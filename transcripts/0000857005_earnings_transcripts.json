Thank you for standing by, and welcome to PTC's 2025 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, operator, and welcome to PTC's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Conference Call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer; Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Dahdah, Chief Revenue Officer.\nToday's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.\nThe forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, November 5, 2025, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Neil Barua.\n\nNeil Barua\n\nExecutive VP & President of Service Lifecycle Management\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin by addressing the press release we issued earlier today regarding the definitive agreement we've reached for TPG to acquire our Kepware and ThingWorx businesses. This is exciting news for us. For our Kepware and ThingWorx customers, this move is designed to enhance the value of these products deliver.\nBy partnering with TPG, Kepware and ThingWorx gained additional investment, expertise and operational focus, all for the businesses to continue growing and delivering more for customers.\nFor PTC, this move increases our focus on the area central to our intelligent product life cycle vision. CAD PLM, ALM and SLM and the growing emphasis on SaaS and AI.\nWith our resources and investment concentrated in these areas, we will continue helping our customers address some of their most pressing challenges by enabling them to fully leverage the value of their product data and to transform each stage of life cycle.\nWhen the transaction closes, we will maintain a close relationship with the Kepware and ThingWorx businesses to ensure a smooth transition. Kristian will walk you through more of the transaction details in a few minutes.\nTurning to fiscal '25. Q4 was another quarter of solid execution. We delivered 8.5% constant currency ARR growth and 16% free cash flow growth year-over-year. Throughout the quarter, we were encouraged to see some of the early benefits from our go-to-market transformation show up operationally.\nOur execution on large strategic agreements improved through better coordination between our sales, technical and customer success teams. We said on our Q3 call that we had a robust pipeline of large Q4 deals, and I'm proud to say we closed most of them.\nThe dynamics of these deals are encouraging in the context of our intelligent product life cycle vision and focus areas. We won our largest Codebeamer deal ever as a customer in the automotive vertical decided to move up legacy processes and invest in its next-gen product data foundation.\nA large windshield competitive displacement win in the med tech vertical was alongside of ServiceMax expansion, reinforcing this customer's commitment to building a product data foundation and extending that data to other parts of the life cycle. We also won the largest Onshape delever. This was a competitive displacement with the customer embracing the workflow and collaboration benefits of a cloud-native SaaS offering. You could read more about our customer wins across verticals in our appendix slides.\nARR came in at the middle of our Q4 guidance range, which reflects the variability of the large deal structures we discussed in our Q3 call. Importantly, we ended the year with record deferred ARR under contract, providing strong visibility into fiscal 2016 and beyond. While not all of that converts immediately, it gives us confidence in our growth trajectory as these multiyear ramps activate.\nIn addition, our go-to-market teams are operating with great alignment across verticals and geos. We continue to execute on commercial optimization levels and the overall feedback from the field is very positive.\nOur marketing messaging. Focus on our intelligent product life cycle vision is helping customers clearly see how our portfolio enables them to leverage their product data to transform with AI.\nFinally, we appointed John Stephenson, an industry veteran, as Chief Product Officer. John is establishing a clear product operating rhythm to support our go-to-market motion and tightening product and R&D linkage to increase the pace and predictability of road map execution.\nOverall, Q4 capped off a year of steady, disciplined execution during a volatile market environment. The go-to-market momentum we described last quarter didn't take, it accelerated. Our teams leaned into the transformation and strengthened customer relationships at the exact and we saw clear evidence of multiproduct adoption across verticals.\nWhen we started the go-to-market transformation, we said it would take 18 to 24 months to hit full stride. Less than a year in, the factors we control are clearly moving in the right direction, and we are focused on making them more repeatable and sustainable in fiscal '20.\nRegarding the outlook for fiscal '26. For ARR growth, we are guiding to a range of 7% to 9% with Kepware, ThingWorx; at 7.5% to 9.5% without Kepware and ThingWorx. We are also well on track to deliver $1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal '26, including Kepware and ThingWorx.\nRegarding net new ARR, Q1 will be similar to last year. and we expect momentum to build through the year, supported by the shape of our pipeline and deferred ARR. The high end of our annual ARR range accounts for continued improvements in our go-to-market progression, minimal customer disruption from the Kepware and ThingWorx divestiture and a relatively steady macro environment. The low end of our annual ARR range accounts for some worsening in the macro environment and unexpected disruption from the divestiture. Variability in deal structures can also move us higher or lower in the range.\nOur confidence in fiscal '26 is underpinned by our focus on our intelligent product life cycle vision. AI is cementing the importance of structured product data foundations and PTC is uniquely positioned to make these possible. Customers understand that applying AI to siloed or stale data doesn't work and are turning to PTC's portfolio to build their data foundation. This begins in engineering and other departments and functions across the life cycle.\nAI is then applied to this contextual data and even more substantial transformations become possible for our customers. We're enhancing our CAD, PLM, ALM and SLM offerings to make it even easier to build a product data foundation, and we're embedding more AI. We've recently released new AI capabilities in ServiceMax, Servigistics, Onshape and Arena, and we have a strong Creo AI road map underway. We are also on track to release new versions of Windchill, Windchill+ and Codebeamer in the weeks ahead.\nI would like to now turn to our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal '26 with our leverage below 1x, we expect to return excess cash to shareholders. We expect to buy back between $150 million and $250 million worth of shares per quarter during fiscal 2016, starting with $200 million in Q1.\nOur capital allocation strategy remains disciplined and flexible as we will continue to make investments in R&D around our intelligent product life cycle vision and leave the door open for tuck-in acquisitions.\nIn summary, we feel momentum building. We're pleased to share today's news about Kepware and ThingWorx, and we're happy they're set up for success with TPG. And for PTC, we move with clarity and a purposeful direction with the entire company focused on delivering our intelligent product life cycle vision for customers.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kristian.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 6, I'd like to provide some more details on the Kepware and ThingWorx divestiture. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar 2026, and our expected use of net after-tax proceeds will follow our overall capital allocation strategy of returning excess cash to shareholders while leaving room for any potential tuck-in acquisitions.\nWe could receive up to $725 million in total cash consideration if certain thresholds are achieved. We expect either $565 million or $600 million upfront, depending on performance during the period up to close. The $125 million future potential earn-out is based on certain criteria related to a potential future transaction by the buyer.\nAssuming an April 1 close and a $565 million upfront payment, we would expect net upfront proceeds of approximately $365 million after working capital and indebtedness adjustments, divestiture-related fees and taxes related to the transaction.\nTurning to Slide 7. In fiscal '25, ARR attributable to Kepware and ThingWorx was approximately $160 million, and constant currency ARR growth was negative 1%. Including perpetual license and professional services revenue, the revenue contribution of Kepware and ThingWorx was approximately $200 million. We estimate that approximately $70 million of free cash flows was attributable to Kepware and ThingWorx in fiscal '25.\nFor fiscal '26, we're providing constant currency ARR guidance for PTC, including and excluding Kepware and ThingWorx. ARR growth, excluding Kepware and ThingWorx, is expected to be 50 basis points higher. Also, for fiscal '26, we expect the Kepware and ThingWorx transaction will impact our as-reported free cash flow primarily due to onetime transaction-related items.\nTo illustrate, I'll take you through a model on Slide 8. Starting at the top with our $1 billion of free cash flow guidance for fiscal '26, which assumes Kepware and ThingWorx are a part of PTC for the full fiscal year. Assuming the transaction closes on April 1, 2026, we would expect lower net cash inflows related to Kepware and ThingWorx in the second half of fiscal '26. However, we would expect this to be largely offset by a transaction services agreement, which begins upon close. If the transaction closes sooner than expected, there could be a modest impact to free cash flow.\nRelated to the transaction, we expect to incur approximately $160 million of onetime cash outflows. Approximately $35 million of this relates to onetime divestiture-related fees and approximately $125 million relates to onetime cash taxes. We'll have more clarity on those items when the transaction closes, and we'll provide an update at that point. Remember, from an accounting perspective, the proceeds will show up in cash flow from investing, while taxes and divestiture-related costs will show up in operating cash flows.\nAssuming an April 1, 2026, close, this model shows that our as-reported free cash flow would be approximately $840 million in fiscal '26. You will have clear visibility to the onetime cash outflows in our reporting, and we will officially update our guidance post close. But as we think about fiscal '27, we expect to be building off the approximately $1 billion we are guiding to this year and we'll need to factor in up to $50 million of headwinds from the divestiture, which is the run rate of Kepware and ThingWorx cash flows, partially offset by TSA income, which we expect to continue.\nMoving to Slide 9 and a review of the results we just reported. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q4, our constant currency ARR using our fiscal '25 plan FX rates was $2.446 billion, up 8.5% year-over-year.\nAnd while I know that we consistently tell investors to focus on ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income. Given some of the dynamics in the quarter, I do think that it's prudent to talk a little bit about the revenue beat versus the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter and put this in context with our ARR results.\nWe came in at the midpoint of our guidance range for net new ARR in Q4. And as we discussed on our last call, the biggest variable between the high and low ends of the range was going to be deal structures. It certainly played out that way.\nIn Q4, our teams did a great job, and we contracted a record amount of customer commitments. Many of these were in the form of ramp deals, many included commercial optimization levers, and several new and renewing contracts came in with longer-than-anticipated term lines. In fact, our average term line in Q4 increased from approximately 2 years in Q4 of '24 to approximately 3 years in Q4 of '25.\nThe way revenue accounting works for on-prem subscriptions under ASC 606, we record approximately 50% of the total contract value when the deal starts, and we recognize the rest ratably over the term.\nAs was evident from our revenue guidance for Q4, we were expecting a healthy uptick in revenue, reflecting the mix of large multiyear renewals and large contracts in the pipeline. But what actually happened was that we beat the midpoint of our guidance range by $140 million and the high end by $110 million.\nSo going back to ARR. You'll recall that ARR is the best approximation of annual billings related to recurring contracts because it's aligned with the amount that we invoice the customer on an annual basis. And as far as future contractual commitments, well, in the ARR way of thinking, that is recorded as deferred ARR.\nIn the traditional P&L way of thinking, that shows up in RPO. And when we report our RPO in our 10-K, you'll see that it's up more than $550 million, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. But remember, not all of that turns into ARR or revenue in fiscal '26. There's additional deferred ARR in fiscal '27 and beyond as well. This should help explain why our revenue growth in the quarter significantly outpaced our ARR growth.\nAll in all, it was a solid quarter. with a lot of long-term positive impact that you don't see in our current ARR results or near-term outlook. The significant revenue beat is also what drove the significant EPS beat.\nOn the cash flow side of things, we generated $100 million of free cash flow in Q4. For the full fiscal year, our free cash flow was $857 million, up 16%. Note that the free cash flow we generated in fiscal '25 absorbed approximately $20 million of outflows related to our go-to-market realignment. Our 16% free cash flow growth in fiscal '25 illustrates the operating leverage we benefit from as our ARR grows. Another way to illustrate our operating leverage is through our operating efficiency percentage, which expanded by 310 basis points to 45% in fiscal '25 compared to 42% in fiscal '24. You can see this in our illustrative cash flow model on Slide 23.\nNext, turning to Slide 10. Before I take you through our guidance, let me walk you through how we guide and report ARR. For fiscal '25, we provided constant currency ARR guidance and reported constant currency ARR results for all periods using our fiscal '25 planned FX rates, which were as of September 30, 2024. And for comparative purposes, at the same time last year, we also recast historical constant currency ARR amounts at our fiscal '25 planned FX rates.\nFor fiscal '26, we're taking the exact same approach with historical results, recast using our fiscal '26 planned FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2025. For new investors who may not be familiar with our approach, please reach out to me or Matt and we'd be happy to do a deep dive.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 11. Because we don't know exactly when the Kepware and ThingWorx transaction will close, our guidance for fiscal '26 and Q1 '26 includes Kepware and ThingWorx for the full year. The exception is ARR, where we are additionally providing guidance that excludes Kepware and ThingWorx.\nAll the ARR amounts on this slide are based on our fiscal '26 planned FX rates. For constant currency ARR, excluding Kepware and ThingWorx, we expect growth of approximately 7.5% to approximately 9.5% in fiscal '26. For constant currency ARR, including Kepware and ThingWorx, we expect growth of approximately 7% to 9%.\nOur ARR guidance is mindful of the efforts required to separate Kepware and ThingWorx as we push toward a closing expected in the first half of calendar 2026.\nFrom a linearity perspective, we're expecting similar quarterly seasonality as in fiscal '25 for net new ARR. This primarily has to do with the shape of the pipeline, linearity of churn and the linearity of deferred ARR, which is heavily skewed to Q4 in fiscal '26. Note that our cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis. And to be clear, our business is currently constituted is on track to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in fiscal '26.\nWe have a high degree of confidence in our guidance for free cash flow due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined budgeting structure we have in place. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We build primarily upfront annually 1 year at a time, regardless of contract term lengths. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable. In fiscal '26, we expect similar invoicing seasonality compared to the previous 5 years based on this and our expected cash outflows we expect approximately 55% to 60% of our free cash flow to be generated in the first half of the year and for fiscal Q4 to be our lowest cash flow generation quarter.\nSome of you may have noticed that our guidance assumption for CapEx is stepping up by approximately $20 million in fiscal '26, which is also absorbed in our guidance for free cash flow. We view this as onetime in nature because it's related to moving a major R&D center to a new office.\nAlthough our focus is on ARR and free cash flow, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance to help you with your models. It's worth noting that our revenue guidance for fiscal '26 looks different from fiscal '25. We expect revenue to be up north of 10% in the first half, up in the mid-single digits in Q3 and to decline in Q4. This obviously reflects the dynamics I discussed earlier, with Q4 being down given the significant overperformance in Q4 of '25.\nMoving on to Slide 12. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for fiscal '26. Focusing on PTC, including Kepware and ThingWorx, the column on the right illustrates the midpoint of net new ARR growth that corresponds to our fiscal 2016 constant currency ARR guidance range of 7% to 9%. Consistent with my reminder from last quarter, we expect churn to remain low in fiscal '26 because our customers need to maintain subscriptions to our software to continue designing, producing and servicing the products.\nTurning to Slide 13. Here's a similar illustrative model for Q1 of '26 focusing on PTC, including Kepware and ThingWorx, the column on the right illustrates the dollar range of Q1 26% sequential net new ARR growth that corresponds to our Q1 '26 constant currency ARR guidance range of 8% to 8.5%. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our lightest net new ARR quarter given normal renewal seasonality and the timing of larger enterprise transactions.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we expect similar linearity for net new ARR in fiscal '26 compared to fiscal '25. What's important, however, is what Neil mentioned earlier, that our demand capture remains healthy in a challenging macro environment, and we're entering the year with a stronger pipeline than when we started fiscal '25 and a solid deferred ARR balance which is heavily skewed to Q4.\nAs you know, our net new ARR can be somewhat volatile in any given quarter, given dynamics such as new or renewal bookings seasonality, timing of deferred ARR, starting how much of our new bookings in any given quarter starts in the quarter, how much churn we expect in any quarter, et cetera?\nAll of that said, we feel good about the state of the business, the focus on the intelligent product life cycle and its relevance to our customers as evidenced by our pipeline. We have many initiatives underway to capture the opportunity to drive net new ARR growth in the future.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for the Q&A session."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to PTC's 2025 Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Eric, and welcome to PTC's 2025 Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer; Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Dahdah, Chief Revenue Officer.\nToday's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results.

I'm proud of what PTC is accomplishing in fiscal year '25, and I'm more confident than ever in the important position we hold in the market. Our vision for our customers' digital transformations is resonating. They rely on PTC software to build structured product data foundations in their engineering teams and to extend the value of that data across their enterprises. This helps us accelerate time to market, produce higher-quality products and manage complexity across their businesses. And these product data foundations are the fundamental backbone of AI-driven transformation for our customers and become a driver for organizing and structuring data using PTC solutions. .\nIn Q3, we executed well, 9.3% constant currency ARR growth and 14% free cash flow growth year-over-year. We also continued deleveraging our balance sheet and repurchasing shares. With our continued visibility to solid cash generation, we expect to remain active under our $2 billion share repurchase authorization. These results reflect continued resilience in a dynamic macro environment and also indicate the early progress of our go-to-market transformation and deepening strategic engagement with customers.\nIn Q3, policy and trade uncertainty led some customers to slow or face deals. By quarter end, we began to see signs of stabilization as customers adapted to the environment. While it is too early to call a trend, our sense is that we are past the point of maximum disruption. Input costs and tariff discussions remain important watch items and dynamics differ across verticals and geographies, but demand has remained resilient. To us, this underscores that our solutions continue to be mission-critical for customers even in periods of macro uncertainty.\nOur Q3 results also reflect steady progress with our go-to-market transformation. The team is continuing to build a more consistent operating rhythm, and we're seeing encouraging signs. Pipeline creation remained healthy. Win rates with tenured reps improved modestly and new reps are making progress in their ramp. We're also seeing stronger collaboration across sales, marketing and customer success and deeper, more strategic engagement with senior decision-makers. While we're still early in this transformation compared to a year ago, we're structurally stronger and better positioned to support our customers. This remains a long-term effort and will continue to refine and adapt, but the early progress we've seen gives us confidence in the direction we're headed.\nWe advanced our product data foundation strategy in Q3 with portfolio enhancements and customer wins across our 5 focus areas of CAD, PLM, ALM, SLM and SaaS. And we continued our progress with AI. In CAD, we released the most sophisticated version of Creo yet with Creo 12. This release included enhancements in several important areas, including AI-driven generative design. In PLM, we released Arena Supply Chain Intelligence, which brings AI-driven supply chain risk monitoring directly into the PLM environment.\nOur customer wins included a new Windchill+ deal with a well-known med tech brand in a competitive process, a new Codebeamer deal with a major automotive supplier. The adoption of Windchill+ with a long-time aerospace and defense customer and finally, a ServiceMax expansion with a med tech customer that is also standardized on Windchill as its enterprise PLM system. You can read more about our customer wins in the appendix lines.\nOur product data foundation strategy is also core to what we're doing with AI. Product data foundations are the backbone of AI-driven transformation. We have the solutions to deliver these product data foundations in PLM, CAD, ALM and SLM, and we have a deep understanding of how our customers apply this data across their enterprises. This combination is central to our vision and will keep PTC in the driver's seat to transform our customers' businesses with product data and AI.\nFiscal year '25 has been a milestone year for our AI strategy with releases and meaningful progress from ServiceMax, Windchill, Codebeamer, Onshape, Arena and many of our other products. Feedback from customers has been very positive and validates the direction we're moving in. We'll release more AI capabilities in several products in Q4, followed by a strong AI road map for fiscal year '26.\nMore broadly, our relation with NVIDIA highlighted in this morning's press release, reflects what's possible when product data intelligence meets cutting-edge innovation. NVIDIA has long used Creo and Windchill. But what's even more exciting is the growing convergence between PTC solutions and the expanding category of physical AI. As AI begins to shape the physical world, not just the digital, product data becomes a connective tissue. That's the role we're playing, and it's the one we expect to deepen with NVIDIA and others. While still early, it will be an area to watch and if it's directly with our vision of product data foundations and AI-driven transformation.\nOverall, Q3 was another solid quarter. As we execute in Q4, my confidence is driven by a few things. We have a strong Q4 pipeline with several meaningful opportunities across our verticals and core products, supported by the progress of our go-to-market transformation. Our vision of product data foundations, enabling AI-driven transformation is resonating well with customers and is aligned with durable secular trends rooted in their needs. These include the shift to software-defined products, regulatory-driven traceability and the move to SaaS.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Kristian.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 6. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis.\nAt the end of Q3, our constant currency ARR using our fiscal '25 plan FX rates was $2.372 billion, up 9.3% year-over-year. In Q3, our free cash flow was $242 million, up 14% year-over-year, while we continued to invest in our key focus areas. Note that the free cash flow we generated in Q3 absorbed approximately $3 million of outflows related to our go-to-market realignment.\nTurning to Slide 7. Let's look at our constant currency ARR growth in more detail. Looking at our product groups, our constant currency year-over-year ARR growth was 8% in CAD, driven primarily by Creo and 10% in PLM, driven primarily by Windchill, Codebeamer and IoT. On a year-over-year basis, constant currency ARR grew by 8% in the Americas, 11% in Europe and 11% in Asia Pacific.\nMoving to Slide 8. We ended Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $199 million. At the end of Q3, total debt was $1.236 billion, and we were 1.2x levered. In Q3, we continued the disciplined and consistent execution of our $2 billion share repurchase program and used $75 million of cash to repurchase 444,000 shares of our common stock. We also continue to diligently pay down our debt in Q3 with our total debt balance decreasing by $156 million. In line with what we've said coming into the year, we intend to buy back approximately $300 million of our common stock in fiscal '25 with approximately $75 million of repurchases expected in Q4.\nOur fully diluted share count in fiscal '24 was 121 million, and we currently expect fully diluted shares to be approximately flat in fiscal '25.\nLooking forward, our capital allocation strategy is governed by a couple of key principles. First, we believe PTC should operate in a net debt position. And second, given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow generation, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. As such, we expect to return excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 9. All of the ARR amounts on this slide are based on our fiscal '25 planned FX rates as of September 30, 2024. We've updated our guidance ranges for ARR, cash flow, revenue and EPS to reflect our year-to-date results and our outlook for Q4. I'll get into more detail on our constant currency ARR guidance on the next 2 slides.\nOn free cash flow, we've raised the low end of our previous guidance range, and we're now guiding to approximately $850 million for fiscal '25. This guidance absorbs roughly $20 million of cash outflows for severance and consulting fees related to our go-to-market realignment and these are cash outflows that we don't expect to incur next year. For Q4, we're guiding to free cash flow of $90 million to $95 million. At this point, we have good visibility to the free cash flow guidance we've provided for fiscal '25. First of all, during the first 3 quarters of the year, we've generated almost 90% of our full year guidance; second, focusing on cash inflows and as of the end of July, we've already built most of what we expect to collect for the remainder of 25. And third, on the cash outflow side of the equation, which is also important, we know what cash outflows we have planned for the last 2 months of the year.\nIt's worth pointing out that our free cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis. So it's important to be mindful of FX volatility. Approximately 45% of our ARR is transacted in foreign currencies and approximately 35% of our non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. So we have somewhat of a natural hedge. That said, significant FX moves can have an impact.\nGiven where rates are today, it's worth pointing out that FX is still expected to be a headwind for the full year, but should be a modest tailwind for the second half. All of this has been contemplated in our execution and guidance throughout the year. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront 1 year at a time, regardless of contract term lengths. Over the medium term, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow faster than our ARR with our non-GAAP operating expenses expected to grow at roughly half the rate of ARR. A basic tenet of our subscription business model and budgeting process is that there is natural operating leverage that we benefit from as our ARR grows.\nTo help you with your models, we also provide revenue and EPS guidance. However, I'd like to reiterate my favorite reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC, since we primarily sell on-premise subscriptions and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 fiscal '22 earnings call that you may want to refer to if you're new to PTC. You can find the presentation on the Investors section of our website.\nThe summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nTurning to Slide 10. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model that shows our guidance for Q4 in context. You can see our sequential net new ARR over the past 11 quarters. The column to the right illustrates the dollar range of Q4 sequential net ARR growth that corresponds to our updated Q4 constant currency ARR guidance range of 8% to 9%. As we've discussed on previous calls, fiscal '25 is back-end loaded due to the size and shape of our pipeline, which is influenced by the size and shape of our expiring base. The majority of our net new ARR comes from upsells, expansions and cross-sells, so our expiring base dynamics can be important.\nRaising the low end of the full year guidance to 8% from the 7% growth we talked about last quarter, essentially takes the COVID or GFC-like scenario off the table. The 8% to 9% range for Q4 allows for some ongoing variability given the macro environment, which Neil commented on earlier. For example, deals could be downsized [indiscernible] as well. But we feel good about the size of the pipeline build in Q4.\nMoving to add similar illustrative model for fiscal '25 as over the past year. And then the column on the right at rate hole range of full year net ARR growth that is matched to our updated fiscal '25 constant currency ARR guidance range of 8% to 9%. Note that compared to other years shown on this slide, fiscal '24 benefited by approximately $10 million due to incremental deferred ARR in that year.\nFinally, and consistent with my reminder from last quarter, we expect churn to remain low in fiscal '25. Since transitioning to a subscription business model, our business has proved to be resilient because our customers need to maintain licenses to our software to continue designing and producing their products. And while we sell to engineering, manufacturing and services departments, most of our business is focused on engineering, where spending by our customers tends to be more protected.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for the Q&A session."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to PTC's 2025 First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Sarah, and welcome to PTC's 2025 First Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. .\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.\nThe forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, February 5, 2025, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Neil Barua.\n\nNeil Barua\n\nExecutive VP & President of Service Lifecycle Management\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. PTC started fiscal 2025 as anticipated with our first quarter results coming in slightly better than the guidance we provided which contemplated a difficult macro and our go-to-market changes. The consistency of our ARR and free cash flow underscores the strength of our diversified business model and our disciplined focus on execution. .\nWhile we continue to see a sluggish selling environment in Q1, I am pleased with the intensity we have internally to ensure we exit fiscal 2025 with increased momentum. This includes the focus we have on our go-to-market transformation as well as many important purposeful product releases, augmented by the work we are doing in AI. I'll share more on these key business initiatives during my comments today.\nFor fiscal '25, we've reiterated our ARR and free cash flow guidance ranges, and we think the guidance we provided for Q2 and the full year is appropriate. Christian will take you through the details.\nTurning to Slide 4. First off, I'd like to provide an update on the changes we announced last quarter to our go-to-market organization. We've made significant progress, reshaping our approach to be vertically oriented and the changes are energizing our team and customers. These efforts are designed to align us with our long-term growth opportunities and ensure we remain well positioned to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.\nAs part of this transformation, we welcomed Rob Dahdah as our Chief Revenue Officer in December. Rob's reputation for excellence in enterprise software is already evident. His impact on the sales team and his focus on performance standards are in early stages and showing promise. Rob is also instilling greater alignment across our sales, customer success and marketing teams, setting the stage for sustained growth over time.\nIn addition to Rob, we've added key leadership roles in growth marketing, technical enablement, sales enablement and customer success. These hires bring fresh perspectives and high standards and their mandate is to raise the bar across our organization. Our vertical approach and organizational changes will take time to bear fruit, and we expect to be hitting our stride as we exit the year.\nTo be clear, these efforts are critical to delivering sustainable, low double-digit ARR growth. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing so far. There is a step change in focus and speed, and we will not take our foot off the pedal. Let's move now to Slide 5, which highlights our product portfolio and strategy. Our customers need to introduce new products at a faster pace and with higher quality even as product complexity increases. That's not possible without digital transformation across their workflows, which is what our products enable.\nWe're focusing our resources and attention on the 5 core areas of our portfolio that we believe can create the greatest customer value. As a reminder, these 5 focus areas are PLM, which is driven primarily by our Windchill product, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; SLM, which is primarily driven by our ServiceMax product; CAD, which is driven primarily by our Creo products; and lastly, our continued focus on SaaS.\nToday, I'd like to highlight some exciting new advancements across these focus areas. Starting with PLM with Windchill Navigate view work instructions, we're extending 3D digital work instructions from PLM to shop floor employees, enabling our customers to get more value from their product data. In ALM, we're excited about the upcoming release of Codebeamer 3.0, which will further extend the scalability and capabilities of our market-leading ALM solution. In SLM, just this past quarter, we achieved FedRAMP certification for ServiceMax, a critical milestone that opens new opportunities in our FA&D vertical. In CAd, Creo 12 leapfrogs the competition in composite structure design and adds thermal physics to our AI-driven generative design engine. Both of these are embedded modules within Creo and open up new use cases for highly innovative designs.\nAnd also in SaaS, Onshape, the industry's only cloud-native SaaS platform for CAD and PDM also continues to advance, delivering significant new releases at a remarkable place, 17 over the past year, including cloud-native CAM and advanced servicing tools. We are also further differentiating our core offerings with AI, and we're encouraged by the opportunity this presents. So let's get into this area. We believe the industries we serve over time will be fundamentally transformed by AI, and PTC is in a great position to be a leader on this front.\nThe promise of AI is based on access to data and putting it to use. PTC solutions are used to create, manage and share the product data that is at the heart of our customers' businesses. This could be design data in Creo, requirements data in Codebeamer and bills of material data in Windchill or service history data in ServiceMax. We are advantaged in that we have decades of experience with how our customers use this data in their everyday operations and the impact that it has on workflows, speed of development, product quality and employee productivity.\nOur understanding of how this data store, access and use in our products has been our blueprint for applying AI. It's our secret sauce throughout 2024. I said PTC is taking a practical and value-based approach to AI for our customers. We've been hard at work on this front and have identified the most prominent applications and use cases for AI across our portfolio in concert with customer feedback. Our offerings operate in [ system wide ] capacities allowing customers to interrogate the data in their systems to confirm information, accelerate workflows and automate tasks such as proactively notifying engineers of a design or requirements change.\nThese AI offerings will also have specialized AI agents embedded in them. These agents will map to specific domain workflows and data sources within engineering, manufacturing and service and they'll intelligently interact behind the scenes, connecting information across their specialty domains to serve out the best information or complete a task. I'm pleased to share that the first of these offerings will launch next week with ServiceMax.\nThe ServiceMax AI offering includes several agents that assist with scheduling, service delivery and workforce enablement. This offering was in beta mode for much of 2024 with top ServiceMax customers, and now it's ready for everyone. These AI agents have access to all the data stored in a ServiceMax instance and technicians can interact with them through natural language. Using the latest GenAI technology, the agents can answer questions about a specific job or asset, automate manual documentation and scheduling tasks and review proactive recommendations for predictive maintenance.\nThe main goal here is greater efficiency for technicians, doing more in less time. As part of this launch, we're introducing a new ServiceMax AI SKU, which will be the entry point for AI-powered features. This will be a per user per month subscription charge, which is what ServiceMax customers are used to. Our ServiceMax road map for fiscal '25 includes other AI-powered features and capabilities based on large language models that can be accessed by the same ServiceMax AI SKU.\nWe believe that more ways of accessing AI-powered features will lead to more adoption and happier customers. This will allow us to learn faster and continue to improve the offerings and pricing models. In addition, we have been testing a beta version of generative AI features in CodeBeamer with Volkswagen Group and Microsoft, which we demonstrated at Microsoft's Ignite event in November to much fanfare. Based on customer feedback, I'm excited around the real potential for AI here because of Codebeamer importance to software-defined product strategies for so many of our customers. These customers store their hardware and software requirements data in Codebeamer, critical for the overall product development process and for meeting regulatory and safety requirements.\nThese new AI features will help engineering teams improve the quality of the requirements remove duplicate requirements and compare new requirements against existing quality standards. We're also hard at work on incremental AI functionality within Windchill, Creo, Onshape, Arena, Servigistics and other products, and you can expect previews at upcoming events such as HMI and the Paris Air Show. Ultimately, but the value they'll provide the goal of our AI offerings is to draw new customers, encourage upgrades with existing customers and become even more critical to day-to-day workflows.\nTurning now to some customer examples from Q1 that highlight our core offerings. Moving to Slide 6. We've previously talked about our opportunity to cross-sell Codebeamer ALM to our base of Windchill customers as products of all types become increasingly software driven. The 2 products, Windchill and Codebeamer in a customer environment. Working together is highly differentiated in our space, an area we are investing in. Today's first customer story highlights this theme. This medtech customer has been leveraging Windchill to help drive their business since 2017, deploying it broadly beyond core engineering as a platform to enable enterprise-wide collaboration to accelerate time to market.\nSoftware-defined products are a focus area for this customer as software has become a key driver of their product differentiation. In fact, their main products are software upgradable and they are able to charge their customers for software upgrades that add value to existing products. At the same time, the opportunity for software-driven product growth comes with new challenges associated with managing the rapid expansion in the number of unique software configurations that need to be developed and update or over time.\nThis customer needs help managing all of these software variants and releases and that is why they are now focused on modernizing their current fragmented ALM system and expanding their use of ALM. They decided to standardize on Codebeamer, displacing 2 legacy ALM vendors. Cross-selling was a key part of this deal. This customer is a happy user of Windchill and Codebeamer's future road map aligns with their future plans. Furthermore, the med tech vertical is similar to verticals, including automotive and federal, aerospace and defense in that there is an additional catalyst driving the adoption of Codebeamer, regulatory and safety compliance.\nWith the rapid increase of software that is embedded in hardware components, companies are looking for tools to help ensure and automate their regulatory compliance processes. Traceability is required for safety-critical, highly regulated industries and Codebeamer is the most modern ALM product that enables us in an agile development environment. Beyond this specific customer example, 27 of the top 30 public medical device manufacturers use PTC in some fashion, and we believe we are well positioned to expand our footprint and grow our Codebeamer business in this vertical.\nALM represents a really interesting growth opportunity across multiple verticals in alignment with our PLM focus. As such, we have been increasing our investments in Codebeamer, working alongside Creo and Windchill to accelerate our leadership. Turning to our next customer story on Slide 7. This customer is in the federal, aerospace and defense vertical and is a good example of a well-established company that continues to invest in digital transformation to drive market leadership in a competitive high-growth environment. This customer is seeing strong growth in demand and needs to increase production.\nIn addition, their customers are asking for state-of-the-art products that are at the boundary of what is physically possible. We're talking about designs where a small amount of wind resistance makes a very big difference. To tackle these challenges, this customer needs best-in-class tools and that's why they chose Creo for design engineering and Windchill as their enterprise backbone for their product data.\nDesign Excellence is in focus for this customer because this is an R&D-centric enterprise and it depends on improvements in design engineering to stay competitive. To further add to their capabilities, they will continue to invest in advanced Creo modules, including Creo Simulation Live, composites and generative design. These modules will help this customer produce lighter weight products with higher quality at a faster pace using less materials. This customer is also continuing to expand its Windchill system as an enterprise platform to drive collaboration around real-time trusted product data. They have provided Windchill product data access to operational functions, including supply chain, quality, sales and service, usage has gone viral, driving productivity gains.\nThese outcomes are leading to a large follow-on order for more seats as well as further expansion to employees on the factory floor. Currently, approximately 70% of this customer's employee base benefits from having access to product data in Windchill, and this customer's Creo and Windchill ARR has grown significantly with more room to run.\nIn closing, I remain immensely optimistic about where PTC is heading. Our focused strategic initiatives are gaining traction, and we are driving purposeful innovations that are resonating with customers.\nCombine that with transformative go-to-market changes and to focus on accountability in everything we do, and you can understand why we are energized. Thank you for your support and interest in PTC. Kristian, over to you.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 9. Our ARR and free cash flow results in Q1 were in line with our guidance. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow were the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q1 '25, our constant currency ARR using our fiscal '25 planned FX rates was $2.277 billion, up 11% year-over-year.\nIn Q1, we saw a continuation of the challenging selling environment we've been experiencing for a couple of years now, and this continues to impact close rates. Also consistent with our expectations from a quarter ago, our constant currency ARR growth in Q1 was impacted by 2 factors, which we called out on our previous earnings call.\nThe first factor was the linearity of deferred ARR in fiscal '25. And the second factor was a couple of contracts that resulted in churn in Q1, which are contracted to come back into ARR later this fiscal year.\nMoving on to cash flow. In Q1, our free cash flow was up 29% year-over-year as we continue to invest in our key focus areas at the same time. Note that the $236 million of free cash flow we generated in Q1 absorbed $11 million of outflows related to our go-to-market realignment, which is in line with our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 10. Let's look at our constant currency ARR growth in more detail. Looking at our product groups, our constant currency ARR year-over-year growth was 9% in CAD, driven primarily by Creo and 11% in PLM, primarily driven by Windchill, Codebeamer, IoT and ServiceMax. On a year-over-year basis, constant currency ARR grew by 9% in the Americas and 12% in both Europe and Asia Pacific.\nOur ARR growth is based on our unique product portfolio, which aligns with the digital transformation needs of our customers. Despite the overall selling environment, our top line has shown good resilience, supported by our subscription model, low churn rate and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their R&D investments through challenging times.\nTurning to Slide 11. We ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $196 million. At the end of Q1, gross debt was $1.548 billion, and we were 1.7x levered. We continue to diligently pay down our debt, and we started to buy back shares under our $2 billion share repurchase program. During Q1, we paid down our debt by $205 million and used $75 million of cash to repurchase 383,000 shares of our common stock.\nAs you all know, we have $500 million bond that's coming due in February, which we intend to retire upon expiration with cash on hand and by drawing on our revolving credit facility. Given the consistency and predictability of the business, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. As such, assuming we have excess cash, we expect to return it to shareholders. The authorization we now have in place gives us a lot of flexibility in how we do that.\nIn line with what we've said previously, we currently intend to buy back approximately $300 million of our common stock in fiscal '25, with another approximately $75 million of repurchases expected in Q2. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities. Finally, our fully diluted share count in fiscal '24 was $121 million, and we currently expect fully diluted shares to be approximately flat in fiscal '25.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 12. All of the ARR amounts on this slide are based on our fiscal '25 plan rates as of September 30, 2024. For constant currency ARR, given our differentiated product portfolio, the resilience of our subscription business model, the actions we've taken over time to align our investments with market opportunities and allowing that our go-to-market changes are expected to take time to have their intended effect, we expect growth of approximately 9% to 10% for fiscal '25 and approximately 9.5% for Q2 of fiscal '25.\nI'll get into more detail on constant currency ARR on the next 2 slides. On cash flow, we're guiding to free cash flow of $835 million to $850 million in fiscal '25, which absorbs the approximately $20 million of cash outflows for severance and consulting fees related to our go-to-market realignment we've discussed previously. We're not calling out a restructuring charge, so all of this will flow through the sales and marketing and cost of revenue lines on our P&L.\nAs we've said previously, this is not a cost-cutting exercise. We're reinvesting in our go-to-market organization with a focus on the areas we believe deliver the greatest value to our customers. In fiscal '25, we expect largely similar invoicing seasonality compared to the previous 4 years based on this and our expected cash outflows. We expect approximately 60% of our free cash flow to be generated in the first half of the year and for fiscal Q4 to be our lowest cash flow generation quarter.\nFor Q2 of fiscal '25, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $270 million, which absorbs approximately $4 million of the $20 million of total outflows related to our go-to-market realignment. Note that our cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis. So FX fluctuations can have an impact in either direction. Approximately 45% of our ARR is transacted in foreign currencies and approximately 35% of our non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. So we have somewhat of a natural hedge.\nThat said, significant FX moves can have an impact, and we're seeing some of that pressure this year. We'll see how FX rates move as we progress through the year. But at this point, we still feel comfortable with our cash flow guidance for Q2 and for fiscal '25. While changes in FX, interest rates and tax regulations can be difficult to predict, we have a high degree of confidence in our free cash flow forecasting process due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined budgeting structure we have in place.\nImportantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront 1 year at a time, regardless of contract term lengths. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable. Furthermore, over the past 5 years, we've optimized our internal budgeting process. It starts with having a subscription business model that generates predictable cash inflows. Then we begin each fiscal year by funding our business for growth at the low end of our internal ARR forecast.\nAs the year progresses, we maintain or increase that level of funding based on the growth dynamics we're seeing. By proceeding in this manner, we're able to match our investments to the market environment in an agile way, while also delivering predictable free cash flow. That said, we would not do anything that impacts the long-term prospects of the business because of short-term FX movements. Over the medium term, we continue to expect our free cash flow to grow faster than our ARR with non-GAAP operating expenses expected to grow at roughly half the rate of ARR.\nA basic tenet of our subscription business model and budgeting process is that there's natural operating leverage that we benefit from as our ARR grows. To help you with your models, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance. However, I'd like to reiterate my favorite reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we primarily sell on-premise subscription and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business.\nI did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 fiscal '22 call that you may want to refer to if you're new to PTC. You can find the presentation on the Investors section of our website. The summary is, we believe ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nNext, on Slide 13. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q2. This slide shows our sequential net new ARR over the past couple of years. And the column on the far right illustrates that we need $44 million of sequential net new ARR growth to hit 9.5% growth for Q2. Obviously, it's impossible to predict any given quarter with that level of precision, and we're being mindful of the macro environment and the go-to-market changes we're making.\nAs you know, based on our results over the past few years, our net new ARR can be somewhat volatile in any given quarter, given dynamics such as the timing of new bookings, the timing of renewals, the timing of deferred ARR starting how much of our new bookings in any given quarter starts in the quarter, how much churn we expect in any given quarter, et cetera.\nIt's not unusual to see quarterly volatility in our sequential net new ARR results. Importantly, we expect churn to remain low throughout fiscal '25. Also, as we make incremental investment decisions over the course of a fiscal year, we continue to focus on our internal forecast for the full year net new ARR growth.\nMoving to Slide 14. Here is a similar illustrative model for fiscal '25. You can see our results over the past 3 years, and the column on the right illustrates that we need $214 million of net new ARR this year to hit the midpoint of our fiscal '25 constant currency ARR guidance range. This range, along with our Q1 results and Q2 guidance, obviously, indicates a back-half loaded year, which is supported by our pipeline and our internal forecast.\nOur pipeline continues to grow, and we have a significant stable of large opportunities in our Q3 and Q4. At the midpoint of our range, we would be adding approximately $20 million less net new ARR in fiscal '25 compared to 2024 and approximately $5 million less than in fiscal '23 and '22, Note that fiscal '24 benefited approximately $10 million due to incremental deferred ARR in that year.\nAdjusting for that, our fiscal '25 guidance midpoint indicates approximately flattish net new ARR growth compared to fiscal '24, '23 and '22. I think this point highlights exactly why we're evolving our go-to-market organization this year. We're hard at work with this evolution, augmented with new product releases such as the ones that Neil outlined earlier, to ensure that we exit this year with momentum to drive net new ARR growth into fiscal '26 and beyond.\nIn the meantime, our business model is resilient, and we continue to believe the right guidance range for fiscal '25 constant currency ARR growth is 9% to 10%. In conclusion, PTC has a strong product portfolio and strategy, a track record of operational discipline and clear value creation opportunities. We're focused on what matters most for our customers, and we are aligning our operations so that we can scale our business in a consistent plan.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for today's Q&A session."

Please go ahead.\n[Audio Gap] conference call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Adam, and welcome to PTC's Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.\nThe forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, July 31, 2024, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Neil Barua.\n\nNeil Barua\n\nExecutive VP & President of Service Lifecycle Management\n\nThanks, Matt. In Q3, we again delivered solid constant currency ARR growth, up 12% year-over-year, demonstrating that our portfolio of products is resonating with customers. Our Q3 free cash flow growth was also solid, rising 29% year-over-year. Christian will take you through our quarterly results and forward-looking guidance in detail. Before we get into more detail, I want to recognize Mike DiTullio, who will transition out of the President and Chief Operating Officer roles at the end of the fiscal year and continue as an adviser to me into 2025. .\nMike's part in PTC's success has been profound over his tenure of more than 25 years. We certainly wouldn't be the company we are today without him. In addition, he's been a great partner to me as I've stepped into the CEO role. We've been discussing its future plans, and we both agree that it's the right time to start this transition process. When we start fiscal '25 will no longer have the COO position within our leadership structure. At this stage of my CEO tenure, my approach is to be close to the business and be more directly involved with operations and execution, especially for our key priorities.\nAccordingly, I will be assuming many of Mike's responsibilities. Additionally, I'd like to reiterate what I said on last quarter's call, which is that I'm turning over lots of stones and looking at everything in this company in order to usher in a new phase of focus and effectiveness across the entire company. To that end, while Mike's change was externally visible because we filed an 8-K, there are numerous other changes that we have already made and are making across many different areas of the organization. This is an ongoing process that we're doing with the intent of driving more effectiveness in the pursuit of our incredible growth potential.\nLet's move now to Slide 4, which highlights our product portfolio and strategy. As a reminder, our 5 focus areas are: one, PLM, which is driven primarily by our Windchill product; two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; three, SLM, which is primarily driven by ServiceMax; four, CAD, which is driven primarily by Creo; and five, our continued focus on SaaS. These are the areas where we can create the greatest customer value and are the areas where we are focusing our resources and attention. At the most basic level, our customers need to introduce new products at a faster pace and with higher quality.\nIt is not unusual to hear from customers that they need to shorten their new product introduction time lines in half. That's not possible without digital transformation across their workflows, which is exactly what our products enable. It's also worth highlighting that we are bringing our suite of software offerings together to help product companies improve their competitiveness. Given the unique breadth and openness of our portfolio, we can enable end-to-end digital thread initiatives, which leverage a connected flow of product data across design, manufacturing, service and ultimately, reuse. A digital thread enables product companies to break down silos, streamline workflows and achieve interoperability across departments, functions and systems with a single version of truth.\nIt also secures the quality, consistency and traceability of product-related data, ensuring that the data is up-to-date, accessible, reliable and actionable. With the digital thread, the right data is delivered to the right people at the right time and in the right context across the value chain. The demand drivers for our core offerings are strong, and our differentiated capabilities to drive digital thread initiatives are increasingly important to our customers. There is so much we can do to help our customers drive better business outcomes. To unlock this potential, I have started to focus on our operations, taking a fresh look at ways to continue driving improvements.\nOn last quarter's call, we discussed rebalancing some R&D resources away from creating new standalone IoT and augmented reality applications to instead support growth of our core products. That was just the first step. Putting in place an organizational design that enables us to scale more programmatically will set us up for continued success in the future. We are now primarily turning our attention to optimizing our go-to-market and G&A activities.\nAs I mentioned upfront, we've leaned out the go-to-market management structure, so there are less layers between me and our customers. At this point, we are moving forward without the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Revenue Officer roles, and I will be working directly with our Head of Sales and Head of Customer Success. We are actively looking at every facet of our business to continue driving alignment and effectiveness across our entire company. It is about focus on customer value and getting more effective with each dollar we spend to support them and capture that demand.\nThe opportunities to achieve this are significant here at PTC. We are in the early innings of doing this work, and we expect the heavy lifting to continue in fiscal '25. I'd like to turn now to discuss 3 of our focus areas to illustrate the significant value we bring to customers. This quarter, I'll touch on what we have been seeing with customers of our Windchill PLM, Codebeamer ALM and ServiceMax SLM products.\nStarting with PLM on Slide 5. This is product lifecycle management, and Windchill is our flagship PLM product. PLM systems tend to be really sticky and are mission-critical for our customers. This is software that historically had the function of helping CAD engineers keep track of their CAD files. Now PLM is at the epicenter of digital transformation initiatives and product companies.\nAs I explained last quarter, product companies are increasingly focused on compressing the time it takes to get new products to market. And at the same time, their products continue to get much more complex, both to design and produce. The complexity becomes untenable, quality and time to market gets impacted. Sooner or later, it becomes very clear that having an advanced PLM system is a strategic necessity.\nIn general, manufacturing companies have a long way to go in terms of their digital transformation journeys. And when a product company gets really serious about optimizing and automating their design and manufacturing processes we tend to see large PLM expansion projects and step function increases in ARR as customers expand their Windchill deployments in terms of both seats and functionality. A good example of this is our Q3 win as a supplier to the automotive industry that specializes in cabling and wiring harness solutions.\nGiven the rise of software-defined vehicles and the importance of electronic wiring systems, the role of this company in the automotive supply chain has grown. It's interesting that this company already appreciate the value of leveraging their PLM system beyond engineering to drive better business outcomes. They are using Windchill within R&D, but they're currently using homegrown tools to drive collaboration across their engineering, supply chain, manufacturing and quality assurance teams. Over time, maintaining their homegrown system became unsustainable from both the complexity and cost standpoint.\nThey found it compelling that extending Windchill beyond engineering is easy to implement and provides quick time to value, and they decide to standardize on their Windchill system as their backbone for enterprise-wide collaboration around their product data. Turning to Slide 6. The second customer example for today is a medical equipment customer that has been using our Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products for years now.\nWhat's interesting is that this customer wants to unlock value by going with the digital thread approach I highlighted a few minutes ago. Our Codebeamer ALM product helped to complete their digital thread vision. After being a Codebeamer customer for about a year testing out the product, they decided they were all in and ready to move forward with their digital thread initiative.\nAnd in Q3, they signed a deal with us that will expand their ARR by 190%. As a reminder, ALM or application life cycle management helps engineers keep track of product requirements and test to ensure that all requirements are met. This traceability is very important in safety critical and regulated industries, including the automotive and medical equipment markets and has been growing in importance across other industries because of the trend towards software-driven products of all types.\nProducts now contain more embedded software than ever. And for many products, there's been an explosion in the number of unique software configurations that need to be developed and updated over time. Codebeamer is a next-gen platform that enables industrial companies to manage this increasing level of complexity. Codebeamer's differentiated from legacy ALM offerings in 2 key ways: First, Codebeamer has industry-leading traceability capabilities; and second, Codebeamer also helps with time to market by supporting agile development processes. Consider, for example, what happens when a company has a product in the field that fails. Regulators immediately want to understand which version of the software that product had and might even demand that more stringent new requirements be placed on new products the company makes. Codebeamer is becoming the solution of choice to deal with this new reality.\nCodebeamer is a big part of completing the digital thread vision for this customer because software plays such a critical role in their new product innovations. Before having Codebeamer, they faced challenges managing their high volume of software requirements, which led to unnecessary delays in getting new products to market as well as exposure to risk. As a medical equipment company, software innovation and regulatory traceability are front and center for this customer, and the value Codebeamer brought to them gave them the confidence to rely on PTC in a more holistic way.\nThey are expanding their Windchill and Codebeamer deployments and will use Windchill as the foundation for their digital thread. The digital thread is becoming increasingly strategic to customers across many industries, as product companies see the potential to improve their competitiveness by managing the complete life cycle of their products in a more integrated manner.\nWhat is most important to thread together can be different for different customers, but having visibility to a more complete picture and being able to gain actionable insights through a digital thread of product data is becoming table stakes as the competitive environment continues to intensify across many industries. Turning to the third customer example for today, which is a ServiceMax SLM win on Slide 7. SLM is service life cycle management and one of our main products here as ServiceMax, the industry leader in field service management for high-value, long life cycle products. In Q3, we landed a new PTC customer because of ServiceMax. This customer engineers, manufacturers and services, industrial and electrical power systems around the world, and they like that ServiceMax has become part of PTC. The drivers behind this win were similar in many ways to the elevated company win we highlighted on last quarter's call.\nThe point is that many product companies are not only focused on managing complexity and accelerating time to market, they are also looking for new sources of top line and bottom line growth. In this example, the customer had a CEO-led initiative to better leverage their installed base to grow aftermarket revenue in a repeatable and cost-effective manner. Because of organizational silos, the customer currently has fragmented service business operation, which impacts their field service productivity and customer service.\nThey struggle to compete with smaller, local vendors for aftermarket contracts to service their own products. The customer made the strategic decision that it was time to transform their service operations and they selected service facts. The ServiceMax system will be their software foundation and single source of truth for their aftermarket services and customer service initiatives. Before going out into the field, the ServiceMax application will help their service technicians understand everything they need to know about the specific product that needs servicing so that they can bring the right parts with them.\nThe ServiceMax application will also schedule and route the field technicians efficiently and guide the field technicians through complex procedures. As typical of ServiceMax deals, the selection process was very thorough and ServiceMax came on top based on product capabilities that are aligned with the priorities of the customer to drive more proactive customer service, improved visibility into their installed base of products, drive higher aftermarket attach rates and improve field technician utilization.\nLastly, we also remain encouraged by our other focus areas that it didn't provide examples for this quarter, which are CAD and SaaS. We have been reinvesting in our business, consistently growing our annual R&D investment footprint to provide greater value to our customers. In Q3, we made incremental progress in each of our 5 focus areas towards executing in a scalable fashion and focusing our investments on the product advancements that customers care the most about.\nAs I emphasized earlier, you should expect to see a continued focus on aligning all our resources across all operational functions in this company behind our 5 focus areas. This is foundational work, and we will be disciplined about seeing it through. It will take time and progress may not be linear, but we will leave no stone unturned, as I said, as we focus on scaling our business and further improving the consistency of our execution.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Christian to take you through our Q3 financial results and future guidance.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 9. PTC, again delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a continued challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. To help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of foreign exchange volatility, we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis.\nAt the end of Q3, our constant currency ARR was $2.125 billion, up 12% year-over-year and within our guidance range. Our free cash flow results were also solid, up 29% year-over-year, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our key focus areas. However, we came in a bit below our guidance of approximately $220 million due to timing. We have a high degree of confidence in our cash flow guidance and targets due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined resource allocation structure we have in place.\nWith the timing issues resolved, we continue to expect free cash flow of $725 million in fiscal '24 and continue to be confident that our business model positions us to deliver solid, predictable results. Turning to Slide 10. Let's look at our ARR growth in more detail. Starting with our product groups.\nIn Q3, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in CAD and 13% growth in PLM. Despite the overall demand environment, which has been sluggish for a couple of years now, our top line has shown good resilience. Our solid ARR growth is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint in high-growth segments of the market and the digital transformation journeys of our customers. These underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times.\nMoving to our ARR by region. Our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across the Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q3 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q2.\nMoving to Slide 11. First of all, given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. As you know, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nGiven the strategic acquisitions, namely ServiceMax and Codebeamer that we've done over the past couple of years and the debt we took on to fund them, we paused our share repurchase program. As we said before, we intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt in fiscal '24. And as we've been saying, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt pay-down and share repurchases when we get to fiscal '25. We were 2.2x levered at the end of Q3. During the quarter, we paid down our debt by $195 million and ended Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $248 million and gross debt of $1.8 billion.\nWe continue to expect that we'll end fiscal '24 with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. Lastly, we expect fully diluted shares of approximately $121 million in fiscal '24, up by approximately 1.5 million shares year-over-year. With that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 12.\nReflecting our year-to-date performance and our outlook for Q4, we're updating our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance, lowering the high end of the range by $20 million and now expect to end the year with constant currency ARR growth [ of 11% to 12% ]. It's worth noting we're updating our revenue guidance accordingly, reducing the high end by $20 million. We're reiterating our free cash flow guidance of approximately $725 million in fiscal '24, given our year-to-date performance and Q4 outlook. For Q4, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $83 million and constant currency ARR of $2.2 billion to $2.22 billion, which corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%. We believe we've set our guidance appropriately. I'll get a little more into ARR guidance details on the next slide. But before I do, I'd also like to reiterate my favorite reminder. To help you with your models, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance. But ASC-606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we primarily sell on-premise subscriptions.\nAnd the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 '22 call that you may want to refer to if you are new to PTC. The summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nImportantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront 1 year at a time regardless of contract term lengths. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable. Moving to Slide 13. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q4. You can see our results over the past 11 quarters and the column on the far right illustrates what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance.\nThe illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q4 guidance range, we need $85 million of sequential net new ARR growth. This is approximately $10 million more than we added in Q4 of the previous 2 fiscal years. And this year, we expect to benefit from Codebeamer cross-selling ServiceMax with an aligned and enabled sales force and approximately $5 million more in deferred ARR than we had in Q4 of fiscal '23.\nWe think our guidance range for Q4 and the full year balance both risk and opportunity. And looking out a little further ahead to our fiscal '25, and here, keep in mind that we're still in the middle of our detailed planning process. But I would not be surprised if our official fiscal '25 guidance, when we give it next quarter was in the low double-digit ARR growth range, consistent with our medium-term targets and in line with our performance over the past couple of years, again, balancing both risk and opportunity.\nI also anticipate our free cash flow guidance would be somewhere within the $825 million to $875 million range we previously communicated. Additionally, as we think about capital allocation, I think you will see us resume share repurchases in fiscal '25 in and around the $300 million level as we balance debt paydown with returning capital to shareholders.\nObviously, we'll provide our official guidance on next quarter's call, but we just wanted to provide some directional thinking that we feel pretty comfortable with given the recurring nature of our business model and the budgeting process we have in place. In conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio, solid strategy and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to PTC's 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, John, and welcome to PTC's Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Neil Barua, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and -- and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.\nThe forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, May 1, 2024, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in the quarter with generally except accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Neil Barua.\n\nNeil Barua\n\nExecutive VP & President of Service Lifecycle Management\n\nThanks, Matt. I'm proud of what the PTC team accomplished during our second fiscal quarter. We again delivered solid results, which Kristian will take you through in detail.\nThis quarter continues to demonstrate that PTC is on the right track and that our portfolio of products is resonating with customers. Before going into more detail about our strategy and discussing some proof points from the quarter, I'd like to address our midterm targets, which we have updated today.\nTo be clear, we are not changing our cash flow guidance. What we have updated is our midterm ARR growth targets. We are now targeting constant currency ARR growth in the low double digits over the midterm, which is consistent with the performance we have delivered over the past 5 years through varying macroeconomic conditions.\nIn addition, we feel very good about our ability to hit our cash flow targets even while we appropriately reinvest into the business for product development. This is because we have a disciplined process to manage our internal spending based on the level of ARR growth we are seeing.\nThis year, as an example, our internal spend framework assumed 10% to 12% ARR growth. In addition to adding incremental investment to drive multiyear growth, we are also proactively managing our existing spend. We are able to do this effectively by leveraging the skill sets of our global R&D teams, where we could shift the focus of these resources towards the product areas that create the greatest customer value.\nIn addition, we have confidence in generating increasing operating leverage from our go-to-market and G&A teams. The investments we make are aligned to the market environment and our 5 focus areas to ensure appropriate resource allocation towards the areas that create the greatest customer value.\nAs an example, we are currently in the process of rebalancing resources primarily in R&D, away from creating new stand-alone IoT and AR applications to instead support PLM, ALM and SLM growth. While these are not huge movements of people and there will not be a restructuring charge associated with this, it is an example of how we plan to put a greater focus on driving our priorities more effectively.\nAs a reminder, our 5 focus areas include: number one, PLM, which has driven primarily by our Windchill product; number two, ALM, which is driven by our Codebeamer product; number three, SLM, which is primarily driven by ServiceMax, number four, CAD, which is driven primarily by Creo and lastly, number five, our continued focus on SaaS.\nI'd like to turn now to discuss 2 of our focus areas to illustrate the significant value we bring to customers. This quarter, I'll touch on what we have been seeing with customers of our Windchill PLM and ServiceMax SLM products.\nStarting with PLM. This is product life cycle management, and Windchill is our flagship PLM product. PLM systems tend to be highly configured, really sticky and our mission-critical system of record for our customers.\nThis is software that historically had the function of helping CAD engineers keep track of their CAD Fox. Part of the reason PTC's growth has been so solid over the last few years is because PLM systems have grown in importance at product companies.\nToday's products are more complex, typically with embedded electronics and software and even the mechanical components are now more complex. To drive revenue growth, product companies have become increasingly focused on producing more variants of their products.\nMixing certain hardware configurations with other software configurations, while at the same time, compressing the time it takes to get new products to market. That's a tall order. Simply put, product companies that offer multiple configurations of their products face a diversity and scale challenge.\nAnd sooner or later, it becomes clear to these companies that having an advanced PLM system is a strategic necessity. In general, manufacturing companies have a long way to go in terms of their digital transformation journeys.\nWhen a product company gets really serious about optimizing and automating their workflows, we tend to see large PLM expansion projects. This creates a step function increase in ARR, as customers expand their Windchill deployments in terms of both seats and functionality.\nThis is what we saw in a leading medical equipment company with over $5 billion of annual revenue and 20,000 employees. Getting new products to market faster is a top business priority for them. As a first step, they standardize on Windchill within R&D across all their business divisions and harmonize their engineering practices related to product changes and configuration management.\nBy doing this, they established a solid engineering foundation that ensures the traceability work performed and updates made for both productivity gains and also to remain compliant with regulations.\nBefore standardizing on Windchill, this customer did not have an authoritative source of truth for their product data. So, whenever they ran into conflicting product data in their systems, they lost a lot of time figuring out why that happened and what to do about.\nWhile the first step for this customer was expanding Windchill within R&D, they also want to accelerate their new product introduction time lines. To do this, they needed to drive earlier collaboration around new products, across other operational functions outside of R&D.\nTo accomplish this goal, they decided to leverage their Windchill system as a backbone for enterprise-wide collaboration around product data, and they expanded their Windchill deployment to teams, including manufacturing, supply chain, quality, regulatory, compliance and marketing.\nFor example, providing the supply chain team with relevant product data earlier in the process enables any issues around component availability or component pricing to be identified earlier, resulting in less need for products to be redesigned or reworked later.\nTurning to the second customer example for today, which is about cross-selling ServiceMax, SLM into our base. First, A reminder that SLM is service life cycle management, and our main product here is ServiceMax, which we acquired a little over a year ago.\nServiceMax is the industry leader in field service management for high-value long life cycle products. Our customers are not only facing complexity challenges, competitive pressures have also increased.\nGlobalization has forced companies to be more efficient if they want to remain competitive. They are looking for new steady sources of top line growth and margin expansion.\nIn order to drive scalable service revenue, expanding their focus with digital tools on their services operations is key. The example I want to highlight here is one of the largest elevator companies in the world with billions in annual revenue. After struggling with disparate disconnected systems that got in the way of providing good service to their customers, they decided to embark on a complete service transformation to improve both the growth and profitability of their services business.\nIn the future, when their service technicians go into the field to service an elevator, they will know, using the ServiceMax application about the specific elevator so they bring the right parts to the work site. They will know the service history and have service instructions for that specific elevator. And of course, they'll be scheduled and routed efficiently to the job site.\nFurthermore, the elevator business is highly regulated and the ServiceMax application will ease the regulatory compliance burden by having traceable records of the work performed during service calls. This is how ServiceMax helps our customers.\nWe've been focused on cross-selling ServiceMax into our strong base of customers where we have established customer trust. As of the start of fiscal '24, we aligned the PTC sales team with the ServiceMax sales [ freshers ] to go to market together. And this collaboration played a big role in getting this deal across the finish line.\nWe also remain encouraged by our other focus areas that I didn't provide examples for this quarter, which are Codebeamer ALM, CAD and SaaS. In each of our 5 focus areas, we made incremental progress during Q2 towards executing in a scalable fashion and focusing our investments on the product advancements that customers care the most about.\nAs many of you know, during my transition period before taking over as CEO, I spent time listening to employees, digging into our product strategy. speaking with customers and partners to understand their needs and how we address them.\nAs a result of the time I spend on this, I feel good about our product portfolio and strategy, which guides our 5 focus areas. You should expect to see a continued emphasis on focusing our resources in the areas that create the greatest customer value and where we have a right to win.\nI've also started to focus on our operations. I began to examine where we excel and have room for improvement. As you know, PTC has been on a multiyear journey to improve efficiencies. But my early observations are that PTC will benefit from a fresh look at innovative ways to continue to drive operational improvements.\nI'm turning over lots of stones, and we'll look at everything to usher in a new phase of focus and effectiveness across the entire company.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q2 financial results.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Neil. Hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 8. PTC, again delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow in a challenging selling environment. As you know, we believe ARR and free cash flow are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nTo help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility we provide ARR guidance and disclose our ARR results on a constant currency basis.\nAt the end of Q2, our constant currency ARR was $2.075 billion, up 12% year-over-year and above our guidance range. Note that we acquired ServiceMax in Q2 of fiscal '23, so we're no longer excluding ServiceMax from our organic ARR results.\nIn Q2 '24, our cash flow results also came in ahead of our guidance with operating cash flow of $251 million and free cash flow of $247 million, both of which were up 19% year-over-year.\nOur cash flow performance is driven by our ARR and operating efficiency. And in Q2, we extended our track record of disciplined operational management while continuing to invest in our key focus areas.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's look at our ARR growth at a more detailed level. Starting with our product groups in CAD, we delivered 11% constant currency ARR growth in Q2 and with the growth primarily driven by Creo. In PLM, our constant currency ARR growth was 13%, primarily driven by Windchill.\nDespite the overall demand environment, which has been sluggish for many quarters now, our top line has shown good resilience. Our solid ARR growth is supported by our unique portfolio with a solid footprint and higher growth segments of the market and the digital transformation journeys of our customers.\nThese underlying strengths are further supported by our subscription model, our low churn rate and the propensity for our customer base to prioritize their own R&D investments through challenging times.\nMoving to our ARR by region. Our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across Americas, Europe and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double digits. Across all regions, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth rates in Q2 were similar to the growth rates we saw in Q1.\nMoving to Slide 10. In -- First of all, given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance. And as you know, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, and -- while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nSo given the strategic acquisitions, namely ServiceMax and Codebeamer that we've done over the past 2 years, we paused our share repurchase program. And as we've said before, we intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt in fiscal '24.\nHeading into fiscal '25, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. We were 2.3x levered at the end of Q2. During the quarter, we paid down our debt by $256 million, and we ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $249 million and gross debt of $2.011 billion. We expect to end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion.\nLastly, we now expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1.5 million shares in fiscal '24 and -- versus our previous expectation of approximately 1 million shares under the accounting rules, specifically ASC 260, a higher share price results in incrementally higher diluted share count.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 11. We're reiterating our fiscal '24 free cash flow guidance and narrowing our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance range. We're taking the low end of the ARR guidance up by $10 million, reflecting our solid first half performance. We're taking the high end of the range down by $10 million, reflecting a change to the deferred ARR, we expect to recognize in the back half of the year.\nYou'll recall that we said we had approximately $20 million more deferred ARR in the back half of fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. We've reduced this by $10 million as we've renegotiated a handful of customer contracts.\nWhile not commonplace with existing contracts, renegotiations do sometimes happen. Some of you may recall that we had a handful of these during COVID as well.\nThe field teams do a good job here, working with customers in what I like to call a customer-friendly but commercially responsible manner, meaning we're doing the right thing for the customer now, while also ensuring that these deals will result in a higher exit run rate and better contractual terms for PTC.\nWe remain squarely focused on long-term value creation for our customers and our shareholders. It's worth noting that we're updating our fiscal '24 revenue guidance accordingly, taking the low end up by $10 million, reducing the high end by $10 million. Additionally, we're lowering the entire range by $10 million due to the impact of FX.\nAs you'll recall, we do not guide to constant currency revenue. Our EPS guidance reflects our first half performance and the impacts of the narrowing of the revenue range and the FX impact as well.\nAnd lastly, our free cash flow is also impacted by FX, but we're reiterating the $725 million guidance given the first half results.\nFor Q3, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $220 million in constant currency ARR of $2.115 billion to $2.13 billion, which corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%.\nWe believe we've set our Q3 and full year guidance appropriately. I'll get into more ARR guidance details on the next 2 slides. But before we do, I'd also like to reiterate my favorite reminder.\nTo help you with your models, we're providing revenue and EPS guidance. But ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premise subscriptions and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that aren't necessarily relevant to the performance of the business.\nI did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 '22 call that you may want to refer to if you're new to PTC. The summary is, we believe ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nImportantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time. We primarily bill our customers annually upfront 1 year at a time, regardless of contract term lengths. So our free cash flow results over time are comparable.\nLet's turn to Slide 12, and here's an illustration of what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '24.\nAs you can see from the slide, to hit the midpoint of our fiscal '24 guidance range we need $145 million of sequential ARR growth in the second half of fiscal '24. This is approximately $20 million more than we added in the second half of the previous 2 fiscal years.\nAnd in the second half of fiscal '24, we expect to benefit from Codebeamer, cross-selling ServiceMax with an aligned and enabled sales force and $10 million more of deferred ARR than we had in the second half of fiscal '23.\nMoving on to Slide 13. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q3 '24. You can see our results here over the past 10 quarters, and the column on the far right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance.\nThis illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q3 guidance range, we need $48 million of sequential net ARR growth.\nBecause our ARR trends tend to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q3 of fiscal '23 and Q3 of fiscal '22. We think our guidance range for Q3 of '24 and the full year balances both risk and opportunity.\nFinally, on free cash flow, I want to reiterate the point that Neil made earlier. We continue to have a high degree of confidence in our cash flow guidance and targets due to the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined resource allocation structure we have in place.\nIn conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio and strategy and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator and begin the Q&A session."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to PTC's 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, and welcome to PTC's 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, CEO; Neil Barua, CEO-elect; and Kristian Talvitie, CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call, are valid only as of today's date, January 31, 2024, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PTC, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. There may be an issue displaying the presentation materials, so if you don't see them, I invite you to go to investor.ptc.com. You'll find the same presentation materials there and you can follow along. We are right now on Slide 3. I'm pleased to report that PTC's Q1 results provided a good start to our fiscal '24. We delivered solid financial results while, in parallel, making great progress on CEO succession.\nOver the past 6 months, Neil and I have run a textbook transition process and we're nearing the culmination. We spent a lot of time together and traveled the world extensively to accomplish the goal we articulated of a seamless transition that ensures continuity and PTC strategy and momentum. Neil is ready to be CEO. He understands our business well, he's fully committed to our strategy, and he has the full support of an outstanding executive team. I'm confident that PTC will continue to drive growth and profitability well into the future under Neil's leadership. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Neil to discuss the Q1 results. Neil?\n\nNeil Barua\n\nThank you, Jim. We're on Slide 5. Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 topics: first, what I've learned about PTC over the past several months; second, the drivers of PTC's durable and consistent growth; and third, driving further value creation with discipline and consistent execution. After my remarks, I'll hand over the call to Kristian to take you through our Q1 results and our guidance. Then we will have a Q&A session.\nUpfront, I'd like to say a big thank you to Jim for sharing his industry insight and wealth of knowledge over the past year. The transition has gone very well. It has been helpful to have Jim participate as I've engaged with customers, employees, and investors. I'm honored to be taking over the CEO role on February 14 with PTC on a solid trajectory, credit to Jim and the team. We have a great strategy based on differentiated portfolio of assets and led by a strong team. As I said, my initial focus is on ensuring that we keep building on our momentum with discipline and consistent execution.\nTurning to Slide 6. Our customers design, manufacture and service products. Most of our large customers produce and service the world's most critical assets, for example, wind turbines, tractors, automobiles and MRI machines. The biggest learning I've had relates to what I am seeing in our customer base and how much we could do for them. Digital transformation has clearly taken hold with our customers around the world and finally is here to stay. Industrial companies can't have manual, antiquated or disconnected workflows if they want to be competitive in today's complex world. Our customers need to modernize the portion of their operations that spans from design to manufacturing to service. Importantly, our core products are the essential foundation for that.\nTurning to Slide 7. Industrial companies are still at early stages of leveraging product data effectively across the organizations, but they have started to move on it in a meaningful way. We see the opportunity the same way our customers do. Digital transformation is a journey. Our broad portfolio provides a lot of opportunity to help our customers be competitive, irrespective of soft PMIs and economic cycles.\nNext on Slide 8, my second major learning is that the overall PTC team is strong and capable. As I visited our offices around the world, I spent a lot of time doing skip-level, one-on-one meetings and town halls. I was inspired by the caliber and spirit of our people. I was impressed by their extensive product understanding and deep customer relationships. Their enthusiasm is palpable. They realize the opportunity ahead of us and that we have a portfolio of capabilities to win big.\nTurning to Slide 9. I also feel very good about the strength of my highly experienced leadership team and how we will operate going forward. My style is to bring what I'm hearing from customers into the conversation and capture the energy and ideas from each team member. This collaborative framework is already working well. And as a team, we are making progress in aligning on PTC's value creation opportunities going forward and our focused energies towards them.\nLet's turn to Slide 10. On our past couple of earnings calls, we have been sharing this framework, which shows the cumulative drivers that support our top line growth. Fiscal '24 is expected to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit organic constant currency ARR growth. A key point to understand is that our top line growth is sustainable, supported by the many layers of cumulative drivers that we have built over time. Each layer contributes to our ability and drive value for customers. As our customers continue to invest in digital transformation, our comprehensive product portfolio differentiates PTC. This is because PTC is the only company that can help industrial manufacturers drive closed-loop product life cycle management across engineering, manufacturing, quality and service.\nMoving to Slide 11. We have also been sharing this framework on recent earnings calls, which shows the cumulative drivers that support our bottom line growth. As with the previous slide, every layer in this framework is important. The key point on this slide is that our strong free cash flow growth in recent years is attributed not only to our solid top line growth but also to a subscription license business model and strong operational discipline. I am fully aligned with Kristian on the paramount importance of our free cash flow guidance, and we have a high level of confidence in the targets we've provided.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our philosophy on resource allocation is that focus and discipline are important. To that end, it is our view that we have a compelling portfolio in place. The key things to get right are to focus on evolving customer needs and to drive strong and consistent execution towards that. To ensure this consistency, we will put a clear focus on our highest ROI opportunities. We will be disciplined and unemotional when it comes to prioritizing our time and resources on the products and product integrations that will create the most value for our customers. To use an analogy, we plan to put more wood behind the most important arrows to ensure we drive the best outcomes for our customers and PTC.\nLet's now turn our attention to these priorities. Expanding our PLM or product life cycle management footprint at customers, both within engineering departments and enterprise-wide. There are 2 main reasons for this secular track. First, PLM systems have evolved to meet the complexities faced today by industrial manufacturing companies. As just 1 example, the Volvo Group, whose Chief Digital Officer and Chief Technology Officer I was speaking to yesterday, uses Windchill to manage their platform product strategy, which leverages modular components. The sophisticated configuration management capabilities of Windchill have enabled the Volvo Group to produce more product variants while, at the same time, lowering their unique part count, which is good for the Volvo Group's top line as well as their bottom line.\nIndustrial companies have come to understand that their ERP systems are inadequate to handle these types of complexities. They now view their PLM systems as strategic and spending on PLM is in focus. Secondly, industrial companies are facing competitive pressures and are looking for new ways to drive productivity and efficiency. As they digitally transform, they also re-architect their workflows to streamline inefficiencies and drive collaboration with their manufacturing, quality and service operations. Again, it is the PLM system that takes center stage as this happens because the PLM system is becoming the system of record for product data. And that makes the PLM system the epicenter for digital transformation of product companies. Increasingly, PLM systems are being leveraged as the backbone for sharing product data across departments as well as with design and supply chain partners. This is good news for PTC. The market is coming to us where we are strong.\nAnother large value creation opportunity is cross-selling. PTC has done this successfully over the years, and we have additions to the portfolio that are meeting evolving customer needs and therefore present significant opportunities for PTC. One is ALM or application life cycle management, which is led by Codebeamer and is now augmented by our acquisition of [ Pure Variance ]. Here, we have the most modern and capable ALM solution in the market. Products now contain more embedded software than ever. And for many products, there's been an explosion in the number of unique software configurations that need to be developed and updated over time.\nCodebeamer is a next-gen software development platform that enables industrial companies to manage this increasing level of complexity. Pure Variance augments Codebeamer with industry-leading software variant management capabilities, which is a key differentiator. While demand from the auto industry and its suppliers are a strong driver of ALM growth, demand for ALM tools is expanding in other verticals as well due to the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Clearly, this is an interesting growth opportunity, and we have been increasing our investments and focus in this area.\nOur second cross-sell opportunity is ServiceMax. We acquired ServiceMax in January 2023 and the strategic fit with PTC is solid. For many of our customers, growing the services business is their top priority. As a system of record for high-value, long-life cycle assets in the field, ServiceMax significantly enhances our SLM or service life cycle management portfolio, enabling PTC to now offer the industry's first truly comprehensive solution for service process optimization. The opportunity set here is large, and this segment is underpenetrated today with most of our wins replacing homegrown or stretchy based systems. ServiceMax has approximately 300 customers, and PTC has approximately 3,000 with the exact same profiles: industrial companies that produce complex, high-value assets. This provides us with clear cross-sell opportunities, and we have now aligned the PTC sales teams with the ServiceMax sales specialists to go to market together.\nWe are building momentum. But keep in mind that this will take some time to develop because sales cycles for this type of product are long, given their new implementations for the most part. Clearly, continuing to grow CAD and converting our installed base over to SaaS across all products are 2 additional opportunities which overlap to some extent because we will see conversion of Creo customers to our Creo+ SaaS offering over time, much like Windchill+. For customers, moving to SaaS enables a different collaboration paradigm that brings significant productivity benefits, making real-time multiuser collaboration possible.\nBeyond the productivity benefits, customers also want the lower total cost of ownership and improved security posture that SaaS offers. As we have stated previously, we see this as another 10-plus year journey for our customers. We have visibility to solid growth in our core on-premise business and therefore don't need to rush things and force customers to move before they are ready. The opportunity will be with us for a long time. Therefore, our focus is making sure our SaaS transition is done with an optimized customer experience. It is a tight community so credibility and references are important.\nWrapping up on Slide 13. I'm honored to be stepping in at such an exciting time. There are so many good things happening at PTC and so many opportunities to drive further value in part because of the portfolio of products that Jim and the team built over the years and the distinct needs of the market. PTC is well positioned to deliver sustainable ARR and free cash flow growth based on layers of cumulative growth and profit drivers.\nWe are putting, as I said, more wood behind the most important arrows to drive the best outcomes for our customers. And I am focused on working with the team to enhance PTC's execution on the opportunities that drive the most customer and shareholder value. We plan to host an Investor Day this year and share more about our key medium- to long-term opportunities. We are working towards becoming more consistent with our messaging and more focused in how we prioritize our time and resources. It is a great time to be at PTC because we have a clear path to unlocking a lot of value. With that, I'll hand the call over to Kristian to take you through our Q1 financial results.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 15. PTC again delivered solid financial results in terms of both ARR and free cash flow, which we believe are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business. Our constant currency ARR growth was 23% in Q1, and on an organic basis, excluding ServiceMax, our growth was 13%. Note that we acquired ServiceMax in Q2 of fiscal '23 so starting next quarter, Q2 of fiscal '24, we will no longer exclude ServiceMax from our organic results.\nTo help investors understand our business performance, excluding the impact of FX volatility, we've been providing ARR guidance and disclosing our ARR results on a constant currency basis. At the end of Q1, our constant currency ARR was $2.016 billion, slightly above the guidance range we provided for the quarter. In Q1, our cash flow results also came in slightly ahead of our guidance with operating cash flow of $187 million and free cash flow of $183 million. As a reminder, our Q1 cash flows included $30 million of imputed interest related to the deferred payment for ServiceMax. Our cash flow performance is driven by our ARR and operating efficiency. And in Q1, we extended our track record of disciplined operational management while continuing to invest in key priorities like ALM and SaaS.\nTurning to Slide 16. Let's look at our ARR growth by geographic region. Although FX continues to be volatile and the selling environment remained challenging in Q1, our constant currency organic ARR growth was solid across the Americas, Europe, and APAC, with growth in the low to mid-double digits. In APAC, our year-over-year organic constant currency growth increased to 14% in Q1 compared to 12% in Q4. And in the Americas and Europe, our organic year-over-year constant currency growth in Q1 was comparable to what we saw in Q4.\nTurning to Slide 17, let's look at our ARR growth by product group. In CAD, we delivered 10% constant currency ARR growth in Q1 with the growth primarily driven by Creo. In PLM, our constant currency ARR growth was 33%. 19 points of this growth was attributable to ServiceMax and therefore our organic constant currency growth in Q1 was 14%. In PLM, our organic growth was primarily driven by Windchill and also supported by strong percentage growth in ALM, thanks to Codebeamer. Although the manufacturing PMIs have indicated a sluggish overall demand environment for many quarters now, our top line has shown good resilience. Part of this is because of our subscription license model, our low churn rates and a propensity for our customer base to prioritize R&D investments through challenging times. In addition, as Neil explained earlier, our solid ARR growth is being supported by the digital transformation journeys of our customers, which we believe is a secular trend.\nMoving to Slide 18. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $265 million. Given the consistency and predictability of our free cash flow, we aim to maintain a low cash balance and prefer to maximize debt reduction. Our gross debt was $2.267 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.7%. During Q1, our gross debt decreased by $55 million. We used $181 million of cash to pay down debt, which was partially offset by $96 million, primarily related to pure-systems and the $30 million imputed interest payment related to the final payment for the ServiceMax transaction, which we discussed previously. We were 2.8x levered at the end of Q1 '24 and expect that to trend down throughout the remainder of the year as we're prioritizing paying down our debt this fiscal year. We intend to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt this year and expect to end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion.\nIn connection with this, we've temporarily paused our share repurchase program and expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal '24. Heading into fiscal '25, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 19. We're maintaining our fiscal '24 guidance. And following our solid Q1 results, we believe we're well positioned to deliver on our guidance for the full year. For Q2, our constant currency ARR guidance range of $2.05 billion to $2.065 billion corresponds to year-over-year growth of 11% to 12%. I'll get into more details on the next slide. On cash flows, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $240 million in the second quarter. To help you with your models, we're continuing to provide revenue and EPS guidance, but as a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue and EPS difficult to predict for PTC since we sell primarily on-premises, subscription licenses, and the way revenue is recognized from these contracts can vary significantly based on variables that we don't believe are necessarily relevant to the performance of the business. I actually did a teach-in on this subject on our Q4 '22 call that you may want to refer to if you're new to PTC.\nThe summary is we believe ARR and free cash flow rather than revenue and operating income are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. Importantly, we've maintained consistent billing practices over time, and we primarily bill our customers annually upfront 1 year at a time regardless of contract term lengths, so our free cash flow results over time are comparable.\nMoving on to Slide 20. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q2 '24. You can see our results over the past 9 quarters, and the column on the far right illustrates what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. This illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q2 guidance range, we need $41 million of sequential net ARR growth. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q2 of '23 and Q2 of '22. We believe we've set our Q2 '24 constant currency guidance range prudently, which reflects an ongoing sluggish selling environment.\nPutting this into the context of the full year, let's turn to Slide 21. Here's a repeat of the slide we showed last quarter, which illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '24. Looking at the full year perspective naturally removes a lot of the quarterly volatility related to large transactions and ramp deal and start date dynamics. As you can see on the slide, for illustrative purposes, even if the full year is flattish with the last 2 years from a net new ARR perspective, given the incremental $20 million of deferred ARR in the back half, which we've talked about before, we would be at 12% growth for the year. We think the full year guidance range of 11% to 14% balances both risk and opportunity.\nFinally, on free cash flow, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our quarterly and full year guidance because of the predictability of our cash collections and the disciplined budgeting process we have in place. So in conclusion, PTC has a strong portfolio and strategy and a great team of people with deep expertise and strong customer relationships. We're focused on disciplined and consistent execution to ensure we deliver on the value creation opportunities we have ahead of us. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A session."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to PTC's 2023 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Danica, and welcome to PTC's 2023 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, CEO; Neil Barua, CEO-elect; and Kristian Talvitie, CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.\nThe forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, November 1, 2023, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's CEO, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PTC, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As usual, I will focus on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics, and Kristian will cover currency effects later in the call. I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, PTC, again delivered solid financial results in terms of ARR and free cash flow, which are the most important metrics to assess the performance of our business.\nReflecting on the full year, which will be my last year in the CEO seat, fiscal '23 has been one of PTC's best years ever. Despite a challenging economy, we delivered a seventh consecutive year of double-digit top line growth with ARR growing 23%, 13% organically and revenue crossing the $2 billion threshold. And on the bottom line, we delivered 41% growth in free cash flow. This performance is a great stepping off point for me as I hand the reins of the company to Neil Barua going forward.\nGiven the CEO transition that's actively underway, during this call, I'll focus my comments on Q4 and fiscal '23 and let Neil take the lead on forward-looking commentary. Coming back to the Q4 results and turning to Slide 4. Though the manufacturing PMIs have indicated a sluggish global environment for many quarters now, our top line ARR continues to show good resilience. In Q4, we saw a broad-based ARR strength across our product groups and geographies. Our churn remained low. And for the full year, we did better than the churn targets we had shared previously. Customer demand was solid in Q4, up overall and on an organic basis, in line with the exceptional results we delivered in Q4 last year.\nWithin this context, the portion of business that we signed in Q4, but that did not start in Q4 or fiscal '23 was greater than we had modeled. Since ARR only kicks in when the subscription starts, Q4 ARR was $8 million lower than we had modeled, while deferred ARR is consequently $8 million higher. With this influx, our total deferred ARR is now $20 million higher than it was at the beginning of fiscal '23. Kristian will explain that because of this added strength in deferred ARR, we are now guiding ARR to grow 11% to 14% in fiscal '24, higher than the 10% to 14% growth range we discussed previously.\nMoving to Slide 5 and switching to our bottom line view. We delivered $44 million of free cash flow in Q4, ahead of our guidance and up 52% year-over-year. For the full year, our free cash flow was $587 million, ahead of our guidance and up 41% year-over-year. Remember that ARR is the primary driver of cash flow. So this robust result was driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency. In fiscal '23, we delivered 38% operating efficiency which was 620 basis points higher than fiscal '22, well above our initial target that call for approximately 450 basis points of improvement in operating efficiency.\nWe expect these operating efficiency improvements to be sustainable, and we think our subscription business model will continue to provide us with operating leverage. Turning to Slide 6. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in the Americas was 25%. In Europe, ARR growth was 24%, and in APAC, ARR growth was 18%. Regionally, compared to a quarter ago, the GAAP between as reported and constant currency ARR widened in Europe and narrowed in APAC. On a global basis in Q4, our constant currency ARR growth was 3% less than our reported ARR growth. Versus prior quarters, we saw improved demand in China and in our SMB reseller channel. All 3 regions benefited from inorganic growth to varying degrees due to the acquisition of ServiceMax.\nNext, let's look at ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 7. In CAD, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q4. Within these results, the growth magnitude was primarily driven by Creo but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape. PTC is taking share in different parts of the CAD market with both products, and we're excited about the potential of our new Creo+ SaaS offering as well as Onshape. We launched Creo+ at LiveWorx event this past May, and the initial customer demand for Creo+ has been encouraging. Regarding Onshape, with NPS scores that lead the industry by a considerable margin and solid retention rates, we see good opportunities to take share in the part of the CAD market that Onshape focuses on.\nGarmin's recent decision to replace their incumbent CAD system with Onshape speaks to the products maturing functionality and competitive differentiation. In PLM, our ARR growth rate in Q4 was 34% or 15% organic with the incremental inorganic growth coming from ServiceMax. ARR growth in Q4 was primarily driven by Windchill, but supplemented by strong organic growth in ALM, thanks to Codebeamer. Codebeamer has proven to be a great addition to our portfolio with strong demand coming from manufacturing companies that might already be profession at managing hardware development but are struggling to deal with a growing wave of software complexity.\nWhile demand is most notable in the automotive industry due to the rise of software-defined vehicles, we see customer demand for ALM tools expanding in other verticals as well, driven by the trend towards software-driven products of all types. Not only do manufacture products contain more software than ever, but there has been an explosion of software configurations that need to be developed and maintained across a company's different product lines, including across model years, sales options and cloud deployments. That's why we supplemented our Codebeamer ALM solution with the acquisition of Pure Systems.\nYou probably know that on the hardware side of the manufactured product, configuration management has always been the special sauce of Windchill, now with the addition of the Pure variant solution, Codebeamer will be able to offer equally robust configuration management for the software side of the product. The Pure Systems company is relatively small, but their breakthrough peer variance offering has already landed early wins at many of the same auto and industrial companies that are adopting Codebeamer. Introducing this key competitive differentiator and value proposition into Codebeamer makes our position in the ALM market even more promising.\nWe've been taking significant share in the PLM market and are well positioned going forward with our strength in core PLM with Windchill Arena, complemented by strong positions in the faster-growing ALM and SLM parts of the market. Wrapping up my comments then. First, I'd like to say heartfelt thank you to all of you who have supported me and my team over the years. Your insights and support have helped us to transform PTC into the awesome company it is today, a $2 billion scale growth and profit leader with a unique product portfolio that helps our manufacturing customers digitally transform their businesses. I'm personally very proud of what the PTC team has accomplished during my 13 years as CEO and much longer tenure as the company's technology and strategy leader.\nI feel things are in good position to transition the leadership to Neil Barua. Neil will be supported by the same team who drove our transformation, including Kristian, Mike DiTullio, Aaron Von Staats, Kevin Wrenn, Steve Dertien, Catherine Knicker and thousands of other PTC employees. I wish them all the best as they evolve the business in pursuit of new ways to create value for our customers and shareholders under Neil's leadership just as they did during mind.\nI will remain in the background supporting Neil through February, but I plan to let him take the stage in investor discussions going forward. With that, I'll hand the call over to Neil to share his perspectives on the CEO transition and the future of the PTC business.\n\nNeil Barua\n\nThanks, Jim. Hello, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. The CEO transition is progressing well and according to plan. I'm excited to soon step into the CEO role, and I appreciate everything Jim is doing to ensure a seamless transition. I spent much of the past quarter traveling with Jim to visit customers, employees and partners. These meetings have been good opportunities for me to listen and to build relationships with key stakeholders. These meetings have also reinforced how relevant our software is to our customers' digital transformation initiatives.\nPTC has established a strong position with customers, and it is clear to me that there continues to be a lot of opportunity ahead. I'm also starting to meet with investors and analysts, and I'm looking forward to continuing and deepening the 2-way dialogue. To that end, I'm looking forward to callbacks with many of you as well as some investor roadshows upcoming and conferences. And we are working on nailing down a date for an Investor Day, likely in the spring after the CEO transition. More broadly, I've been immersing myself in all aspects of PTC's business. As one example, I work closely with our team on the win at Volkswagen Group that we announced yesterday.\nThis significant expansion of PTC's footprint at underscores the value PTC brings to customers and our customers rely on us to support their product development needs at scale. Our teams understand the digital transformation needs of our customers, and we have the right strategy and product portfolio to help them achieve their goals. There's no other company that can help manufacturers drive closed-loop product life cycle management across engineering, manufacturing, quality and service. PTC is in a very healthy position and I am energized by the business that has been built in a job ahead. Next, let's turn to Slide 10.\nOn the Q3 call, we shared this framework, which shows the layers of cumulative drivers that support our top line growth. Fiscal '24 is expected to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit constant currency ARR growth. So PTC's ability to put up consistent double-digit growth is well established. This is a good framework to understand the sustainability of our top line performance. I won't go through each of the drivers now, but the takeaway is that all the layers contribute to our growth. PTC is clearly moving in the right direction, and my focus as the new CEO will be on ensuring a disciplined and metrics-driven execution of the strategy.\nMoving to Slide 11. We also shared this framework on our Q3 call, which shows the layers of cumulative drivers that support our bottom line growth. It's important to recognize that our strong free cash flow growth in recent years is attributable not only to our solid top line growth, but also to our subscription license business model and strong operational discipline. Focusing on operational execution is essential to consistently deliver for our customers and our shareholders. As with the previous slide, all the layers in this framework are important, and I see good opportunities to further expand our operating efficiency. I want to reiterate that with our subscription model and operational discipline, we expect our free cash flow to grow faster than our ARR over the midterm.\nAs we reinvest in our business to drive growth, we expect to do so prudently such that non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow at roughly half the rate of our ARR over time. Let's turn to Slide 12. Today, we are providing targets that reflect solid top line and bottom line growth over the medium term, which Kristian will take you through in more detail. As you will hear from Kristian, for fiscal '26, we are targeting ARR growth in the mid-teens and free cash flow of approximately $1 billion. If there is one takeaway from my comments today, it should be that I am singularly focused on leading PTC to execute to its full potential.\nAs the company's next CEO, I strongly believe that we have the right strategy, organization and product portfolio to drive consistent customer and shareholder value in the years ahead. Over to you, Kristian.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Neil, and hello, everyone. Starting off with Slide 14. In Q4 '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.941 billion, up 23% year-over-year and in line with our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax, our ARR was $1.77 billion, up 13% year-over-year. In Q4, our as reported ARR was $38 million higher than our constant currency ARR. Also in Q4, ARR was impacted by $8 million due to start date timing. The key point is we contracted the overall amount of business that we guided to at the beginning of the quarter. At end year starts landed as expected, we would have been around the high end of our guidance range.\nNow with approximately $20 million more deferred ARR in fiscal '24 -- starting in fiscal '24 compared to what started in fiscal '23, we're increasing our fiscal '24 guidance range to 11% to 14%. Moving on to cash flow. Our results were solid and ahead of our guidance with Q4 operating cash flow of $50 million and free cash flow of $44 million. For the full year, our free cash flow was $587 million, up 41%. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things.\nThe majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year and Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q4 revenue of $547 million increased $39 million or 8% year-over-year and was up 6% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, revenue was $2.097 billion, up 8% or 12% on a constant currency basis. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue or EPS are the best indicators of our underlying business performance. But would rather guide you to ARR and free cash flow as the best metrics to understand our business and cash generation potential.\nMoving to Slide 15. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $288 million. Our gross debt was $2.322 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.7%. During Q4, we paid down $43 million of debt and at the end of Q4, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan and approximately $202 million drawn on our revolver. In October of '23, we made the final payment for the ServiceMax transaction totaling $650 million, including $30 million of imputed interest, which will be included in our Q1 '24 free cash flow. We funded this payment with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. The deferred payment was also -- was included in debt on our Q4 balance sheet, and also factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was 3x at the end of Q4.\nAlso in October, we drew an additional EUR 85 million on the revolver related to the Pure Systems acquisition. We expect to be below 3x levered at the end of Q1 '24 and remain below 3x throughout the remainder of fiscal '24. We're prioritizing paying down our debt in fiscal '24. We expect to use substantially all of our free cash flow to pay down our debt this year and end the year with gross debt of approximately $1.7 billion. We've paused our share repurchase program, and we expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal '24. Heading into fiscal '25, we'll revisit the prioritization of debt repay down -- of debt pay down and share repurchases. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x remains to return approximately 50% and of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nNext, turning to Slide 16. Let's take a quick look at how we did against our initial guidance for the year. Summarizing our fiscal '23 financial results. In a challenging market environment, we executed well in all 4 quarters and consistently delivered solid top and bottom line growth. With that, let me move on to fiscal '24 guidance. Turning to Slide 18. We provide ARR on both a constant currency basis and on an as reported basis. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past 8 quarters. Clearly, as reported ARR embeds a lot of FX volatility. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis positive or negative.\nThat's why we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. For fiscal '23, we provided constant currency ARR guidance for the year and constant currency ARR results for all 4 quarters using FX rates as of September 30, 2022. For comparative purposes, we also provided constant currency ARR history at these FX rates. Next, on Slide 19, we're taking the same approach for fiscal '24. Our as reported Q4 '23 ARR was $1.79 billion based on actual FX rates as of September 30, 2023. That rate is our baseline for our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance. For comparative purposes, we've recast our constant currency ARR history at these rates which you can see on the upper half of this slide and is also in the data tables posted on our website.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 20. For fiscal '24, we expect constant currency ARR to grow from $1.979 billion to $2.19 billion to $2.25 billion, which corresponds to growth of 11% to 14%. Our Q1 constant currency guidance range of $1.995 billion to $2.01 billion corresponds to year-over-year growth of 22% to 23%. Note that we closed the ServiceMax acquisition right at the start of Q2 '23, so Q1 will be the last quarter we exclude ServiceMax from our organic growth rate. On cash flows, we're guiding for free cash flow of approximately $725 million in fiscal '24. Note that our cash flow guidance is not on a constant currency basis, so FX fluctuations can have an impact in either direction.\nFor fiscal '24, our guidance for operating cash flow is $745 million. We're assuming CapEx of approximately $20 million. It's worth noting how consistent and solid our free cash flow results have been since completing our transition to a subscription business model. In addition, we maintain consistent billing practices, and we've optimized our AR, AP and budgeting processes over the past few years. The predictability of our cash generation is tremendously helpful as we manage our business and invest for growth. For example, we're able to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, which is great for customers and employees alike.\nBeyond our core investments, we adjust our shorter-term or more discretionary investments accordingly given our business performance and outlook. The net result is solid and consistent free cash flow growth. In fiscal '24, we expect approximately 55% or more of our free cash flow to be generated in the first half of the year, which is less than we've seen over the past 3 years. This is primarily because in Q1 of '24, our free cash flow of $180 million includes a $30 million imputed interest payment related to the deferred payment on our acquisition of ServiceMax.\nFinally, on this slide, we're continuing to provide revenue and EPS guidance to help you with your models. But as a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths. Also, since revenue is impacted by ASC 606, it's important to remember that margins and earnings per share also impacted, so we do not view these as meaningful indicators of the performance of our business.\nTurning to Slide 21. Here, you can see how we're investing for growth while delivering solid free cash flow. On the slide in blue, you can see our absolute level of R&D spending, which has increased steadily over the years. But more importantly, you can see the slope of the blue line has inflected in recent years, along with our transition to a subscription model. As our free cash flows expanded, this has enabled us to reinvest greater amounts year after year into R&D to drive future growth despite the turbulent macro environment we've been in. Moving on to Slide 22. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for fiscal '24. You can see our results over the past 3 years and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '24.\nThe illustrative model indicates that to hit $2.22 billion midpoint of our guidance range, we need to add $241 million of net ARR this year. While this is higher than the amounts we added in fiscal '23 and '22, there are some important drivers to consider. First of all, as we discussed earlier, we have more deferred ARR contractually committed to start in fiscal '24. In fact, that amount is approximately $20 million higher at the start of fiscal '24 compared to the start of fiscal '23. Secondly, we expect Codebeamer to be a tailwind for ARR growth in fiscal '24. While we currently expect Pure Systems to have de minimis impact on our ARR results in fiscal '24, given its overall size.\nWe do expect that peer systems will help drive our Codebeamer momentum. Also, fiscal '24 will be our first full year of having ServiceMax under our roof. The broader PTC Salesforce has been equipped to sell ServiceMax, and they also have quotas now. All things considered. We believe we've set our fiscal '24 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently. Next, on Slide 23, here's a similar illustrative model for Q1. You can see our results over the past 8 quarters, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance.\nBecause our ARR trends tend to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q1 '23 and Q1 '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q1 guidance range, we need to add $24 million of net ARR on a sequential basis. We believe we've set our Q1 constant currency guidance range prudently. It's also worth mentioning that the incremental $20 million of deferred ARR we have starting in fiscal '24 is skewed to the second half of the year. Moving on to Slide 24. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. Given the complexities related to ASC 606, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC.\nThe model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it this way, may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can help. Starting at the top for fiscal '24 ARR, we're using the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance range. Next, our perpetual revenue is primarily related to our Kepware business, which is moving to subscription over time. And the primary reason our professional services is modeled to decline in fiscal '24 is because a portion of our professional services revenue is transitioning to DXP over time.\nThese 3 line items get us to our expected cash generation for the year. Moving down the model, you can see that even though we continue to reinvest in the business, we also see room to expand our operating efficiency due to our sticky products and subscription business model, combined with operational discipline. Continuing to move down the model, we provide guidance assumptions for stock comp, CapEx, interest payments. You can find these on Slide 29 of the earnings deck and also Pages 3 and 4 of the press release. Specifically, interest payments are expected to be approximately $135 million in fiscal '24, driven by an increase in debt, higher interest rates and the timing of our interest payments.\nNext, cash taxes are modeled higher in fiscal '24, reflecting higher taxable income as well as the impact of Section 174. And finally, let's take a look at the other category. In fiscal '23, the $72 million is related to FX movements, pre-acquisition ServiceMax collections and working capital. For fiscal '24, the main driver of the $19 million being modeled is working capital to support continued growth. All this sums up to expected free cash flow of approximately $725 million. If the demand environment is such that we're trending to the lower end of the ARR guidance range, we'll be more judicious in incremental investment decisions if the demand environment is such that we're trending to the higher end of the ARR guidance range, we would feel more comfortable increasing investments.\nWe have a robust budgeting process internally and that helps us not only prioritize run rate spend but also prioritizes additional investments we might want to make. For example, even in a muted demand environment, we may want to increase R&D investments but it wouldn't necessarily make sense to increase sales and marketing spending. So turning to Slide 25. For fiscal '25, we're reiterating our previous targets, and for fiscal '26, we're providing targets that extend the trajectory that we're on. We provide these targets to help you understand the potential of our business. But I also want to remind you that the macroeconomic environment, FX rates and interest rates have been volatile in recent years and could positively or negatively impact our midterm targets.\nIt's also important to point out that global tax law changes are expected to have a significant impact on our midterm free cash flow, which we've factored into our midterm targets. Next, on Slide 26, I'd like to explain the progression of our free cash flow, looking back 3 years and looking forward 3 years. Over the course of fiscal '21 to fiscal '23, we delivered a 40% 3-year free cash flow CAGR. Over that time period, we had solid ARR growth. And as expected, our non-GAAP OpEx growth was roughly 50% of our ARR growth. It was actually 46%. Looking forward, we're targeting FY '26 free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which reflects a 3-year free cash flow CAGR of approximately 20%. This factors in a continuous of operational discipline, it also factors in a hefty step-up in cash taxes, particularly in fiscal '25 and '26 due to global tax law changes and the depletion of our deferred tax assets.\nWe're focused on paying down our debt and while interest payments will increase in fiscal '24, we expect them to decrease in both fiscal '25 and $26 million. In summary, turning to Slide 27. First, we have a strong portfolio and strategy. We have a solid position in CAD with a long-term opportunity to disrupt this market with Onshape and Creo+. This year, we've expanded our category leadership in PLM which has become a technology backbone for digital transformation and industrial companies. The acquisitions of Codebeamer and Pure Systems significantly strengthens our ALM position, which is becoming increasingly important to our customers as their products add more software and complexity to their products. And the addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected Digital Thread capabilities across the full product life cycle.\nSecond, our strong execution. With organic growth at double-digit levels already, we're in the early days of a major on-premise to SaaS transformation driven by the evolving needs of our customers. but it's an oversimplification to focus only on SaaS as the one and only major driver of growth for PTC. The delivery model is important, but it all starts with our robust software portfolio that meets the needs of industrial product companies. We continue to benefit from cumulative layers of PTC specific growth drivers, including driving customer expansion through cross-selling our differentiated portfolio and PLM expanding beyond the engineering department and becoming an enterprise-wide system of record.\nFiscal '24 is forecasted to be our eighth consecutive year of double-digit constant currency ARR growth. Third, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade. We've been demonstrating that we're judicious with our investments, being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty. From a cost and operational perspective, we're lean and a continuous improvement mindset is part of PTC's culture.\nFourth, with organic ARR growth in the low teens, juxtaposed PMIs that are generally in the mid-40s, I trust you would agree we're actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. We're targeting solid top line ARR growth and bottom line free cash flow growth. And finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. And while I personally will miss Jim, I'm also excited to have Neil join the team and help continue to drive and evolve PTC. For sure, the environment around us will continue to change, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers.\nWith so many positive trends going our way, we continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to continue to create value for our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll pass it back to Neil for a couple of closing comments.\n\nNeil Barua\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining us and for your -- for the time today.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nActually, we're going to...\n\nNeil Barua\n\nWe're going to move to Q&A now, and then I'll give some closing remarks."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to PTC's 2023 Third Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Josh, and welcome to PTC's 2023 Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Barua, CEO Elect.\nToday's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date. July 26, 2023. And PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PTC, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. You probably noticed that we have some additional news regarding CEO succession to cover today. So I'll kick off with an overview of Q3, but skip the normal customer commentary to allow time for the succession discussion. I trust that many of you had a good chance to interact directly with customers at a recent LiveWorx event, and I hope that will carry you for a while.\nStarting with Q3 results then, I'm pleased to report that in Q3, PTC again delivered solid results. As you know, we feel that ARR and free cash flow are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. In Q3, we exceeded our guidance on both metrics, and today, we are again raising our full year ARR guidance midpoint as well as our full year guidance for free cash flow. As usual, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics, and Kristian will outline currency effects later in the call.\nStarting with the top line metric of ARR on Slide 4. In Q3, we came in at $1.868 billion which was above the high end of our guidance range and up 25% year-over-year. Organic ARR growth accelerated slightly to 14%. ServiceMax contributed the extra 11 points of inorganic growth to bridge us to the overall 25% growth rate. We passed the 1-year anniversary of acquiring Codebeamer, so we're now counting Codebeamer in our organic ARR results. Though the manufacturing PMIs continue to indicate a sluggish environment globally, our top line ARR continues to show good resilience. In Q3, we saw broad-based ARR strength across all product groups and geographies, and our churn results remain good.\nGiven strong year-to-date results, together with a solid pipeline and outlook for Q4, we're raising our full year ARR guidance midpoint. As I mentioned, Kristian will provide the details later.\nMoving to Slide 5 and switching to our bottom line view, we delivered $164 million of free cash flow in Q3, ahead of our guidance and up 46% year-over-year. Remember that ARR is the primary driver of cash flow. So this result was driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency. We raised our key free cash flow guidance for the year. Kristian will elaborate on that as well.\nTurning to Slide 6. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in the Americas was 29%. In Europe, ARR growth was 24%. And in APAC, ARR growth was 16%. On a global basis, FX was neutral to our year-on-year growth in Q3, but regionally, FX continued to be a growth tailwind in Asia, whereas it's a growth headwind in Europe. All 3 regions benefited from inorganic growth to varying degrees due to the acquisition of ServiceMax.\nSpeaking of ServiceMax, we saw our first cross-sell activity happened in the quarter. And while it's still quite early in the integration process, there is a nice cross-sell pipeline building, which bodes well for the future.\nNext, let's look at the ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 7. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 11% ARR growth in Q3 in a market that's been growing an estimated 7%. Within these results, the growth was primarily driven by Creo, but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape. PTC is clearly taking share in different parts of the CAD market with both products. In PLM, which includes those products that enable data and process management, our ARR growth rate in Q3 was 36% and or 16% organic with the incremental inorganic growth coming from ServiceMax. In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing an estimated 8% in core PLL.\nARR growth for PLM in Q3 was primarily driven by Windchill, supplemented by strong organic percentage growth in ALM and SLM. Clearly, we're taking significant share in the PLM market as well.\nTurning to Slide 8. I want to double-click on our ARR growth strategy because we've been fielding many investor questions regarding how we've been able to perform so well on the growth front as compared to peers, and whether this differential growth is sustainable. Some investors think we've shifted from 1 growth strategy to another over the years, but we see it very differently. In our view, we have consistently layered new growth strategies on top of existing growth strategies to create additional tailwinds that fuel faster growth. Let me explain.\nOur growth strategy starts at the bottom of the chart where we participate in CAD and PLM markets that are growing in the upper single-digit range. So that is our baseline. On top of this, our products are very strong competitively, which has allowed us to take some incremental market share and outgrow our peers. Then back in fiscal 2014, we launched our IoT business, which will be more than $200 million of ARR this year and continuing to grow at a rate that's accretive to company growth. Perhaps the single biggest driver of growth was unleashed in 2015 when we launched the full-on transition from a perpetual and maintenance model to a subscription business model. This was a short-term pain for long-term gain type of strategy, and I'm pleased to say the pain bottomed out in fiscal '17 and faded in fiscal '19 and and we've been enjoying the long-term gain and growth rate ever since.\nSimply put, a recurring model with sticky software creates much more growth than does a perpetual model even at the same level of new seed sales. That's why companies like PTC cross the valley of death to get there. You can refer to our FY '21 investor deck where we took investors through the math model that shows how much easier it is to grow a sticky recurring business model than a perpetual one. Following that, we put a strong focus on commercial improvements, such as improved churn, improved discounting and price optimization. And then redoubled our efforts in these areas when we entered the COVID and inflationary periods.\nCollectively, these improvements have created incremental tailwinds to company growth rates, and we think there's more to be done here going forward. We could have been satisfied to stop there, but we didn't. We saw the CAD and PLM markets beginning to pivot towards SaaS, which led us to acquire the peer SaaS Onshape and Arena businesses. These businesses continue to be growth tailwinds as the growth is accretive to PTC's overall growth rate.\nThen in fiscal '22, we decided to bring the SaaS phenomenon that was driving strong Onshape and Arena growth to our core CAD and PLM business, which we did using the Atlas platform that leveraged Onshape technology. This strategy allows us to land larger ARR run rates because we're selling both the software and the service to deliver it. And of course, now we can expand the existing on-premise customer base ARR run rates by shifting customers to SaaS and upselling to include the value of the delivery service the customer now gets from PTC.\nFrankly, this growth driver is in its early stages, and its impact is minor right now compared to what it promises to contribute in the coming years. Because we already enjoy strong growth independent of this SaaS driver, you should consider that SaaS is not our growth strategy per se, it's just another tailwind that helps in our quest to drive our growth rates higher.\nFinally, during fiscal '22 and '23, we made smart acquisitions like Codebeamer for the ALM part of our PLM strategy and ServiceMax for the SLM part of our PLM strategy. On a stand-alone basis, these businesses are growing faster than PTC. And of course, these growth tailwinds will increase as we further develop the cross-sell synergies we're pursuing. Cross-sell is already becoming meaningful for Codebeamer now and looks very promising for ServiceMax where we're still quite early in the process.\nSo when an investor asks what is driving the 14% organic growth that PTC is reporting this quarter? The answer really is all of it, except of course, ServiceMax, which is not yet factored into the organic calculation, but will be in a few quarters. For those who questioned whether this level of ARR growth is sustainable, I'd first like to point out that fiscal '23 will be the seventh consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth across good macro setups and bad. And indeed, ARR growth has generally been accelerating over that time as more of these growth drivers came into play.\nI'd also point out that several of these drivers should be more impactful going forward, whereas none of them show signs of fading away. The sluggish macro, no doubt has cost us a small amount of growth here in fiscal '23, but past history suggests we'll get it back when macro conditions improve. Bottom line is we feel very confident that PTC is positioned to deliver sustained double-digit ARR growth at or near the top of our peer group. Most importantly, please keep in mind that it is ARR, not revenue that drives free cash flow at PTC.\nOn the subject of free cash flow, then, let's turn to Slide 9 where I'd like to double-click on the dramatic increase in margins that we've been driving, which raises similar investor questions of how and for how long. Our strong margin expansion, best measured using our operating efficiency metric, starts with the bottom 4 strategies we've been driving for many years. The first and biggest expansion driver has been the mix shift from professional services to software.\nBefore this transformation, our revenue had a roughly 25% mix of low-margin professional services, whereas currently, we're at about 7% professional services mix on our way to a 5% mix thanks to the recent arrangement to sell a portion of our professional services business to ITCI in the form of DxP services. In turn, the large system integrator partner ecosystem we built has become a critical part of our growth strategy as SIs help create software demand in order to drive demand for their own services. We've been backfilling the low-margin services mix with high-margin software all along. And by the time we get to our 5% services mix target, the cumulative effect of this mix shift will be about 10 points of margin expansion.\nWe feel the negative impact to revenue growth from declining services revenue over the years has been more than justified by the positive impact of the higher profit software mix to our margins and free cash flow. Said differently, the quality of PTC's revenue has increased dramatically. At the next level, a second big driver of margin expansion has been our go-to-market improvements, which had dramatically increased the productivity of our sales force over the years. In particular, our development of a strong cross-sell muscle has been very helpful to sales productivity and naturally, we leverage this key strategy whenever we bring acquired products into the mix like Codebeamer and ServiceMax.\nThe third big driver in this group is our R&D offshoring program, which allows us to maintain relatively rich resourcing against more moderate spending levels. We tend to have a higher degree of offshoring than peers, and we have consistently proliferated this strategy across our portfolio and into acquisitions that we make.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, year-to-date R&D spending is around 16% of revenue, but R&D accounts for 37% of our employee base. Our largest offshore site is the PTC R&D center in India that will celebrate its 30th anniversary next year. So you can see we have an incredibly deep pool of talent and expertise there.\nThe fourth item to point out is the portfolio rebalancing, we do as part of our planning every year to ensure that our resources are best positioned to drive growth while maximizing profitability. This strategy essentially boiled down to driving low-growth businesses at very high margins while driving moderate growth businesses at good margins, thus reserving sufficient dry powder to invest more aggressively to develop new high-growth businesses like Onshape, all while retaining an attractive and expanding company margin profile.\nThe next layer, the margin strategy is to leverage the benefits of scale that a recurring subscription business offers. Because growth in ARR requires relatively little growth in terms of variable costs, we've been doing a good job following our rule of thumb that on average, our costs will rise at half the rate of ARR growth, helping to drive expanding margins year after year. The improving commercial discipline around churn, discounting and price optimization that I previously mentioned as a growth driver is obviously a margin driver, too, since our input costs are essentially the same independent of churn, discount and price levels. The incremental growth we get here comes at nearly 100% margin.\nFinally, the changes we made in fiscal '21 to align our field organization to SaaS organizational principles, Together with the operational rebalancing we did in fiscal '22 to better align spending with our growth outlook in IoT and ARR have been big margin drivers because they've allowed us to meet incremental resourcing needs without incremental hiring.\nOur IoT business, for example, now has mid-teens operating efficiency margins while being accretive to company growth. Similar then to what I said about ARR growth, the significant margin expansion we're delivering here in fiscal '23 is really due to all of the above factors. In my view, these gains are fully sustainable with more to come in the future. As Kristian and I have said previously, we expect our operating efficiency margin to expand to 40% by fiscal '25 and expect we can get to mid-40s longer term. So we continue to have a lot of runway here.\nMoving on to Slide 10 then. I'd like to discuss our plans for CEO succession. I feel the company is in great shape in terms of top line and bottom line growth with multiple layers of initiatives that can sustain this performance well into the future. I trust you see we're continuing to demonstrate the resilience of our business as our growth powers on while PMI trends in the wrong direction.\nSo for me, with more than 25 years under my belt now at PTC, half that time as CEO, I think it's a perfect time to think about putting a new generation of leadership in place that can sustain this high level of success well into the future. I love this company, and I'm very proud of all that's been accomplished during my time here, but life is calling me to a new chapter in following the succession I plan to retire from traditional management roles.\nPTC's Board has given careful consideration to who should be PTC's next leader and how we could best transition this person into the role to preserve our strategy and momentum. Our Board engaged Korn Ferry's CEO succession practice to determine what characteristics were most important in our next CEO and to vet our internal candidates and to consider external candidates. That careful process led us to an ideal successor in Neil Barua, the former CEO of ServiceMax.\nNeil is smart in articulate and he knows our industry. He's been a CEO twice already, yet still has a lot of career runway. He has a finance background, but really leans in with customers and product strategies. He's developed great followership within PTC already. And by the time, Neil become CEO, he will have spent more than a year coming up to speed as a PTC insider. We are set up to have a seamless transition that offers complete continuity in the company's strategy and performance. So effective now we've made a series of changes that initiate the transition process.\nI have been named Chairman and CEO and with plans for the CEO role to transfer to Neil on February 14, 2024, which is the date of our next Annual Shareholders Meeting. Neil has been appointed to the Board and has been given the title of CEO elect. Neil and I will work together over the coming 6 months to ensure Neil has ample opportunity to get to know our important customer, employee and shareholder constituencies and to transition my knowledge, relationships and responsibilities to him.\nGiven that I'm a nonindependent Chairman by definition, the Board has appointed experienced Director, Janice Chaffin, to be Lead Independent Director. Neil will inherit and be surrounded by an excellent team that fully supports him. Mike DiTullio, will continue to head our operations as President and COO. Kristian Talvitie will continue to head our financial strategy as CFO.\nLikewise, other PTC executives, such as our Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Legal Counsel and Chief Human Resources Officer, will remain in place throughout the transition and beyond. This transition should be very smooth. The bottom line is that the Board chose a great successor whom I fully endorse and who has the support of the entire team. I'm very happy for Neil and for myself, I might add, that we could find such an elegant way to transition PTC leadership into what promises to be an exciting and successful next phase for the company.\nWith that, I'd like to turn to Slide 11 and ask Neil to spend a few minutes introducing himself before we move back to Christian for additional commentary regarding results and guidance. Neil?\n\nNeil Barua\n\nExecutive VP & President of Service Lifecycle Management\n\nThanks, Jim. Hello to everyone listening. It's great to be on the call today. PTC is a terrific company, and it's an honor to be named PTC's next CEO. I want to thank the Board for running a thoughtful succession planning process and for the vote of confidence they placed in me. I've learned a lot about PTC since the ServiceMax acquisition 7 months ago, and I'm excited to continue learning from Jim, Mike, Kristian and the rest of the leadership team during the transition period.\nI want to personally thank Jim for all he has done for PTC for setting things up so well for me and the team and for the friendship that we've built. For those on the call who don't know me, I've been in the tech industry for nearly 25 years. I was CEO of ServiceMax for about 4 years before the acquisition by PTC. Prior to that, I was CEO of IPC systems for 4 years. Prior to IPC, I worked in the technology PE space as an operating executive at both Silver Lake and Francisco Partners.\nPTC is in a terrific position, and my top priority is continued execution. Over these last 6 months, I've seen firsthand how excited our customers are about our model-based closed-loop digital threat strategy and how critical our software is for their digital transformation journeys. I've also observed the talent and passion of our employees and the commitment they bring to our customers and partners. There is no other company like PTC, and I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and help take it to the next level.\nOver the next several weeks and months, I will be meeting and spending more time with our customers, employees, partners and investors. I'll be joining many upcoming investor and analyst meetings with Jim and Kristian and I look forward to meeting you. Jim, thanks again to you and the Board. Over to you, Kristian.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Neil. And let me start off by reiterating Jim's ringing endorsement. It's been great getting to know you, and I'm looking forward to working with you to drive customer and shareholder value.\nTurning to Slide 13. I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported. In Q3 '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.89 billion, up 25% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax, our ARR was $1.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. In Q3, our as reported ARR was $61 million higher than our constant currency ARR on a year-over-year basis, currency fluctuations were neutral to growth in Q3.\nAs Jim explained, our solid top line in Q3 was broad-based across all geographies and product groups. I'm sure many of you have been following the manufacturing PMIs due to the historical correlation with our top line when we operated a perpetual business model many years ago. The global manufacturing PMI peaked in December '21 and has been under 50 for almost a year now. The Eurozone PMI has been particularly weak.\nIn contrast to those trends, our top line, including in Europe, has continued to grow. Our subscription business model and low churn rates make our ARR resilient and demand for digital transformation continues across our customer base. In Q3, our ARR benefited from some timing, which we factored into our guidance for Q4. Naturally, we also took the outlook for bookings, churn, start dates, deferred ARR into account when we raised the midpoint of our fiscal '23 ARR guidance range.\nMoving on to cash flow. Our results were strong with Q3 cash from operations of $169 million and free cash flow of $164 million, coming in ahead of our guidance. This performance was driven by continued strong execution based on our foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. In addition, we had a net timing benefit of approximately $5 million in Q3. So keep that in mind as we go through our Q4 cash flow guidance in a few minutes.\nWhen assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter, and on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. Q3 revenue of $542 million increased $80 million or 17% year-over-year and was up 21% on a constant currency basis. In Q3, recurring revenue grew by $83 million partially offset by a $3 million decline in professional services revenue. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with Jim's mix conversation, including our strategy to transition some of our professional services revenue to DxP services, our partner for Windchill + lift and shift projects.\nAs we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation potential.\nMoving to Slide 14. We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $282 million. Our gross debt was $2.365 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 5.6%. During Q3, we paid down $180 million of debt. And at the end of Q3, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan and approximately $245 million drawn on our revolver. We have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction due in October 23 of $650 million of which $620 million is already reflected as debt on our balance sheet and $30 million of imputed interest will be reflected in our Q1 '24 cash flow.\nWe intend to fund this payment with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. The deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet, as I just mentioned, and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was 3x at the end of Q3. We expect to be at or below 3x levered by the end of Q4 and below 3x levered throughout fiscal '24. Given the interest rate environment, we continue to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal '23 and fiscal '24. We've paused our share repurchase program and expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares in fiscal '23.\nWe expect to have substantially reduced our debt by the end of fiscal '24 and will then revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nNext, Slide 15 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use FX rates as of September 30, 2022, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past 7 quarters. Based on exchange rates at the end of Q3 '23, our as reported ARR at the end of fiscal '23 would be higher by approximately $64 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance.\nWe report both actual and constant currency results and FX fluctuations can have a material impact on actuals. But remember that we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q3 and Q4, the impact to our as reported ARR would also change.\nWe believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 16. For all ARR guidance amounts, we are using our constant currency FX rates, which, again, are as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal '23, we expect constant currency ARR of $1.935 to $1.95 billion, which corresponds to constant currency ARR growth of 23% to 24%. We raised the low end of our guidance by $10 million. So the midpoint of our ARR guidance is up $5 million.\nOn cash flows, we are again raising our fiscal '23 cash flow guidance. We're now targeting cash from operations of approximately $605 million and free cash flow of approximately $585 million. As I pointed out last quarter, I think it's worth highlighting that we're raising our cash flow guidance for the year, while we have also been increasing investments in select growth opportunities for our business in the back half.\nThe important point is that the resilience of our business model enables us to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macro environment. In addition to that, as a baseline, we adjust shorter-term investments accordingly, given our business performance and outlook. The result is solid and consistent cash flow growth.\nWe maintain consistent billings practices, and we've optimized our processes around billings and payments over the past 2 to 3 years. Because of this, the quarterly seasonality of our free cash flow results has been very consistent over the past 2 years, and we're on track to deliver similar quarterly linearity in fiscal '23 as well.\nFor Q4, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $42 million. We expect approximately $2 million of CapEx in Q4, and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $44 million. Note, that we made acquisition and restructuring-related payments of $11 million through the first 3 quarters of the year, of which $3 million was paid in Q3. And we plan $11 million of payments in Q4, which we've also factored into our free cash flow guidance.\nGoing forward, we also plan to provide full year and quarterly guidance for both revenue and EPS. We continue to believe that revenue and EPS are not good measures of our business performance. And internally, we look at ARR as our primary top line metric and free cash flow as our primary bottom line metric. That said, the public scorecard is still often revenue and EPS. And while we have consistently met or beat on ARR and free cash flow over the past few years, we sometimes score a miss on revenue or EPS against metrics that we've not even guided to quarterly. So now we're going to start guiding to both revenue and EPS on a quarterly basis.\nThe EPS ranges we're providing are aligned with our revenue guidance ranges, which appropriately allow for a broad range of outcomes given ASC 606-related dynamics. For fiscal '23, we've narrowed our revenue guidance range and primarily due to FX fluctuations, we lowered our revenue guidance midpoint by $5 million. Our fiscal '23 revenue guidance range is $2.09 billion to $2.12 billion. And for Q4, we're guiding to $540 million to $570 million. As a reminder, ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription company. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term length.\nMoving on to EPS. For fiscal '23, we expect GAAP EPS of $2.14 to $2.45 and non-GAAP EPS of $4.07 to $4.38. For Q4, our guidance range is $0.47 to $0.77 for GAAP and $0.95 to $1.25 for non-GAAP. Since revenue is impacted by ASC 606, it's important to remember that earnings per share is also impacted.\nNow that I've taken you through our guidance, let's quickly review how our guidance has progressed this year on Slide 17. First, looking at ARR, as you'll recall, when we began fiscal '23, we had a constant currency ARR growth range of 10% to 14%, given the uncertain macro environment. There's no doubt that we're operating in a difficult macro backdrop. But even still, we've been able to deliver solid results, taking the low end up every quarter this year. And now with our fiscal '23 ARR guidance midpoint is for a 13% constant currency organic constant currency growth.\nAs we begin to think about next year, while we're not guiding fiscal '24 at this point. I think it's safe to assume that we will weigh our end market opportunity, pipeline, momentum and also try to consider the macro environment at the time. Assuming the current macro environment continues, I would not be surprised to see an ARR guidance set up similar to this year going into next year.\nAnd much like this year, I would think that we would expect to deliver a free cash flow result within our previously guided fiscal '24 range regardless of the ARR outcome for the year in [ macro ] environment will be more judicious with our spending and in a more favorable top line environment, we are likely to invest more in the business. Because of the stability of the business model, we have a lot of room to match run rate top line inflows or cash generation with run rate expense investments, which are primarily headcount, and COGS expenses related to SaaS delivery. I think we have proven that we will actively manage our investments in line with the macro and momentum -- business momentum we're seeing. Looking at our free cash flow guidance progression, we've been able to raise our guidance every quarter this year. We started the year guiding for 35% free cash flow growth and we're now guiding to 41% growth.\nTurning to Slide 18. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model. You can see our results over the past 7 quarters, and the column on the right illustrates what's needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q4 of fiscal '23. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is the sequential growth in Q4 of '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q4 '23 guidance range of $1.943 billion, we need to add $75 million of ARR on a sequential basis. This is $1 million less than the $76 million we added in Q4 of fiscal '22.\nAll things considered, we believe we've set our constant currency ARR guidance range prudently.\nSummarizing then on Slide 19. First, we have a strong portfolio and strategy. This year, we've expanded our clear category leadership role in PLM, which has become a technology backbone for digital transformation and industrial company. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle.\nSecond, our strong execution with organic growth at double-digit levels already. We're in the early days, but executing well against a major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. And as Jim explained, it's a massive oversimplification to focus only on SaaS as the growth driver for PTC. We continue to benefit from the cumulative layers of PTC specific growth drivers, including driving customer expansion through cross-selling our unique portfolio.\nThird, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade. We've been demonstrating that we're judicious with our investments, being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty, from a cost and operational perspective, we're lean and a continuous improvement mindset is part of PTC's culture.\nFourth, with the organic ARR growth in the low teens, juxtaposed against PMIs that are generally in the mid-40s. I trust you would agree that we're actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Our top line growth and bottom line profitability are approaching peer leadership levels.\nAnd finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. For sure, the environment around us will continue to change, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers. We're continuing to make progress towards our midterm guidance targets. In a challenging macro environment, we've been able to deliver solid ARR growth year-to-date in fiscal '23. We have confidence in continued double-digit ARR growth and our free cash flow target for fiscal '24 despite the macro uncertainty that continues to persist. We feel good about our midterm growth aspirations and cash flow targets as well.\nWith so many positive trends going our way, we continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive shareholder value. So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PTC 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSVP of IR, PTC Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Lisa, and welcome to PTC's Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com. During this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call, are valid only as of today's date, April 26, 2023, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames Heppelmann\n\nThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report PTC delivered strong results in our second fiscal quarter of 2023. As you know, we feel that ARR and free cash flow are the best metrics to assess the performance of our business. We exceeded our guidance on both metrics in Q2 and are at the midpoint, raising the full year guidance for both metrics. A reminder that as usual, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics, and Kristian will expound on currency effects later in the call.\nStarting with the top line metric of ARR on Slide 4. In Q2, we came in at $1.814 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range, and up 26% year-over-year. Top line strength was broad based across all segments and geographies. Bookings were solid in Q2, and our churn results were outstanding. Organic ARR growth was 13%, with ServiceMax and Codebeamer, contributing the extra 13 points of inorganic growth to bridge us to that 26% growth rate.\nGiven our strong first half results, together with a solid outlook for the second half, we are narrowing our full year ARR guidance range while slightly raising the midpoint. Kristian will provide guidance details later. Global PMIs continue to hover in the mid-40s to 50 range, suggesting the business environment remains challenging for industrial companies, but it does not appear to be getting much worse.\nDespite the sluggish macro, the solid organic bookings result we saw in Q2 was up nicely on a sequential and year-over-year basis, suggesting at this point that the softer booking result in Q1 was probably an anomaly within the normal range of bookings volatility rather than the beginning of a more sinister trend.\nWhile we did see continued booking softness in small and medium business and in China, this was offset by notable bookings strength in Europe and in the U.S., and in particular with Windchill and Codebeamer as well as with IoT and AR. Running counter to the SMB trend, Onshape had a record bookings quarter, helped in part by a large household name electronics company, making the decision to move away from SolidWorks and standardize instead on Onshape to gain the advantages of SaaS and agile product development.\nThis key win represents a notable milestone for Onshape. In our core business, we saw a higher mix of ramp deals from companies choosing to proceed with large strategic programs but wanting to ramp their deployments over multiple years. This buying behavior pushes more of the bookings into deferred ARR, which benefits fiscal '24 and fiscal '25 ARR growth more than it does fiscal '23. Deferred ARR is up sharply year-over-year.\nNaturally, we took the outlook for bookings, churn, start dates and deferred ARR into account when we adjusted our FY '23 ARR guidance. We landed a large and interesting PLM and ALM order from a European automotive OEM that included extension options for Windchill and Codebeamer to contemplate our relationship spanning 20 years.\nThe fact that an automotive OEM wants to understand commercial terms over the next 2 decades speaks to how sticky our software is. Clearly, they expect to have it for a while. A final top line observation is that organic growth arguably has a bit more momentum than the numbers on this slide suggests. That's because following the Codebeamer acquisition, our strategy has been to shift our organic ALM selling effort to the new Codebeamer technology platform. That strategy is working, and Codebeamer is doing exceptionally well.\nCodebeamer is now the ALM standard at several of the largest European and Asian auto OEMs and at numerous suppliers. But the consequence of this shift in sales strategy is that some of the ALM business we would have likely transacted organically is now scored as inorganic Codebeamer instead. We estimate that excluding the impact of this mix shift factor in Q2 would cause this slide to show organic growth at 14%, with inorganic growth at 12%. Codebeamer will become organic in Q3 when we pass the acquisition anniversary.\nMoving to Slide 5 and switching to our bottom line. We delivered $207 million of free cash flow in Q2, a record quarterly result that was ahead of our guidance and up 48% year-over-year. Note that in fiscal '22, we had $41 million of restructuring-related cash outflows for the full year, and $18 million in Q2. Excluding the impact of restructuring payments in last year's compare, we still delivered 31% year-over-year free cash flow growth in Q2, driven by a combination of strong ARR growth and higher operating efficiency due to disciplined cost management. We raised our free cash flow guide for the year. Kristian will elaborate on that, too.\nTo help you understand what's driving the big year-over-year increase in free cash flow, let me recap the margin expansion program that PTC management has been driving. First, I'll remind you that operating efficiency is our metric that measures the percentage of our billings that we're able to convert to cash flow each year. Margins have been expanding for many years now, but the organizational realignment we did at the end of fiscal '21, coupled with the resource rebalancing work we did during fiscal '22, have together created an organizational model for PTC that's efficient and sustainable. We delivered 300 basis points of expansion in fiscal '22.\nAt the midpoint of our fiscal '23 ARR guidance range, based on actions that are well behind us now, we expect our operating efficiency to expand by at least another 450 basis points this year. Looking back, while other companies were hiring like crazy, the proactive work we did to optimize our cost structure proved prescient and is generating exactly the results we promised. Given the trends at PTC, we do not anticipate any need for the type of layoffs or restructuring that we've seen in the tech world around us. Indeed, we're still hiring and investing in the business, albeit conservatively, which Kristian will discuss later.\nTurning to Slide 6. A large driver of this margin expansion is the natural result of putting the business model transition behind us, traversing the valley of death in fiscal 2014 through '19 caused PTC to defer revenue recognition while retaining the same spending levels, which made our reported margins look much worse than they fundamentally were. The short-term pain we endured during that transition is long gone. And now, we're enjoying the fruits of the long-term gain we were aiming for, which is a resilient business that's tracking toward peer-leading performance.\nThat's a good segue to Slide 7, where I'd like to share a view of PTC's combined top and bottom line performance in comparison to peers. Starting at the upper left, Autodesk recently showed this FY '23 Rule of 40 comparison at their Investor Day in March. Note that Autodesk definition of the Rule of 40 uses free cash flow margin rather than operating margin, which is probably a good way to look at it given ASC 606 accounting noise. I'd prefer to use ARR rather than revenue growth for the same reasons, but I realize that makes comparisons of actuals hard to do.\nSo for today's purposes, we will embrace Autodesk definition. That said, this chart showed PTC with an anemic 28% figure for fiscal '23, which didn't sound right to me given the margin expansion I just described. So moving to the upper right, our team looked up all the actuals to reverse engineer the Autodesk chart, and 2 things became clear: First, Autodesk has a strange fiscal calendar, where 11 of the 12 months of their fiscal '23 actually happened in calendar '22. Most of the companies in this analysis, including PTC, would say this is really a '22 comparison.\nSecond, there are some significant onetime factors involved here, too, because PTC's fiscal '22 cash flow was negatively impacted by the restructuring I mentioned, whereas Autodesk cash flow during this period was helped by their practice of billing multiyear subscriptions upfront, which they've since committed to move away from.\nPutting those points aside, obviously, the future matters more than the past. So it's interesting to consider the trajectory of companies in this peer group going forward. The 2 charts on the lower half of the slide have been created using consensus data pulled directly from FactSet. In the current year, based on strong growth and significant free cash flow margin expansion that PTC has been delivering, we're expected to move to the middle of the pack, while Autodesk recedes.\nNext year in 2024, based on continued growth and margin expansion, PTC is expected to lead this peer group in the Rule of 40 as Autodesk defines it. Of course, these are just consensus models and not actuals, but we're comfortable with the expectations shown here for PTC because they align to the midterm guidance ranges we provided at our November Investor Day. We'll plan to revisit this useful chart periodically to track how PTC is doing as compared to peers.\nTurning to Slide 8. Let's look at ARR growth by geography. ARR growth in Americas was 29%. In Europe, ARR growth was 25%. And in Asia Pacific, ARR growth was 19%. All 3 regions benefited from the acquisitions of ServiceMax and Codebeamer, albeit to differing degrees.\nNext, let's look at ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 9. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q2 in a market that's been growing an estimated 7%. Within these results, the growth was primarily driven by Creo, but supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape. Jay Vleeschhouwer recently noted in his research that Creo has been the fastest-growing major CAD system for 12 of the past 16 quarters. Onshape's growing at a considerably faster rate than Creo, so PTC is clearly taking shares in different parts of the market with both products. I feel we have a great hand to play in the CAD market.\nIn PLM, which includes those products that enable data and process management, our ARR growth rate in Q1 was 39% or 16% organic, with the inorganic growth coming from both ServiceMax and Codebeamer, Codebeamer having enjoyed a tailwind from the ALM mix shift factor I previously mentioned. In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing approximately 8% in core PLM, but more like 11% when you roll in the extended PLM categories of ALM and SLM. ARR growth for PLM in Q2 was primarily driven by Windchill, supplemented by strong percentage growth in Arena, IoT and SLM. PTC has a strong hand to play here, too. As clearly, we are taking significant market share in the PLM market as well.\nTurning to Slide 10. Now that 2022 is behind us, we thought it would be helpful to publish PTC's calendar year performance for those analysts who wish to make growth and market share comparisons on that basis. As you can see, calendar 2022 was a strong year for PTC, and it was our fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth in both our CAD and PLM segments.\nIn PLM, the addition of ServiceMax into our portfolio brings management of the customer's installed base of products into our product life cycle management offering and this significantly expands our category leadership. On a calendar 2022 basis, inclusive of the $153 million ServiceMax contributed on a pro forma basis, PLM revenue was $1.15 billion. ARR growth was strong at 20%, with organic at 18%, which suggests we're widening the leadership gap.\nIn Canada, results were all organic in calendar '22, and growth here, too, remains well ahead of the market. CAD revenue was $788 million in calendar '22, and the ARR growth rate was 10%. PTC's growth rate in CAD is best-in-class. So while we're not the category leader, given the differential growth rates, we are in the passing lane.\nTurning to Slide 11. In just a few weeks, we're hosting our big LiveWorx event on May 15 and 16 here in Boston. This is our flagship event dedicated to our customer and partner ecosystem, and we're also welcoming investors to join. It's a great way to network and learn firsthand all things PTC.\nThis year, we're excited to try a new approach to maximize the investor experience. In addition to having an exclusive investor lunch session on sustainability as well as an executive Q&A session, we have organized an immersive investor track, which will enable you to attend our main keynote and our spotlight sessions on ServiceMax, Windchill and Creo Plus sitting alongside our customers and partners. We will host a special demo tour for investors, and you'll be free to explore and learn more on your own, too. There will also be opportunities to network with our executive team, and our Board will be present as well. We would love to see you at LiveWorx. If you need registration details, please reach out to our IR team.\nOn Slide 12, one of the demos you can check out on the Windchill section will come from Fresenius Medical Care. Fresenius is the world's leading provider of products and services for individuals that need dialysis treatment. Fresenius produces dialysis machines in over 40 manufacturing facilities around the globe and also runs a network of over 4,000 dialysis clinics. There's a lot of inherent complexity in their product life cycle. Fresenius saw the opportunity to bring down treatment costs and improve their products by building a digital thread workflow across their engineering, manufacturing and service domains. Windchill was selected as the backbone to bring product data together and enable better collaboration across internal groups and with external partners.\nFresenius subsequently standardized on Creo, and has since adopted ThingWorx for smart connected products and for smart connected factories. Currently, they're exploring how they might leverage ServiceMax in that digital thread. Fresenius is a great case study that shows the breadth of what PTC technology can enable.\nFor another teaser on Slide 13, one of the demos you literally can't missing is the Komatsu wheel loader. It's big and yellow and weighs 30 tons. Using Creo and Windchill, Komatsu engineers and manufacturers equipment that customers use for decades in the field. Because Komatsu's aftermarket service business contributes significantly to their overall financial results, they've been investing in software to make the services business more efficient and productive. Komatsu has been using PTC service life cycle management software, including Servigistics since 2006 to optimize spare parts inventory, and Arbortext since 2015 to streamline the availability of service instructions.\nLast year, Komatsu expanded their investment in service technology by selecting ServiceMax. Komatsu purchased software independently from PTC and ServiceMax when we were still separate companies, but represents a good example of the type of customer where we think we can be successful cross-selling because they really appreciate that 3D model-based digital thread.\nKomatsu is also a poster child for my point that for every customer that ServiceMax currently has, PTC has 10 more that look like them, companies that use Creo and Windchill to produce products that have long service lives.\nSummarizing then on Slide 14. In fiscal '23, we're continuing to make good progress toward our midterm guidance targets. With solid first half results, we're well positioned to achieve our full year ARR and free cash flow guidance, which ticked upward this quarter. PTC has expanded our clear category leadership role in PLM, which has become a must-have technology backbone for digital transformation at industrial companies. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle.\nSecond, with organic growth at double-digit levels already, we're in the early days, but executing well against the major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind. You'll learn a lot more about our SaaS strategy at LiveWorx.\nThird, we have a well-earned reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade and the proactive changes we made are driving high levels of free cash flow growth through the midterm guidance period. Fourth, with organic ARR in the low teens juxtaposed on PMIs in the upper 40s, I trust you would agree we are actively demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Q2 bookings were solid and churn outstanding. Top line growth and bottom line profitability are approaching peer leadership levels, even in this challenging macro environment.\nAnd finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and a proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. I want to congratulate Mike DiTullio, who was promoted to President and COO in the quarter. Mike and I have decades of experience working together, and I'm very much enjoying this new division of labor. Congratulations also to Neil Barua, who was previously the CEO of ServiceMax and joined PTC as the President of our SLM business that combines ServiceMax with PTC's broader suite of service-related technologies and use cases. We're pleased to have Neil join the team and love what he brings to the business.\nWith so many positive trends going our way, I continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to create shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance.\n\nKristian Talvitie\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, PTC, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into it, I'd like to note that the non-GAAP results and guidance and ARR references I'll be discussing will be in both constant currency and as reported.\nTurning to Slide 16. In Q2 of '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.81 billion, up 26% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding ServiceMax and Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.63 billion, up 13% year-over-year. As Jim explained, our solid top line in Q2 was broad-based across all geographies and product groups. Our pipeline development also continued over the past 3 months in a solid and consistent way, and our outlook was steady all quarter long.\nIn Q2, our organic top line continued to show good resilience. I'm sure many of you have been following the manufacturing PMIs due to the historical correlation with our top line when we operated a perpetual business model. The PMIs have been soft over the past year, particularly in Europe, where factory orders have been down 11 months in a row and where the Eurozone PMI was a little over 47 in March. In contrast to those trends, our top line, including in Europe, has continued to grow. Our subscription business model makes our ARR resilient, and demand for digital transformation continues across our customer base.\nIn fact, Q2 was one of our best bookings quarters in Europe ever. On an as reported basis, we delivered 23% ARR growth, 11% organic. In Q2, our as reported ARR was $68 million higher than our constant currency ARR. Remember that for our constant currency reporting, we use rates as of September 30, 2022, for all periods, forwards and backwards. On a year-over-year basis, currency fluctuations were still a meaningful headwind in Q2 and for the entire first half.\nMoving on to cash flow. Our results were strong with Q2 cash from operations of $211 million, and free cash flow of $207 million, coming in ahead of our guidance. This performance was driven by continued strong execution based on a foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. When assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's always good to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter, and on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue.\nQ2 revenue of $542 million increased 7% year-over-year and was up 13% on a constant currency basis. In Q2, recurring revenue grew by approximately $40 million, partially offset by small declines in perpetual license and professional services revenue. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with our strategy to transition some of our professional services to DXP services, our partner for Windchill, plus lift and shift projects. And the decline in perpetual license revenue is consistent with our plan to continue transitioning Kepware to a subscription model over time. Kepware is the primary driver of the small amount of perpetual license revenue we have left.\nAs we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation.\nMoving to Slide 17. We ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $320 million. Our gross debt was $2.545 billion, with an aggregate interest rate of 5.4%. In Q2, in conjunction with the ServiceMax acquisition, we took out a $500 million term loan and increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion.\nAfter the new borrowings and $205 million of debt pay down in Q2, we had $1 billion in high-yield notes, a $500 million term loan and approximately $425 million drawn on our revolver at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, we have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction due in October of 2023 of $650 million, which consists of $620 million of debt and $30 million of imputed interest. We intend to fund this with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility.\nThis deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which was 3.4x at the end of Q2. We continue to be -- expect to be around 3x levered by the end of Q4, and below 3x throughout fiscal '24. Given the interest rate environment, we expect to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal '23 and fiscal '24. We've paused our share repurchase program. And in fiscal '23, we expect our diluted share count to increase by approximately 1 million shares.\nWe expect to substantially reduce our debt by the end of fiscal '24, and we'll then revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return 50% or so of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases, while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nNext, Slide 18 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use rates as of September 30, 2022, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past 6 quarters.\nBased on exchange rates at the end of Q2 '23, as reported ARR in Q3 '23 would be higher by approximately $70 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance, and fiscal '23 in as reported ARR would be higher by approximately $73 million compared to our constant currency guidance midpoint.\nWe report both actual and constant currency results, and FX fluctuations can have a material impact on actuals. But remember, we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q2 '23 and the end of Q3 '23, the impact to our as reported ARR would also change.\nWe believe that constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. Given the continued volatility in FX that we've seen over the past few months, I thought it would be useful to update our ARR sensitivity rule of thumb on Slide 19. Using FX rates at the end of Q2, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro to USD rate would be about $40 million positive or negative, and the impact of a JPY 10 change in the U.S. dollar to yen rate would be about $9 million, again, positive or negative. In addition to the dollar, we transact in euro, the yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. And of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 20. For all ARR guidance amounts, we're using our constant currency FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2022. For fiscal '23, we expect constant currency ARR growth of 22% to 24%, which corresponds to a fiscal '23 constant currency ARR guidance range of $1.925 billion to $1.95 billion. We raised the low end by $15 million and lowered the high end of our ARR range by $10 million. So the midpoint of our ARR guidance is up a few million dollars.\nI'm going to circle back on this on the next slide to provide a little more context. For Q3, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be in the range of $1.845 billion to $1.855 billion. At the midpoint, this equates to 24% constant currency growth. On cash flows, we are again raising our fiscal '23 cash flow guidance. We're now targeting cash from operations of $600 million and free cash flow of $580 million. I think it's worth pointing out that we're raising our cash flow guidance for the year while also increasing investments in select growth opportunities for our business in the second half of fiscal '23.\nThe important point here is the resilience of our business enables us to maintain core long-term investments even in a turbulent macro environment. In addition to that, as a baseline, we can adjust our shorter-term investments accordingly given our business performance and outlook. The net result is solid and consistent cash flow growth. We maintain consistent billing practices and we've improved our processes around collections and payments over the past 2 to 3 years. Because of this, the quarterly seasonality of our free cash flow results has been very consistent over the past 2 years, and we're on track to deliver similar quarterly linearity in fiscal '23 as well.\nAs in the past 2 fiscal years, we ended the halfway point of fiscal '23 at approximately 65% of our full year cash flow target. For Q3, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $155 million. We expect approximately $5 million of CapEx, and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $160 million.\nMoving to revenue guidance. For fiscal '23, we expect revenue of $2.08 billion to $2.14 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 8% to 11%. ASC 606 makes it fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths.\nNext, on Slide 21. We've taken you through a lot of details. So I think it's important to step back and give you a high-level perspective. We'll use the slide that we showed on our Q4 '22 call as a basis to do this. The initial guidance range and scenarios we provided on our Q4 '22 call is at the bottom half of this slide. We started the year providing a range of ARR outcomes that included organic bookings anywhere from up 5% to down 15% on a year-over-year basis and churn anywhere from flat to worse by 100 basis points. On the top half of the slide, you can see a summary of the current guidance range. As you can see, we've narrowed the guidance from our initial range of $60 million at the start of the year to our current range of $25 million at the midpoint.\nIn short, since Q4 of fiscal '22, we've taken the bottom end of the ARR range up by $25 million and taking the top end of the range down by $10 million, along with the adjustment for ServiceMax we made at the time of close. So basically, based on our first half performance and the outlook for the second half, we've taken the initial low-end scenario for ARR off the table, which called for an organic bookings decline of 15% and for churn to increase. Our organic bookings growth was solid in the first half, and we expect flattish organic bookings for the full year. We've also continued our strong organic churn performance, and we've actually seen an improvement of about 50 basis points in the first half. And while we continue to guide to flat churn for the year, we think this may be conservative.\nThere are a lot of factors that could impact where we end the year in terms of ARR and just to be clear on the major factors they include: first, whether organic bookings are flat or a little better or a little worse than that. Second, how inorganic bookings perform also matters. The scenarios we're showing on the bottom half of the page only contemplated organic bookings. In addition to flattish organic bookings, we expect total bookings growth on a year-over-year basis, supported by bookings from ServiceMax and Codebeamer.\nThird, whether churn comes in flat or continues on the trend of slight improvement we've seen in the first half. Fourth, we saw in Q2, in particular, increased customer interest in ramp deals. These are multiyear contractual commitments from customers where the ARR increases during the contractual term. In practice, what this means is that the amount of ARR we get in year 1 is smaller than the exit run rate, which is what creates deferred ARR for us. These are great deals in the sense that they demonstrate significant customer commitments to PTC. And with low churn rates we have, these deals bode well for future ARR growth. And lastly, it probably goes without saying that the difference in timing of booking a deal and when the contract term actually begins, matters as well. We count the booking when we sign the contract, but ARR and revenue start only when the contract term begins. We have consistently called this out as a factor in ARR, especially in Q4 when we may sign a contract in Q4, but for a variety of reasons, it doesn't actually start until Q1.\nThis also can create deferred ARR for us, but it's just short-term deferred and the timing difference is generally measured in days or weeks. A lot of moving parts for sure, but the net result of all of this is that we've raised the midpoint of our ARR guidance by approximately $8 million from when we started the year.\nOn the free cash flow side of the equation at the beginning of the year, we said we thought $560 million was a good target regardless of the ARR outcome as we would moderate or increase spending based on the environment as we saw it. As you know, we were cautious on spending and hiring in the first half, and that has served us well. We're comfortable increasing the target to $580 million for the year. given the results in the first half and the outlook for the back half. While there is a tailwind from FX to be expected for the year, I'll remind you that FX rates in the first half are still below the FX rates for the first half of last year. So we've not really seen much of a year-over-year benefit from FX thus far this year.\nAnd I'll also remind you, we generate about 65% of our free cash flow in the first half. But if FX rates hold for the second half, we should see some pickup. That said, this will be offset by higher-than-anticipated interest rates and the increased investments we're making in select growth opportunities, namely Codebeamer, Windchill Plus and Atlas in the back half, and this is all factored into our current guidance.\nHopefully, this slide helps clarify at a big picture level, how we've performed through the first half and our expected range of outcomes for the back half. Summing all this up, in the first half of fiscal '23, we've been demonstrating the resilience of the model and the stickiness of our solutions or said another way, the value that customers are getting from our solutions in an uncertain macro environment. On the top line, we think the combination of flattish organic bookings compared to record bookings last year with additional growth coming from our more recent acquisitions and churn that is flat to improving is a compelling outcome in a difficult macro.\nOn the bottom line, we're continuing to be judicious with our investments. being mindful of both long-term opportunities and near-term macro uncertainty.\nTurning to Slide 22. Although we're not providing separate guidance on ServiceMax, I thought it would be helpful to summarize the financial disclosures we made on ServiceMax in one place for you. These are the same numbers we provided previously with 1 exception. Since we focus on software ARR, we updated the geographic region chart to show the expected ARR mix instead of the expected revenue mix. As part of PTC, ServiceMax continues to trend toward the numbers we gave you.\nTurning to Slide 23. We Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for the back half of the year. You can see our results over the past 6 quarters -- and the 2 columns on the right illustrate what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '23 because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparisons are the sequential growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q3 '23 guidance range of $1.85 billion, we need to add $36 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis.\nThis is $7 million less than the $43 million we added in Q3 of fiscal '22. And in percentage terms, we need 2% organic sequential ARR growth to hit our guidance midpoint for Q3, which is at the lower end of what we've delivered over the past 6 quarters. Next, to hit the midpoint of our full year guidance range of $1.938 billion, we need to add $88 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis in Q4. While this is $12 million more than we added in Q4 of fiscal '22, we expect previously deferred ARR and sequential ARR growth from ServiceMax that we didn't have in Q4 of '22. We expect these 2 things will more than compensate for the additional $12 million sequential increase when compared to Q4 of '22. All things considered, we believe we've set our Q3 '23 and full year constant currency ARR guidance ranges prudently.\nTurning to Slide 24. I'll conclude my prepared remarks today by highlighting that we prepared for a storm, and we're demonstrating resilience in the midst of one. For sure, the environment will continue to change around us, and we will continue to adapt accordingly while still pushing the envelope of what we can do for our customers.\nFrom a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies and R&D at those companies tends to be quite resilient. So we have a supportive top line backdrop. We also have a subscription business model and our products are very sticky with our customers. Given our results in the first half and the pipeline and outlook for the second half, we expect to deliver flattish organic bookings in fiscal '23 in comparison to record bookings in 2022. We also expect our ARR growth in fiscal '23 to benefit from incremental ServiceMax and Codebeamer contributions. And on the top line, we conservatively expect flattish churn from the already strong level of churn at the end of fiscal '22.\nJust as importantly, from a cost and operational perspective, we are lean, having already battened down the hatches a while ago. In addition to the cost optimization work we did last year, we slowed planned hires and backfills in the first half of fiscal '23. We're well positioned to deliver on our updated cash flow targets for the year. And now at a time when many other technology companies are cutting costs, we're capitalizing on the strength of our business model and outlook by increasing investments selectively in long-term growth opportunities.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PTC 2023 First Quarter Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSVP of IR, PTC Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Rob, and welcome to PTC's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike DiTullio, President of our Digital Thread Group. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will be making forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Actual information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call, are valid only as of today's date, February 1, 2023, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, CEO, Member of National First Executive Advisory Board & Director, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to report that despite seeing some incremental macro softness, PTC delivered a solid first quarter to kick off fiscal '23. On the top line metric of ARR, we came in at $1.603 billion, which was above the high end of our range and up more than 15% year-over-year. The strength was broad-based across all product groups and geographies. Organic ARR growth was 14%, with Codebeamer then contributing that extra point of inorganic growth. The strong Q1 ARR results put the company in a position to narrow our original 10% to 14% full year ARR guidance to 11% to 14% as we feel that the 10% outcome has become increasingly implausible with a solid Q1 behind us.\nSwitching to our bottom line metric of free cash flow, we delivered $172 million ahead of our guidance and up 28% year-over-year. We raised our free cash flow guidance for the full year by $15 million. Currency had little impact to free cash flow in Q1, but it is expected to be incrementally helpful as the year progresses.\nOn the subject of currency, I'll remind you that Kristian will cover the ongoing effects of foreign exchange fluctuations later in the call. So to simplify things, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results when discussing top line metrics.\nTurning to Slide 5. Shortly after our first quarter close, we completed the acquisition of ServiceMax. ServiceMax is not included in the Q1 results we reported, though we did incur some acquisition-related costs that we're a headwind to our nevertheless strong free cash flow results in Q1. With the deal now closed, ServiceMax will be included in our guidance going forward.\nTo recap the highlights of this business as now part of PTC, ServiceMax is used to manage the service processes for high-value, long life cycle products. Think of products like an MRI machine in a hospital, a machine tool in a factory or pumping equipment at a refinery. This has always been a sweet spot for PTC, and we have many customers matching this profile.\nReferring to the infinity diagram on Slide 5, many of you know that PTC's logo represents the interplay of physical and digital, and that logo provides a good way to explain the fit with ServiceMax. The digital part of our logo refers to when products are under development. At this point, they exist in a purely digital form, which is authored in Creo and managed in Windchill.\nBeing purely digital at this stage, products are easy to change and highly configurable. Each time our customers get an order, their factories take a configuration of the digital product data that matches the order and use it as the recipe to produce the physical product, which is then delivered to the end customer. That's where the physical part of our logo fits in. Physical products are very different. If you want to change them, for example, you need to dispatch a truck to the customer site, carrying a technician and spare parts. Spare parts are managed in our Servigistics software. The technician will need access to similar types of digital product information as what the factory used when creating the product. This service information is created using Arbortext and Vuforia.\nHigh-value products are operated by the customer for years or even decades. These products require regular service to keep them up and running, and this service is typically provided by the manufacturer who views the recurring service contracts and spare part sales as a highly desirable source of revenue and profit. ServiceMax helps the manufacturer manage their entire installed base of physical product instances and orchestrates all the necessary service activities. By monitoring the installed base of products, ThingWorx adds a lot of value to ServiceMax because it allows service to be more proactive and preventative in nature. And sometimes the service can even be done remotely, thereby canceling the need for a truck roll.\nAs you can see, ServiceMax has great synergy with Creo and Windchill because, on one hand, the service process consumes the digital product data created in engineering in the form of parts catalogs and service instructions. And on the other hand, the service process is the primary source of feedback that drives ongoing product improvements through engineering change orders, or ECLs.\nWindchill serves as the system of record for the digital definition of all possible product configurations, and ServiceMax serves as the system of record for the actual physical instances of products that exist, each of which may have a slightly different configuration. As the infinity diagram implies, there is a digital thread of product information flowing between these key systems in both directions throughout the product life cycle. Aligning ServiceMax with PTC's various offerings will lubricate this flow of data, creating tremendous business value. No competitor has a solution comparable to this.\nEqually important, as the service system of record, ServiceMax knits together our existing SLM products, allowing PTC to now offer the industry's first truly comprehensive offering for service management optimization. You can think of our new SLM offering as a hub-and-spoke model with ServiceMax as the hub and PTC's various other service solutions as spokes.\nFor example, ThingWorx IoT connects to and monitors the vital signs of installed products to enable preventative remote service. Arbortext dynamically publishes technical service information to match each product configuration in the installed base. Vuforia AR enables this technical service information to be augmented onto each installed product to make service technicians more productive. And Servigistics allows customer service level agreements to be met while carrying the smallest possible inventory of spare parts. With the acquisition now closed, work is underway to enable deeper integration between ServiceMax and these various PTC offering.\nI'm pleased to announce that Neil Barua, the CEO of ServiceMax, is joining PTC and will preside over this expanded SLM business that now exceeds $300 million of combined ARR. Neil and team will unveil a broad, new SLM vision at our LiveWorx conference in May. And based on the number of inquiries we're getting, I expect it to be one of the highlights of the conference.\nThe strategic fit with ServiceMax is excellent, and we're excited about the synergies we can generate by cross-selling from engineering to service and vice versa and also cross-selling between our various SLM offerings within the service domain. The financial fit is excellent too as the transaction is expected to be accretive to PTC's growth rate as well as the PTC's cash flow, and this drove part of today's guidance raises.\nServiceMax also increases PTC's total addressable market. The ServiceMax business has been growing in the mid-teens, which is a few points faster than the market, but we see potential for the business to accelerate to high-teens growth over time as synergistic cross-sell opportunities are realized.\nTurning to Slide 6. Given the elevated focus on profitability that investors all share in today's market, I want to reiterate the margin expansion program that PTC management has been driving. The organizational realignment we did at the end of fiscal '21 and the resource rebalancing work we did during fiscal '22 have created an organizational model for PTC that's both highly efficient and fully sustainable.\nWhen we made these changes, we were not addressing a problem per se but simply pursuing margin expansion opportunities that we had identified. The actions we took proved prescient as we're now well-positioned for a macro downturn. While many notable tech companies are announcing layoffs to come to terms of bloated cost structures, thanks to our proactive actions, we're entering this period of uncertainty with a very lean cost structure, and we do not anticipate any need for layoffs or restructuring.\nIn Q1, non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 36% compared to 35% a year ago. That sounds like progress, but due to ASC 606 noise, it doesn't fully capture the full magnitude of improvements we've made. We prefer to assess our margin progress by focusing on a more meaningful metric we now call operating efficiency. Operating efficiency is the same metric that we previously called cash contribution margin, but we're changing the name of the metric to be more precise that it is an operating metric, not a non-GAAP financial measure. This is a change in name only. The metric is still calculated the same way and still measures how much of our billings we're able to convert to cash flow each year.\nAt the midpoint of our ARR guidance range, based on actions already taken, we continue to expect this operating efficiency to expand by another approximately 450 basis points in fiscal '23, following the 300 basis point improvement we delivered last year. The significant operating efficiency improvement, when layered on top of double-digit ARR growth, is what drove the strong Q1 free cash flow result and is what will drive the 38% free cash flow growth we're guiding to for fiscal '23. Kristian will elaborate further.\nTurning to Slide 7. As you're aware, our FY '23 ARR guidance range has, from the start, contemplated the possibility of a potential macro downturn. In Q1, we saw further signs of a downturn in the form of incrementally softer bookings. At the same time, we were comforted by strong renewals, which actually improved slightly year-over-year, reinforcing just how sticky our software is.\nThe net impact of these softer bookings and stronger renewals was a slowdown of about 0.5 percentage point from last quarter's 16% ARR growth rate, taking the Q1 ARR growth rate down to about 15.5%. This was obviously less than we had allowed at the high end of our Q1 ARR guidance range, so ARR results landed $3 million above the range. The softness was relatively consistent across various dimensions of the business, suggesting it was macro related rather than any type of competitive issue.\nThe summary is that after posting 15.5% growth in Q1, we remain well positioned to perform against our financial targets and indeed, have raised our guidance accordingly.\nTurning to Slide 8. With Q1 behind us, as compared to our original guidance, we're now on track to deliver ARR growth results within a narrower 11% to 14% range in fiscal '23, with the low end having been raised because the 10% outcome is less plausible now given that solid Q1. Keep in mind, the addition of ServiceMax to our portfolio happens here in Q2, and the inclusion of ServiceMax will recalibrate the ARR growth range upward. In a few minutes, Kristian will outline a new guidance range that's essentially 11% to 14%, plus 1,100 basis points more from ServiceMax added on top.\nAcross this range of ARR outcomes, we've also raised the original cash flow guidance we provided a quarter ago by $15 million to $575 million, which now represents 38% growth for the full year. The raise is powered in roughly equal parts: by a strong free cash flow result in Q1, the expected $5 million benefit from the ServiceMax acquisition and improving foreign exchange rates. Should exchange rates hold or further improve, FX could prove incrementally helpful as the year progresses. Kristian will elaborate on the various factors involved here, too.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's look at ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth in the Americas was 16%. In Europe, ARR growth was 15% despite the Russia exit in Q2 of last year which still affects the growth rate given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. ARR growth in APAC was 12%. Across all geographies, the largest ARR growth in terms of magnitude was driven by continued strong demand for Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products.\nIn the Americas, we saw the strongest ARR percentage growth in IoT, Arena, Windchill and Onshape. In Europe and APAC, the growth rate was highest for Arena, which has been expanding outside the U.S. Arbortext and Servigistics both delivered strong growth rates in Europe and APAC. And finally, in Europe, Onshape and augmented reality also delivered strong percentage growth.\nNext, let's look at the ARR performance of our product groups on Slide 10. In CAD, which is those products that enable authoring of product data, we delivered 10% ARR growth in Q1 in a market that has been growing approximately 8%. Within this, the growth was primarily driven by Creo supplemented by strong percentage growth in Onshape and Arbortext.\nIn PLM, which includes those products that enable data management and process orchestration for product development, our ARR growth rate in Q1 was 20%, or 18% organic, with strong growth across all geographic regions. In PLM, we continue to significantly outperform the market, which has been growing approximately 12%.\nHalf of our Q1 growth was driven by Windchill, but ALM, including Codebeamer, and Arena, IoT and retail PLM, also contributed to great Q1 PLM results by delivering strong percentage growth.\nI'd like to discuss Windchill+ in the context of a new logo customer on Slide 11. Given the importance of our SaaS transformation program as a growth driver, I'm pleased to see good progress ramping up the new multi-tenant Windchill+ solution. While it's still early, across a combination of new logo deals as well as lift-and-shift SaaS conversions, we now have about a dozen Windchill+ customers in production, or headed there shortly, with dozens more opportunities in the pipeline. As we said at our Investor Day, we expect an S-curve type of ramp over multiple years for our Plus offerings. And thus far, we're tracking well to that expectation.\nTo share a customer story, we landed a new logo deal with a well-known motor sports company. That's a great example of an organization that's reaping the benefits of the streamlined PLM implementation experience that Windchill+ offers. This customer has committed to enter a new racing circuit but faces a tight time line to get prepared. Their team needed a PLM system to be in place quickly because they're designing a more efficient power unit that needs to be completed and tested in short order. And then as usual, there'll be a steady diet of changes and improvements thereafter.\nWith their Windchill+ implementation, the motor sports company achieved a production ramp-up time of several months, including integration with their hybrid SaaS ERP system. They got there so quickly by leveraging the out-of-the-box capability of Windchill+ delivered by PTC to the customer as a secure preconfigured service. This customer has no dedicated IT team, so leveraging SaaS applications is important to enable them to keep their internal efforts focused on racing while improving collaboration across team members in the field and around the globe.\nAs a reminder, Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger Plus strategy, and you'll see us follow with Creo+ and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY '23 and beyond. We are aiming to launch Creo+ and the bigger Plus strategy at LiveWorx in May.\nI'd like to share another customer anecdote to help you better understand the immense power of our technology. Turning to Slide 12, I want to tell you about an important project from our customers at the U.S. Department of Energy. I trust you saw the mid-December news that, for the first time, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed. This major scientific breakthrough happened at Lawrence Livermore's National Ignition Facility and may pave the way to a future filled with clean energy.\nThe National Ignition Facility, or NIF, is essentially a massive machine of enormous size and complexity. The NIF is a precision-engineered system of systems that generates and then directs 192 powerful laser beams onto a pencil eraser-sized area that heats to millions of degrees to ignite the nuclear fusion reaction. The sports stadium-sized NIF machine is all modeled in Creo and Windchill, everything they say, except the walls and the bathrooms. With 3.5 million components, we believe the NIF is the largest Creo and Windchill assembly ever made and, very likely, the largest assembly ever modeled in 3D CAD, which is a real testament to the power of our technology.\nDuring our regular collaborations with DOE teams over many years now, PTC product teams have been challenged to further develop our products to enable such highly advanced projects in what has proven to be a mutually beneficial relationship.\nWhile substantially more work lies ahead in the effort to harness the potential of fusion energy, as demonstrated by the NIF, we're very proud of the role that our technology has played in enabling this early breakthrough. And the announcement was exciting for many PTC employees who have been involved, including me. PTC may very well prove to play a key enabling role in the ultimate ESG breakthrough.\nSummarizing then on Slide 13. While in Q1, we saw incremental signs of a macro slowdown, there's a lot going our way right now. First, PTC has established itself as the clear category leader in PLM, which has become a must-have technology backbone for digital transformation at industrial companies. We just posted another quarter of 18% organic PLM growth, well ahead of market peers. We are conquering the PLM market. The addition of ServiceMax further extends what was already a unique portfolio of interconnected digital thread capabilities across the full product life cycle, and ServiceMax is expected to be a tailwind to ARR and free cash flow right from the start. Both Codebeamer and ServiceMax will provide a big boost to our PLM conquest efforts.\nSecond, while the company growth is at a double-digit level already, we're in the early days but executing well against a major on-premise to SaaS transformation that should provide a multiyear growth tailwind.\nThird, we have a reputation for driving margin expansion that goes back more than a decade, and the proactive changes we've already made are driving high levels of free cash flow growth again this year.\nFourth, we're demonstrating that our business model is very resilient. Top line growth and bottom line profitability are at levels that are amongst the best in our industry peer group. Not many peer companies are projecting the double-digit organic top line and 38% bottom line growth that PTC is guiding to this year.\nAnd finally, we're led by a team that has deep expertise and proven ability to drive growth and margin expansion. We're happy to welcome Neil Barua to the PTC executive ranks because Neil and the entire ServiceMax team share the same depth and passion for the business that's so important here in the PTC culture.\nWith so many positive trends going our way, I continue to believe PTC has a tremendous opportunity to create shareholder value even in the face of a macro downturn we've all been expecting.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported.\nTurning to Slide 15. In Q1 '23, our constant currency ARR was $1.6 billion, up 15% year-over-year and exceeded guidance. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.59 billion, up 14% year-over-year.\nAs Jim explained, our top line strength in Q1 was broad-based. We're executing well against our strategy, and we're continuing to improve upon the strong market position that we have. Our SaaS businesses saw continued solid ARR growth in Q1 as well.\nOn an as-reported basis, we delivered 11% ARR growth, 10% organic, due to the impact of FX headwinds. Currency fluctuations were positive in Q1 of '23, and our as reported ARR was $60 million higher than our constant currency ARR. However, on a year-over-year basis, currency fluctuations were still a meaningful headwind.\nMoving on to cash flow. Our results were strong, with Q1 coming in ahead of our guidance across all metrics. While it was great to see favorable FX movements during Q1, there was no impact to free cash flow from FX. Our free cash flow performance in Q1 was driven by strong execution based on a foundation of solid collections and cost discipline. Our cash from operations also came in ahead of guidance by $11 million due to a combination of free cash flow outperformance and the timing of capital expenditures, which were $9 million in Q1 compared to our guidance of $5 million.\nWhen assessing and forecasting our cash flow, it's important to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter and, on an annual basis, free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue.\nQ1 revenue of $466 million increased 2% year-over-year and was up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In Q1, recurring revenue grew by $12 million, perpetual license revenue grew by $5 million and professional services revenue declined by $9 million year-over-year. The decline in professional services revenue is consistent with our strategy to transition some of our professional services talent and revenue to DxP, our partner for Windchill+ lift-and-shift projects.\nAs we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue is the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but we'd rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation.\nBefore I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin as I did last quarter. Compared to Q1 '22, our non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 100 basis points to 36% in Q1 of '23. We continue to caution that because revenue is impacted by ASC 606, other derivative metrics, such as gross margin, operating margin, operating profit and EPS, are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning that we're benefiting from the work that we've done to optimize our cost structure in fiscal '22.\nOn a year-over-year basis in Q1, we continue to grow our top line at a faster rate than our spending and delivered significantly higher ARR and free cash flow.\nMoving to Slide 16. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $388 million. Our gross debt was $1.36 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 4.3%.\nLooking forward, in Q2, in conjunction with the ServiceMax acquisition, we took out a $500 million term loan and increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.25 billion. The net of new borrowings and debt pay down in Q2 should leave us with $1 billion in high-yield notes, the $500 million term loan and approximately $450 million drawn on the revolver at the end of the quarter.\nAs a reminder, we also have a second payment for the ServiceMax transaction due in October 2023 of $650 million. We intend to fund this with cash on hand and our revolving credit facility. This deferred payment is included in debt on our balance sheet and is factored into our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We expect our debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.4x at the end of Q2. We should be around 3x levered by Q4 and below 3x throughout fiscal '24 and into fiscal '25 as we continue to pay down debt.\nTo help you with your models, in fiscal '23, as it relates to cash flow, we expect total cash interest payments of approximately $85 million. And as it relates to the P&L, we expect interest expense of approximately $125 million.\nGiven the interest rate environment, we expect to prioritize paying down our debt in fiscal '23 and '24. We'll pause our share repurchase program. And in fiscal '23, we expect our diluted share count to increase by a little under 1 million shares.\nWe expect to have substantially reduced our debt by the end of fiscal '24, and we'll then revisit the prioritization of debt paydown and share repurchases. Despite this interruption, our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, remains to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nNext, Slide 17 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section, on the top half of the slide, we used FX rates as of September 30, 2022, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how currency dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as-reported ARR over the past 5 quarters.\nExchange rates continued to move materially in Q1 '23, causing a difference between constant currency ARR results and our as-reported ARR results. Based on the exchange rates, at the end of Q1 '23, our as-reported ARR in Q2 of '23 would be higher by approximately $62 million compared to the midpoint of our constant currency guidance, and fiscal '23 as-reported ARR would be higher by approximately $67 million compared to our constant currency guidance midpoint.\nWe report both actual and constant currency results, and FX fluctuations can obviously have a material impact on actuals. But remember that we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q1 and in the end of Q2 '23, the impact to our as-reported ARR would also change. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes currency fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative.\nGiven the sharp moves that we've seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb on Slide 18. In addition to the U.S. dollar, we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. Using currency rates at the end of Q1, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro-to-USD rate would be $39 million, positive or negative, and the impact of a JPY 10 change in the USD-to-yen rate would be $9 million, again, positive or negative. And of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 19. For our ARR guidance amounts, we're using FX rates as of September 30, 2022. The previous guidance shown on this slide is from our November 2022 Investor Day presentation and includes ServiceMax.\nFor fiscal '23, we expect constant currency ARR growth of 22% to 25%, which corresponds to a fiscal '23 constant currency ARR guidance range of $1.91 billion to $1.96 billion.\nThis narrowed range is based on 2 primary factors. First, we took up the bottom end of the 10% to 14% guidance range we provided on our Q4 earnings call, which excluded ServiceMax. While we saw some incremental macro-driven booking softness in our first quarter, this was partially offset by better-than-planned churn, and our guidance contemplated the potential for a much bigger impact than what we saw, and we actually finished $3 million above the high end of our Q1 '23 ARR guidance range. So based on our strong Q1 results and forecast for the year, while still being mindful of the macro environment, we feel comfortable taking up the lower end of the range, which still allows for continued softening due to the macro environment.\nSecondly, the other update to guidance is adding approximately $170 million for ServiceMax compared to our Investor Day assumption, which was for approximately $175 million.\nThere's a few reasons we're doing this, which include: first, ServiceMax' fiscal quarters ended 1 month later than ours. As we all know, the final month of a quarter in a software company is really when the magic happens. So while I think that ultimately, their results will align with PTC's quarter-end hockey stick, I also think it's prudent to assume it may take a few quarters to align selling and customer buying behavior.\nSecond, as you know, salesforce.com is a go-to-market partner with ServiceMax for its Asset 360 product. Salesforce just announced a fairly sizable reduction in force. And while we do not know if or how this may impact ServiceMax business in the coming months, we feel it's a valid concern which we want to account for in our guidance. And third, frankly, the uncertainty of the macro environment applies to ServiceMax as well.\nSo it's primarily for these 3 reasons that we're derisking the ServiceMax guidance for fiscal '23 and adding $170 million to our now updated 11% to 14% guidance range. With a strong Q1 behind us and given our pipeline and forecast and how we've set our guidance ranges, we believe we're well positioned to achieve our fiscal '23 ARR guidance. Note that we expect modestly more deferred ARR to become ARR in fiscal '23 than in fiscal '22. And our churn in Q1 was lower than planned. In dollar terms, churn was actually lower in Q1 '23 than it was in Q1 '22, and that's against a bigger base of ARR.\nFor Q2, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be in the range of $1.79 billion to $1.81 billion. At the midpoint, this equates to 25% constant currency growth. I'll discuss our Q2 guidance in more detail on the next slide.\nOn cash flows for fiscal '23, we raised our guidance. We now expect cash from operations of approximately $595 million, up 37%; and free cash flow of approximately $575 million, up approximately 38%.\nCompared to the guidance we provided a quarter ago, our updated $575 million target for free cash flow factors in our strong execution and results in Q1, $5 million from the ServiceMax acquisition, which we already communicated at our Investor Day, as well as an increase from FX tailwinds for the remainder of the year. Assuming we hit our Q2 free cash flow target, we'll be at approximately 65% of our full year target, similar in the past 2 years.\nOur CapEx assumption for fiscal '23 is $20 million. Therefore, relative to our free cash flow guidance of $575 million, we're guiding to cash from operations of $595 million.\nFor Q2, we're guiding to free cash flow of approximately $200 million. We expect approximately $5 million of CapEx in Q2, and therefore, our cash from operations guidance is approximately $205 million.\nAs you model the quarters of fiscal '23, keep in mind, we expect the quarterly distribution of full year cash flow results to follow a similar pattern as in fiscal '22 and fiscal '21, with over 60% of cash flow in the first half of the year and Q4 being our lowest cash flow generation quarter.\nMoving on to revenue guidance, which we raised from our November 2 guidance, primarily because of ServiceMax and currency. For fiscal '23, we expect revenue of $2.07 billion to $2.15 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of 7% to 11%. ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence, the wide range. More importantly, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of term lengths.\nTurning to Slide 20. Here is an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q2 '23. You can see our results over the past 9 quarters, and in the far right column, we've modeled the midpoint of our Q2 constant currency ARR guidance range. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant compare is Q2 of '22.\nThe illustrative model indicates that, to hit the midpoint of our Q2 '23 guidance range of $1.8 billion, we need ServiceMax ARR of approximately $160 million, which is what we said at Investor Day and believe is a reasonable target. On top of the ServiceMax contribution, we need to add $37 million of organic ARR on a sequential basis. This is $19 million less than the $56 million we added in Q2 of fiscal '22. In percentage terms, we need 2% organic sequential ARR growth to hit our guidance midpoint for Q2, which is at the lower end of what we've delivered over the past 9 quarters.\nAll things considered, we believe we've set our Q2 '23 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently.\nTurning to Slide 22. I'll conclude my prepared remarks today by highlighting that we're prepared for a storm and expect to be resilient in the face of one. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies. And R&D at those companies tends to be quite resilient, so we have a supportive top line backdrop. We also have a subscription business model, and our products are very sticky with our customers.\nJust as importantly, from a cost perspective, we've already battened down the hatches. In addition to the cost optimization work we did last year, we've already slowed planned hires and backfills as we head into Q2. Nevertheless, as we've said in the past, we don't have a Pollyanna-type view when it comes to the macro situation. We have a strong track record of disciplined operational management. And if the macro situation gets meaningfully worse, you can expect us to moderate our spending further to better align spending with market realities and mitigate the impact on our fiscal '23 cash flow results.\nFor example, variable compensation would automatically adjust. And depending on the magnitude of the downturn, we would also be incrementally more cautious on hiring and marketing spend, travel, et cetera. On the other hand, if the macro situation improves and/or if the dollar weakness continues, this would be favorable for our cash generation. And in that scenario, we would have the optionality to invest more aggressively in our business.\nThere's no question that the macro environment is hard to predict. Nevertheless, we've completed one strong quarter of fiscal '23 and are positioned to continue producing attractive financial results based on our strong product and market position, coupled with solid execution and prudent financial management.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PTC 2022 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSVP of IR, PTC Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Angela, and welcome to PTC's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release.\nThe forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, November 2, 2022, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, CEO, Member of National First Executive Advisory Board & Director, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PTC delivered an outstanding fourth quarter, which capped off a record year in fiscal '22. Our top line metric of ARR and bottom line metric of free cash flow both came in above the guidance ranges we issued 90 days ago.\nExecution was strong throughout fiscal '22 as full year results align well to the growth and margin expansion strategies we outlined at last December's Investor Day. Relative to top line and bottom line metrics, across both absolute and relative improvement measures, fiscal '22 was PTC's best year in decades.\nBefore I dive in, I'd like to point out that Kristian will cover the ongoing effects of the strong dollar later during his section of the call. So to simplify things, I'll focus my discussion on constant currency results where applicable.\nTurning to Slide 4. ARR and free cash flow results for Q4 were very strong and the strength was broad based across all segments and geographies. On particular note, we saw organic ARR growth continue at the accelerated pace of 15%, driven by strong performance across the board in Digital Thread - Core, Digital Thread - Growth, FSG and Velocity.\nOur Codebeamer acquisition had another strong quarter and contributed 1 point of inorganic ARR growth, taking PTC's total ARR to $1.71 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Our top line ARR growth was helped by the lowest churn the company has seen in many quarters, even better than last quarter. Organic churn, excluding the impact from Russia, improved by 193 basis points, well better than the 100 basis points we guided to at the start of the year.\nDespite churning the entire Russian business, churn was lowest in Europe for both Q4 and the full year. Price increases provide a helpful tailwind to renewals globally, but the underlying gross churn improvement is what has carried the day all year long. Fiscal '22 was the fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth for PTC. It was also the second consecutive year of 16% ARR growth. But take note that the organic element of that growth mix has accelerated by 300 basis points from 12% in fiscal '21 to 15% in fiscal '22.\nPer our guidance, we expect to post a sixth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth in fiscal '23 even after a considerable allowance for a potential macro slowdown. Free cash flow in Q4 was $29 million, ahead of our guidance. Free cash flow for fiscal '22 was $416 million, above our guidance and up 21% year-over-year despite an approximate $30 million or 700 basis points headwind due to the impact of FX on our operations. Including $53 million of payments primarily related to our restructuring from a year ago and fees related to acquisitions, adjusted free cash flow was $468 million.\nNext, on Slide 5. I want to reflect on the margin expansion initiatives we pursued over the past year, including both the restructuring related to our SaaS pivot announced a year ago, and the portfolio resource optimization we discussed on the last call. Both programs have proven very successful because, against the backdrop of a rocky economy, we achieved about 3 percentage points of cash contribution margin expansion in fiscal '22, while simultaneously accelerating organic ARR growth rate by about 3 percentage points as well. That's 6 points of expansion against a Rule of 40 type measure in a single year. We expect the ongoing effect of these profitability initiatives to lead the further cash contribution margin expansion in fiscal '23.\nWith the restructuring costs behind us and cash contribution margins expanding on double-digit ARR growth, we're expecting to drive free cash flow up about 35% to the $560 million level in fiscal '23.\nMoving to Slide 6. Despite the scary headlines we continue to read every day, we saw record demand for our offerings in the fourth quarter. While we again experienced some macro-related softness in smaller deals, notably in Europe, and some softness in China, these factors were offset by the strength in PLM, SaaS and larger deals.\nAs we previewed on the last call, organic bookings were up low single digits from a blockbuster Q4 last year, setting new record highs in Q4 and for fiscal '22. Q4 bookings were up 30% sequentially from the strong Q3 level, which reflects typical seasonality. Bookings growth was strong in both the digital thread and Velocity units.\nThe recent Codebeamer acquisition continues to perform exceptionally well with Q4 wins at a large German automaker, a large semiconductor company and a large Korean automaker, among others.\nTurning to Slide 7. In Q4, we again saw a strong ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth for the Americas was 17%. In Europe, ARR grew 16% despite the Russia exit in Q2, which still affects the growth rate given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. ARR growth in APAC was 13%.\nAcross all geographies, the largest ARR growth in terms of magnitude was driven by continued strong demand for our Creo CAD and Windchill PLM products within Digital Thread - Core. We saw the strongest ARR growth in terms of percentage across all geographies for Velocity. With our cloud-native Onshape CAD and Arena PLM products continuing to grow multiple times faster than the market rate.\nNext, let's look at ARR performance of our business units, starting with the Digital Thread on Slide 8. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread - Core, we delivered another strong double-digit growth performance in Q4 with 14% ARR growth. Within this, CAD again grew low double digits, while PLM accelerated to 19% growth as Windchill continues to be a hot seller.\nQ4 represents the 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit ARR growth that we've seen in the core CAD and PLM business. In Digital Thread growth, which is IoT and AR, growth sustained the 19% ARR growth rate, and we were just a smidgen short of rounding up to that 2 handle growth rate goal we were hoping for. Close enough in my view.\nThingWorx DPM had a decent quarter, including a nice expansion deal from a customer who first purchased DPM last quarter. FSG posted great results again in Q4, growing 9% organically and 19% inclusive of Codebeamer.\nTurning to Slide 9. On the SaaS transformation front, we landed several Windshields deals including our first few lift and shift SaaS conversions with our partner, DXP Services. The SaaS transition program is right on track. Our win at Raymond Corporation illustrates the value proposition of Windchill+. Raymond Corp. is owned by Toyota Industries, and they make a wide variety of forklift trucks, pallet jacks and warehousing products. Raymond conducted a study and found that with our Windchill+ SaaS solution, they can drive substantial savings in total cost of ownership while avoiding the burden of maintaining the software system themselves. Raymond is now enabling their distributed workforce with Windchill+.\nA reminder that Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy, and you will see us follow with Creo Plus and other similar premium SaaS offerings in fiscal '23 and beyond. We're aiming to launch Creo Plus and this bigger Plus strategy at LiveWorx in May.\nTurning to the Velocity business on Slide 10. Year-over-year ARR growth for the Velocity unit maintained the accelerated rate of 29% we saw last quarter with Onshape and Arena, again, each growing multiple times faster than their respective market. Arena continues to mirror the PLM strength we see with Windchill and the mid-20s growth rate of Arena that we've seen throughout fiscal '22 is more than 10 percentage points higher than Arena's pre-acquisition growth rate had been. Both Onshape and Arena have been great acquisitions for PTC.\nThe strength of these businesses, which are the cloud-native pioneers in our industry gives us confidence that the future of our market will be SaaS, and the shift to SaaS will create strong growth tailwinds for PTC for years to come.\nLet's turn to Slide 11 and talk about the future. Given the strength we've seen in our business throughout fiscal '22 juxtaposed against the likelihood of a more difficult macro situation that is said to be headed our way but has not yet arrived in a meaningful way, it's a real challenge to tell you with precision how our business will perform in fiscal '23. But because of our recurring model, the fact that our software is very sticky, and key to the digital transformation efforts that industrial companies around the world are pursuing, we think that the range of likely outcomes is fairly narrow at 10% to 14% ARR growth. Therefore, it's most likely that we'll see ARR growth in the double-digit range again in fiscal '23.\nAt the high end of our 10% to 14% ARR organic growth guidance for fiscal '23, we would be looking at only modest bookings growth and no further improvement in churn, both somewhat disappointing outcomes versus the strength we've seen in fiscal '22. At the midpoint of the guidance range, we're looking at no growth at all in bookings, plus 100 basis points more churn.\nAt the low end of the guidance range, we're looking at a 15% decline in bookings all year, plus the 100 basis points more churn. We feel that these are the most plausible outcomes for fiscal '23. But I want to be completely clear that as we sit here today, we have no indication whatsoever that bookings will actually decline or the churn will actually increase. We are simply adding a prudent safety factor to our guidance range, so we're all prepared for a downturn should it happen.\nWhile we don't foresee even worse outcomes and thus have not included them in our guidance range, for the sake of illustration, a 30% decline in bookings all year, plus the 100 basis points more churn gets us to 7% ARR growth. And just to demonstrate the amazing resilience of our model, note that it would take a massive 75% year-over-year bookings decline on top of 200 basis points more churn to get to flat year-over-year ARR growth.\nBut even then, free cash flow, which shows solid growth given cash contribution margin improvements already implemented, the restructuring payment that are now behind us and the spending austerity we'd surely implement in response to a downturn of that magnitude. Bottom line is that we're very confident that the resilience of our model ensures strong fiscal '23 results.\nWhile a potential macro downturn is on everybody's mind, the foreign exchange rates we're already experiencing is a bigger factor in our fiscal '23 free cash flow projections. The $560 million target for free cash flow correlates both to an ARR growth slowdown and to the very strong dollar that we're currently experiencing.\nAt today's foreign exchange rates, which are the most unfavorable in 2 decades, the $560 million of free cash flow in fiscal '23 includes a roughly $60 million headwind versus what the same free cash flow would be at given our fiscal '22 plan rates. The $560 million remains within the $550 million to $600 million free cash flow range we established back in 2019 when the world looked very different. But I trust you can see, if not for significant FX headwinds we would, in fact, be guiding to a free cash flow number above that 2019 range due to the underlying strength in our business.\nKeep in mind that because our customer contracts are recurring, the same dollars flow through the system year after year. While FX is a big headwind now, if exchange rates return to a more normal range in the future, then the headwind would dissipate and free cash flow would trend back toward the higher level of performance.\nOn the other hand, if today's FX rates become a permanent new normal, then we'll give consideration to other strategies like regional pricing changes to compensate. Obviously, the company is very well positioned. And while we're allowing that the macro situation could slow us down somewhat versus our true potential in fiscal '23, our strategy is clearly working, our execution has been stellar and our resilient business model means we're positioned to produce attractive and differentiated performance in our top line ARR and bottom line free cash flow metrics, no matter what scenario unfolds.\nI shortened my typical customer anecdotes today because I want to save time to discuss the new IR reporting model that we're adopting as we transition into fiscal '23. Let's move to Slide 12. As most of you know, with the Codebeamer acquisition landing in FSG last quarter, suddenly, FSG has become a growth business, which doesn't really match our original conception of FSG as a low-growth cash cow. In fact, with Digital Thread - Core growth and FSG segments, all growing mid-teens or better, our current reporting model yields little insight into our growth drivers.\nIn thinking through what to do with FSG, we realized that the current segmentation also doesn't map very well to our strategy and it doesn't map at all to industry market segments, which makes competitor performance comparisons difficult.\nWorst yet by fragmenting parts of our PLM business across Digital Thread - Core where Windchill lives, FSG where our Retail Flex PLM business is based on Windchill lives and Velocity where we have Arena, our IR reporting structure has obfuscated our strong market position in PLM.\nGiven how our business has evolved, we feel the current reporting model no longer serves any of us very well and it's time to evolve it too.\nTurning to Slide 13 to address these challenges going forward, we've decided to adopt a simpler reporting model of CAD and PLM and to be completely transparent in how we're recasting our business into this model. I've already discussed last year's growth rates using the existing 4 segments of Digital Thread - Core growth in FSG plus Velocity.\nOn Slide 13, you'll see how the prior segments mapped to the new segmentation model. The mapping is more simple than it appears. If we are referring to using a computer to aid in designing product information then it is computer-aided design, or CAD. If we are referring to aggregating product data and databases and managing the processes to interact with it across the product life cycle, then its product life cycle management or PLM.\nYou can see that if we recast last year into the new model, then inside a $1.71 billion ARR company, growing 16% last year, we had a $756 million ARR CAD business, growing 11% and a $950 million ARR PLM business growing 20%. In case it helps with competitor comparisons, total revenues were $1.137 billion for PLM and $796 million for CAD in fiscal '22. This new reporting model maps much better to our analysts and competitors view the world.\nYou can also see how we'd allocate PTC's 10% to 14% ARR growth guidance for fiscal '23 using the old model, and how those same growth allocations would then map to the new model. In the old IR segmentation model, we would have guided Digital Thread - Core to grow 10% to 14%, Digital Thread - Growth to grow 15 (technical difficulty) FSG to grow 5% to 10% and Velocity to grow 20% to 25% in fiscal '23.\nI trust you find that all to be quite reasonable and consistent with the high level of the ranges correlating to fiscal '22 actuals in the low end of the range, leaving room for macro slowdown. In the new model, that same 10% to 14% company growth maps to CAD growing 8% to 10% and PLM growing 12% to 17%.\nPlease view this bridge from the old model to the new model as a onetime event because starting with the next earnings call, we will report using only the new CAD and PLM IR segmentation model. It will make things much easier for all of us.\nTurning to Slide 14. I want to briefly remind you that while we're adopting a new reporting model, it is certainly not a new strategy. I trust it might even feel a little familiar to you. Indeed, we've always been clear that it was our PLM strategy that led us to acquire Servigistics, ThingWorx, Arena, Codebeamer and others. We have said that at each step of the journey. You might even remember me saying IoT is PLM and introducing the closed-loop PLM language back when we acquired ThingWorx.\nPerhaps you even remember a few years back, we had a reporting category of extended PLM that included PLM, ALM and SLM. We've been pursuing a broad PLM vision for years and have made tremendous progress. Now we want to put it on display. We probably need a drum roll now because this reporting model unveiled some really great news on Slide 15 that's been true for some time, but masked by our reporting structure.\nAs the new segmentation clearly reveals, with $981 million of PLM software revenue, I'm ready to declare that PTC has become the clear category leader in the hot PLM market. Using apples-to-apples definition similar to that of competitors, PTC is easily #1 globally in terms of scale, ahead of #2 Siemens and #3 Dassault by some distance. Note that total PLM revenue at PTC is more than $1.1 billion when you include services, but being a software company, we think it's most appropriate to focus on software.\nWith a growth rate well ahead of these competitors in recent years, we are rapidly widening the leadership gap. A primary reason why we've been outpacing the market for years is because of the uniquely compelling PLM portfolio we've built. But a second key reason is that we transitioned to a subscription business model years ago, whereas competitors remain largely perpetual in nature. While the valley of death, which slowed PTC's growth for years, has faded in our rearview mirror, it lies ahead for these competitors should they attempt to transition to our business model. That would only open the software revenue gap further.\nThe takeaway is that just as surely as Dassault leads in CAD and ANSYS leads in simulation, PTC leads in PLM. 5 consecutive years of PTC's accelerating PLM growth demonstrates that PLM supports a very attractive growth rate. I feel confident PTC can and will build on a strong leadership position in this great market segment for years to come.\nTurning to Slide 16. Today, we're guiding the first quarter and full year of fiscal '23. At our virtual Investor Day just 2 weeks from now, we'll give you a bit more insight into our business strategy and operations in fiscal '23 and then guide how we expect that to play out across a longer period through fiscal '25. I don't want to preview that content today, but I think you'll like where the company is headed as we continue performing while transforming as we've consistently done over the past decade.\nThen a bit farther down the calendar, we hope you'll join us here in Boston for LiveWorx 2023 on May 15 and 16 of next year, where you have an opportunity to dive deep into all things PDC. LiveWorx will afford investors ample opportunity to interact with management, employees, customers and partners. Please block off both events on your calendars.\nWrapping up my part then on Slide 17. As I reflect on fiscal '22, demand remained strong all year, and we've seen only minor signs of a macro slowdown. Accelerating growth and expanding margins prove our strategy is working well, and strong execution has driven our top and bottom line performance to levels that are amongst the best across our industry peer group.\nTransitioning into fiscal '23, I'm excited about the opportunities to do even better as we push ahead with our SaaS and margin expansion initiatives. We're watching diligently for changes in the demand environment, and feel well prepared for whatever lies ahead. Because of our business model and spending discipline, we expect to deliver solid top line growth and robust bottom line growth across any of the more plausible macro scenarios. I continue to believe the company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to Kristian for his more detailed commentary on financial results and guidance.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported.\nTurning to Slide 19. In fiscal '22, our ARR grew 16% on a constant currency basis and exceeded guidance. On an organic constant currency basis, excluding Codebeamer, our ARR was $1.61 billion, up 15% year-over-year. As Jim explained, our top line strength in Q4 was broad-based. We're executing well against our strategy, and we're continuing to improve upon our strong market position.\nOur SaaS businesses across our digital thread and Velocity groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q4. On an as-reported basis, we delivered 7% ARR growth, 6% organic, due to the impact of FX headwinds, which were $134 million, substantially higher than the approximately $85 million of FX headwinds that we would have expected assuming Q3 ending exchange rates and at the midpoint of our guidance for Q4.\nMoving on to cash flow. Despite the FX headwinds, our cash flow results were strong, with Q4 and full year results coming in ahead of our guidance across all metrics. Solid collections performance and slower hiring helped to offset the incremental headwinds that materialized in Q4. And for the full year, our restructuring cost controls and above planned perpetual license revenue, primarily from Kepware also helped to offset the FX headwinds.\nWhen assessing and forecasting our free cash flow, it's also important to remember a few things. FX rates were more favorable in the first half of fiscal '22, and the majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter, and free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue. In fiscal '22, FX fluctuations created a headwind of approximately $30 million to our free cash flow results.\nQ4 revenue of $508 million increased 6% year-over-year, and fiscal '22 revenue was $1.933 billion, up 7%. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. On a constant currency basis, our Q4 revenue was up 12% year-over-year, and our fiscal '22 revenue was up 11%.\nBefore I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin as I did last quarter. We continue to caution, because revenue is impacted by ASC 606, other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin, operating profit and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning that we're benefiting from the work that we've done to optimize our cost structure. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 300 basis points to 38% in fiscal '22.\nMoving to Slide 20. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $272 million. Our gross debt was $1.36 billion with an aggregate interest rate of 3.9%. During Q4, we repaid $75 million on our revolving credit facility.\nRegarding our share repurchase program, as we've communicated previously, we completed $125 million of repurchases at the front end of this fiscal year. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nNext, Slide 21 shows our ARR by product group. In the constant currency section on the top half of the slide, we use rates as of September 30, 2021, to calculate ARR for all periods. You can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past 8 quarters. I provide a reminder on the previous call that when we set ARR guidance for fiscal '23, we would be providing that at the September 30, 2022 FX rates and restating history assuming those rates. Let's turn to that now.\nHere on Slide 22, we show the new reporting categories that Jim took you through with historical ARR results recasted using our FY '23 plan rate for all periods. We post a set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as these ARR tables. For comparative purposes, the constant currency historicals are at FY '23 plan rates and should be used when forecasting PTC's constant currency ARR results.\nThis is important to consider in the context of our guidance because we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q4 and the end of Q1, that would be reflected in our as-reported ARR. We believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative.\nGiven the sharp moves in FX that we've seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb here on Slide 23. And as you can see, in addition to the U.S. dollar, we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. Using our Q4 FX rates, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro would be approximately $38 million positive or negative and the impact of a JPY 10 change would be approximately $7 million, again, positive or negative. And of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base.\nTurning to Slide 24. Since most of the sell-side forecasts have been built, assuming September 30, 2021 rates, I thought it would be helpful to provide this slide as a reference point before I take you through our actual guidance on Slide 25. Slide 24 illustrates what our guidance would have looked like if calculated using our fiscal '22 plan rates. The year-over-year growth rate for ARR is the same 10% to 14% that you'll see on Slide 25. However, the absolute values for ARR are higher given the FX rates versus the FY '23 plan rates.\nFor revenue, the actuals we report and the guidance we provide are on an as-reported basis, not on a constant currency basis. For illustrative purposes, this slide shows our fiscal '22 revenue on a constant currency basis, assuming our fiscal '22 plan rates. On this basis, the illustrative year-over-year growth rates for fiscal '23 are about 6% higher than the comparable numbers you'll see on the next slide.\nThe range of revenue growth is lower on Slide 25 because our reported revenue is based on monthly FX movements rather than a point in time set of rates, and we faced some tough comps in fiscal '23, particularly in the first half of the year.\nWith that, I'll take you through our guidance on Slide 25. Today, I'll focus on FY '23 and Q1. In a couple of weeks when we have our Investor Day, we'll focus more on the medium term. For all ARR guidance amount, we're using our fiscal '23 plan rates, the rates as of September 30, 2022.\nFor fiscal '23, we expect constant currency ARR growth of 10% to 14%, which would make this the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. This corresponds to fiscal '23 constant currency ARR of $1.73 billion to $1.79 billion. Churn is a key component of our ARR guidance, and we significantly outperformed our churn guidance in fiscal '22 and ended the year with organic churn at 5.6% using our fiscal '22 plan rates.\nOur medium-term target, as stated back in 2019 was to get to the 6% level by fiscal '24, and we achieved this earlier than expected. Going forward, I think there's still room to improve our churn rate, but at the same time, I want to be cognizant of the macro environment, and that's the rationale behind keeping our churn assumption essentially flat for fiscal '23.\nNext, on cash flows. For fiscal '23, we expect free cash flow of approximately $560 million, up about 35% and adjusted free cash flow of $562 million, up about 20%. This includes an estimated $60 million of headwinds caused by FX impacts on our operations as compared to FY '22 FX rates.\nOur fiscal '22 restructuring is substantially behind us. So the difference between free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow is small for fiscal '23. Our CapEx assumption for fiscal '23 is approximately $20 million, and therefore, relative to free cash flow guidance of $560 million, we're guiding for cash from operations of $580 million. In a few minutes, I'll take you through an illustrative FY '23 free cash flow model in more detail.\nMoving on to revenue guidance. For fiscal '23, we expect revenue of $1.91 billion to $1.99 billion, which corresponds to a growth rate of negative 1% to positive 3%. ASC 606 makes revenue fairly difficult to predict in the short term for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. And remember, revenue does not reflect cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths.\nIt's worth taking a few minutes to explain this. So let's go on a short detour from guidance and turn to Slide 26. This slide shows a hypothetical example with 10 contracts and different assumptions for 4 variables: software type, which can be either on-premise subscription, perpetual support or cloud/SaaS; number two, upfront recognition percentage. To keep this model simple, we'll just assume that 50% of the on-premise subscription total contract value is recognized upfront under ASC 606. To be clear, this varies by company and even by product within each company. But here, we're just trying to keep this simple to illustrate the point.\nNumber three, term length. This example uses term lengths ranging from 1 to 4 years and 4 contract size. This is really total contract value or TCV. In this example, TCV ranges from $1,000 to $4,000. But note, all of these contracts have the same ARR of $1,000.\nMoving to Slide 27 for certain contract types, namely SaaS and cloud and on-premise support contracts, revenue recognition is ratable over the term of the contract. For these contracts, term length and contract value do not have impact on revenue recognition and revenue aligns with ARR on an annual basis. You can see this here with $250 being recognized every quarter.\nOn the next slide, Slide 28. Here is an example of a 1-year on-premise subscription that renews annually. Due to ASC 606, half of the contract value is recognized as upfront revenue and the remaining half is recognized ratably over the contract term. Since this is a 1-year subscription, revenue aligns with ARR on an annual basis. However, on a quarterly basis, there is a difference because of the upfront revenue recognition was $625 in the first quarter and $125 in the next 3 quarters.\nTurning to Slide 29. Here, we're highlighting an example of a 4-year on-premise subscription. Again, under ASC 606, half the contract value is recognized as revenue upfront. However, ARR and cash invoicing are both done on an annual basis. In this example, the amounts would be 1,000 per year. In contrast, as this example shows, we would recognize $2,000 of revenue upfront, and the remaining $2,000 will be recognized ratably over the 16 quarters of the term.\nMoving to Slide 30. The graph compares ARR and revenue for these 10 hypothetical contracts over a 12-year period. Over the 12 years, this model assumes no growth, no price increases nor churn. There's no changing of term lengths, no migrating from support to on-premise subscription or from on-premise subscription to SaaS. Of course, as you know, we actually have programs in place that actively drive each of these dynamics, but it would be much too complicated to start adding these kinds of dynamics into this super simple example.\nThe green line, which is ARR, appropriately shows flat business performance, 10 contracts at $1,000 each for $10,000 in ARR each year, 0% growth. Whereas the blue line, which is revenue, shows a lot of volatility from year-to-year. Revenue growth rates vary from negative 33% to positive 69% in any given year. And again, while this example is overly simplistic, hopefully, you can see why we keep saying that you can't really look at revenue to understand the underlying performance of our business, nor is it helpful when trying to understand free cash flow dynamics.\nWhat is important to remember is that over the term of the contract, over the term of each contract, every dollar of ARR becomes $1 of revenue. However, how and when revenue is recognized is dependent on the mix of contracts starting and/or renewing in any given year and can vary significantly from period to period. And you can imagine what happens to margins and EPS under this kind of scenario.\nNext, on Slide 31 is the conclusion. Due to ASC 606, the revenue trend is noise for companies like PTC that sell on-premise subscriptions. But the point here is, don't worry because free cash flow is really a function of ARR. And this is why we focus on ARR and free cash flow and believe it to be the best way to assess our fundamental business performance.\nNow returning from that fun side trip to guidance on Slide 32. For Q1, we're guiding for cash from operations of $170 million, free cash flow of $165 million and adjusted free cash flow of $166 million. There's one additional item worth noting related to the cash flow in Q1 and fiscal '23. In Q1, we expect to make a $10 million foreign tax payment related to changes to the withholding tax policy of a foreign country. Since we also expect this to be substantially -- all of this to be substantially -- substantially all of this to be refunded before the end of fiscal '23, there is no expected impact to the full year financials and we will not adjust for this.\nAside from this item, as you model the quarters of fiscal '23, keep in mind that we expect the quarterly distribution to follow a similar pattern as in fiscal '22 and fiscal '21 for the cash flow metrics with over 60% of our cash flow coming in the first half of the year and Q4 being our lowest cash flow generation quarter.\nNext, on Slide 33. Let's take a look at an illustrative model that uses the assumptions that Jim described earlier and illustrates what you need to believe to achieve the midpoint of our fiscal '23 constant currency ARR guidance at the midpoint of $1.76 billion. In this illustrative model, which is for 12% constant currency ARR growth, we've assumed that churn worsens by approximately 100 basis points, and we kept new ACV flat. While new ACV is not exactly the same as bookings due to dynamics such as ramp deals and in-year starts, which we've discussed before, it's a close enough proxy for this exercise.\nI would point out that while the churn increase looks high, that is, in fact, the math of an approximate 100 basis point increase that we outlined earlier in the discussion. And while the macro environment may increase churn, as you can see on the page, a 100 basis point increase would push absolute churn level -- churn dollars above levels that we have not seen for quite some time.\nAnd we have some tailwinds on the churn front, which include term lengths lengthening. In fact, our expiring base in fiscal '23 is only slightly higher than in fiscal '22 despite more than $200 million of beginning ARR. The price increase we implemented in May should also provide some tailwind throughout the year. And importantly, our product portfolio continues to mature and some of the product segments that have higher churn like IoT and AR have seen steady improvement in churn over the past 3 years and still have lots of room for improvement to get to renewal rates more in line with, for example, Creo and Windchill.\nOn the flat new ACV assumption, I would also point out that we have slightly more deferred ARR starting in fiscal '23 than we did in fiscal '22. We will have a full year of new sales from Codebeamer versus the 2 quarters worth that we had in fiscal '22, and the price increases that went into effect should provide a modest tailwind on the new sales front as well.\nYou can see that to hit the midpoint of $1.76 billion, we need to add $188 million of ARR in fiscal '23. Balancing potential macro uncertainties with the momentum we've been seeing in our business, our forecast and given some of the considerations I just mentioned, we believe our fiscal '23 guidance is prudent.\nTurning to Slide 34. Here's an illustrative constant currency ARR model for Q1. You can see our results over the past 8 quarters. In the far right column, we've modeled the midpoint of our constant currency Q1 ARR guidance. Because our ARR tends to see some seasonality, the most relevant comparison is Q1 '21 and Q1 '22. The illustrative model indicates that to hit the midpoint of our Q1 '23 guidance of $1.59 billion, we need to add $18 million of ARR on a sequential basis. This is less than the $40 million we added in Q1 of '21 and the $37 million we added in Q1 of fiscal '22. Again, for the reasons I mentioned just a minute ago, we believe we've set our Q1 '23 constant currency ARR guidance range prudently.\nLet's move on to Slide 35, which shows an illustrative free cash flow model for fiscal '23. I know that most of you model free cash flow using the indirect method, which uses the P&L and balance sheet as a starting point. Given the complexities related to ASC 606 that we spent some time on earlier on this call, there are inherent challenges in using the indirect method to forecast free cash flow for PTC. The model on this slide is based on what we use internally. I know that looking at it in this way may be unfamiliar to some of you, so please feel free to reach out if we can help.\nStarting at the top with ARR. Note that the FY '22 ARR has been -- is at the September 30, 2022 rates and that for fiscal '23, we've used the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance. Moving down the model. The primary reason why FY '23 professional services revenue is down is because of unfavorable FX developments we've seen over the past year. In addition, we expect roughly 1/3 of our professional services revenue to transition to DxP over time.\nMoving to cost of revenue and operating expenses, the FX developments over the past year have the opposite effect here. Compared to revenue for costs and expenses, the FX moves are beneficial. You can see the powerful leverage on our cash contribution, which is a characteristic outcome of a sticky recurring subscription business model, combined with operational discipline.\nAs you can see, expected restructuring payments are materially lower in fiscal '23 because, as Jim explained earlier, we completed the work related to the operational optimization announced a year ago and the related cash restructuring payments are now substantially behind us. We've also completed the work to rebalance resources across the company to align with our growth opportunities and we did this without a restructuring charge.\nMoving on, you'll see that other expense is higher in fiscal '23 compared to fiscal '22, this is primarily due to higher interest rate on our revolver, given the higher interest rate environment. Cash taxes are also higher in this model and reflect both higher taxable income as well as the impact of Section 174.\nAnd finally, the other category is also higher in FY '23. The main driver here is higher working capital to support continued growth. FY '22 also includes the impact of FX movements.\nAll this sums up to expected free cash flow of $560 million, inclusive of the $134 million ARR headwind that materialized and consequent $60-ish million headwind to free cash flow. Jim explained earlier, we expect to deliver approximately $560 million under the most plausible ARR growth scenarios, and I'd like to reiterate that.\nIf the macro situation gets worse and our cash generation is impacted, you can expect us to moderate our spending. On the other hand, if the macro situation improves or the dollar strength reverses, this would be favorable for our cash generation. And in that scenario, we'd likely invest more aggressively in our business. As we start the year, we believe $560 million is a good target.\nAnd that's a good segue to Slide 36. First of all, we are prepared for a storm and expect to be resilient in the face of one. From a top line perspective, we serve industrial product companies. And R&D at those companies tends to be quite resilient, so we have a supportive top line backdrop. We've also transitioned successfully to a subscription business model, and our products are very sticky with our customers.\nJust as importantly, from a cost and operational perspective, we have done a lot of optimization in 2022 that will serve us well going forward. We've already battened down the hatches.\nNevertheless, as we've said in the past, we do not have a Pollyanna type view when it comes to the macro situation. We have a strong track record of disciplined operational management. And in the event of a meaningful downturn, we're prepared to pull additional spending levers to mitigate the impact on our cash flows. Variable compensation would automatically adjust. And depending on the magnitude of the downturn, we would also curtail plant hires, look at backfilling, attrition, marketing spend, travel spend, et cetera.\nSo with that, I'd like to wrap it up here and turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the PTC 2022 Third Quarter Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSVP of IR, PTC Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Savannah, and welcome to PTC's Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance, provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, July 27, 2022, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, CEO, Member of National First Executive Advisory Board & Director, PTC Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PTC delivered an outstanding third quarter with top line ARR results and bottom line free cash flow results above our guidance, and we're raising our guidance for the third time this year.\nBefore I dive in, I'd like to point out that Kristian will cover the effects of the strengthening dollar later during his section of the call. So to simplify things, I will focus my discussion of top line growth metrics on constant currency results.\nTurning to Slide 4. ARR and free cash flow results were very strong, and the strength was broad-based across all segments and geographies. Of particular note, we saw organic ARR growth further accelerate to 15%, driven by the acceleration we saw across the board in Digital Thread Core, Digital Thread Growth, FSG and Velocity units. ARR growth was helped by the lowest churn the company has seen in many quarters. I'm pleased to see PTC's organic growth rate move into that mid-teens range we've been targeting.\nWe closed the Intland acquisition during Q3. I will refer to this business as Codebeamer going forward because that is the product name we will retain. Codebeamer had an outstanding first quarter at PTC and added 1 point of inorganic ARR growth, taking PTC's ARR to $1.63 billion, up 16% year-over-year.\nIn Q3, we complemented our top line growth with even stronger bottom line growth. Despite strong FX headwinds and nearly $20 million of restructuring and M&A transaction payments, our free cash flow performance was strong at $112 million, which was ahead of our guidance and up 33% year-over-year.\nRemember that the restructuring we implemented at the end of last fiscal year was designed to drive a more aggressive and efficient SaaS strategy. At the time it was announced, we viewed the charges as short-term pain for long-term gain. Now we're at the inflection point where most of the pain is behind us, leaving us with a cost structure that's in great shape, while the operational changes continue to generate the positive results we expected. I'm going to circle back on the margin topic in a few minutes when I reflect on macro scenarios.\nMoving to Slide 5. Despite the scary headlines we read every day, we've continued to see solid global demand for our offerings. We did see some minor indications of macro-related softness in smaller European reseller accounts and in China due to COVID-related lockdowns, but this proved immaterial as organic bookings were up 29% year-over-year, roughly double the organic ARR growth rate. Europe bookings grew 20%.\nAs I mentioned, renewals were also strong, and we're raising our FY '22 organic churn guidance as we're trending slightly better than expected. Growth was strong in both Digital Thread and Velocity units and across all 3 geographies. Q3 was the seventh consecutive quarter that bookings have grown faster than ARR, which, together with improving renewal rates, is driving the accelerating ARR growth we've been delivering all year.\nTo help you appreciate the resilience of PTC as you think about any potential macro volatility that may lie ahead, on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly again review our business model dynamics to help investors understand why, despite the uncertainty, we have confidence in our financial targets for the remainder of the year.\nOn the left hand of the slide, you can see that the 16% ARR growth we delivered in Q3 was based not just on our Q3 performance, but performance over the prior 3 quarters as well. Given our definition of ARR as the annualized value of the book of active recurring software contracts, ARR growth is effectively a trailing 4-quarter metric. When we say ARR grew 16% in the third quarter, we mean that on average, ARR has now grown 16% over each of the past 4 quarters because the entire book of active recurring business is now 16% larger than it was at this time last year.\nWhile this trailing dynamic serves to dampen the impact of bookings in any single quarter, such as the strong results in Q3 where bookings grew roughly twice the speed of ARR, it also provides a tremendous foundation of stability for the company. We are raising our ARR guidance for the full year because 3 of the 4 quarterly results that will comprise FY '22 ARR growth are already known, and we feel sufficiently confident about Q4. Kristian will elaborate during his guidance review.\nAs you think about macro scenarios and their effect on PTC, remember the basic rule of thumb that so long as bookings exceed churn over the trailing 4 quarters, ARR will grow and so too should free cash flow. Bookings currently exceed churn by a wide margin, roughly 3:1. To demonstrate the resilience of our model, I'll quickly review the same big, round, directionally accurate numbers I supplied last quarter for you to run scenarios against.\nThink of PTC having around $1.5 billion in ARR, and on a run rate basis, we're adding $300 million in annual bookings while seeing $100 million in annual churn. That's the 3:1 ratio I spoke of. Over the next year, the $1.5 billion of ARR would step up by $300 million in bookings and step down by $100 million in churn to grow to $1.7 billion, which is 13% growth. That's roughly consistent with our current run rate performance, though our actual 15% ARR growth level reflects that we're running slightly favorable on both bookings and churn.\nI'll skip the details this time around. But on the right side of the slide, let me remind you of the hypothetical scenarios I shared last quarter. The first scenario has bookings slow 30% for 4 quarters like we experienced in 2009, and the second scenario has bookings slow 30% for 2 quarters like we experienced in 2020. In both cases, churn has held flat, consistent with experience in both periods. Across those scenarios, ARR grows upper single digits to low teens.\nNow to understand profitability in a downturn, let's take a fresh look at Slide 7, which I borrowed and updated from our December Investor Day presentation. Whether top line growth remains strong as it has been or it slows a bit due to macro developments, we expect to see significant margin expansion going forward. Margin expansion starts with the scale advantages we get by growing the top line faster than spending. Fiscal year-to-date ARR is up 16%, while non-GAAP OpEx is basically flat. But we have several margin expansion programs that go further.\nThe first margin expansion program is reflected in the actions we successfully implemented at the end of FY '21, which is shown on the left half of the page. Those changes are worth several hundred basis points of margin expansion once the restructuring is complete, and it now largely is. By the time we enter FY '23, we have the bulk of the operating costs and the restructuring costs removed from our results.\nIn addition to that, we've also initiated a second margin expansion program, which is shifting resources within our portfolio in a way that addresses key staffing needs while driving up the profitability of our J-curve businesses as shown on the right half of the slide.\nBy reassigning some sales and R&D resources, and I'm talking about the actual people, from IoT and AR, where growth has been lower than expected, into other parts of the portfolio like CAD and PLM, where growth has been exceeding expectations, we're able to accommodate much of the company's resourcing needs while canceling more than half of the 800 open positions we had a quarter ago. This program will not involve layoffs or restructuring charges, just new assignments for existing employees. The avoidance of new hires and their previously budgeted cost is expected to yield a couple of hundred basis points of margin expansion over time.\nNote that a nice side effect of these resourcing shifts is that the Digital Thread Growth unit comprised of IoT and AR is now crossing into profitability. We expect to see further margin expansion that comes naturally as these businesses continue scaling beyond the current $214 million in ARR.\nIn addition to the margin expansion programs that are well underway, there's a third margin expansion opportunity. If we were to encounter signs of a significant macro slowdown, like the scenarios I mentioned, we would quickly implement new hiring restrictions against the balance of the open positions we have as well as other spending restrictions. This, too, would further help margins.\nThe summary is that our cost structure is in great shape as we contemplate scenarios of what lie ahead. Given the cost lever we've already pulled with the restructuring at the end of last year, the lever we're pulling now by rebalancing resources within the portfolio and the additional lever that remains incrementally available to us if we see signs of a downturn, we're looking at substantial margin expansion drivers that make us confident we can deliver free cash flow growth in the mid-20s or better at Q3 FX levels and across most plausible ARR growth scenarios.\nA mid-20s free cash flow growth rate supports the longer-term free cash flow guidance we currently have out there. So we continue to feel good about that even in this shaky environment. Because we have products that are compelling and sticky sold into good markets using a recurring revenue model, coupled with a long-standing reputation for spending discipline, PTC is in a good position to drive differentiated free cash flow growth no matter what macro scenario plays out.\nGetting back to Q3. Let's take a quick look at our ARR performance by geography on Slide 8 before turning to our business units. In Q3, we again saw a strong ARR growth across all geographies. ARR growth in the Americas was 14%. In Europe, our ARR growth was 17% despite the Russia exit in Q2 which still affects the growth rate given the trailing nature of our ARR metric. Our ARR growth in APAC was 16%. Knowing that investors are concerned about the macro environment, I'd like to reiterate that we are continuing to see strong bookings and renewal performance globally and in Europe. And given our recurring business model, ARR is likely to grow in all but the most extreme downturn scenarios one can imagine.\nNext, let's take a look at the ARR performance of our business units, starting with Digital Thread, on Slide 9. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another strong double-digit growth performance in Q3 with 14% ARR growth. Within this, once again, CAD grew low double digits, while PLM grew 17%. Bookings grew faster in both cases. Q3 was the best performance yet across the now 19 consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth we've seen in the core CAD and PLM business.\nOn the SaaS transformation front, Windchill+ is in its early days, but we had a solid SaaS quarter for Windchill based primarily on a good mix of SaaS in new projects. We continue to expect to see a growing SaaS impact from lift and shift conversions as that phenomenon ramps in FY '23 and beyond. A reminder, too, that Windchill+ is the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy, and you'll see us follow with Creo plus and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY '23 and beyond.\nIn Digital Thread growth, which is IoT and AR, we were pleased to see ARR growth accelerate to 19% in the neighborhood of that 2 handle growth rate we're targeting. ThingWorx DPM had a solid quarter, including a multimillion dollar ramp deal with a leading global contract manufacturer for a 30-factory DPM rollout following a successful proof of concept. With ThingWorx DPM, we believe we have a turnkey IoT solution with strong product market fit, and this deal represents an excellent proof point.\nFSG posted great results again in Q3, accelerating to 9% ARR growth organically and growing 17%, inclusive of Codebeamer. Within FSG, Retail PLM, Arbortext and Servigistics all performed notably well, driven by solid results in terms of both bookings and renewals.\nLet's turn to Slide 10 and double-click on Codebeamer. As the driver of the inorganic growth of FSG, Codebeamer had an outstanding quarter, beating its plan even before landing a mid-7 figures ramp deal with a European automotive supplier that's standardizing on Codebeamer across its thousands of software engineers. This transaction was actually the largest order PTC booked in the third quarter, which is quite an accomplishment for a business that currently represents 1% of our ARR.\nThe Codebeamer product has best-in-class ALM capabilities and is seeing high demand because these capabilities are critical to manufacturers whose products contain embedded software. That's especially true in industries like automotive and medical devices that are regulated because an errant software chain -- change somewhere in the supply chain could lead to an unexpected product behavior that might kill people. Codebeamer is off to an amazing start, and early returns are very encouraging.\nWe have combined Codebeamer with our previous ALM offering called Integrity and elevated this consolidated ALM business to be a key product line alongside CAD, PLM, IoT and AR in the Digital Thread portfolio. Codebeamer will continue to be sold stand-alone, and we'll sell it with PLM as well. In addition to the strong stand-alone ALM sales that Codebeamer has been experiencing, adding it to PTC's portfolio is expected to drive incremental revenue and cost synergies.\nTo keep our reporting simple in the near term, we will continue to report the ALM business in the FSG line item. Placing the high-growth Codebeamer business in the FSG reporting line item should take FSG from being a low single-digit grower to a sustainable mid-single-digit grower going forward, which, of course, helps to elevate PTC's overall growth rate as well.\nBefore I turn to our Velocity business unit, let me run through a customer story on Slide 11 that illustrates how customers are leveraging our digital transformation capabilities. With more than 29,000 employees, Vestas is a key global provider of sustainable energy solutions to the energy industry.\nVestas is a great PTC customer, and they use our software across their Digital Thread as they design, manufacture, install and service onshore and offshore wind turbines around the globe. To meet the unique needs of each customer and each deployment, Vestas has embraced digital transformation. Vestas has literally taken an electrical mechanical wind turbine and turned it into a highly tailorable, software-controlled, connected powerhouse of clean and affordable energy.\nFor Vestas, the first step was to establish a strong PLM foundation in engineering. Now Vestas is leveraging the end-to-end configuration management capabilities of Creo, Windchill and ThingWorx to drive process improvements across engineering and manufacturing. By eliminating manual handoffs and redundant work, Vestas is unlocking a step-function improvement in product and process quality while shortening lead times.\nVestas is driving closed-loop innovation using data from a large number of connected wind turbines in the field to generate engineering insights. PTC's unique portfolio is well aligned to support Vestas along their digital transformation journey and their future plans include increasing use of ThingWorx and Vuforia as they continue to develop their best-in-class wind power solutions.\nTurning to the Velocity business unit on Slide 12. Year-over-year ARR growth for our Velocity unit accelerated slightly to 29% in Q3 with Onshape and Arena, again, growing multiple times faster than their market. These cloud-native businesses, each a pioneering leader in its respective category, continue to give us proof points that suggest the future of the product life cycle software market will be SaaS.\nWith Velocity, PTC has the best pure-play SaaS strategy in our market. It really is the industry benchmark for how SaaS should be done. And with the Atlas platform, borne of Onshape and now powering Windchill+ in the broader plus strategy, we are implementing SaaS across the entire portfolio. We expect the SaaS strategy to create strong growth tailwinds in the core business for years to come.\nLet's move to Slide 13, where I'd like to take you through a Velocity customer story. Wavemaker Labs is a product development accelerator known for product development excellence in automation applications. They have a portfolio of companies, and they help these companies build disruptive technologies. Photo you see on the slide is the Flippy 2 automated frying robot from Miso Robotics, which is one of Wavemaker's portfolio companies. Miso Robotics is leveraging automation to revolutionize commercial food service, and their customers include Jack in the Box, Chipotle and White Castle, all favorites of Kristian Talvitie, I'm sure.\nTo help Miso Robotics and their portfolio companies drive high-velocity product development, Wavemaker Labs has chosen Onshape and Arena. Speed, agility and flexible scalability are top priorities for Wavemaker Labs, making Onshape and Arena a natural fit. The unique analytics and management reporting capabilities of Onshape helps Wavemaker Labs to better understand the efficiency and the engagement of their engineers.\nAlso with their high-velocity mindset, Wavemaker Labs is focused on driving frictionless collaboration from start to finish. They're looking forward to being one of the first customers to deploy the new Onshape-Arena connection feature, which is in customer test now and will be released shortly. This connector will launch the industry's first integrated, pure SaaS CAD and PLM suite, which enables improved collaboration and a seamless flow of product data across engineering, supply chain and manufacturing or contract manufacturing activities.\nFor a final topic, turning to Slide 14, there are 2 upcoming investor events I want to raise to your attention. First, we plan to hold a virtual FY '23 Investor Day event on November 17 where we'll give you a deeper view into PTC's financial plans for FY '23 and beyond. Second, we plan to host a large LiveWorx ecosystem event on May 15 and 16 of 2023. That, assuming COVID cooperates, we expect will bring together thousands of customers, partners, investors and employees in a live event at the Boston Convention and Expo Center near our Seaport headquarters.\nWe're hoping that many of you will attend the LiveWorx event where we'll have a dedicated investor track that allows you to participate in keynotes and investor sessions, plus gives you ample opportunity to interact directly with management, customers and partners across the PTC ecosystem. To make it easier for you, we plan to make the November event both shorter and virtual with the intention to give you what you need for your models to tie you over to the bigger LiveWorx event in May, where you can get a full dose of strategy and customer exposure. Please watch for a hold-the-date invitation from our Investor Relations team regarding both events.\nTo wrap up on Slide 15, demand remained strong in Q3, and we've seen only minor signs of a macro slowdown. But we're watching diligently, and we're well prepared for whatever lies ahead. Because of our resilient business model and spending discipline, we expect to deliver solid top and bottom line growth across any of the more plausible macro scenarios.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with PTC's position. Our strategy is working well. We've driven both our growth and profitability to levels that are near the top of our peer group. And I'm excited about the opportunities to do even better as we push ahead in parallel with our growth and margin expansion initiatives.\nThroughout the first 3 quarters of FY '22, bookings and renewals have been very strong. Growth has been accelerating all year, which is why we're raising our guidance for the third time. And we're entering the fourth quarter of what will be our fifth consecutive year of double-digit organic ARR growth. I think the company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for more details on the financial results.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported.\nTurning to Slide 17. As a reminder, when we provided guidance last quarter, we specifically excluded the Codebeamer and DxP transactions, which had not closed at that point. Codebeamer contributed $16 million of ARR in Q3. On an organic constant currency basis, our ARR was $1.61 billion, up 15% year-over-year and ahead of the comparable guidance range we provided, which was $1.58 billion to $1.595 billion. Including Codebeamer, our constant currency ARR was $1.625 billion, up 16% year-over-year.\nAside from a nonoperating cash inflow, the DxP transaction did not impact our results as most of the in-flight services contracts are still on our paper. We expect the transition of these services contracts to happen gradually over time and will be reflected in future guidance as we provide it. However, we expect the impact to ARR and free cash flow to be de minimis.\nAs Jim explained, our top line strength in Q3 was broad-based. We're executing well against our strategy, and we're continuing to improve upon strong market position. Our SaaS businesses across our Digital Thread and Velocity groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q3. On an as reported basis, we delivered 9% ARR growth, 8% organic due to the impact of FX headwinds, which were approximately $81 million, substantially higher than the $32 million of FX headwinds we estimated a quarter ago using Q2 ending exchange rates.\nDespite the FX headwinds, our cash flow results were strong, coming in ahead of our guidance. Increased ARR, solid collections performance, slower hiring and above-plan perpetual license revenue from Kepware helped to offset the incremental headwinds that materialized in Q3.\nWhen assessing and forecasting our quarterly cash flow, it's also important to remember a few things. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year. Q4 is our lowest cash flow generation quarter. And free cash flow is primarily a function of ARR rather than revenue.\nQ3 revenue of $462 million increased 6% year-over-year. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. FX impacted revenue by $18 million in Q3, so our revenue on a constant currency basis was $480 million, up 12% year-over-year.\nBefore I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin as I did last quarter. We continue to caution that because revenue is impacted by 606, other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin, operating profit, EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning that we're benefiting from the work we've done to optimize our cost structure following our restructuring announcement last November.\nIn Q3 '22, our non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly less than in Q3 '21, yet we delivered significantly higher ARR, free cash flow and revenue. And our margin percentage also expanded compared to a full year ago. As I indicated last quarter, we believe the improvements we've driven are sustainable, and we remain on track to deliver operating margin expansion for the full year and expect to end the year with operating margins in the high 30% range.\nMoving to Slide 18. We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $322 million. Our gross debt was $1.43 billion, with an aggregate interest rate of 3.5%. During Q3, the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility increased by $159 million on a net basis to $434 million. This was due to the financing of the Codebeamer acquisition, partially offset by paying down $105 million on our revolver.\nRegarding our share repurchase program, as we've communicated on the previous 2 calls, we've completed $125 million of repurchases in fiscal '22. Our long-term goal, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3 turns, is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while also taking into consideration the interest rate environment and strategic opportunities.\nNext, Slide 19 shows our ARR by product group. We post a set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as ARR details. In that file, we share both constant currency and as reported ARR. As a reminder, when we calculate constant currency figures, we use our current year plan FX rates, which are as of September 30, 2021, for all periods.\nYou can see on the slide how FX dynamics have resulted in differences between our constant currency ARR and as reported ARR over the past 7 quarters. Based on exchange rates at the end of Q3, reported ARR for fiscal '22 would be approximately $85 million less than our constant currency ARR guidance. This is important to consider in the context of our guidance because we provide ARR guidance on a constant currency basis. If exchange rates fluctuate significantly between the end of Q3 and the end of Q4, the impact to our as reported ARR would also change.\nWe believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative. As a reminder, as we said, our ARR guidance for fiscal '23 on our next call, we'll be providing that at the September 30, 2022, foreign exchange rates and restating history, assuming those rates.\nMoving on to the next slide. Given the sharp moves in FX that we've seen recently, I thought it would be useful to provide an updated ARR sensitivity rule of thumb, so to speak, here on Slide 20. In addition to the U.S. dollar, we transact in euro, yen and more than 10 other additional currencies. Using our Q3 FX rates, the impact of a $0.10 change in the euro to USD rate would be $38 million, positive or negative, and the impact to a JPY 10 change in the U.S. dollar to yen rate would be about $8 million. Of course, the estimated dollar impact to ARR is dependent on the size of the ARR base.\nTurning to Slide 21. We're pleased to have closed both the Codebeamer and DxP transactions in the third quarter. Let me explain the financial impact starting with ARR. At the end of Q3, Codebeamer's ARR was $16 million, reported as part of FSG. We expect solid ARR growth from Codebeamer, and this should help FSG grow consistently in the mid-single-digit range going forward.\nThe DxP transaction will not impact ARR, but it is instead expected to result in lower professional services revenue. This will happen over time as the services contracts move to DxP from PTC. In Q3, the impact was de minimis. And since our services business is not high margin, we do not expect a material impact to our profitability as the business gets smaller over time.\nNext, from a free cash flow perspective, we expect Codebeamer and DxP to have an immaterial impact in fiscal '22 and to be accretive in fiscal '23. In fiscal '22, the incremental operational cash flows essentially offset incremental transaction-related fees and incremental interest expense.\nWith that, I'll move on to guidance on Slide 22. I'll start by pointing out that our previous guidance did not include the financial impact of Codebeamer or DXP, and our updated guidance now does. As I just explained, this positively impacts ARR but is immaterial for our other guidance items. We're raising our fiscal '22 constant currency ARR guidance based on our strong year-to-date new and renewal bookings performance, the addition of Codebeamer, and despite our exit from Russia in Q2 of this year.\nThe new range is now $1.66 billion to $1.69 billion, which translates to constant currency ARR growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal '22. At the midpoint, we're raising ARR guidance by $23 million. Approximately $16 million of the raise is attributable to the addition of Codebeamer ARR with the rest being driven by our strong business performance.\nGiven the macro uncertainties, we're providing a wider range for ARR than we usually would at this point in our fiscal year. The low end contemplates a 2020 recession kind of scenario where bookings would be down 30% and we'd see a modest increase in churn. This is primarily to illustrate the resiliency of our model. As Jim mentioned, we did not really see any material impact from the macro environment in Q3. So if that trend continues, we would beat the low end handily.\nIt's also worth noting that we're increasing our expectation for organic churn improvement in fiscal '22 from approximately 100 basis points of improvement to approximately 150 basis points of improvement, excluding the impact of our exit from Russia. Even including the inorganic Arena churn and additional Russia-related churn, we're expecting approximately 100 basis points of churn improvement.\nAnd while we don't guide to bookings, I know that we sometimes reference bookings performance, and Jim mentioned earlier that our bookings growth has outpaced our ARR growth for 7 quarters in a row. This will not continue in the fourth quarter given the exceptionally strong bookings performance we had in Q4 of fiscal '21.\nAs Jim also mentioned, in our Digital Thread growth segment, our IoT and AR product lines, ARR accelerated again in the third quarter as we achieved 19% year-over-year growth. We expect fiscal '22 ARR growth for this segment to be 20%, plus or minus.\nNext, on cash flows, we're raising our free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow guidance for fiscal '22. Our strong year-to-date execution includes growing ARR at the high end of our guidance range, especially in the first half of the year which helped us to generate the majority of our FY '22 collections when FX rates were more favorable. Additionally, Kepware continues to perform very well, and our perpetual license bookings are also above plan.\nGiven our operational discipline and the macro environment, our hiring has also been somewhat slower than anticipated.\nAnd as we think about Q4, the internal resource reallocation Jim discussed earlier will also further slow hiring.\nThese tailwinds are helping us to offset various headwinds, including FX, our Russia exit, modestly higher compensation and incremental acquisition and interest-related costs due to the Codebeamer and DxP transactions. Finally, regarding Q4, we continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern of cash flow generation, primarily driven by invoicing seasonality.\nMoving to revenue. Because of the sharp moves in FX over the past 3 months, we're reducing the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance by $15 million. So for fiscal '22, our new revenue guidance is $1.9 billion to $1.95 billion, and the year-over-year growth we are guiding to is now 5% to 8%. ASC 606 makes revenue very difficult to predict for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. Note that revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths.\nI'll close out my prepared remarks today by taking you through an illustrative constant currency ARR model on Slide 23. Here, we're showing our ARR progression over the past 7 quarters and an illustration of what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for fiscal '22.\nFocusing on the last line in the chart, organic sequential ARR growth. The trend that has developed in fiscal '22 shows better organic ARR growth year-to-date compared to fiscal '21. Next, calling your attention to the green box. This model shows targeted ending ARR at $1.67 billion for Q4 to the midpoint of our guidance range. As you can see, to hit the midpoint of guidance, we need to add $50 million of organic ARR in Q4. This is less than the $63 million we added in Q4 of fiscal '21.\nWe believe we're well positioned to do that given our pipeline and forecast and also in part because we have more deferred ARR starting in Q4 of '22 than we did last year. And with the context of macro concerns, we've set a low end that contemplates a severe downturn in the global economy. Putting all this together, we believe we've set our guidance prudently.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A."

Welcome to the PTC 2022 Second Quarter Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSVP of IR, PTC Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Savannah, and welcome to PTC's 2022 Second Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live through an audio webcast, and a replay of the call will be available later today at www.ptc.com.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance as to future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's annual report on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during this call are valid only as of today's date, April 27, 2022, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nDuring the call, PTC will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, CEO, Member of National First Executive Advisory Board & Director, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. To simplify things, please note that throughout my commentary, I will be discussing all growth rates in constant currency.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that PTC delivered another strong financial performance in fiscal Q2. All of our metrics came in above our guidance, and the strength was broad based across all segments and geographies. Of particular note, we saw organic ARR growth accelerate to 13% despite the self-inflicted churn caused by our decision to exit the Russian market. We ended Q2 with $1.56 billion of ARR. Bookings grew faster than ARR, and renewals were very strong.\nWe also continued our track record of translating top line growth into even better bottom line growth. In Q2, our adjusted free cash flow performance was strong at $158 million, up 22% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance. The non-GAAP operating margin of 42% in the quarter was the highest we've seen. The margin expansion strategies we outlined at our December Investor Day are generating the results we expected.\nMoving to Slide 5. While we're monitoring the global macro and geopolitical situation carefully, we continue to see strong global demand environment for our offerings. Driving digital transformation across the product life cycle remains an important priority for our customers. Bookings were up mid-teens year-over-year, and the strength was broad-based. Growth was strong in both Digital Thread and Velocity and across all 3 geographies. Q2 was the sixth consecutive quarter that bookings have grown faster than ARR, which, together with improving renewal rates, creates an acceleration bias for ARR growth.\nTo help you understand the resilience of PTC as you think about any potential macro volatility that may lie ahead, I'd like to expand on our business model dynamics to ensure you appreciate why our business model provides us with confidence in our ability to achieve our financial targets in the back half of the year.\nLet's take a look at Slide 6. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see that the 13% ARR growth we delivered in Q2 was based not just on Q2 performance but also on the momentum we built over the previous 3 quarters as well. ARR growth is a rolling 4-quarter metric. So when we say ARR grew 13% in the second quarter, we mean the entire book of recurring business is now 13% larger than it was at this time last year.\nWhile this rolling dynamic dampens the impact of bookings in any single quarter, such as the strong results in Q2, it also provides the foundation of stability and resiliency for the company. Remember that so long as bookings exceed churn, ARR will grow. Bookings currently exceed churn by a wide margin.\nTo help you run your own scenarios, let me simplify the math by giving you some big round directional numbers to work with. Let's say PTC has around $1.5 billion in ARR. And on a run rate basis, we're adding $300 million in annual bookings while seeing $100 million in annual churn. Over the next year, the $1.5 billion of ARR would step up by $300 million and stepped down by $100 million to grow to $1.7 billion, which is 13% growth. That's consistent with our run rate performance.\nNote that because PTC provides sticky enterprise software, our history in 2009 and again in 2020 shows renewals remain steady through a macro downturn. To better understand the sensitivity then of ARR to macro changes, let's start with a hypothetical scenario where bookings stopped growing and remained flat indefinitely at $300 million. In that case, with churn being steady, ARR would experience double-digit growth for several years and high single digit for several more years after that.\nIf you're concerned about a downturn in Europe, which represents 40% of our business, you could create an alternate model where 40% of our bookings declined by 25% for 2 quarters and then bounced back, in which case we'd still deliver 12% ARR growth over the forthcoming year. If you want to run a more draconian global macro downturn scenario, you could model a 25% reduction across all bookings for the next 4 quarters, in which case you still get 8% ARR growth over the next year. Frankly, no matter what scenarios you might model, you'll consistently see that PTC has a very resilient business.\nKeep in mind that those were hypothetical examples because the actual results are considerably better. When bookings grow faster than ARR, as we've seen quarterly since the COVID rebound, it creates an acceleration effect for ARR. Improvement in renewal rates, which we've also been seeing, are helpful as well. PTC is experiencing the benefit of these dual acceleration effects right now, which is why we're raising our ARR guidance for the full year.\nIn summary, while the company is in position to accelerate ARR growth, assuming conditions remain as they have been, we're also in good position to power through any potential macro slowdown with strong results as we did in 2020 when bookings design -- declined sharply for several quarters due to the pandemic before rebounding again. PTC's FY '20 ARR growth of 11% compared very favorably to our more cyclical industry peers who don't have the same recurring business model. Some of whom even experienced top line declines in their comparable business lines.\nThe takeaway from this discussion is that our subscription model, which took us years of hard work to put in place, is a wonderful thing. And it will keep PTC in a growth leadership position in our industry for years to come.\nMoving on, let's take a quick look at our Q2 ARR performance by geography on Slide 7 before turning to our business units. In Q2, we saw strong ARR growth across all geographies. Our ARR growth in Americas was 12%. All product segments grew with the main growth drivers being continued strength in our core PLM and CAD segments and another strong contribution from our Velocity business.\nIn Europe, our ARR growth was 15% despite the Russia exit. We saw strong results across the board in Europe with growth primarily driven by our core PLM and CAD businesses and strong growth in the IoT and AR segment. In addition, our Velocity and FSG businesses delivered solid growth in Europe in Q2. Europe has the largest mix of channel versus direct, and the resellers continue to perform well.\nI know that investors are concerned about exposure to Europe and the macro environment there. So I'd like to reiterate that, first, we're continuing to see strong bookings performance in Europe; and second, as I've demonstrated quantitatively, our model is highly resilient. Our ARR growth in APAC was 14% with our core CAD and PLM businesses again being the main drivers.\nNext, let's look at the ARR performance of our business units, starting with Digital Thread on Slide 8. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered another double-digit growth performance in Q2 with 13% growth. Within this, CAD grew low double digits, while PLM grew mid-teens. Bookings grew faster in each case, reflecting on Q2 across the now 18 consecutive quarters of double-digit ARR growth that we've seen in the core CAD and PLM business. This was the best performance yet, which I attribute to a combination of strong demand for digital transformation, best-in-class, sticky solutions sold in the recurring revenue model with low churn rates and the growth tailwinds from our SaaS initiatives.\nIn our core business, our solutions are very strategic, and we're executing well and taking market share. You may have noted we also launched Windchill+ during the quarter, which is our next-generation differentiated core SaaS PLM solution. Windchill+ contains the technology and operational improvements that enable higher profitability and is now becoming our lead Windchill sales play. Windchill+ is just the tip of the iceberg of a bigger plus strategy. And you'll see us follow with Creo+ and similar premium SaaS offerings in FY '23 and beyond.\nIn Digital Thread Growth, we saw ARR growth of 15%. While the sequential acceleration was modest, we made good operational progress and remain on track to get growth to a 2 handle by the end of the year. Following the launch of our new ThingWorx Digital Performance Management Solution, which we abbreviate as DPM, in Q2, we landed our first 9 deals across various different industries, including aerospace and defense, high-tech, automotive and food and beverage. Though these were starter deals, average initial deal size was 6 figures. Rockwell brought in several of these DPM deals, and the DPM pipeline for both companies looks good going into the back half of the year.\nFSG had a great Q2 with 8% ARR growth. Servigistics, Retail PLM and Arbortext all performed well, helping to drive solid results in terms of renewals and churn. Growth was particularly strong in the Americas and Europe. With FSG, our strategy is to keep delivering value to customers by having dedicated focus on each of these products. And I'm pleased to see that strategy produced another strong quarter.\nBefore I turn to our Velocity business unit, let me run through a couple of quick customer stories that will give you a taste of how customers are leveraging our digital transformation capabilities. I'll start with Bosch on Slide 9. Bosch is a massive global supplier of technologies and services. With 400,000 employees, including 75,000 engineers, a key challenge for Bosch is how to drive end-to-end digital transformation at scale. Bosch is leveraging their Windchill PLM system as a backbone in combination with Creo and ThingWorx to enable new and improved workflows. This specific example is about Bosch using model-based design capabilities of Creo and Windchill. By moving beyond the world of 2D drawings and leveraging enhanced 3D Creo data across engineering, manufacturing and inspection processes, Bosch is driving improved productivity and bringing products to market faster.\nNext on Slide 10. Cummins is the world's largest independent diesel and gas engine manufacturer and an interesting ESG story that we help enable. Cummins has long made it a company goal to reduce their environmental impact, and digital transformation is a critical part of their journey. By using generative design and ANSYS-powered simulation upfront in their Creo-based design process, Cummins has been able to reduce material usage, create better products and accelerate time to market.\nTurning to the Velocity business on Slide 11. Year-over-year ARR growth for our Velocity segment was 27% in Q2 with both Onshape and Arena growing multiple times faster than the market, which demonstrates there's a distinct and vibrant segment of the CAD and PLM market that prioritizes SaaS and agile product development as their #1 buying criteria. With Onshape and Arena, PTC has a unique ability to serve this market segment, and we're continuing to ramp both our Velocity product and go-to-market investments.\nLet's move to Slide 12, where I'd like to take you through a Velocity example showing how Arena is empowering Filtronic's global team to deliver innovative products faster. Filtronic is using Arena's SaaS PLM solution to control product design and supporting documentation and to enable collaboration across globally distributed teams. The benefits of providing complete visibility into critical product and quality processes are significant. For example, engineering change cycle time was cut by 50%, and the issue resolution time has been cut in half as well.\nTurning to Slide 13. We announced 2 transactions last week, and I'd like to recap both and provide some additional context. First, we announced an agreement to acquire Intland Software, a next-generation application life cycle management or ALM company for $280 million. For background, PTC entered the ALM market a decade ago when we acquired MKS and their Integrity suite. ALM has become an important and well-established offering within PTC's portfolio and is sold both standalone and as a key subsystem of our Windchill PLM offering.\nThe Codebeamer family of software products from Intland is a next-generation ALM suite that's fast becoming the new standard in safety critical and regulated industries, especially in the large automotive industries where products are increasingly differentiated by the software. Bringing Codebeamer into our ALM suite will bolster both ALM and PLM growth potential by significantly increasing our product strength and market momentum.\nIntland's a great company who matches their strong product with strong growth and surprisingly good profitability for their size. We expect to achieve both revenue and cost synergies with this acquisition. When it closes, the acquisition is expected to add roughly 1 percentage point of inorganic growth to our FY '22 ARR results.\nIntland will join our existing ALM unit. So Codebeamer ARR will be reported as part of our FSG segment. We expect this acquisition will increase the growth rates of FSG going forward, which we now expect to be consistently growing in the mid-single-digit range.\nSecond, we announced an agreement to sell a portion of our professional services business to long-time partner ITC Infotech to further power our SaaS strategy. This move is a continuation of a long-term strategy we've been executing to focus PTC's efforts on high-margin software while we look to a partner ecosystem to deliver the professional services that unlock the value of that software in the customer setting.\nAs we ramp up the SaaS initiatives we described at our December Investor Day, a key component of the program is the lift and shift efforts required to move on-premise customer deployments into our SaaS cloud. With a large installed base, we're looking at the need for potentially thousands of services projects in the coming years. These are projects where PTC needs to play a direct role because at the end of each project, we will be taking ownership of the running system and carrying it forward.\nRather than put our own professional services organization back on to a growth vector as we scale up to perform these projects, we're instead planning to transition some of our key PLM talent into a new ITCI unit called DxP Services, thereby allowing the lift and shift capacity to scale on ITC's P&L rather than ours. This new DxP Services unit will be our partner to run joint lift and shift projects with DXP doing the upgrade and the customization work that happens at the customer site and PTC assuming the resulting system into our centralized SaaS operations. This is a professional services transaction, so it has no bearing on ARR.\nKristian will comment further on the expected financial impact of these 2 transactions. We expect both will close in Q3.\nTo wrap up then on Slide 14, I'm very pleased with PTC's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Our portfolio of products is unique and compelling, and it aligns well to customer demand. Throughout the first half of FY '22, bookings and renewals have been strong, and growth is accelerating as we enter the second half of what will be our fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth. We're poised to further accelerate growth as SaaS tailwinds blow harder in the coming quarters and as we gain momentum with DPM and other IoT and ARR initiatives.\nOur profitability continues to expand following the changes we implemented at the start of the year and as our start-up businesses continue to mature up their J-curves. Our model has proven to be highly resilient even in the face of a slowdown like during the pandemic in 2020. We're raising our guidance for the second quarter in a row, and I think the company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for more details on the financial results. Kristian?\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and ARR references will be in both constant currency and as reported.\nTurning to Slide 16. At the end of Q2, our constant currency ARR was $1.564 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Our SaaS businesses in both the Digital Thread and Velocity business groups saw continued solid ARR growth in Q2 and represented a larger mix of our overall business, both year-over-year and sequentially. We delivered above the ARR guidance range we provided for Q2, which was for constant currency ARR of $1.54 billion to $1.55 billion. On an as-reported basis, year-over-year ARR growth was 11%. Foreign exchange was a $32 million headwind, and our as reported ARR in Q2 was $1.532 billion.\nIn March, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we announced that we would discontinue business operations and sales in Russia. Exiting Russia had a $4 million adverse impact on our Q2 ARR. We've accounted for the $4 million impact as churn in Q2.\nCash from operations of $142 million in Q2 was in line with our guidance. Considering the $32 million foreign exchange headwind to ARR, this was a strong outcome, reflecting expected seasonality and another quarter of solid collections performance.\nIn Q2, free cash flow of $140 million grew 21% year-over-year and included $18 million in restructuring and other related payments. Adjusted free cash flow was $158 million, up 22% year-on-year. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow were both ahead of our guidance due to strong cash from operations and also because CapEx in Q2 came in slightly lower than we had anticipated. The main takeaway on cash flow is that despite the headwinds related to foreign exchange, we've been executing well and delivering on our targets.\nQ2 revenue of $505 million increased 9% year-over-year. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So we don't believe that revenue growth rates are the best indicator of our underlying business performance but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash generation. FX impacted revenue by about $6 million in Q2, and our revenue on a constant currency basis was $511 million.\nBefore I move on to the balance sheet, I'd like to provide some color on our non-GAAP operating margin, which expanded to 42% in Q2, as Jim noted earlier. This compares to 37% a year ago. Revenue is impacted by ASC 606. So other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin and EPS are all impacted as well. Still, it's worth mentioning that our costs in Q2 benefited from the restructuring we announced in Q4.\nSix months ago, we set an expectation that we would be eliminating some duplicative functions in our field organization and that our operating expense mix would shift towards R&D in alignment with our SaaS acceleration strategy. You can see the progress we've made in our Q2 results. We now have a more optimized operating structure. And we believe the improvements we've driven are sustainable and will enable us to deliver non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal '22 roughly in line with our year-to-date performance.\nMoving to Slide 17. We ended Q2 with cash and cash equivalents of $307 million. Our gross debt was $1.28 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.4%. During the second quarter, we generated cash proceeds of $43 million through the sale of our equity investment in Matterport. This, in conjunction with cash from operations, we used to pay down $175 million on our revolving credit facility in the second quarter.\nRegarding our share repurchase program, as we communicated last quarter, we've completed our planned repurchases for fiscal '22 with $5 million settling in Q2. And for the remainder of the year, we'll focus on delevering. Looking forward to fiscal '23 and on a go-forward basis, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below 3x, our goal is to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases.\nNext, Slide 18 shows our ARR by product group. We post a set of financial data tables to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as ARR details. In that file, we share both constant currency and as reported ARR. As a reminder, when we calculate constant currency figures, we use our current year plan FX rates for all periods. Our fiscal '22 plan FX rates are based on foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2021. We're using these rates to calculate constant currency figures for all quarters in fiscal '22 and for all prior periods as well.\nTo illustrate, you can see on the slide that we expect to report -- we expect as reported ARR to be lower than constant currency ARR for Q3 and fiscal '22. This is because of the FX headwinds and rate movements, which have moved significantly since September 30, 2021. Based on the exchange rates at the end of Q2, we expect as reported ARR for Q3 to be impacted by $32 million. And for fiscal '22, we expect the FX headwind to be approximately $34 million.\nThis is important to remember in context of our guidance because we provide ARR on a constant currency basis. And if the exchange rates fluctuate significantly between now and the end of Q3, the expected impact to our reported ARR would also change. We do believe constant currency is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes foreign exchange fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative.\nWith that, I'll move on to guidance on Slide 19. We're raising our fiscal '22 constant currency ARR guidance based on our strong performance in the first half and despite our exit from Russia. The new range is now $1.64 billion to $1.665 billion, which translates to constant currency ARR growth of 12% to 13% for fiscal '22. For Q3, we're guiding constant currency ARR to be $1.58 billion to $1.595 billion. At the midpoint, this equates to 13% constant currency growth.\nWe continue to expect IoT and ARR to reach ARR growth of 20% or more by the end of the year. And our FSG and Velocity businesses continue to do very well in the market. That all said, the main driver of our fiscal '22 ARR guidance raise is the strong customer demand we're seeing in our core CAD and PLM offerings, which represented 70% of our ARR in Q2.\nWe're maintaining guidance for fiscal '22 cash from operations at approximately $430 million as our strong execution and operational discipline are helping us to offset FX headwinds and the Russia exit. Our guidance for Q3 cash from operations is approximately $110 million. We've updated our CapEx guidance for fiscal '22 to approximately $25 million, which is down from about $30 million that we set at the beginning of the year. And we're expecting approximately $5 million of CapEx spend for Q3.\nTherefore, we're raising our full year free to cash flow target to approximately $405 million and guiding for Q3 free cash flow of approximately $105 million. We continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern in our fiscal '22 cash flow generation, primarily driven by invoicing seasonality. The majority of our collections occur in the first half of our fiscal year, and we continue to expect expenses to increase in the second half of fiscal '22 as we ramp hiring and our SaaS investments. because of these dynamics, Q4 is expected to be our lowest cash flow generation quarter.\nOur free cash flow guidance for fiscal '22 includes $40 million to $45 million of restructuring payments compared to our expectation a quarter ago of $45 million to $50 million as some employees have otherwise departed PTC and some employees that were expected to depart have moved into new roles where we've been looking at hiring. Both of these are good things. We have less restructuring payments and have been able to fill new open roles with good people in a challenging hiring environment.\nIn addition, our fiscal '22 guidance assumes approximately $5 million of transaction-related payments that were incurred in the first half of fiscal '22. Therefore, consistent with raising our free cash flow guidance, we're also raising our adjusted free cash flow target to approximately $455 million.\nFor Q3, we expect approximately $10 million of restructuring payments and approximately $5 million of transaction-related payments, which were incurred in the first half, bringing our adjusted free cash flow to approximately $120 million.\nMoving on to revenue. Despite foreign exchange headwinds and our Russia exit, we're taking the low end of our full year revenue guidance up by $25 million based on our Q2 beat and forecast for the remainder of fiscal '22. So our new revenue guidance range is $1.905 billion to $1.975 billion. The year-over-year growth we're guiding to now is 5% to 9%. ASC 606 makes revenue difficult to predict for an on-premise subscription company, hence the wide range. Note, revenue does not influence ARR or cash generation as we typically bill customers annually upfront regardless of contract term lengths.\nTurning to Slide 20. Jim provided some highlights earlier in terms of the financial impact we expect from the Intland Software and ITC Infotech transactions we announced last week. While both transactions are expected to close during Q3, we have not incorporated the expected financial impacts to our guidance because these deals haven't closed yet. We will officially update all financial metrics and guidance when we report our Q3 earnings.\nIn the meantime, directionally, for constant currency ARR, we expect these transactions to have a positive impact of approximately $15 million in fiscal '22. We will report Intland in our FSG product group along with our other ALM assets. And regarding free cash flow, we expect the transactions to have an immaterial impact to free cash flow in fiscal '22 as incremental operational cash flows are expected to offset the incremental transaction-related fees and increased interest expense in the second half. And we expect these transactions to be accretive in fiscal '23.\nGoing forward, as Jim explained, we expect these 2 deals to help us drive the adoption of our SaaS offerings. And over time, ITC -- the ITC Infotech transaction is expected to result in lower professional services revenue but not expected to have a material impact on our profitability. Again, we'll provide a lot more detail at Q3 when we report our results and update all guidance metrics at that point.\nI'll close out my prepared remarks today by taking you through an illustrative constant currency ARR model on Slide 21. Here, we're showing our ARR progression over the past 6 quarters and an illustration of what is needed to get to the midpoint of our constant currency ARR guidance for Q3 and fiscal '22. First of all, recall that in Q2 of fiscal '21, our ARR growth benefited due to the acquisition of Arena. So taking that into consideration, in the first half of fiscal '22, we added approximately $25 million more ARR on an organic basis compared to the first half of fiscal '21.\nNext, calling your attention to the green box. This model shows targeted ending ARR at $1.588 billion for Q3 and $1.653 billion for Q4, both at the midpoint of our guidance ranges. The illustration shows a sequential ARR that's needed in Q3 and Q4 to hit the guidance midpoints. As you can see, in the second half of fiscal '22, we need to add about the same amount of new ACV as we did in the second half of fiscal '21 in order to hit the midpoint of our constant currency guidance. We believe we're well positioned to do that even given some of the macro concerns and noting that we also have more deferred ARR starting in the second half of fiscal '22 than we did in fiscal '21.\nSo hopefully, that's helpful. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator and begin Q&A."

Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Shimao, PTC's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Shimao\n\nSVP of IR, PTC Inc.\n\nHello. Thank you, Julian, and welcome to PTC's results call for Q1 of fiscal '22. On the (technical difficulty) Jim Heppelmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Kristian Talvitie, Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring this call, PTC will make forward-looking statements, including guidance on future operating results. Because such statements deal with future events, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements can be found in PTC's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in today's press release. The forward-looking statements, including guidance provided during today's call are valid only as of today's date, January 26, 2022, and PTC assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. During the call, PTC will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release made available on our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to PTC's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Heppelmann.\n\nJames E. Heppelmann\n\nPresident, CEO, Member of National First Executive Advisory Board & Director, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nTurning to Slide 3, I'm pleased to share that PTC delivered another strong financial performance in fiscal Q1. We executed very well, building on the momentum we saw in Q4. To simplify things, please note that throughout my prepared commentary, I will only discuss growth rates in constant currency. ARR came in at $1.507 billion, which was better than the $1.5 billion we had guided to at the recent Investor Day. That represents 16% growth, 11% of which was organic. Adjusted free cash flow was also strong at $145 million, which was up 20% year-over-year and better than the $140 million expectation we said at the Investor Day. We're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022.\nTurning to Slide 4. Of particular note was our bookings strength. Bookings were up double digits organically and high teens overall against the very strong COVID bounce back quarter we saw in Q1 of fiscal '21 when bookings grew more than 30% over the prior year. To put it in perspective, given the tough comparison against Q1 of last year, we had planned bookings to actually be down slightly, inclusive of Arena. So this performance was more than 20% above plan. I know that some analysts and investors had voice concerned that the restructuring work we did in late Q4 and throughout Q1 would distract us, but obviously, we didn't see that.\nThe strength was broad-based across direct sales and resellers and was achieved with no megadeals. Rockwell came in ahead of their part of our plan, too, which was great to see and suggest my concerns of them being distracted and may prove overstated. Arena contributed the inorganic element of bookings growth, with another strong bookings quarter, coming in above plan as well. With the Arena acquisition getting round tripped here in Q2, Arena becomes part of the organic results going forward and their low 20s growth rate will then add another tailwind to the organic results. Arena has been a great acquisition.\nBookings growth was particularly strong in PLM, and in both Europe and Americas. From a macro perspective, global PMIs remain an expansion territory, while digital transformation and SaaS continue to grow in importance as secular drivers. The interest in digital transformation in SaaS has been driving strong bookings for what is very sticky software, which when layered into a recurring revenue model that is atypical of industry peers, has allowed PTC to deliver performance in excess of market growth rates. This happened right through the pandemic, especially in the large core business that represents about 70% of our ARR, and we fully expect it to continue going forward. These factors gave us confidence to raise the lower end of our ARR guidance range, which at the new midpoint basically means we've rolled our Q1 beat forward.\nNow let's take a look at the ARR performance by geography on Slide 5 before turning to business units. In Q1, we saw a strong ARR performance across all geographies. Our ARR growth in the Americas was 19%. All product segments grew with key growth drivers being the acquired Arena contribution and the Velocity business unit overall, layered on top of another strong quarter in the core CAD and PLM business. In Europe, our ARR growth was 13%. We saw strong results across the board in Europe, with the strongest drivers of the growth being our Digital Thread growth and core businesses. Europe has the largest mix of channel versus direct and the resellers continue to perform well. Our ARR growth in APAC was 14%, with growth primarily driven by our Digital Thread core business.\nNext, let's take a look at the ARR performance of our various business units, starting with the Digital Thread group on Slide 6. In our largest product segment, Digital Thread Core, we delivered yet another double-digit performance in Q1 with 11% growth. Within this, CAD and PLM, both grew double digits, with strong growth across all 3 geographies. This is the 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit ARR growth in the core business. And as we roll out our more aggressive SaaS strategy, I expect we'll see many more.\nIn the Digital Thread growth, which is IoT and AR, we saw ARR growth of about 14%, consistent across both elements. This was in line with our plan and the mid-teens near-term growth expectation we set at the recent Investor Day. While this level of growth remains accretive to company growth, we continue to expect an acceleration of growth into the 20s as we get into the back half of the year. The biggest driver of growth in Q1 was from expansions, especially in Europe and APAC. We believe market conditions in IoT are improving, and we like the way the pipeline for our new DPM offering is developing through both PTC and Rockwell channels. For AR, we continue to see a tremendous level of interest, but the market remains nascent. Perhaps most importantly, the formation of the Digital Thread business unit at the start of FY '22 has driven important initiatives to increase our focus on cross-selling of IoT and AR into the core CAD and PLM customer base.\nFSG had a great Q1 with 6% ARR growth. The expansion deal we recently announced with the U.S. Air Force, both increases and extends this key relationship for up to 5 more years. Contracts like this demonstrate the value that our customers are realizing from Servigistics and other FSG products such as retail PLM and ALM. You may remember, I noted at our Investor Day that having FSG grow in the mid-single digits rather than flat would be a helpful upside growth driver. So I'm pleased to see FSG post another strong quarter.\nLet me run through a couple of quick customer anecdotes to give you a sense for our Digital Thread customers and how they rely on us. On Slide 7, MAN Energy Solutions is the world's top provider of large bore engines in turbomachinery for the maritime and energy industries. The company manufactures complex parts in nearly every engine they make must meet unique customer requirements. Before implementing Creo, they relied on manual outdated processes that slowed design and production. With Creo, they've been able to transition from 2D to a full 3D model-based approach. Creo's broad range of tool path automation capabilities enable them to save time in the programming of the tool pass used to machine the large complex engine parts, greatly increasing efficiency in transitioning from design to production.\nTurning to Slide 8. You may have noticed we announced a deal with -- we announced that the German company, Scheffler, has expanded its relationship with PTC, and I'd like to share a bit of the back story. Scheffler has been a long-time Creo customer and has successfully deployed Windchill within engineering. But back in 2017, one of our PLM competitors announced a large PLM deal with Scheffler that appeared to cap PTC's expansion opportunity. But that system didn't ultimately stick as Scheffler has now decided to consolidate on PTC systems with Windchill being the backbone and is broadly deploying our solutions in their standard out-of-the-box fashion so that Scheffler can participate in the full power of our Digital Thread portfolio. I'm very excited about this collaboration and the further expansion that Scheffler is exploring with our IoT and AR offerings.\nOn Slide 9, you'll see how IMA Group, our global business that delivers packaging machines, services and solutions to a wide variety of industries, was looking for a way to expand their control room offering to help their customers improve overall equipment effectiveness and reduce downtime. As long-time users of PTC's Creo and Windchill, IMA decided that ThingWorx was the ideal IoT solution for their initiative and that Kepware could provide connectivity not only to their machines, but to the other vendors' machines deployed alongside them. IMA has successfully launched new revenue streams by enabling 24/7 monitoring of customer production lines and improved OEE by up to 16%.\nThe Vuforia integrated with ThingWorx is the platform of choice for the U.S. Air Force training initiatives. Slide 10 highlights the work that PTC partner, Vectrona has done with the U.S. Air Force. With finite training resources and limited capacity, the U.S. Air Force set out to incorporate augmented reality into their maintenance and munitions training. Vectrona using Vuforia Studio worked with the U.S. Air Force to create immersive 3D AR experiences for phones, tablets and the HoloLens 2 that are designed to accelerate learning, improve work performance and facilitate remote training. The improved training shows better engagement and information retention with continuous and repeatable task training available regardless of the system or aircraft type.\nTurning to Slide 11, the Velocity [Bus] ARR growth in Q1 was more than 650% due to the inclusion of Arena and 53% organically, which would be Onshape. If you were to add Arena's pre-acquisition results into the prior year to get a better pro forma comparison, then you'd have the Velocity business unit growing at 28% in Q1. That 28% is a mix of Onshape growing at 53% and the larger Arena business growing in the low 20s. Growth of both Onshape and Arena is multiple times higher than market rates, clearly demonstrating that industrial companies see the benefits of SaaS. We continue to ramp investments to expand technology leadership and to broaden the geographic presence of our Velocity businesses.\nOn Slide 12, Beta Technologies, a leading developer of next-generation electric aircraft for the cargo and logistics market, sought a cloud-native product development platform where everyone would be working with one single source of truth without the workflow restrictions of traditional file-based design systems. Beta turned to Onshape because of how it enables real-time collaboration, allowing the engineering team to work from any location while streamlining their communications during the design process. To profile Arena customer, Potrero Medical, on Slide 13, is a predictive health company developing the next generation of medical devices, leveraging smart sensors and artificial intelligence. Potrero needed a scalable quality management system to support its growing product development and compliance needs, including satisfying FDA audit requirements. Arena was the right solution, offering a cloud-native QMS with a quick implementation, leading to ECO cycle time reduction of 30% and nonconformance improvement of 20%.\nAs a final topic, I'd like to give you a quick update on our SaaS acceleration initiative on Slide 14. We've made tremendous progress in the past 90 days since we announced the more aggressive strategy. We've launched our SaaS program management office, which was modeled after the very successful approach we used to drive our subscription transition several years back. Our field organizations transition to the new two-in-a-box customer success organization model without missing a beat.\nWe converged our cloud and tech support organizations with product development to deploy the DevOps type of approach you see in virtually all SaaS companies. We've made good progress advancing our offerings, especially the Windchill multi-tenant version, which will go into production shortly this quarter, and we made good progress preparing the SaaS conversion offerings that will power the hundreds of lift in ships that will happen in the coming quarters and years. We have more work to do, but we're certainly up and running.\nThe time for SaaS has arrived in our industry and PTC is very well positioned. We're already the SaaS leader in our space with continued strong SaaS growth in Windchill and FSG and high levels of growth in our cloud native Velocity business unit. Sharing the Atlas SaaS platform, we have a dual strategy to win with Onshape and Arena powering a new agile product development approach, while we transition our Digital Thread portfolio and existing customer base to SaaS to elevate the platform strategies that so many larger companies have.\nTo wrap up on Slide 15, I'm pleased with PTC's position and the opportunity that lies ahead. Q1 gave us a strong start to what we expect to be our fifth consecutive year of double-digit ARR growth. Our portfolio of products is unique and compelling and obviously aligns well to customer demand. Our results have been consistently strong for many quarters, but we're poised to accelerate growth as the SaaS tailwind blows harder in coming quarters and as we gain more momentum with our IoT and AR initiatives in the back half of the year. We're poised to drive higher levels of profitability, too, following the organizational changes we've already implemented and as our start-up businesses continue to mature up their J curves. The company has never been in a better position to create shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Kristian for more details on the financial results.\n\nKristian P. Talvitie\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, PTC Inc.\n\nThanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review our results, I'd like to note that I'll be discussing non-GAAP results and guidance, and growth rate references will be in both constant currency and as-reported rates.\nSo turning to Slide 17, we delivered constant currency ARR of $1.507 billion, which is 16% growth year-over-year and slightly exceeded our Q1 guidance of $1.5 billion. On an organic constant currency basis, this is 11% growth. FX was an approximate $11 million headwind in Q1, so our as reported ARR was $1.496 billion. Our SaaS products in both the Digital Thread and Velocity business units saw a continued strong growth in Q1, with growth rates similar to what we discussed at our recent Investor Day. This is in combination with continued strong growth of our software-only sales. As of Q1, our SaaS portfolio is now 15% of our total ARR on a constant currency basis.\nQ1 free cash flow of $134 million grew 21% year-over-year and includes $11 million in restructuring and other related payments. Adjusted free cash flow was $145 million and was slightly ahead of the $140 million we discussed at our Investor Day. Q1 revenue of $458 million increased 7% year-over-year. As we've discussed previously, revenue is impacted by ASC 606, so we do not believe that revenue growth rates are indicative of our underlying business performance, but would rather guide you to ARR as the best metric to understand our top line performance and cash collection. FX only impacted revenue by about $1 million in Q1. So our revenue on a constant currency basis was $459 million.\nQ1 non-GAAP operating margin of 35% compared to 36% in Q1 of 2021. While this is a strong result, it's still worth pointing out that because revenue was impacted by ASC 606, other derivative metrics such as gross margin, operating margin and EPS are all also impacted. Suffice it to say that our COGS and OpEx came in in line with our expectations in Q1, and we continue to maintain good discipline on our operating expense structure.\nI would like to point out that our GAAP results reflect a gain of $9.8 million related to our investment in Matterport. And we're also slightly reducing the range for expected P&L charges from approximately $45 million to $50 million, down to $40 million to $45 million for the full year. And coincidentally, we're also reducing the range of expected cash payments for the restructuring and other from what was previously $50 million to $55 million, down to $45 million to $50 million for the full year. For guidance purposes, we will continue to show $50 million as the cash payments and the adjusted free cash flow reconciliation. But as payments come in lower, then we would just expect actual free cash flow to come in higher. There's no change to the $450 million adjusted free cash flow target.\nMoving to Slide 18, I'll begin with our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with cash and cash equivalents of $296 million. In addition, at the end of Q1, we had medium-term investments of $87 million, primarily related to our investment in Matterport. Our gross debt was $1.45 billion with an aggregate interest rate of about 3.2%. In Q1, we used $120 million of cash to repurchase shares. We also had an additional $5 million of repurchases, which settled early in Q2. For the remainder of fiscal '22, we will focus on delevering, and looking forward to FY '23 in an ongoing go-forward basis, assuming our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is below 3x, we will continue to target to return approximately 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases.\nTurning to Slide 19. We post a data table to our IR website that has our financial statements as well as ARR detail by segment. In that file, we share both constant currency and as-reported ARR. As a reminder, when we calculate constant currency, we use our current year plan FX rates and restate history to the same rates. So here, for example, on this slide, you can see our Q1 constant currency ARR of $1.507 billion and the actual as reported ARR of $1.496 billion. This is important to remember in the context of our guidance because we provide guidance at the planned rate. We believe this is the best way to evaluate the top line performance of our business because it removes FX fluctuations from the analysis, positive or negative.\nWith that, I'll move on to guidance on Slide 20. As Jim mentioned, we're raising the low end of our full year constant currency ARR guidance by $10 million. The new range is now $1.625 billion to $1.660 billion. This essentially reflects rolling our Q1 overperformance through the remainder of the year. We're now expecting constant currency ARR growth of 11% to 13% in fiscal '22. It's worth pointing out that based on FX rates at the end of Q1, we would expect a $13 million headwind against that full year ARR guidance. For Q2, we're setting constant currency ARR guidance of $1.540 billion to $1.550 billion. This is 12% organic constant currency growth at the midpoint. On an as-reported basis, the FX impact we're calculating based on the FX rates at the end of Q1 is a $12 million headwind in Q2 compared to the constant currency guidance.\nMoving to free cash flow. We're maintaining our full year free cash flow target of $400 million. This includes approximately $50 million of restructuring and acquisition-related payments. The majority of these payments are related to the reorganization we announced in Q1 with some residual payments primarily related to our Seaport move for which we took the accounting charge in prior periods. So our adjusted free cash flow target for fiscal '22 remains $450 million. Fiscal Q2 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be approximately $155 million. We expect to make approximately $20 million in restructuring and other related payments in Q2, bringing our free cash flow to approximately $135 million.\nMoving to revenue. We're also taking the low end of the full year revenue guidance up by $20 million. This reflects both the strength in software and strength in the professional services business that we saw in Q1 and the related forecasts for the full year. So for fiscal '22, our new revenue guidance range is $1.870 billion to $1.975 billion. The year-over-year growth rate range is now 3% to 9%. Our ASC 606 makes revenue very difficult to predict for on-premise subscription companies, hence the wide range. Note that revenue variability has -- this is from 606, has no impact on ARR or its related cash generation as we continue to primarily bill customers annually upfront regardless of term length. We continue to expect more than 60% of our annual free cash flow generation to occur in the first half of the year. Collections are stronger in the first half, and we expect expenses to increase as we ramp hiring in our SaaS investments throughout the year.\nWe're wrapping up on Slide 21 with the free cash flow model that we use and went into some depth on at our recent Investor Day that you can see here. I know many of you use model free cash flow using the indirect method. However, given the complexities related to revenue recognition due to 606, this is difficult to do. The model we show here has proven quite effective. The table shows fiscal '21 actuals compared to the model we shared at Investor Day compared to our current guidance. Let me take you through the model focusing on the non-GAAP column on the right and starting at the top.\nFirst, we're showing the midpoint of our as reported ARR guidance of $1.630 billion, which is different from the constant currency guidance that we gave due to the $13 million FX headwind and is also $5 million lower than what we showed at the Investor Day. We use as reported here because it's a better reflection of the cash we expect to generate.\nYou can also see that we have increased the perpetual license revenue forecast slightly and also the professional services revenue increase that we mentioned earlier. COGS is slightly higher, reflecting the increased costs to deliver the incremental professional services revenue and the rest of the assumptions remain the same, and we still end up with our target adjusted free cash flow of $450 million. Obviously, this is a model based on assumptions such as the midpoint of the ARR range, the impact of FX, the pace of hiring, et cetera. So if some of those variables change, which they invariably will, the model will have to be adjusted accordingly.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, if cash payments related to the restructuring coming at the low end of the range, we would see a flip from the restructuring line to the free cash flow line, but the adjusted free cash flow target would remain unchanged. But as we sit here today, we think this is a reasonable view of how we expect the year to shape up.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we can begin Q&A."

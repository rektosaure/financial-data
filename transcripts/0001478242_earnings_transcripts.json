revenue of $578 million was up six 8% reported five 9% constant currency.\n\nLet's move down the P&L now adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $949 billion representing.\n\nRepresenting growth of one 1% while year to date, adjusted EBITDA was $2 $742 million thats up and even 2% year over year.\n\nOur third quarter GAAP net income was $331 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1 93.\n\nYear to date, GAAP net income was $846 million or $4 86.\n\nDiluted earnings per share.\n\nAdjusted net income was $515 million for the third quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share with EBIT $3.\n\nYear to date, adjusted net income was $1 billion partnered $80 million or $8.50 per share.\n\nSure.\n\nNow as already noted we had .\n\nnet new bookings this quarter confirming the improved demand environment would start we started to see in the second quarter.\n\nbacklog at September 30, with $32 4 billion up four 1% year over year and next 12 months revenue from backlog was $8 $1 billion that up 4.0% year over year.\n\nReviewing the balance sheet as of September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.814 billion and gross debt was $14 billion $957 million.\n\nIt resulted in net debt of $13.143 billion.\n\nOur net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 352 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA.\n\nAnd third quarter cash flow from operations was $908 million and capital expenditures were $136 million, which resulted in record free cash flow for the quarter of $772 million.\n\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike , who will share details on our guidance Mike.\n\nThanks, Ron and good morning, everyone, let's start with our full year guidance.\n\nWe are confirming our full year 2025 guidance and are narrowing the ranges for revenue adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share and are maintaining the midpoint of our prior guidance.\n\nWe expect revenue to be between $16 billion, and $150 million and $16 billion $250 million representing year over year growth of four 8% to five 5% or five 2% at the midpoint.\n\nThis revenue guidance includes approximately $100 million of Covid related revenue step down entirely in Rds.\n\nApproximately 100 basis points of tailwind from foreign exchange and approximately 150 basis points of contribution from acquisition.\n\nThese assumptions are unchanged from the prior guide.\n\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3 billion $775 million and $3.800 billion.\n\nGrowing two five to three 1% year over year or two 8% at the midpoint.\n\nWe expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $11 85.\n\nAnd $11 95.\n\nSix five to seven 4% versus prior year or about 7% at the midpoint.\n\nYes.\n\nNow turning to the fourth quarter.\n\nWe're expecting revenue to be between $4.204 billion and $4.304 billion, which represents year over year growth of six 2% to eight 7%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.033 billion and $1.058 billion representing.\n\nRepresenting growth of three 7% to six 2% versus prior year.\n\nAnd adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $3 35.\n\n$3 45.\n\nWhich represents year over year growth of seven 4% to 10, 6%.\n\nAnd this guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 27th continue for the balance of the year.\n\nSo to summarize in the third quarter, we delivered strong top and bottom line results as well as record high free cash flow.\n\nnet bookings were $2 $6 billion growing 13% year over year and I think in a net book to Bill ratio of 115 times.\n\nForward looking demand metrics clinical business continued to trend in the right direction.\n\n20% growth year over year and sequential improvements in client decision, making timelines.\n\nTaz performed well and delivered solid results driven by ongoing momentum from drug launches and the strength of our broader commercial portfolio.\n\nAnd we reaffirmed our full year 2025 guidance.\n\nWith that let me hand, it back to the operator for Q&A.\n\nOkay.\n\nAt this time I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question.\n\nStar then the number one on your telephone keypad.\n\nI request that you. Please limit yourself to just one question so that others in the queue may participate as well, we'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\n\nYour first question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nHi, Good morning, Thanks for taking my question I wanted to ask you about what I think you call your C more win more strategy.\n\nAnd how that has played out through the middle of the year or through this year in terms of contributing to the RFP flows improvement that you're highlighting.\n\nAs well as your win rate.\n\nAnd how we should think about.\n\nAnd amount if any.\n\nPrice competitiveness, you're applying in that strategy and how that plays out through the P&L as that business converts to revenue. Thank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nLola.\n\nUsually we keep the best for the last what you start with the .\n\nStrategic question, so, let's let's start with that okay, well look.\n\nThe strike in.\n\nBookings momentum and RFP flow.\n\nWe have to say and we can see through the industry in general.\n\nI think it reflects a reduction in the level of uncertainty.\n\nIn the market environment, and the macro political environment.\n\nThey have been a few developments that have sort of helps.\n\nThe decision, making at large pharma on certain programs favorably.\n\nAnd the climate.\n\nOverall has improved.\n\nThat's undeniable.\n\nSo thats certainly.\n\nis a big driver of our growth.\n\nSpecifics of a C Moore when more strategy.\n\nWhich we started earlier this year.\n\nWhich as you know now has has a lot of.\n\nImitators.\n\nHi.\n\nfoods as well in the Senate.\n\nbin.\n\nLooking at markets that we previously had.\n\nThe reduction and had left some more marginal players essentially.\n\nOkay.\n\nWas the monopoly situation in those segments and we've decided to go after that.\n\nThe pricing conversation is a little bit overdone opinions.\n\nYes.\n\nAlignment where markets.\n\nDynamics were unfavorable with a lot of uncertainty and less deals.\n\nTo be had there was more competition on pricing and all we did.\n\nThe first part of the year was through.\n\nAllowing peoples pricing.\n\nDiscounts.\n\nWe're being offered as opposed to walk away.\n\nContinue to build our book of business.\n\nWe don't see that trend.\n\nTrend continuing it hasnt been an issue at all.\n\nThis past quarter.\n\nTo walk away from deals.\n\nAnd we think that the.\n\nThe sector in general.\n\nIs a lot healthier in terms of market dynamics.\n\nAw of.\n\nCertainty has gone down and pricing has returned to normal levels.\n\nYes.\n\nYes. Good question a follow up on the P&L implications.\n\nLook we have the 32 plus billion dollar backlog and only a tiny portion of that was subject to.\n\nA few.\n\nDiscounts as well.\n\nThe year.\n\nThose the revenue associated with those things that are going to bring overall P&L over the next five years.\n\nAnd we do not expect that to have any impact whatsoever.\n\nOn our P&L going forward.\n\nOkay great.\n\nGreat. Thanks, sorry, I'll stick to the one question. Thank you.\n\nHi, Thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin from Deutsche Bank.\n\nYour line is now open.\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. So our it sounds like the business environment is improving.\n\nFundings up consumer confidence improving.\n\nBoth of the segments Taz in Rds.\n\nOur strengthening at least on a two year stack basis is this.\n\nMomentum that we should expect to continue over the next few quarters and into 2026 and maybe if you just give us a glimpse of how youre thinking about those two.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah, well look.\n\nI can't I don't have a crystal ball here and I'm not going to give your 2026 initiatives.\n\nA clever way of us may have upsides Lindsey guidance, we're not going to do that here as you know we usually.\n\nProvide guidance for the year procurement.\n\nUse of our fourth quarter and full year earnings early in the year. So end of January or early February.\n\nWe are in the midst of our.\n\nplanning process and studio city in October.\n\nAnd but if you look at what I can tell you .\n\nWe are going to deliver this year over 5% in topline revenue.\n\nGrowth, which frankly, given what we've been through.\n\nAnd the environment will be.\n\nIn the past year and a half two years I think.\n\nVery very strong performance and you can see that compared to our larger.\n\nCertainly the larger CLO peers.\n\nWe are doing very very well.\n\nSo.\n\nI cannot tell you yet what 'twenty.\n\n26 will be in the next few quarters for that.\n\nLook I wouldn't be surprised if revenue.\n\nGrowth in is not at least the same or better than.\n\nAnd then the growth that we're seeing this year, so I see that certainly most continents.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nHi, guys. Good morning, Thanks for the question and congrats Ron on your retirement.\n\nI was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the differences between what youre seeing on the pharma side versus the biotech side I think you covered the biotechs that nicely in the chemo with my answer, but just sort of wanted to Peel back the onion, a little bit on the pharma side as well.\n\nIn the large pharma side, yes look.\n\nLarge pharma went through.\n\nA lot of transformation internally in terms of their investment programs.\n\nYou going back to the IRS.\n\nThere was.\n\nThis hold phase of re prioritization of programs and reviews of their pipelines, which led to.\n\nElevated level of cancellations due to this re prioritization activity.\n\nThat lasted.\n\nFor year year, and a half beginning.\n\nMid of 'twenty, three and certainly continued through 'twenty four.\n\nWe see that's a CVT as having essentially been completed.\n\nAnd we haven't seen it.\n\nAny further cancellations as a result of that type of activity.\n\nSo we think that the .\n\nPipeline is on now.\n\n40, sanitized of course, they will continue to be cancellations.\n\nThat's kind of a slow down there all that more business as usual due to futility or other reasons and nothing unusual.\n\nLarge pharma.\n\nActually.\n\nGood RFP flow for our pharma is very strong I mentioned that our RFP for growth year over year is 20%.\n\nAnd that applies to large pharma and to EVP equally as strong strong momentum.\n\nAnd again Thats helped.\n\nCall me.\n\nEnvironment, and perhaps more certainty around what's coming.\n\nAnd it's also helped by decided that this reproach stations have been largely completed and.\n\nAnd the programs that are now on the table our programs at our clients wants to.\n\nTo engaging and want to go forward with.\n\nOur room.\n\nCancellations I always say when.\n\nRecent years' worth about half a billion dollars.\n\nA quarter plus or minus a couple of $100 million. So they could range between three and $700 million.\n\nIn a given quarter.\n\nSo a couple of billion dollars.\n\nRuss.\n\nYoure in Youre out in 'twenty, four we had more than 50% higher.\n\nCancellation does that by over $3 billion in 2004.\n\nMost of these re prioritization from large pharma.\n\nThat's essentially behind us and year to date, our cancellations for the regular.\n\nPopcorn is deemed inspection somewhere between 500 around on average about a filing $60 million.\n\nI saw the numbers.\n\nYesterday.\n\nI think.\n\nNothing much to talk about this quarter.\n\nI think where you'd be towards the higher anecdote about a range, but again not because of reproach stations should be normal wholesale business are also.\n\nBookings were very strong very very strong as Jerome.\n\nAs you can see that also in up to one 6 billion of net.\n\nNet.\n\nBookings, which were up 13% year over year up sequentially.\n\ndigits and.\n\nTrough, we experienced Q1.\n\nHe was the trough, we don't see that.\n\nIn the near term so again large pharma.\n\nDynamics.\n\nReturning to .\n\nNormal business conditions.\n\nTrending towards normal business condition, and biotech funding is improving which is the driver of growth and that again is reflected in our bookings in the RFP flow as well.\n\nAlright, thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking the question.\n\nMaybe if I can ask a little bit about taz.\n\nNice growth against obviously, a tough comp as you think about the pathway forward what do you see as the contributions youre getting from some of your inorganic advancements and where are you.\n\nYou see the best opportunities to continue to expand that business above and beyond your own R&D.\n\nI talk to anything along that vein that'd be great. Thanks.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you Michael.\n\nYou spoke about inorganic I think we said the one in the house.\n\nOur points of contribution from a research company as a whole as you know us.\n\nAlways has been the case.\n\nBulk of that is in.\n\nPause.\n\nYeah.\n\nAlthough I think in this past quarter.\n\nDeeds.\n\nThe large acquisition that was denied.\n\nIn R&D isn't as simple I think that what we spent $485 million that we spent in total and the most most of that.\n\nIs one acquisition.\n\nThe.\n\nOur next oncology, we should say.\n\nAnd Exxonmobil.\n\nEspecially in oncology very attractive business, we acquired this.\n\nEnd of Q3, so not much contribution in Q3.\n\nAnd the inorganic contributions warrant, yes, we'd be a few million dollars I guess.\n\nOkay.\n\nDouble digits like $50 million or thereabouts revenue to R&D, yes in Q4 with respect to , we didn't do much.\n\nIn Q3.\n\nAnd so I guess the acquisition contributions will be Europe.\n\nWell, we think we need to see SMS deal as well right, which is it's small obviously, but.\n\nSince you have some extra small segments. It was the launch of.\n\nPeacefully.\n\nSo not as much in tires in Q3 in general.\n\nWe tried to buy technology companies companies that can add.\n\nsuite of products.\n\nAnd then it picks companies, there's a lot of innovation as you move in the Gi space.\n\nMedical Affairs, yes, they can put up data as real world Real World is a very strong real world evidence was.\n\nReally very very strong in the quarter.\n\nAnd we expect that to continue.\n\nInto the future so.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, I mean for the year.\n\nAgain point than I have.\n\nI would say.\n\n60% of that would be does and correct.\n\nAnd the rest for the year nicely from.\n\n25, and then the rest.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, and I believe it does.\n\nSymbols.\n\nOkay.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nAlright. Thank you alright refresh your question I just want to also commend drawn.\n\nThe one I've seen you retire before it I'm not totally convinced you're gone right now.\n\nRight.\n\nI'll walk through our platform in a refinery.\n\nYes, you've dragged him out of retirement in the past already so I don't know.\n\nAlright.\n\nI want to ask you to talk a little bit about the sub components.\n\nTaz in how they are growing in terms of.\n\nReal world evidence and consulting and analytics and just.\n\nSome of them some of the trends that youre seeing there I know consulting often kind of leads the trend in terms of if you see that picking up that means that the environment is getting better and maybe you could just talk a little bit about each of the components and what youre seeing and maybe what that says about the market.\n\nYeah, So look at the growth rates in Q3, it's hard to.\n\nDerive big trends because.\n\nAs you know Q3.\n\nE General is the weakest quarter in the year, but specifically this year, we had a tough compare with last year was the growth of that.\n\nQ3, lessor was eight 6% or low single basically April 6% growth last year.\n\nSo we knew we had a tough compare this quarter.\n\nBut as I mentioned much luxury remarks sequentially were slightly up and usually because Q3 is the toughest quarter given.\n\nNothing happens for six weeks in Europe.\n\nUsed to be three weeks or now , it's going to eight.\n\nI wish we could hope that it is.\n\nHe is working.\n\nSo.\n\nI think that the performance this quarter was very strong it was largely by the real world evidence, which was very very strong.\n\nAnd everything else.\n\nObviously data is usually low single digits.\n\nNevertheless was between low to mid single digit growth again against .\n\nSoft compares.\n\nHelpful Consulting.\n\nYeah.\n\nAre you seeing a pickup in net consultants call you will recall that.\n\nAnd Boston consulting because it's kind of the most discrete and it's positive.\n\nIn terms of leading indicators.\n\nWhen things were trending.\n\nNegative territory consulting went down very rapidly.\n\nIn the 'twenty four and 'twenty.\n\nthousand three first part of 2004 timeframe.\n\nConsulting was down actually negative.\n\nOne of the worst .\n\nNegative double digits.\n\nBut it was positive this quarter end.\n\nAgain, everything outside real World real World evidence.\n\nIn aggregate.\n\nYou can see what the chips or thereabouts.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is open.\n\nOkay.\n\nI mean.\n\nI'll stick on the tax question here just to make sure we're all.\n\nLevel set for the fourth quarter back in February you guided to six 3% to $6 5 billion.\n\nQuite a while ago a lot of things change but.\n\nIf I use that original range and I take out what you've done year to date that would put.\n\nThe implied fourth quarter revenue guidance about 100 to 300 million below the street on task.\n\nThat's a big range and obviously.\n\nLower number than where consensus wise today. So I'm just hoping you can give us a little specificity on what youre thinking for cats in the fourth quarter ahead of our skies.\n\nYes, Im not sure are you talking about ours.\n\nOur targets and then you talked about the street.\n\nIn your guide.\n\nFebruary six 3% to $6 5 billion.\n\nThe year to date number through three quarters is four eight little over $4 eight so that leaves less than 1.5 to less than 1.7 to get to them.\n\nFull year, if I've done them, yes.\n\nbeen I believe frankly, but what you're suggesting that.\n\nThat ties will be lower than our guidance.\n\nYou bet.\n\nWell, I'm really suggesting anything okay.\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\nYeah, Yeah, I'm, hoping you'll tell us that things have changed since the February numbers, but it is possible that maybe the street is just a little high on the segment I mean, it looks like Youll cover it with Rds in PSM, but I just wanted to I want to make sure we're.\n\nAgain, Eric I think you're right.\n\nWe are delivering on guidance.\n\nEric what will help you with some of the key for details, but on a full year basis has been no change all year because that the full year growth rates are between sort of five 6%. So there is no change there.\n\nAlways says 5% to 6% growth year.\n\nYear over year, correct, and CFS correct, yes exactly.\n\nI think you said five to seven constant currency and.\n\nI think.\n\nI believe it was five to seven on February 6th.\n\n.\n\nWe narrowed we narrowed our guys in the last call there so.\n\nSo we're still sticking with the five to six there is no change from our prior guidance and no change where tax is going to land in a full year okay.\n\nI mean to change them.\n\nThere is no change.\n\nYes, we'll help you with that with the Q4, but there's been no change yeah. Perfect. Thanks, just want to make sure. We're not ahead of our scale I appreciate that very much.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnything else Johan .\n\nOur education.\n\nGo ahead 42 questions, but you told us to stick to one.\n\nNo.\n\nI am wondering what are you a special discount because that wasn't really a question so well.\n\nWell look I mean.\n\nIt was like a commentary.\n\nWe're trying to create.\n\nI appreciate it so I'll take two and I'll take advantage and.\n\nGiven and I will take a mile.\n\nTwo things just quickly when do get some ongoing questions on those couple of Mega trials that you mentioned earlier this year I'm. Just curious if you can tell us what the status is I think one was definitely ramping back up here in the back half and I believe the other was still pushed out till next year.\n\nIt's happening at all can maybe just an update on the Mega trials and then secondarily are you in your in your prepared commentary you you highlighted some interesting wins and you mentioned phase one a couple of times.\n\nMy historic interpretation of past conversations with you Werent really a big phase one trial, maybe you partnered with some others, but I'm.\n\nI'm curious on what your involvement is these days and actually.\n\nManaging or even having phase one.\n\nCPU unit, maybe give us a little more color on what youre doing there. Thanks.\n\nYes.\n\nVery good observation Eric.\n\nWe.\n\nOur senior all demands.\n\nFor phase one.\n\nRich.\n\nAnd we are on that as well.\n\nAs you know we don't have.\n\nThe significant presence in that segment, but we are expanding.\n\nIn the slide shows the highlights a couple of examples each also by the way part of our Seymour read more.\n\nOur strategy.\n\nAnd happens to be that there is more demand seems are getting sourced.\n\nRestarted again and the pipelines are strong.\n\nAnd so we are seeing more demand and we are ourselves being more of a presence in the segments.\n\nBaseline in oncology is a little bit different not dealing with healthy volunteers. So it tends to fee generator business.\n\nOther baseline.\n\nThere is some distinction there and thats, what next oncology with phase one oncology yes.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSuper helpful. Thanks.\n\nYeah, and then the two trials.\n\nNo change there, we don't have anything factored into our fourth quarter guidance for revenue burn from either of them. So I suppose that's a slight change from what we said about it.\n\nBasically all pushed out of the year.\n\nAnd it's not contemplated in the guidance.\n\nBear in mind.\n\nYes.\n\nWe mentioned these.\n\nBut it's like a year ago.\n\nSign because it caused us.\n\nAs upon change our guidance for all of these were fast burning and.\n\nAlready gotten sockets and they were interrupted.\n\nAnd so that caused us to change Allen our guide for Rvs in the fourth quarter for the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nAnd so we have to mentioned we already mentioned.\n\nSpecific trials will be extended we can and we try to be very careful because we are mindful of confidentiality for our clients and so on so we cannot see.\n\nSay very much but we do mention it.\n\nWhen there is a significant.\n\nEvents detached one.\n\nTrial.\n\nIn this case was true.\n\nThat caused us.\n\nTo change anything in our numbers, but bear in mind.\n\nAny point in time, we are working on a couple of thousand trials and.\n\nAnd we can.\n\nBuilding backlog as you saw in the and Thankfully we have had very positive momentum in our bookings and it's continuing.\n\nSo we feel good about that in the.\n\nAnd you continue to stagger.\n\nOn a book of business so.\n\nYes.\n\nWould you have been enabled us to continue to deliver and we've been better on rvs, even without that the trials from zooming tissue.\n\nEric.\n\nI'll give you one more question.\n\nYes.\n\nWell.\n\nOkay.\n\nNext question operator.\n\nThis will be our last question.\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Jeff Garro from Stephens. Your line is open.\n\nYes. Good morning, Thanks for taking the question I wanted to ask more about AI and maybe try and make it a two parter first part being if you have any insights how AI is changing your customers' business models and specifically their appetite for outsourcing and then the second part would be how.\n\nAs IQ via using AI internally to deliver results for clients that may be a little bit more efficiently and whether you have any visibility into potential gross margin improvements from those internal use cases. Thank you.\n\nYes, Thank you Jeff.\n\nWe've spoken about this in the past and so far we have about 90, AIA agents and develop needs that cover.\n\nuse cases, and we continue to.\n\nIs that.\n\nBye.\n\nBy early 2007, we plan to develop 500 highly specialized agents and what this June.\n\nIs there essentially.\n\nIn even named a lot of physical labor from the past that we performed for our clients.\n\nSo clearly the second part of your question first.\n\nThat's really helpful.\n\nImprove our margins longer term now it takes time to be growing obviously.\n\nAnd that's fine too.\n\nTwo teams to translate that into margin improvements.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe've had the.\n\nGreat examples.\n\nOn the commercial side.\n\nWe have.\n\nWe use for example, AI tools and compare patient cohorts to each other.\n\nAnd highlight differences, we natural language outputs, which.\n\nIt leads to improvements in cycle times from several weeks with a couple of weeks.\n\nWe really have a lot of examples and pick your own clients.\n\nJune to recite those but we see significant value in continuing to do more with less room.\n\nagents within our internal processes for our clients I gave a number of examples in my introductory remarks, our clients are very stable of course using AI. So early early on before we get involved in discovery.\n\nThere's a lot of.\n\nOur focus from our clients in the discovery space to try to use AI to solve outs molecules and tried to identify.\n\nThe most like cotton called the most likely to succeed the.\n\nTrials to stockholder of the specific disease.\n\nDolby participate between some models and some tools that we have.\n\nBut.\n\nLes wrong.\n\nThe issue on the clinical side is that it's highly regulated.\n\nAnd you've got to work through them.\n\nStandard processes that are.\n\nDefine spy renovations and .\n\nIntermediary step.\n\nSpaces between those regulatory interactions to utilize and deploy it on other sites, it's very helpful.\n\nAnd.\n\nOur clients are using AI in the form of technology moves that some.\n\nSome of which are all of the tools.\n\nThat would be used commercially.\n\nThey use AI and give you a few examples to manage their promotion campaigns marketing campaigns. These AI to get patient insights in the real World Real World evidence is a big area for us and one of the reasons, we experience such great growth.\n\nWe've got very advanced capabilities, given our robust.\n\nAnd information assets.\n\nIn real World patient data.\n\nUsing AI tools.\n\ntried to evaluate how the drug behaves in the real world using AI becomes a great great opportunity. So these are the areas now with respect to the margin.\n\nAs you know we've had.\n\nLot of the restaurant margin headwinds.\n\nCertainly Europe.\n\nBecause of more pass throughs, largely because of the FX tailwind, which all of which comes with Readouts without profits.\n\nAnd the little bit of the mix, you'll see for example, was stronger and yes, a much lower margin.\n\nSo when you have the market headwinds like that certainly we're counting and unusual.\n\nCost reduction programs offshoring.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAnd longer term AI certain Eni AI enablement will.\n\nwill help mitigate those headwinds and help us to improve margins.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I think you'd see would be available for follow up question goes on.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you for taking your time today.\n\nYes, Mr. Joseph Bank.\n\nNo.\n\nThank you.\n\nThanks for taking the time to join US today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on the 2025.\n\nFull year earnings for the team will be available the rest of the day to take any follow up questions you might have.\n\nThank you.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call you may now disconnect."

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another strong quarter. Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance range as we reported over $4 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in our history. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS came in towards the high end of our guidance range. As expected, TAS continued to perform well in the second quarter supported by clients' commercial rollout strategies and new drug launches. TAS reported revenue growth above our expectations at 8.9% led by double-digit growth in real-world evidence.\nOn the clinical side, our net bookings in the quarter were approximately $2.5 billion, translating to a net book-to-bill of 1.12. Our booking performance improved in the quarter even as the overall market environment remains essentially unsettled, and there is still uncertainty persisting regarding future administration policies affecting the biopharmaceutical industry. Of course, this continues to cause some delays in decision-making on new programs, but the R&D team has reacted to these 2 environments by intensifying our [ See More, Win More ] go-to-market strategy aimed at expanding market gains. This strategy is helping the business navigate [indiscernible], in fact, the R&DS team is seeing good traction from these efforts. Our qualified pipeline was up high single digits sequentially and year-over-year, driven mostly by the EBP segment.\nImportantly, we saw a meaningful uptick in RFP flow. Second quarter RFP flow grew low teens year-over-year and high single-digit sequential will grow in all customer segments. Our [indiscernible] rates improved significantly, most notably in the EBP segment. As a result, our backlog reached a new record of over $32 billion at the end of the quarter, growing over 5% compared to the prior year.\nNow let's move to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong revenue and profit results. Total revenue for the second quarter came in above the high end of our guidance range, representing year-over-year growth of 5.3% on a reported basis and 6.3% if you exclude the COVID-related work from both periods. At constant currency, revenue grew 3.6% and 4.6% excluding COVID. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 2.6%, second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.81 increased 6.4% year-over-year.\nNow let's review a few highlights of business activities. As you know, AI is a big deal for us. We are all in, in this transformation. And as we've discussed before, a lot of work here is done with NVIDIA support. IQVIA is developing AI agents that simplify operations across Life Sciences. In fact, NVIDIA showcased these agents in June at their flagship conference in Europe where our [indiscernible] for our platform was highlighted as a leading example of Smart AI agentification. This collaboration develops custom build AI agents using NVIDIA technology designed to streamline processes, enhance workflows and accelerate insights across the Life Sciences ecosystem. Use cases for these agentic offerings include targeted identification, clinical data review, literature review, market assessment and [indiscernible]. This momentum has not gone unnoticed, reflecting the strength of our AI strategy and execution.\n[ Everest Group ] recently named IQVIA is [ France Roan ] generative AI leader for the Life Sciences industry in its reserve reports, AI [indiscernible] Action, [ Operationalizing generative AI ] in Life Sciences. IQVIA was the only CRO to receive the highest ranking of front running in this report, which measures the value impact of end-to-end general AI capabilities for 15 carefully selected broad-based AI companies, CROs and Life Science specialties and niche process.\nLet me now give you some color on [ PAP ] business activity. A top 10 pharma clients selected IQVIA to advance their market access strategy for breakthrough-type 1 diabetes therapy entering Europe. By leveraging AI-driven insights and pricing expertise, IQVIA will help shape the value proposition, pricing and contracting approach to support successful adoption. The European biotech client selected IQVIA to support the global launch of a novel oncology therapy. IQVIA is delivering a Gen-AI powered assistant and [ HCP Vesola ] insights. This solution will enable simulation of [ HCP ] behavior and precise targeting showcasing IQVIA's unique blend of data, AI-enabled technology as well as our expertise in product launch and the specific oncology therapeutic area.\nThe top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA a strategic engagement to support the launch of a novel oncology therapy in the U.S. delivering insights and technology infrastructure to ensure commercial success. The top 10 pharma client selected IQVIA to lead a global real-world safety and effectiveness study for a new dermatology treatment spanning 8 countries and 3,000 patients, which will support product adoption and long-term evidence generation. The European biotech company awarded IQVIA, a global observational study to assess the real safety and effectiveness of a rare disease therapy in kidney disorders. The win highlights IQVIA's rail disease expertise, strong client partnership and use of AI tools to optimize [indiscernible] design and deliver.\nMoving now to R&DS. We continue to win a significant portion of oncology-related trials, our leadership in oncology research is exemplified by our recently announced strategic collaboration with [ Sara Hannan ] Research Institute, one of the late nation's leading oncology research hospital network. This strategic cooperation aims to transform oncology trials globally by [indiscernible] IQVIA's scale and connected intelligence with [ CRI ], deep [indiscernible] oncology expertise, we are aiming to accelerate trial activation, boost recruitment and streamline data capture of electronic health records ultimately removing operational barriers and speeding and delivery of breakthrough therapies to [indiscernible] Patients.\nA few examples of significant wins the R&DS team has in the oncology space. [indiscernible] client selected IQVIA to lead the complex global Phase III colorectal cancer program. IQVIA was selected due to our oncology therapeutic expertise, proven track record, knowledge of the regulatory landscape and our analytics capabilities. The rapid disclaiming biotech selected IQVIA to meet 2 Phase III global pancreatic oncology trials continuing a high-performing partnership with this client. A large pharma client selected IQVIA to lead a global Phase III MTS oncology trial, considering our successful collaboration with these clients on these assets.\nObesity is another therapeutic area where our performance has been particularly strong. The [indiscernible] client selected IQVIA to the 2 global Phase III obesity trials leveraging our vast footprint and deep expertise in chronic weight management. The top 10 pharma clients selected IQVIA laboratories to support expansion of their next-generation GLP-1 development program building on an existing partnership to investigate the drug's efficacy [indiscernible], obesity and type 2 diabetes.\nI also want to highlight our growing strength in cell and gene therapy trials. IQVIA was selected to manage a significant gene editing program for [ Wilson ] disease, spanning both observational and interventional studies. The project deploys AI-enabled solutions that drive speed and precision in rare disease research. Finally, we were honored to be recently recognized for our innovation in facilitating decentralized trials. IQVIA was named winner of the best mobile apps for patient engagement as the 2025 [indiscernible] awards. [indiscernible] power stations and caregivers to participate in decentralized trials from anywhere while ensuring strong privacy and security. The app has mostly support and is available across many geographic regions, increasing patient access, engagement and retention.\nAnd now to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & Interim CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. We'll start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $4.017 billion with up 5.3% on a reported basis and 3.6% in constant currency. Excluding closer related work from this year and last, revenue grew 6.3% at actual currency and 4.6% constant currency.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.628 billion. That's up 8.9% on a reported basis to 6.8% in constant currency. R&D Solutions set reported revenue was $2.201 billion, up 2.5% reported and 1.3% constant currency. Excluding the step-down in COVID related revenues, R&DS revenue growth was 4.2% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Lastly, Contract Sales in Medical Solutions second quarter revenue was $188 million, and that was up 9.3% reported and 6.4% at constant currency.\nFor the first half, total company revenue was $7.846 million, up 3.9% reported and 3.5% at constant currency. And excluding COVID related work, revenue grew 4.8% at actual currency and approximately 4.5% in constant currency. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $3.174 billion, up 7.7% [indiscernible] [ 7.2% ] in constant currency. R&D Solutions first half revenue of $4.303 billion was up 1.4% reported and 1.2% constant currency and excluding COVID related work from both periods, revenue in R&DS grew 3.1% in actual currency and approximately 3% at constant currency for the half. Lastly, at CSMS the first half had revenue of $369 million, up 2.2% reported and 1.9% at constant currency.\nOkay. Moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $910 million for the second quarter. First half adjusted EBITDA was $1.793 billion. Second quarter GAAP net income was $266 million in GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.54. For the first half, GAAP net income was $515 million or $2.94 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $486 million for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.81, up 6.4%. For the first half, adjusted net income was $965 million or $5.50 per diluted share. that being up 6.2% year-over-year.\nR&DS backlog at June 30 was $32.1 billion, an increase of 5.1% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog was $8.1 billion, growing 4.8% year-over-year. [indiscernible] reviewed balance sheet metrics now. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.039 billion and gross debt was $15.490 billion, and that resulted in net debt of $13.451 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.61x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.\nSecond quarter cash flow from operations was $443 million and capital expenditure of $151 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $292 million. And you saw in the quarter that we repurchased $607 million of our shares, which brought our first half share repurchase activity to above $1 billion. This leads us with approximately $2 billion of repurchase authorization remaining under our current program. Also in the quarter, we issued $2 billion of senior notes maturing in 2032.\nNow let's turn to the guidance. We're narrowing our guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share as follows: we expect revenue to be between $16.100 billion and $16.300 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 4.5% to 5.8%. We're just over 5% at the midpoint. This guidance includes year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately 100 basis points. We continue to assume about $100 million step down in COVID-related work and approximately 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity for the full year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.750 billion to $3.825 billion. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $11.75 and $12.05, that's up 5.6% to 8.3% versus prior year or about 7% at the midpoint.\nOkay. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $4.025 billion and $4.100 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $935 million to $955 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.92 and $3.02. Both this quarterly guidance and our full year guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of yesterday, July 21 continues to the balance of the year.\nTo summarize, in Q2, we delivered strong revenue and profit results towards or above the high end of our expectation. TAS business unit, in particular, reported revenue above budget and R&DS, despite the [indiscernible] continued uncertainty on the industry, the team here has responded well, improving win rates and expanding shareholders together contributed stronger bookings and a record backlog in the quarter. Forward-looking metrics for our R&DS offerings remain positive, including a significant [indiscernible] that we saw in RFP flow. We saw strong demand in the quarter for our senior note issuance and finally, we ramped up our share repurchase activity in the quarter, which brought first half repurchases to above $1 billion.\nAnd with that, let me hand it back the operator [indiscernible] for Q&A."

I'll then provide perspectives on the market, including our understanding of the possible effects of recent U.S. dubitative, how we are well positioned to navigate these near-term challenges, and finally, why we remain confident about the industry's resilience and prospects. I'll close by highlighting a few important wins in the first quarter. So let's get started.\nWe delivered strong revenue and profit results at the high end of our expectations despite a continued challenging environment in R&DS. Total revenue for the first quarter came in above the high end of our guidance range, representing year-over-year growth of 2.5% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. And compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line about 4.5% on a constant currency basis, including about a couple of points of contribution from acquisitions. First quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 2.4%. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.70 increased 6.3% year-over-year.\nLet me share some details on the market landscape and the demand metrics received for each segment. Starting with TAS. The business continued the strong recovery trend we saw exiting last year as our clients are launching new drugs and are executing on their commercial road maps. It is in times like these where there is some uncertainty in the biopharmaceutical sector that we really see the value of the scale, diversification and differentiation of IQVIA's portfolio of offerings. Its grid is contributing over 40% of our revenue. TAS revenue growth actually came in above our expectations at 6.4% reported and 7.6% at constant currency, led by double-digit growth in real-world evidence.\nOn the clinical side, as we expected, the near-term market environment continues to be bumpy. We experienced delayed decision-making by customers on new programs, reflecting the heightened macroeconomic and industry sector caution. In fact, our average time from RFP issuance to award in the quarter increased by approximately 10% both year-over-year and sequentially. We believe that this is the result of the sector uncertainty caused by the pronouncements of the new administration, the precise effects of which are unknowable at this point. Several of our clients are slowing or reevaluating programmatic decisions until there is better visibility.\nAlso reflecting concerns the funding environment for EBPs, especially for early stage, has deteriorated. While the R&DS business is experiencing some turbulence, our demand metrics remain positive. Our backlog reached a new record of $31.5 billion at the end of the quarter, growing 4.8% compared to the prior year. Our first quarter RFP flow improved mid-single digits year-over-year and high single digits sequentially. Our qualified pipeline is up low single digits year-over-year driven mostly by good growth in large pharma.\nNow obviously, the demand environment is impacted by the proposed changes that has been signaled by the new U.S. administration. The White House initiatives relative to our industry sector can be grouped into 3 categories: tariffs; agency actions, particularly HHS and FDA-related; and drug pricing.\nStarting with tariffs. When the President announced plans to initiate the reciprocal tariff program, the pharmaceutical industry received certain exemptions. However, following the announcement, the Department of Commerce began a national securitization of the life sciences industry, which may result in tariffs, specifically to the pharma sector. Now IQVIA's direct exposure to tariffs is limited primarily to certain supplies in our laboratory business and is immaterial financially. We understand that industry-specific tariffs, if implemented, may have a more direct impact on our customers. However, it is too early to assess what that impact may be.\nWith respect to agency actions, HHS announced a number of initiatives, including NIH delays and cancellations of government contracts, along with establishing a 15% cap on indirect costs. Now to be clear, IQVIA has no clinical trial contracts with BARDA and no COVID-19 contract sponsored by the government. So our exposure there is 0. That said, we have excellent relationships with these agencies, including BARDA. TAS have a minimal amount of business with the government, and we do not expect any of this to have any impact at all.\nThe NIH funding cap relates to direct administrative and overhead costs. It aims aligning those indirect costs to the same levels as private foundations. This has no impact on direct costs for research funding, and therefore, 0 impact on us.\nRegarding the FDA, there have been numerous restructuring actions announced, which has impacted a significant portion of the workforce. These reductions in force primarily targeted overhead and support functions, such as planning, training, travel, communications and records management. Importantly, core products review teams responsible for evaluating new drugs, vaccines and medical devices, which are primarily funded by the industry, were largely preserved to maintain the FDA's essential regulatory functions. To date, we have no evidence of any trial or approval delays. Whatever total disruptions there may be in nonapproval-related interactions with FDA staff, we expect this to normalize.\nFDA Commissioner Makary has announced his intention to reduce annual testing in favor of a -based models and enhanced usage of real-world evidence in the approval process. We applaud this and we see these actions proposed by Commissioner Makary as benefiting our industry. They will enable clients to move prospects faster into clinical trials. The increased use of real-world evidence, not only in preclinical work but also in Phase II and Phase III trials, plays to IQVIA's strength. Ultimately, this is positive news for EBP companies which develop over 50% of the drugs in clinical trials.\nFinally, on drug pricing. The U.S. administration recently issued an executive order regarding the role of PBMs, pricing transparency and Medicare costs. These initiatives are still in their early stages, and some provisions may require irrational approval. The impact of these potential actions is difficult to ascertain at this point because the specifics have not been determined.\nThe 2 aspects that could actually be very positive for the industry. First, the proposal to do away with the so-called fill penalty provision in the IRA with subject small molecule drugs to CMS pricing review after only 9 years versus 13 years for large molecule drugs. This is key for pharma clients as 50%, 50% of the drug's value is realized in years 9 to 13. Second, the focus on drug pricing, treatment value and comparative effectiveness drives the need for earlier clinical results and more real-world evidence.\nSo in summary, some of our customers have slowed down their decision-making processes, as you would expect, and we experienced deals in RFPs moving to contracts in the first quarter. An unusually high number of EBP awards that were contracted in the quarter were not included in our bookings because funding has not been secured yet. Now we are confident that our industry will successfully manage this period uncertainty and will find ways to adapt. The life sciences industry has consistently demonstrated its resilience, overcoming macroeconomic obstacles and driving in changing environments, and IQVIA is particularly well positioned to navigate this marketplace. We believe when everything is said and done, key decision-makers will recognize the industry is a strategic sector for the U.S. that deserves to be strongly supported. U.S. companies in the biopharmaceutical sector have maintained strong global leadership in biomedical discovery and clinical research.\nOur sector serves as an extraordinary engine of innovation. It was responsible for 46% and 634 novel drugs approved globally over the past decade, confirming strong U.S. leadership. The U.S. is responsible for 61% of global pharmaceutical sales of branded drugs, which is up from 56% a decade ago. The sector invests almost $200 billion annually in research and development and drives economic growth, contributing $1.65 trillion of economic output annually. It supports direct and indirect employment of highly skilled, highly educated workers, growing nearly 5 million people at an average of $157,000 annually, which is double the national average. In fact, many non-U.S. large pharma companies have leased their primary R&D centers to the U.S. to take advantage of the talent pool. And of course, the biopharmaceutical industry provides substantial societal benefit by improving health outcomes and extending life expectancy.\nNow before I turn it over to Ron, let me give you a little bit of color on business activity in the quarter, and I'll be brief and just mention a few salient examples. As the revenue numbers show, TAS disc in the quarter. We won a number of partnerships with clients that are launching new products, for example, a large project for an important EBP client that's launching their first product and the first-ever treatment for low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. We also won a launch partnership with another EBP, leveraging our AI-powered patient relationship manager platform for a groundbreaking treatment for a rare condition in an underserved patient community. We were selected to support a midsized pharma client with an omnichannel campaign that includes KPIs designed to improve patient engagement.\nOur commercial technology suite continues to be successful in the marketplace. Our World Wide Smartphone app, which is a proprietary quality management system, displays the impotent as an EBP client. In the medtech space, we secured a significant contract to deploy integrated information solutions to help our clients streamline operations and decision-making.\nLet me skip a few more of these and move to R&DS. We achieved notable wins across customer segments. As you recall, last year, we reused all 22 of our strategic partnerships with large pharma clients, and we expect to scope in half a dozen of them. We have been awarded significant contracts from these partnerships. For example, in the quarter, a top 5 pharma client that has selected IQVIA as a preferred partner awarded us 4 early-stage under the new model. IQVIA was selected by a top 20 pharma client to support a Phase III obesity program across 8 studies. Our best-in-class clinical trial technology solutions and industry-leading expertise were key factors in securing this deal.\nA top 10 pharma client selected IQVIA's pharma acquisition offerings to achieve a significant reduction in case processing time and agency and manage the increasing volume. We secured a contract teeline to on a Phase II trial for an innovative treatment for patients with prominently hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease. The customer selected IQVIA deep our deep technology expertise, delivery model and partnership-focused approach.\nLastly, Mike mentioned our progress with AI. You may recall, we announced our collaboration with NVIDIA earlier in the quarter. We are progressing as planned to deploy highly specialized industry AI agents. So far, we moved over 20 agents into production, covering 3 use cases in each of the commercial, real-world and R&DS tenants. We are seeing positive results and productivity gains in areas where these AI agents have been deployed. For example, 1 Agentic system in commercial allows us to reduce delivery time by 2/3 from 12 weeks to 4 weeks with a net 30% cost reduction. We plan to scale up from these 3 use cases to 12 by the end of the second quarter and 4 use cases by the end of the year.\nAnd now to Ron for more details on this.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & Interim CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.829 billion grew 2.5% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. quarter, we had virtually no correlated revenue versus over $40 million in last year's first quarter. Adjusting for this COVID, constant currency growth was about 4.5%. So as Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points of this growth than majority of this in the TAS segment.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.546 billion. That was up 6.4% reported and 7.6% constant currency. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue was $2.102 billion, up 0.3% reported and 1.1% constant currency, excluding COVID-related only 3% constant currency. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $181 million declined 4.2% reported and 2.1% at constant currency.\nMoving down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $883 million for the quarter, average growth of 2.4% year-over-year. First quarter GAAP net income was $249 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.40. Adjusted net income was $479 million for the first quarter, up 2.1% year-over-year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6.3% to $2.70. R&DS backlog at March 31 was $31.5 billion, an increase of 4.8% year-over-year and 4.6% at constant currency. Next 12 months revenue from this backlog is $7.9 billion.\nReviewing the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled [ $140 ] million and gross debt was $14.330 billion, resulting in net debt of $12.590 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.40x 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was $568 million in CapEx with $142 [ million ], resulting in strong free cash flow of $426 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $425 million of our shares. This leaves us with approximately $2.6 billion remaining under the current program.\nLet's turn to guidance now. You saw we're raising our full year revenue guidance by $275 million. This to reflect more favorable foreign currency exchange rates since was guided. We now expect revenue to be between $16 billion and $16.4 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of [ 3.9% ] to 6.5% on a reported basis or 5.2% growth at the midpoint. This guidance now includes a year-over-year FX tailwind of approximately 50 basis points compared to about 150 basis points of headwind in our previous guidance. We continue to assume approximately $100 million of step-down in COVID-related work and about 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity for the full year.\nWe are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.755 billion to $3.885 billion as FX changes had a negligible impact on EBITDA. This represents year-over-year growth of 2.2% to 5.5%. We're also reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which continues to be $11.70 to $12.10. That's up 5.1% to 8.7% versus the prior year or 6.9% growth at midpoint.\nNow let's go through the second quarter guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.925 billion and $4 billion, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $895 million and $915 million and adjusted diluted EPS to be between $2.72 and $2.83. Both this guidance for the second quarter and our full year guidance assume that foreign currency rates as of May 5 continue for the balance of the year.\nSo to summarize, in Q1, we delivered strong revenue and profit results at the high end of our expectations. We had a very solid free cash flow, up 89% -- at 89% of adjusted net income. The TAS business continued to achieve above-target performance with revenue growth of 7.6% at constant currency, and R&DS bookings were affected by delayed decision-making by customers on new programs and lower EBP funding, reflecting incremental macroeconomics in the industry sector uncertainty. That set forward-looking indicators for our R&DS offerings, such as qualified pipeline, RFP flow and backlog continue to grow.\nWe're progressing as planned to deploy a new highly specialized industry AI agents, and we've identified over 40 use cases and scale of deployment across the portfolio in 2025. In the quarter, we repurchased $425 million of our shares. And lastly, we raised our full year revenue guidance by $275 million to reflect changes in FX. And of course, we reaffirmed our cost guidance.\nSo with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open the session for questions and answers. Hello? Operator?"

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, you may now begin your conference.\n\nKerri Joseph\n\nSVP of Investment Relation & Treasury\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2024 Earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock Beda, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Perrone, Senior Director Investor Relations.\nToday, we'll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our quarter and full year 2024 results. Great to see many of you in person in our December Investor Day at Innovation Park headquarters. I hope this helps you appreciate the depth and breadth of our offerings as we showcased product demos and for some of our industry-leading laboratories.\nIn fact, a number of you commented to me afterwards that they left with a deeper understanding of the breadth and depth of our capabilities and how our strategy to improve patient outcomes is being executed. As we close 2024, we delivered solid full year results on revenue growth of 5.5% at constant currency, excluding the adjusted earnings per share growing over 9% and free cash flow of $2.1 billion, which represents growth of 41% versus last year as well as 104% of adjusted net income.\nI'm very proud of the results the IQVIA team was able to deliver in an industry that faced significant challenges in 2024. We saw the consequences of the Inflation Reduction Act, which led to delayed customer decision-making, reduce discretionary spend and portfolio reprioritizations.\nAdditionally, we had a challenging macro environment that persisted with geopolitical unrest, continued high interest rates and inflation, foreign currency headwinds and questions about the impact of political elections in the U.S. and around the world, all of which created a tremendous amount of noise and incremental uncertainty.\nIn fact, very few companies in our broader industry sector achieved positive growth, and IQVIA really stood out as an outperformer. More specifically, in the fourth quarter, we saw that we have strong operational results. Revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range, representing about 4.5% growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related. We delivered just under 10% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, and we achieved a record quarter of free cash flow.\nOn the clinical side, net new bookings for the quarter were over $2.5 billion, and this all highlights the great work that was done by our R&DS team in securing new business contracts. This helped mitigate the outsized level of cancellations that did materialize in the quarter, just as we had anticipated.\nNow despite the tough macro environment, the R&DS business had some significant achievements in 2024, we successfully renewed all of our large pharma strategic partnerships this past year, even as many clients reevaluated and consolidated their alliances. In addition, we established new relationships, displaced incumbents and expanded the scope of work in several partnerships positively positioning our business for future growth.\nIQVIA has partnerships with 22 of the top 25 pharma companies. We made significant advancements in our global health business. For example, we help the World Health organization control polilo virus outbreaks in Africa. We collaborated with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, in, so we were able to respond swiftly to a virus disease upgrade. Finally, we were selected by to expedite a vaccine trial for MPOX in Sabsaharan and Africa addressing a critical outbreak and unmet medical need. This all comes to show that whenever there is a crisis, IQVIA is a company public health officials turned to. Now moving to The growth trajectory materialized just the way we said it would, low single-digit growth in the first half and gradually ramping up each quarter.\nIn fact, growth exceeded our expectations in the second half. Obviously, this was helped by easier compares versus the second half of 2023, but we also had stronger organic demand than expected across all subsegments with real world actually returning to double-digit growth.\nWe finished the year with constant currency growth of 5.7% and about 6.5% excluding the COVID step down, which was at the high end of our guidance. We expect to sustain this favorable trend into 2025.\nReflecting on 2024, we're proud of we achieved in a couple of business highlights. We introduced 60 innovations this past year, including 39 AI-enabled applications. For example, we introduced IQVIA AI assistance our first-ever GenAI interface. It allows customers to interact with a growing number of our products and get answers to their questions almost instantly.\nWe launched a number of AI-enabled patient offerings, including our patient relationship manager, which has already been deployed at 8 clients, including 3 top 10 pharma. Our digital business, which was largely the U.S. has begun expanding into Europe, where we've doubled the number of websites, publishers and partners that are now integrated into our digital network.\nNow looking at 2025, we are reaffirming the guidance we provided to you at the December Investor Day. On the top side, things have continued to recover as we anticipated. On the R&DS side, we still have some volatility, so we might see another quarter or 2 of fluctuating demand and elevated cancellations.\nBut we think the bulk of the portfolio reprioritizations at large pharma has been completed. In fact, we feel good about the R&DS demand environment because leading indicators continue to be favorable. For example, our Q4 RFP flow was up mid-single digits, a little higher actually in the segment. Our qualified pipeline is also up with positive growth across all segments. EDP funding, as you noted, was strong through 2024. Full year biotech funding was over $100 billion, which is 44% higher than it had been in 2023.\nNow we did have much higher cancellations in 2024 than ever before. In fact, nearly 50% higher in 2024 than the average of the previous 3 years, but our gross new bookings before cancellations for 2024 were even stronger and up mid-single digits at constant currency versus 2023, which led to an end-of-year backlog of $31.1 billion, which is, again, at constant currency, 5.5% higher than a year ago.\nNow turning to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and it's truly income-related work from both periods. We grew the top line about 4.5% on a constant currency basis. And that included in the quarter about 2 points of contributions from acquisitions, mostly on the side.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 3.1%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost margin discipline, which resulted in 20 bps of margin expansion. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $3.12 increased 9.9% year only. Let me now give you some color on business activity. IQVIA's success is achieved by continuing to raise the bar in innovation every year and investing in highly differentiated capabilities.\nYou saw the recent announcement of our collaboration with NVIDIA to transform health care life sciences to advance AI solutions. AI has the potential to transform our industry. For example, by addressing lengthy and complex processes in clinical trials or on the commercial side by helping expedite diagnosis and improve treatment adherence by patients.\nOur collaboration with NVIDIA will help accelerate the introduction of AI agents within our workflows with AI agents essentially becoming digital companions to researchers, HCPs and patients. Let me give you some more examples of what was achieved in the quarter, and let me start with TAS.\nThe business is rapidly evolving as we see increasing demand for integrated solutions that combine information, analytics and services. This is enabling us to win much larger longer-term deals with our clients because of our unique ability to deliver this combined offerings.\nI'll give you a few examples. IQVIA was awarded a strategic partnership to deliver omnichannel marketing solutions to promote a top 10 pharma clients established portfolio. IQVIA utilize analytics, information technology and commercial outsourcing capability. IQVIA is also partnering with a biotech company to launch a new treatment for ovarian cancer, which would be our clients first product in market. This large deal leverages IQVIA's comprehensive commercial capabilities and expertise to execute regulatory process, launch and commercial activities.\nAnother EBP clients asked IQVIA to support them in launching a new cell therapy for a severe pediatric condition by providing the full comprehensive commercial infrastructure, and that includes field sales, medical and commercial communications, compliance and OCE, a large pharma client engaged IQVIA to simplify data management by integrating the verse sources from all over 3 country 30 countries, reducing complexity and enhancing efficiency.\nIQVIA will support the client's information strategy to stream our operations and centralize its global information into a single standardized system that we will be operating. Moving now to real world. IQVIA is using advanced AI to support a top 10 pharma client to demonstrate efficacy for gastric cancer treatment and gain approval in new markets.\nThe top 10, 15 pharma clients chose IQVIA to help track disease and treatment efficacy in support of various regulatory submissions in Europe. Let me move now to ARDS. I earlier noted the success of our ARDS team, and I want to highlight some notable wins that represent our capabilities across segments therapeutic areas and operational dynamics.\nLet me start with large pharma. The top 5 pharma client selected IQVIA to conduct a complex full-service Phase III study, addressing asthma and COPD patients. We won another full service global Phase II breast cancer study for a top 30 pharma. Another top 10 pharma clients awarded IQVIA large FSP contract. This award is notable because we displaced 2 large, long-time incumbent CROs. Medtech. IQVIA was award in a study to evaluate a novel medical device specifically targeting the cardiovascular condition.\nBiotech, few notable awards include a critical Phase III oncology study based on our strong data-driven approach and ability to manage global complex trials efficiently. Another global study, full-service study for another biotech clients for progressive pulmonary fibrosis disease, which involves nearly 1,000 patients in 26 countries, and again, we're able to win this based on our global footprint and therapeutic expertise, a Phase II trial for rare CNS conditions with limited previous research. Lots of success in the marketplace with large pharma, MedTech and EBP. Now before passing the call over to Ron for a more detailed review of our financial results, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for their extraordinary over this past year. It was challenging,, a great team. We also received amazing recognitions throughout the year. I just want to highlight a few.\nFor us at award IQVIA the 2024 global customer value leadership award for excellence in AI quality and regulatory solutions in health care. IQVIA's smart sold enterprise QMS was recognized for best use of AI in health care by the medtech breakthrough awards. My green lab awarded IQVIA Laboratories, the 2024 race-to-zero leadership award for certifying 100% of of our. We received recognition as a leader in Forbes world's best health care and life sciences management. And lastly, for the eighth year in a row, IQVIA was named one of the world's most admired companies in Fortune's annual survey. And importantly, for the fourth year in a row, IQVIA was named the #1 most admired company in our category of health care pharmacy and other services.\nIn addition, IQVIA earned #1 ranking in the categories of innovation, global competitiveness, people management and use of corporate assets.\nNow Ron will give you more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & Interim CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,958 million, grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $10 million, which is down about $50 million versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID-related work, both from this year and from last, constant currency growth was about 4.5%.\nAnd as Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points of this growth. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.658 billion, which was up 8.3% reported and 9.5% constant currency. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2.123 billion was down 1.3% reported and 1% at constant currency, but excluding all COVID-related work, R&DS revenue grew over 1% at constant currency. And finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $177 million declined 4.8% reported and 3.2% at constant currencies.\nFor the full year, our revenue was $15.405 billion, that's up 2.8% reported and 3.4% at constant currency. COVID-related revenue totaled approximately $110 million for the year. Excluding all COVID-related work from this year and last, constant currency growth and revenue was 5.5% for the year.\nFull year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $6.150 billion, that was up 5.1% reported 5.7% at constant currency and 6.5%, excluding all COVID-related work at constant currency. Full year revenue in R&D Solutions was $8,527 million, up 1.6% on a reported basis, 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth in constant currency in R&DS was over 5%.\nAnd finally, our full year CSMS revenue was $780 million, down 1.2% reported but up 1.4% at constant currency. As already mentioned in his opening remarks, the 2024 growth trajectory in TAS played out as we anticipated with improvements every quarter. And we had -- as we experienced a softening growth rate throughout 2023 due to cautious customer discretionary spending and we predicted that 2024 would be a turnaround year based on our forward-looking indicators in recent history.\nIn fact, that's what happened in 2024, cash growth picked up significantly, finishing the second half with high single-digit growth, driven by strong mid-single-digit organic growth. So as you know, TAS is a short-cycle part of our business. And as we've seen, 2023 gave us early insight into customer spend behavior during the downturn. By the same token, we expect that the 2024 turnaround in TAS surge as a good leading indicator of the industry's recovery for 2025.\nLet's move down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $996 million, representing growth of 3.1%. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.684 billion. That's up 3.2% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $437 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.42. For the full year, GAAP net income was $1.373 billion or $7.49 of earnings per diluted share.\nAdjusted net income was $564 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.12 and that, for the full year, brought adjusted net income to $2.042 billion in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $11.13. R&DS backlog at December 31 was $31.1 billion, an increase of 4.4% year-over-year and 5.5% at constant current states. And do you anticipate the question that I think we'll get about why backlog was flat sequentially versus Q3. Recall that the dollar strengthened considerably during the fourth quarter, and we have to retranslate the backlog at the end of each quarter for reporting to you and not about $0.5 billion off the backlog, that retranslation alone.\nAs of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.702 billion and gross debt was $13.983 billion, resulting in net debt of $12.281 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 3.33x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $885 million, and CapEx was $164 million, resulting in free cash flow of $721 million for the quarter, a record for quarterly free cash flow.\nFor the full year, free cash flow was $2.140 billion, as Ari said, up 41% year-over-year. Now you note that in the quarter, we repurchased $1.103 billion of our shares bring our full year share repurchase to $1.350 billion. And just yesterday, actually, Board of Directors replenished the share repurchase authorization by $2 billion, which increases the total remaining authorization to approximately $3 billion.\nLet's turn to the guidance. For the full year, we're reaffirming our 2025 outlook, which is for revenue growth at constant currency ex COVID of 4% to 7%, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of up to 20 basis points, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5% to 9%. This translates into total revenue between $15.725 billion and $16.125 billion, which includes just over a $100 million step down in COVID-related work, which is entirely in R&DS and of which 75% will be in the first half and 25% in the second half.\nWe expect 100 to 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and an FX headwind should rates continue of approximately 150 basis points versus 2024. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.765 billion to $3.885 billion and adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $11.70 to $12.10. This includes about $675 million of net interest expense, approximately $575 million of operational D&A an effective income tax rate of about 18.5% and an average diluted share count of approximately 178 million shares.\nThe guidance also assumes $2 billion of cash deployment split between acquisitions and share repurchase. And finally, the guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 5 continue for the balance of the year. From a segment level guidance is also unchanged for TAS, R&DS and CSMF, no changes in any of the segments. We expect TAS revenue to grow 5% to 7% at constant currency, which translates into $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion.\nI note we'll have easier comps in the first half than the second half. R&DS revenue is expected to grow 4% to 6% at constant currency ex COVID, which translates into $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion of revenue. This guidance includes over $100 million of step-down and COVID-related revenue that represents about 100 basis points of headwind to R&DS growth rate. We anticipate that R&DS growth rates will be lower in the first half and improved sequentially thereafter. A final CSMS revenue is expected to be approximately $700 million and flattish year-over-year.\nNow let's look at first quarter guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.740 billion and $3.790 billion. Note that Q1 has the largest impact in the year for both foreign exchange and COVID revenue step down for a total of approximately 300 basis points of headwind.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $870 million and $890 million in the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.60 and $2.70. And as mentioned, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates of February 5 continue for the balance of the year.\nSo let's summarize. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter, which closed out a strong year. For the full year, revenue grew 5.5% at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Adjusted EBITDA margin continued to expand and adjusted diluted EPS was up 9.1%. Free cash flow was a record in the quarter of $721 million, bringing the full year to over $2.1 billion, up 41%.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $1.150 billion of our shares. For the full year, share repurchase was $1.350 billion. Our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by $2 billion, which brings the remaining authorization to approximately $3 billion.\nDuring the year, we introduced 60 innovations, including 39 AI-enabled applications and the momentum continues to build with our recently announced collaboration with NVIDIA. IQVIA was named a Fortune's list of World Trust admired companies for the eighth consecutive year and earned first place ranking in our industry group for the fourth consecutive year. And lastly, we reaffirmed our full year 2025 revenue growth guidance at constant currency of 4% to 7% adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of up to 20 basis points and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5% to 9%. And that concludes our formal remarks. Let me hand it back over to the operator to open up the call to Q&A."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Kerri Joseph, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Joseph, please begin your conference.\n\nKerri Joseph\n\nSVP of Investment Relation & Treasury\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and [ Gustavo Barone ], Senior Director, Investor Relations.\nToday, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.aquvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risk and uncertainty of the [ shape ] of the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered another quarter of strong operational results with 5% revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work and 8.6% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Fundamentals of the industry remain healthy, which supports our confidence in the outlook for our business.\nOn the commercial side, things are starting to gradually improve. And while customers continue to exercise budgetary cautiousness, we see faster decisions and more focus on carrying out mission-critical projects such as those associated with launching new drugs. As you recall, new FDA approvals for 2023 were 55, which was the second largest year since [ 2017 ]. And in fact, year-to-date approvals are at 21, which is in line with the average for the last 5 years.\nIn the quarter, TAS came in a little better than our expectations, consistent with the improving leading indicators that we cited earlier this year. Both consulting and analytics and real-world revenue improved sequentially in the second quarter. We said TAS revenue growth for 2024 was going to be the mirror image of 2023. And in fact, TAS revenue growth was about 3% in the first quarter, and it was 4% in the second quarter, excluding COVID and foreign exchange. At constant currency, and based on looking -- on forward-looking indicators, we remain confident in our full year forecast for TAS. This implies 6% to 7% growth for the balance of the year resulting in full year mid-single-digit growth, again, consistent with the target we established for TAS at the beginning of the year.\nOn the clinical side, while we need to see the trend we have observed over the past year with large pharma reprioritizing their portfolios of brands and reallocating money to the most attractive ones in response to largely to the IRA, demand from our large pharma clients in RD&S remains solid. We are also encouraged by the continued acceleration of EVP funding. In fact, BioWorld reports a -- biotech funding for the second quarter was $22.9 billion, which is up 32% versus prior year. For the first half, biotech funding is about $70 billion, essentially equal to the entire year of 2023. Obviously, it does take time for funding to translate into RFP flows. Certainly, it bodes well for mid long-term prospects in our EBP segment.\nIn the quarter, RD&S recorded good net new bookings of approximately $2.7 billion, represents a book-to-bill of 127. Backlog reached a new record of $30.6 billion, which is growth of 7.7% versus prior year. And in fact, that's actually 8.1% when you remove the impact of foreign exchange. And of course, all of our usual forward-looking indicators, RFP, overall pipeline and qualified pipeline are up.\nTurning now to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 5% -- on currency, including approximately 1.5 points from acquisitions. Second quarter adjusted EBIT decreased 2.7%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.64 increased -- 6% year-over-year.\nNow I'd like to spend a bit of time on highlighting some of our business activity, starting with TAS. IQVIA contracted with a top 20 client to expand implementation of our commercial technology ecosystem. IQVIA's AI/ML offerings, including analytics and OCE integrates seamlessly into the client's technology infrastructure and allow our clients to manage their data more effectively and to optimize their customer engagement.\nIn the quarter, IQVIA won a multiyear contract with a top 5 clients t increase the effectiveness of the digital communication strategy. Here, our innovative solution enables targeted audience selection and custom content delivery.\nIn our first quarter call, we shared a preview of a large deal awarded in April for our current OCE offering. This is a multiyear global implementation for a major division of a top 5 pharma client with 1,000 users and is displacing the incumbent.\nAs you know, IQVIA has a rich history of developing AI for health care. For the last 10 years, we've invested heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that support our clients from clinical development through commercialization. Our AI offerings are specifically engineered to meet the demanding standards of precision, speed, privacy and trust that are required in health care.\n[indiscernible] in patient support services or analytics or pharmacovigilance, our proprietary AI software solutions have become market-leading. Let me share a few examples of AI wins and awards in TAS this last quarter. We launched a GenAI solution, which collects structured and unstructured survey inputs from over 30,000 HPEs across 36 countries in multiple regions and in minutes, delivers analytics and insights to our clients on how their interactions and messages about their brand resonated. This work only take a week, at least for human analysts using existing tools.\nThe top 10 client awarded IQVIA contract to implement our centralized GenAI reporting and analytics solution across their entire U.S. sales force, consolidating different legacy tools. IQVIA's comprehensive GenAI solution enables users to ask questions and get contextual responses in the form of charts, graphs and KPIs. This AI solution also actively alerts the user of key trends, anomalies and the changes that were required.\nIn another example, a U.S. Medtech client selected IQVIA to implement IQVIA's AI solution to onboard and train patients to utilize their medical device for diabetes. IQVIA's AI solution incorporates real-time sentiment analysis, provides automated transcription and smart engagement recommendations. It empowers patients to take more control of their treatment, which, of course, promotes better adherence to treatment protocols.\nLastly, for AI in TAS, IQVIA won the award of best use of artificial intelligence in health care out of 4,500 nominations in the 8th annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards. IQVIA's winning AI solution here is called Smart Sold Enterprise Quality Management System, EQMS, which simplifies quality compliance and connects regulatory and quality processes for life sciences customers.\nMoving to real world. IQVIA won an effectiveness study with a midsized pharma client focusing on patients who have not responded well to their previous migraine treatments. We were selected due to our strong therapeutic expertise combined with our direct-to-patient approach to accelerate recruitment and reduce site burden.\nA U.S. EBP client awarded IQVIA a real-world post-approval safety and efficacy study in Japan for their coronary intravascular therapy. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their device, which could potentially increase the clients' market share in Japan as well as help the client register the device in other regions.\nWithin the quarter, a top 15 pharma client awarded IQVIA a significant contract to study effectiveness of a therapy for schizophrenia. The study will use data tokenization to link multiple data sources and then apply AI to provide a comprehensive view of patients pre and post therapy in real-world settings to physicians, patients and caretakers.\nFinally, you may have seen that IQVIA was recognized by a respected independent third-party research organization as a leader in medical affairs and life sciences regulatory operations. IQVIA's global end-to-end solutions enable medical affairs customers to manage and curate the richness of data coming into the organization, transforming evidence into insights that can enable actionable initiatives.\nLet me now move to RD&S. Let's start with the trending therapeutic area of best city treatment. A top 15 pharma client selected IQVIA Labs to conduct globally harmonized high-volume testing to ensure accelerated enrollment. I expect this will result in a significant reduction of study timelines for this therapeutic area where speed to market is key.\nOur strength in the vaccine development area led to another major award to conduct a Phase III trial for a new influenza vaccine -- will enroll approximately 50,000 volunteers.\nTurning to oncology, which represents once again our largest therapeutic area in RD&S bookings this quarter. I'll offer a few examples. A top 20 client selected IQVIA to conduct a large Phase III oncology study focusing on small cell lung cancer, a disease with a high need -- effective treatments. We won this study due to our strong therapeutics -- data and analytics capabilities as well as our proven delivery approach, which includes a dedicated delivery unit project staffing that is exclusively focused on the clients' study. By the way, for some time now, we've been deploying this unique delivery approach for large customers who have an especially complex study portfolio across multiple therapeutic areas.\nA biotech client selected IQVIA to support a large-scale global complex Phase III program to test and validate their innovative cell and gene therapy vaccine for colorectal cancer.\nLastly, in oncology, a top 25 pharma client awarded IQVIA, a contract to develop an optimal clinical strategy and to execute a bladder cancer study in the U.S. We were awarded this engagement based on IQVIA's AI-enabled site selection and feasibility solutions that will help the client meet aggressive timelines.\nI will discuss AI initiatives in TAS and in fact, key enablement is also pervasive in RD&S. A couple of other such examples. A U.S. biotech client awarded IQVIA 4 full-service clinical trials, which are supported by IQVIA's AI-enabled data and analytics, increasing the likelihood of success for -- reducing the risk of protocol amendments as well as the need to add countries and sites after the trial starts.\nIn another example, we were awarded a pharmacovigilance project by a large biotech client to manage all case processing work worldwide using our AI capabilities. The IQVIA AI-enabled solution is designed to dramatically improve productivity -- cost, enhance data quality and accuracy. We will continue to share more exciting AI initiatives across businesses, hopefully, at future investor forums.\nI now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & Interim CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3,814 million grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 3.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $45 million, which is down about $70 million versus the second quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was 5%.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $1,495 million, which was up 2.7% reported and 3.8% at constant currency. And if we exclude COVID work for both years, it was exactly 4% growth. As you may recall, Q1 2023 was the last quarter with meaningful COVID activity [ impact ].\nR&D Solutions revenue of $2,147 million was up 2.4% reported and 3.3% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work with a constant currency and R&DS was 6%.\nAnd lastly, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions revenue of $172 million declined 2.3% reported but grew 2.8% at constant currency.\nFor the first half, total company revenues were $7,551 million, up 2.3% reported and 3.2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency was 5.5%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $2,948 million, up 1.7% reported and 2.4% in constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in TAS in the first half was 3.5%. R&D Solutions first half revenue of $4,242 million was up 2.9% at actual FX rates and 3.6% in constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in RD&S was 7% for the half. And lastly, CSMS first half revenue of $361 million increased 0.8% reported and 5% at constant currency.\nLet's move down to P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $887 million for the second quarter representing growth of 2.7%, while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1,749 million, up 2% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $363 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.97. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $651 million or $3.53 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $487 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.64. For the first half, adjusted net income was $955 million or $5.18 per share.\nNow as already reviewed, RD Solutions bookings were again strong in the quarter. Our backlog at June 30 was $30.6 billion, up 7.7% at actual currency and 8.1% at constant currencies. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.8 billion, growing 6.9% year-over-year.\nOkay, let's turn now to the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,545 million and gross debt was $13,258 million. That results in net debt of $11,713 million. Our net leverage ratio ending the quarter was 3.25x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $588 million, and capital expenditures were $143 million, and that resulted in free cash flow of $445 million.\nOkay. Turning to guidance. With the first half of the year now behind us and better forward visibility, we're refining our financial guidance for the balance of the year. For the year, we now expect revenue to be between $15,425 million and $15,525 million, adjusted EBITDA should be between $3,705 million and $3,765 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $11.10 and $11.30. There is no material change to our previous assumptions about COVID-related step-down, acquisition impacts and foreign exchange [indiscernible].\nBy segment, at constant currency, ex-COVID, our full guidance remains the same and is unchanged versus what we gave you back in February, which is to say TAS will grow this year around 5%, and RD&S in the 7% range.\nMoving now to third quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be between $3,830 million and $3,880 million, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $925 million and $950 million and adjusted diluted EPS should be between $2.76 and $2.86. Now all our guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates as of July 18, continue for the balance of the year.\nSo to summarize, we delivered another solid -- financial performance. RD&S had bookings of $2.7 billion with a strong book-to-bill of 1.27. TAS formed well against our expectations. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8.6% year-over-year. We're now leaving behind the interest expense headwind and are moving back towards resuming double-digit EPS growth. Free cash flow for the quarter and for the past were strong, driven by strong collections performance, and we remain confident that both TAS and R&DS will achieve full year targets for revenue growth we provided at the beginning of the year.\nAnd with that, let me hand it back to the operator to open the session for Q&A."

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Peroni, Senior Director, Investor Relations.\nToday, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results.\nWe had a strong start to the year. We delivered top and bottom line numbers on or slightly above our expectations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work, our revenue grew 6%. We continue to see a favorable demand environment for our industry.\nOn the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remain solid. Our backlog reached a new record and grew almost 8% versus prior year. Net new bookings for the quarter were approximately $2.6 billion, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.23. This included a substantial cancellation in the CNS area that is in the public domain, and I'm sure many of you are aware of, excluding this large cancellation, which is well outside the typical cancellation size we see in a quarter, our first quarter book-to-bill ratio would have been over 1.3 actually closer to 135. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 6% year-over-year, and that's in value meaning in dollar terms, and it was driven by mid- to high single-digit growth in all customer segments, again, in dollar terms. Our qualified pipeline grew double digits versus prior year, again, in value in dollar terms. Emerging biotech funding was very strong according to BioWorld, which we use consistently as a source. First quarter EBP funding was $47.1 billion, which is more than triple the funding of Q1 last year.\nShifting to TAS, our commercial side of our business, revenue in the quarter grew as expected with the modest uptick in activity anticipated for later this year we continue to forecast an improvement in the back half of the year. We continue to see some favorable signs. For example, our pipeline remains strong. In our conversations with clients, there is more clarity on budgets, and we are starting to see faster decision timing with some clients compared to the second half of 2023. As this said, the toll overall with our clients remains cautious. And the fact is that the uncertain macro environment persists as everyone can tell from the Fed remarks yesterday.\nTurning now to the results for this quarter. Revenue for the first quarter grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. Compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including just over a point of contribution from acquisitions. First quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $862 million and first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $2.54. I'd like to share a few highlights of business activity.\nLet's start with the TAS segment. You will have seen that we are expanding our global strategic partnership with Salesforce. The partnership will integrate innovation from IQVIA OCE with Salesforce's Life Sciences cloud to provide customers with a new single end-to-end engagement platform, which is expected to be available late 2025. This is very exciting news for the industry as we expect to transform the engagement with HCPs and with patients with the next-generation CRM platform that's built on OCE, and that's powered by IQVIA data, domain expertise and advanced analytics. Separately, and as we discussed in the past, that continues to be an evolution on the way in how the industry manages HCP and patient engagement. For example, there is an ongoing shift in HCP engagement from in-person to digital interactions. On the patient side, there is increased emphasis on direct-to-patient solutions through patient support and market access programs, including financial support, hub services, medical education. As you know, we've been investing in building out these digital capabilities, and we are getting good market traction. For example, in the quarter, the top 3 pharma client awarded IQVIA a contract for our smart engagement solution to understand the health care provider online journey across therapeutic areas and factor that in earlier into the drug development process. The top 5 pharma bought IQVIA's Omnichannel Navigator solution to assess return on marketing investment, measure customer interactions and campaign performance and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies. A global midsized pharma awarded IQVIA a multiyear contract to implement our commercial compliance solutions. These solutions will allow our clients' interactions with health care professionals to be in compliance with transparency, regulatory obligations in over 30 countries. EBP clients bought IQVIA's patient relationship manager offering, which provides a comprehensive real-time view of the patient's journey and helps maximize the impact of their patient support program. In general, the TAS segment is seeing more demand for our sophisticated technology-enabled analytics solutions. For example, in the quarter, a top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA contract to streamline clinical operation data management processes. IQVIA's technology provides real-time data sharing, eliminating unnecessary file processing and improving the speed of data updates. Also in the quarter, a large med tech firm bought the IQVIA offering that enables better stakeholder targeting and go-to-market execution, ultimately enhancing the clients' ROI.\nMoving to real world. A top 10 pharma company chose IQVIA to conduct a comparative study of the effectiveness of treatments against the standard of care in patients with a specific marker across 10 different cancers. The goal is to help the client gain market access and reimbursement for their treatment, which can be used for multiple types of cancer based on a single biomarker. IQVIA was awarded contract by the top 10 pharma to demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel eye movement technology addressing a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis. A top 10 pharma client awarded IQVIA, a large real-world respiratory infection vaccine effectiveness study. We were selected based on our strong epidemiologic scientific and therapeutic expertise as well as our global footprint to augment site identification and operational execution.\nAnd finally, to conclude my commentary on the TAS segment, I'd like to highlight the work we're doing in public health. It's been an increased area of focus for governments looking to extend life expectancy reduce health inequalities and improve overall quality of and access to care. Some examples of IQVIA's work in this area, one of the largest UN health agencies contracted IQVIA to help with a major initiative to eradicate all types of polyoviruses in Africa, focused on children. IQVIA is deploying personnel to improve outbreak response with vaccines and to strengthen polio surveillance and response in hard-to-reach areas. So far, IQVIA's team conducted visits to more than 12,000 sites and trained over 122,000 health workers across 26 African countries. Another example of our work in this area, IQVIA was selected to conduct a large EU-funded project to create a national oncology network and database for one of the European Ministry of Health to improve the country's low cancer survival rates. A single IT platform will connect national hospitals and the reimbursement fund in that country. The platform will leverage curated oncology data and analytics to manage patient risk and improve treatments in a cost-efficient manner.\nLastly, on public health, the global fund selected IQVIA to support 13 African countries to improve the visibility of their supply chain performance, ensure the availability of commodities and services, mitigate service disruptions and provide stronger assurance through more frequent on-site spot checks. The project focuses on pharmaceutical and diagnostics analytics from over 2,800 facilities for tracer health products in HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. This work is very important to us in public health. It's also extremely important to our global pharma clients who are extremely active in this area as well.\nMoving to R&DS. Let's start by highlighting 2 more distinguished vaccine development awards. The top 10 pharmas selected IQVIA to support the development of a novel respiratory vaccine, which could represent a significant breakthrough as the only vaccine targeting multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously. IQVIA laboratory secured a preferred strategic partnership with a top 10 pharma based on IQVIA's unique expertise, innovation and delivery model. As we discussed in the past, there is stronger demand for FSP services, and we continue to win our fair share in this segment as well. For example, in the quarter, we secured an extension of FSP data management services with a leading midsized pharma known for their innovative rare blood disease therapies. In the EBP segment, we secured 2 large awards where we displaced incumbent CROs based on our global scale and AI-enabled capabilities. We were selected by the U.S. West Coast EBP clients to conduct 2 large Phase III oncology studies simultaneously. This is a big deal as the client is new to IQVIA and selected us based on our differentiated AI-enabled capabilities as the trial protocol includes complex inclusion, exclusion criteria and usually large patient cohorts and aggressive enrollment time lines. We also won another large EBP full-service Phase III trial displacing the incumbent again by leveraging our AI-enabled startup, site identification activation and enrollment capabilities.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & Interim CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone.\nLet's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.737 billion, grew 2.3% on a reported basis and 2.9% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were approximately $45 million, down about $105 million versus first quarter of 2023. Excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. As already mentioned, acquisitions contributed just over 100 basis points to this growth.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.453 billion, up 0.6% reported in 1% at constant currency, excluding all COVID-related, where constant currency growth in TAS was 3%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue was $2.095 billion, that was up 3.4% reported and 3.8% in constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in R&DS was 8%.\nFinally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS first quarter revenue of $189 million was up 3.8% reported and 7.1% at constant currency.\nLet's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $862 million. That's growth of 1.3%. Our first quarter GAAP net income was $288 million, down 0.3% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.56, up 2% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $468 million for the quarter, up 1.3% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS grew 3.7% to $3.54.\nNow it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $30.1 billion, which was up year-over-year, and next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.7 billion, growing 6.1% year-over-year.\nLet's turn to the balance sheet. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.444 billion. Gross debt was $13.536 billion, and the result of those 2 is net debt of $12.092 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.38x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. First quarter cash flow from operations was $522 million in capital expenditures were $145 million, resulting in free cash flow of $377 million.\nTurning now to guidance. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance on a constant currency basis or adjusting revenue at actual currency downward by $75 million to reflect the strengthening the U.S. dollar since we last guided. We now expect revenue to be between $15.325 billion and $15.575 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 2.3% to 3.9% on a reported basis. Now this guidance now includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 100 basis points. And I'll remind you that when we last guided, we were looking for about 50 basis points of FX headwind. We continue to assume approximately $300 million of step-down in COVID-related work and about 100 basis points of contribution to revenue from M&A activity. We're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 3.7% to 6.5%. The impact of FX changes to revenue had a negligible impact on EBITDA. We're also reaffirming our adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which continues to be $10.95 to $11.25, up 7.4% to 10.3% versus the prior year.\nOkay. Let me conclude by providing second quarter guidance. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.740 billion and $3.815 billion. This includes a year-over-year FX headwind of approximately 150 basis points, and we anticipate the second quarter will be the toughest quarterly FX compare of the year.\nAs a reminder, the step-down in COVID-related work is weighted towards the first half of the year. Also, we continue to expect gradual improvement in TAS revenue growth in the back half of the year. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $870 million and $890 million and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.54 and $2.64. And all of the guidance I provided assumes that foreign currency rates as of April 30 continue for the balance of the year.\nSo to summarize, Q1 was a strong start to the year. TAS revenue came in as expected, and we continue to look for improvement in the back end of the year. R&DS delivered $2.6 billion of net bookings, bringing backlog to over $30 billion for the first time in our history. We continue to see favorable forward-looking indicators in the clinical trial business, such as strong RFP flow, strong qualified pipeline growth and strong biotech funding, and finally, we're reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year, including adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.4% to 10.3%.\nWith that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\n\nNicholas Childs\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Treasury\n\nThank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo [ Perone ], Senior Director, Investor Relations.\nToday, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events & Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2023 results.\nYou saw that we had a good quarter. Let me start the call by sharing the latest of what we are seeing in our end markets, along with our key accomplishments for 2023. On the clinical side, demand from our R&DS clients remained strong. Net new bookings for the quarter exceeded $2.8 billion, the second largest quarter in IQVIA history, representing a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.31. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 13% year-over-year, driven by EBP and large pharma. Our [ qualified ] pipeline grew double digits versus prior year. Emerging biotech funding was strong. According to BioWorld, fourth quarter EBP funding was $21.6 billion, the highest quarter in the last 2 years continuing the sequential improvement we've seen throughout the year. For the full year, EBP funding for 2023 was [ $70.9 ] billion, up 17% versus the prior year, and that represents the largest year on record if we exclude the outlier years of '20 and '21, when there was dramatic outstanding due to COVID.\nAs we close 2023, we're proud of what we have achieved in R&DS. The business booked $10.7 billion of net new business, including record high service bookings of $8.4 billion. Our backlog stands at $29.7 billion, and that's up 9% year-over-year. The business added nearly 400 net new customers in the year. We made great progress with our clinical research strategies. We significantly expanded our R&D site network and management organization through strategic acquisitions that offer clinical research coordination study feasibility and patient recruitment capability. We further expanded the capabilities of the lab business through the launch of a new synthetic antibody discovery offering, which is differentiated from the traditional animal-derived antibodies that are used by our competitors. And we partnered with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI, who enhance the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases in underdeveloped countries.\nTurning to TAS. The commercial side of our business continues, of course, to face the macro environment that we've described in the past as our clients remain cautious with their spending and their cost containment. Our results in the quarter were slightly better than what we had expected. Although discretionary spending has not yet rebounded to the levels that we expect, they will, and it continues to be a headwind. Fundamentally, leading market indicators do point to an upcoming improvement.\nFor instance, the FDA approved 55 new molecules in 2023 and that's almost 50% more than the prior year and it is the highest level since 2018. The spend on new drug launches by our pharma clients is expected to be over $190 billion over the next 5 years. That's up over 25% compared to the prior 5-year period.\nFrankly, in our own engagement with customers in the recent past, we noted an improved customer sentiment during the quarter. In fact, the pipeline of opportunities remains strong even as decision time lines remain elongated and negotiations more difficult similar to what we indicated last quarter. Based on these dynamics, we continue to expect demand to pick up, but not before the second half of the year. And as a result, we may see the 2024 sequential short trend for [indiscernible] to be the inverse of what we experienced in 2023. We might see revenue growth in the first quarter that resembles the growth of the fourth quarter of 2023 and grow to gradually improve as we move to the back end of the year.\nNow despite more difficult macro environment, the TAS business had some significant achievements in 2023. We continued expanding our commercial technology and analytics offerings We, in fact, added 33 new clients on our OCE technology platform. We successfully launched a new software platform, which tracks the performance of 1.6 million drugs covering 600 diseases across 93 countries. We successfully introduced a first-in-kind med tech consumption offering that supports the complex journey that medical devices take as they travel from manufacturer to health care providers. And we acquired a quality metric to extend our suite of patient health measurement tools using clinical outcome assessments and patient reported outcomes.\nLet me now turn to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% at constant currency compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, including approximately 1.5 points of contribution from acquisitions.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 5%, reflecting our ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.84 faced the continuing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the U.K. corporate tax rate increase. Excluding the impact of these items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth was 11%.\nNow a few highlights of this business activity this quarter. Let's start with TAS. The midsized pharma client awarded IQVIA, a 4-year outsourcing program to support their life cycle strategy of converting established brands to over-the-counter sales in more than 40 countries. Similarly, IQVIA won a 4-year contract with a large pharma client to provide global market intelligence via a single globally accessible source of commercial data.\nIn the quarter, we won a significant contract with a large pharma in the dermatology, rheumatology and oncology therapeutic areas. This program will allow our clients to access detailed prescribing patterns in local markets, and enhanced HCP targeting in 18 countries. The CDC selected IQVIA to provide comprehensive monitoring services following the end of the COVID public health emergency status. IQVIA will support the CDC in analyzing data in near real time. On the respiratory virus response, including for influenza and RSV, identifying at-risk groups and improving overall population health.\nIn the quarter, our Patient Services business, which is showing faster growth within our past segment secured a significant contract with a large pharma that includes adherence monitoring, co-pay support and at-home treatment administration. In our real-world business, the National Health Service of England awarded IQVIA, a large contract to deploy our privacy technology and to enable the NHS efforts to ensure the highest standards of patient data governance and privacy controls.\nMoving to RDS, a top 5 pharma client selected IQVIA as a key clinical FSP provider. Noteworthy here is that a competitor of ours had been the 100% sole provider previously. This partnership will help the client improve clinical trial oversight and manage costs more effectively.\nIn Q4, another top 5 clients awarded IQVIA a full-service Phase II study on ALS, also known as [indiscernible] disease. IQVIA was selected due to our vast expertise in ALS disease as well as our faster recruitment time lines. In the quarter, a biotech client selected IQVIA to conduct a complex trial for a promising cell and gene therapy targeting myositis, which is an autoimmune disease. We were selected due to our AI capabilities that allow us to identify sites and develop an innovative trial strategy.\nAlso in the quarter, IQVIA expanded its partnership with a major pharma company by securing 6 new global oncology trials, consisting of a mix of early and late-stage trials. We were chosen due to our expertise in oncology and our ability to efficiently manage large complex trials. A leading biotech firm, selected IQVIA to conduct a program comprised of 3 initial stage studies in cancer research. The client is expanding from local to global development and needed a large-scale partner like IQVIA.\nIn Q4, IQVIA was awarded a major contract from a top 10 global pharma to become its primary pharmacovigilance platform provider. This multiyear program includes replacing their legacy systems with IQVIA's drug safety monitoring technology which uses generative AI capability to automatically extract adverse event information from unstructured data sources.\nFinally, and before I turn it to Ron for a detailed financial review, I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company just received. For the seventh consecutive year, IQVIA was named one of the world's most admired companies in Fortune's annual survey. And for the third year in a row, IQVIA was named the #1 most admired company in our category.\nLastly, before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to specifically mention the prestigious recognition received by Christina [ Mac ] one of IQVIA's senior leaders, who is the Chief Scientific Officer for our real-world business. Christina was named 2023 PharmaVoice 100 honorary, is a peer-recognized industry-wide honor. We are very proud at IQVIA of Christina's work and our passion for accelerating innovation in health care through the use of evidence-based decision-making.\nLet me now turn it to Ron for our financial review.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & Interim CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue.\nFourth quarter revenue of [ $3.868 billion ] grew 3.5% on a reported basis and 2.6% constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $65 million, which was down about $125 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Now excluding all COVID related work from both this year and last, constant currency growth was approximately 6%. And as Ari mentioned, acquisitions contributed about 150 basis points of this growth.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.531 billion, up 2.1% reported and 1.3% constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth in TAS was 4%. R&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2.151 billion was up 4.5% reported and 3.7% at constant currency and excluding all COVID related where constant currency growth and R&DS was 9% in the quarter. Finally, Contract Sales and Medical Solutions or CSMS fourth quarter revenue of $186 million grew 2.2% reported and 1.7% at constant currency.\nFor the full year, revenue was $14.98 billion, growing at 4% on a reported basis and 4.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $420 million for the year. Excluding all COVID related work from both years, constant currency growth was 9%. Full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.862 billion, up 2% reported, 2.1% at constant currency and excluding all COVID related work, growth at constant currency in TAS was 6%. In R&D Solutions full year revenue was $8.395 billion, growing 6%, both on a reported and a constant currency basis, and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency in R&DS was 13%. Finally, in CSMS revenue for the full year was $727 million, which was down 2.2% reported and 0.3% at constant currency.\nOkay. Moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $966 million for the fourth quarter. That represented 5% growth, while full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.569 billion, which was up 6.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $469 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.54. For the full year, GAAP net income was [ $1.358 billion ] or $7.29 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $523 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.84. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.901 billion in adjusted diluted EPS was $10.20. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year.\nNow it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another really strong quarter of bookings. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $29.7 billion. That's up 9.2% year-over-year and 31% over the last 3 years.\nOkay. Let's turn to the balance sheet. As of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.376 billion and gross debt was [ $13.673 billion ] . And due to the math that results in net debt of $12.297 billion, our net leverage ratio at year-end was 3.45x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $747 million and capital expenditures was $179 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $568 million for the quarter.\nNow in the quarter, we repurchased $229 million of our shares at an average price of $1.95 per share bringing our full year share repurchase activity to just slightly below $1 billion. This leaves us with just under $2.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program.\nNow as you know, coming out of the merger, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and deployed a significant amount of capital for internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchases, which were quite accretive for our shareholders. Now over that period, our net interest expense was relatively steady at around $400 million per year, but at the end of 2022 and through the middle of 2023, we experienced a rapid and unprecedented rise in interest rates, which drove annual interest expense, up by almost $0.25 billion causing our adjusted EPS to be just slightly over flat in 2023.\nNow as you saw in November, we successfully refinanced approximately $2.75 billion of our near-term debt maturities. The strong demand for IQVIA debt that we experienced allowed us to tighten pricing and lock in an average fixed rate below 4.9% for those issuances after swaps. This refinancing extended approximately $2.75 billion of maturities to 2029 and 2031 and we reduced our interest rate risk exposure by locking in over 80% of our debt at fixed rates. With this refinancing, we now expect net interest expense to be approximately $650 million in 2024. Now the forward curves point to a reduction in rates in the future. We've included the current [indiscernible] consensus in our 2024 guidance. Further reductions would lower our net interest expense more on our variable rate debt and potentially open opportunities to refinance additional debt in the future.\nNow let's go to our 2024 guidance, which I'll review in detail. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be between [ $15.400 billion ] and [ $15.650 billion ] this includes approximately $300 million of a step-down in COVID-related work year-over-year and about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and further FX headwind of approximately 50 basis points versus 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.700 billion to $3.800 billion. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.95 to $11.25.\nNow this guidance includes about $650 million of interest expense. Approximately $580 million of operational depreciation and amortization expense, an effective income tax rate, just under 20% and an average diluted share count [indiscernible] 184 million shares. This guidance also assumes about $2 billion deployment split evenly between acquisitions and share repurchase.\nFinally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year. Now at the segment level, we expect TAS revenue to be between $6 billion and $6.2 billion. Q1 2023 was the last quarter that we had significant COVID-related revenues in TAS. So the COVID step down in TAS will be minimal for the balance of the year. As already mentioned, the guidance now anticipates an improvement in our commercial business towards the back end of the year, which will still result in a year-over-year growth of low to mid-single digits. R&DS revenue is expected to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. This guidance includes almost the entire $300 million step down in COVID-related revenue. And that represents approximately 350 basis points of headwind to the R&DS growth rate. The guidance also reflects the latest phasing of pass-through revenue which results in an additional headwind of approximately 100 basis points to R&DS year-over-year.\nAdjusting for the COVID step-down in the pass-through headwind, R&DS revenue growth in 2024 is expected to remain in the high single digits. CSMS revenue is expected to be approximately $700 million, which is down slightly year-over-year.\nNow let's review the first quarter guidance. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.650 billion and $3.725 billion. The decline in COVID-related work is weighted towards the beginning of the year with the largest impact in Q1. Also, we expect mark conditions and TAS to recover only in the back half of the year, as we've said. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter is expected to be between $850 million and $870 million, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.45 and $2.55. Now keep in mind that Q1 is the toughest comparison for adjusted diluted EPS due to the interest rate increases we saw throughout 2023. As we mentioned, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 12 continue for the balance of the year.\nSo let's summarize. Q4 was another strong quarter. R&DS delivered the second largest booking quarter in IQVIA history at over $2.8 billion, along with another quarter of double-digit RFC growth. For the full year of 2023, revenue grew 9% at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points and adjusted diluted EPS was up 12% [indiscernible] you exclude the year-over-year impact of interest rates and the increase in the U.K. tax rate. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $568 million, representing 109% of adjusted net income. IQVIA was named to Fortune's 2023 list of the World's most Admired Companies for the seventh consecutive year and earned the first place ranking within our industry group for the third consecutive year. And lastly, we issued full year 2024 guidance with underlying revenue growth of 5% to 7%, continued margin expansion and a resumption of EPS growth with adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to be up 7% to 10%.\nNow before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to make you aware of the leadership change within IQVIA's finance organization, Nick Childs, who has led our Investor Relations and treasury functions very ably for the past 3 years, is moving on to become CFO of our North American business. He will be succeeded by Kerry Joseph, who has served as CFO of that business unit for the past 5 years. Kerry, who is a member of the global finance leadership team has had many finance roles of increasing responsibility during his 20-plus years with the company. Kerry and Nick have already been working together to transition responsibilities and Kerry will join Nick on our follow-up calls this quarter, so you all have a chance to meet them.\nNow with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. So in line with our expectations, R and DS is performing very well. The task business continued to grow, but revenue fell short, although we had expected about half of our total revenue shortfall came from foreign exchange headwinds, and the versus our previous guidance and the other half from persistent weakness in demand in the task segment. Despite the task revenue shortfall, our productivity actions allowed us to deliver on our profit guidance.\n\nWe continue to receive questions about the health of the industry and customer demand and I'd like to give you the latest of what we're seeing in the market. Let's start on the clinical development side, the man in the R and DS segment remains strong net new bookings exceeded 2.6 billion dollars, representing a quarterly book to bill of 124 overall, including pastries, and given that this quarter there is a significant difference between services, bookings and bookings with pastries, I note that our services bookings were the highest ever at 2.3 billion dollars resulting in a 1.4 services book to bill.\n\nOur backlog reached 28.8 billion dollars growing 11.7% versus prior year another historic high. Our quarterly RFP flow was up 10% year over year with growth across all customer segments. Our strong performance is supported by continued healthy market dynamics emerging biotech funding was strong in the quarter. According to BioWorld, third quarter EBP funding was 18.7 billion dollars, the largest quarter this year. Year to date, EBP funding through Q3 was up 8% versus prior year.\n\nIf you look at the first half large former R&D spend, it was above 20% of net revenues highlighting continued strong R&D activity within large former as well. Based on these indicators, the clinical trial industry remains healthy. Our strong market position, market wins scale and differentiated offerings give us confidence that our R&D as business will continue to deliver above market growth.\n\nTurning now to TAS, on the commercial side of our business we are obviously facing a tougher macro environment. Our clients remain cautious with their spending and have extended their decision making timelines beyond what we would have normally expected. I'm sure you also saw that several large farmers have announced significant cost reduction programs, and obviously we are a significant vendor to large farmers. Now we had anticipated to see improvements as we progress through the year, specifically in the quarter, we usually see activity pick up in September after the slower July August summer months.\n\nIt didn't happen. While we still had growth for the segment as a whole, we experienced further declines in our analytics and consulting business, somewhat slower than expected growth in the discretionary parts of our real-world business, as well as some impact from the China situation. While the acceleration we are anticipating is staking longer than expected, based on our pipelines, we remain confident that there will be a rebound and demand sometime in 2024.\n\nWe know this because the pipeline of opportunities remains strong, even as decision timelines are elongated and negotiations with our customers have become more difficult. We also know this because historically, going back 25 years every time there was a pullback in spend on the commercial side, the industry adapts and comes back within a year or two.\n\nWith this that context, let's now review the third quarter results. Revenue for the third quarter grew 4.9% on a reported basis, 4.1% at constant currency. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line approximately 8.5% on a constant currency basis and that includes approximately a point and a half of contribution from acquisitions. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 9.1%, driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline.\n\nThird quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.49 faced the ongoing headwind of the step-up in interest expense and the UK corporate tax rate. If you exclude the impact of these non-operational items, our adjusted diluted EPS growth underlying was 13%.\n\nLet me share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter and let me start with TAS. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded seven note worthy analytics contracts to support our clients go-to-market strategies. For example, the NBP clients selected IQVIA to provide analytics around keep subscriber and pay your trend for their women's health products. In another significant win this quarter, IQVIA secured a large US data analytics contract with a top 10 farmer client that had been buying from a competitor for over a decade.\n\nWe also received an award from an EVP client to support the launch of their first branded product into the diabetes market. This will be an end-to-end launch solution including field reps, insight sales reps, OCE, information management infrastructure, data analytics, commercial compliance and copy car operations. Also in the quarter, I'm sure you saw that we received an award from Sanofi to deploy our OCE platform within the Middle East and Africa markets. Sanofi has been using Iqvia in many markets around the world to support their HCP engagements.\n\nOn the tech side, we've been getting some questions about our partnership with Salesforce and I just want to confirm that Iqvia has been a key life sciences partner to Salesforce for many years now with offerings that span from clinical to commercial.\n\nAnd we plan to continue the strong partnership with Salesforce, combining our life sciences domain expertise and intelligence with Salesforce technologies and platforms. Moving now to real world, we were awarded multiple rare disease studies from both large-former and biotech clients. Highlighting our expertise and differentiated offerings within this growing therapeutic area, including innovative study design, patient recruitment and AI enable technology to provide unique solutions. Couple of examples. The top 20 large-former awarded Iqvia a 10-year study to improve patient treatments for a rare genetic liver disease.\n\nA Japanese EDP client awarded Iqvia two large post-marketing surveillance studies on rare diseases in the circulatory nervous and muscular systems. Moving now to RNDS, we entered into a strategic collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI aimed at enhancing the world's ability to rapidly conduct clinical research for vaccines and other biological countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases. This collaboration is a key neighbor of CEPI's mission goal, which is sponsored by the G7 and G20 countries, to develop safe, effective and globally accessible vaccines against emerging disease outbreaks within 100 days.\n\nWe've also entered into a innovative strategic collaboration with Argenics, a global immunology biotech company, leveraging our connected intelligence capabilities we bring together and to end asset development services, ranging from regulatory to market authorization to integrate a technology enable pharmacovigilance safety tracking. This will allow Argenics to accelerate the market launch of new rare disease therapies to autoimmune patients. In the quarter, a top 10 former client renewed their FSP partnership with Iqvia as they looked to design along the new clinical monitoring model. [inaudible] Iqvia was selected for our strategic design and operational expertise in oncology, including our ability to manage multiple large complex trials and our experience managing the unique safety profile of these molecules.\n\nWith that, I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. [inaudible] Year-to-date revenue of $11 billion, $116 million, grew 4.2% on a reported basis in 4.8% of constant currency, excluding all COVID-related work, constant currency growth was 11% year-to-date. Technology and analytic solutions revenue year-to-date was $4 billion, $331 million, up 2% reported in 2.4% of constant currency, and excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and tax year-to-date was 7%.\n\nR&D solutions year-to-date revenue of $6 billion, $244 million, was up 6.5% at actual FX rates, and 6.8% at constant currency, excluding all COVID-related work, growth at constant currency and R&D was 14% year-to-date. And a finally contract sales and medical solutions year-to-date revenue of $541 million to client 3.6% reported and increased 1.2% at constant currency. To move down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $888 million, representing growth of 9.1% while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2,603 million, up 7.3% year-to-date.\n\nThird quarter gap net income was $303 million, and gap deluded earnings per share was $1.63. Year-to-date gap net income was $889 billion, or $4.76 of earnings per deluded share. Adjusted net income was $4.62 million for the third quarter, and adjusted deluded earnings per share was $2.49. Year-to-date adjusted net income was $1.378 million, or $7.37 for deluded share. Excluding the year-to-year impact of the step-up and interest rates, and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted deluded earnings per share grew 13% in the third quarter, and 12% year-to-date. Now, it's already reviewed R&D solutions delivered another strong quarter of bookings. Backlog at September 30 stood at $28.8 billion, up almost 12% year-to-year, and 33% higher in the last three years.\n\nLet's review the balance sheet. As of September 30 at the cash and cash equivalence, total $1.224 million in gross debt was $13.631 million, and that resulted in net debt of $12.407 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.52 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $583 million, and capital expenditures were $146 million, resulting in free cash flow of $437 million. Now, you saw in the quarter that we repurchased $144 million of our shares, which put their year-to-date share repurchased activity just slightly below $800 million. This leads us with just under $2.6 billion of share repurchased authorization remaining under the current problem.\n\nOkay, let's turn to guidance. We're updating our guidance to reflect both the slower growth and the task segment and the headwind from foreign exchange rates compared to our previous guide. We currently expect revenue to be between $14 billion, $885 million, and $14 billion, $920 million, which represents a year-over-year growth of 3.3 to 3.5%. Excluding approximately $600 million of COVID-related revenue step down versus 2022, this guidance represents growth at constant currency of approximately 9%, including about 140 basis points of contribution from acquisition.\n\nTo reflect these changes in revenue, we're also updating our guidance for full-year adjusted EBITDA to $3 billion, $560 million to $3 billion, $570 million, and this represents year-over-year growth at 6.4 to 6.7%. It also implies 70 basis points of margin expansion for the year. Lastly, we're updating our guidance for adjusted deluded EPS to $10.16 to $10.23, which is flat to 0.7% versus the prior year. This includes the year-over-year impact of the step-up of interest rates and the increase in the you take corporate tax rate. If you were to exclude these items, adjustment deluded earnings per share is now expected to grow 11 to 12%.\n\nBased on this full-year outlook, our implied fourth quarter guidance is as follows. For revenue, we expect between $3 billion, $769 million in $3 billion, $804 million or growth as 0.8 to 1.7% on a reported basis, and 0.7 to 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $957 million and $967 million, up 4 to 5.1%. Net yields margin expansion of about 80 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted deluded EPS is expected to be between $2.79 and $2.86 growing 0.4 to 2.9% year-over-year.\n\nExcluding the step-up and interest expense and the increased UK tax rate, we're expecting fourth quarter adjusted deluded EPS to grow 10 to 13%. Now, all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 30th continue for the balance of the year.\n\nNow, as as our custom, we plan to provide you with the detailed 2024 full-year guidance on our Q4 earnings call in February. However, while it's early and we're still in the midst of our planning process, we thought it would be helpful to share a preliminary view that would help you frame how we see 2024. We see reported revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2024. This includes a further step down of approximately $300 million in COVID revenue, which is about 200 basis points of headwind or revenue growth.\n\nSo, as well as another 100 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange rates, assuming current foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect for 2024. We see adjusted EBIT dot margins, expanding 50 basis points and this will drive high single digit adjusted deluded EPS growth. Now, I trust this preliminary look at 2024 is helpful to you.\n\nAgain, we will, as is our custom, give you more detailed guidance and specificity for 2024 when we release our four year earnings early next year. So, to summarize, despite client caution and spending levels below our expectations, it has business continued to its growth in the quarter, while the near term growth outlook for taxes below our previous expectations were confident in the longer term fund the metals of the businesses are pipelines indicate there will be a rebound in demand sometime in 2024.\n\nIn the quarter, we delivered another strong performance in RADS with 11% revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-rogated work, quarterly net new bookings were strong at over $2.6 billion, representing a book to bill of $124. And we reached a historic high of $2.3 billion in services bookings, representing a services book to bill of $1.4L. Our industry reading backlog reached a new record of $28.8 billion, approximately 12% year over year. And finally, leading the indicators on the clinical side remains strong as evidenced by a quarterly RFP growth of 10% versus the prior year with growth across all customer segments.\n\nSo, with that, let me hand it back over to the operator to open up the conference for Q&A. At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star then a number one on your telephone keypad. You request that you please limit yourself to just one question so that others in the queue may participate as well. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster."

We're about to begin.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQDS second quarter 2023 earnings conference call.\n\nAll lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. And if you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. And just as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Childs, Senior Vice President in domestic relations and treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter of our 2023 earnings call.\n\nWith me today are Ari Boosby, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ron Bruhlmann, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nEric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel.\n\nMike Fiedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis.\n\nGustavo Peron, Senior Director, Investor Relations.\n\nToday we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the events and presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements.\n\nActual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\n\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a Supplement 2 and not a Substitute 4 financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nA reconciliation of these non-GAT measures to the comparable GAT measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to our chairman and CEO .\n\nwith 9% organic revenue growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work. The demand environment for the industry continues to be healthy, which supports our confidence in the long-term outlook for our businesses. Emerging biotech funding continued its healthy trend. According to BioWorld, second quarter EVP funding was 17.1 billion dollars, up 33% versus prior year, and up 10% sequentially versus Q1.\n\nClinical trial starts were up over 10% sequentially compared to Q1223.\n\nFDA approvals continue their strong momentum, which is a positive indicator for our commercial businesses going forward.\n\nThere were 26 approvals in the first half of the year, and that's up 30% versus the average of the prior five years.\n\n2023 is on pace to be one of the largest years in the last decade in both value of transactions and number of deals and that is with a high interest rate environment. Our Q2 demand metrics showed continued healthy growth. Net new bookings were just under 2.7 billion dollars which was our second largest quarter ever.\n\nand represented a quarterly book to bill of 1.28. By the way, before I move on, I know that some of you inquired.\n\nand I think some of you were concerned about what that may have implied about our performance. So just to remove any concern our services booked to bill this quarter was Nick 1-1-1-34? 1-1-1-1-34 and our trailing 12 months booked to bill is 134 overall and again for those who asked it's the same on a services basis. So do we use any meaningful deviation\n\nbook to bill ratio and the services book to bill then we will let you know otherwise you can assume they are roughly the same. Now as a result of these bookings our backlog reached 28.4 billion dollars growing 11% versus\n\nIt was up 8% year over year and 6% sequentially. The longer-term fundamentals of the industry are certainly very positive. In the short term, our clients have continued to be cautious with their spending due to the uncertain macroeconomic conditions. And that's reflected primarily, I would say only, in some subsegments of our commercial business segments, that is TAAS and CSMS. In the second quarter, these businesses were stable.\n\nwith the task segment growing in the second quarter at a rate consistent with the first quarter, as we had anticipated in our guidance. Of course, last time we spoke, we expected clients spending in these commercial businesses to show signs of acceleration by now.\n\nBut unfortunately, they have continued to delay decisions. A pipeline is still there.\n\nHowever, decisions keep being moved to the right.\n\nAnd as a result\n\nWe now expect this commercial business to perform for the balance of the year, similarly to what we saw in the first half.\n\nFor the tab segments, that represents approximately 6% growth organically.\n\nand that 6% growth organically for the year is actually very strong in the current environment. With that, let's review the second quarter results. Revenue for the second quarter grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency compared to last year, and again, excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 9% at constant currency on an organic basis. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8%.\n\nexpected face the headwind of the step up in\n\nand the UK corporate tax rate change.\n\nexcluding the impact of these non-operational items, our adjusted mularger icons andphones.\n\nA few highlights of business activity.\n\nIQVIA has been awarded a significant contract with the top 10 pharma to implement our full commercial data and analytics solution suite.\n\nThis suite of offerings will benefit our clients by utilizing insights powered by AI, such as personalized engagements with HCPs, leveraging our multi-channel capabilities including digital,\n\nprecise geographical sales targeting, and better cost efficiency by reducing the number of resources that are manually generating insights. This initiative positions IQVIA as a strategic partner with its LAV top 10 pharma client for AI-powered data analytics\n\nThe project allows commercial teams to continuously track brand performance, factor in AI generated insights and improve as a result execution across seven cancer indications in over 25 countries. In another win.\n\nIQVIA was awarded a significant contract\n\nto deploy our OCE optimizer application globally.\n\nThis is an AI-powered multi-channel sales management application that optimizes HTTP engagement in real time.\n\nIqya was selected over two other competitor solutions.\n\nbecause of the seamless integration that OC offers with the client's current ecosystem, the superior AI capability, and our successful history with this client in previous global system implementations. Also in the quarter, IQVA was selected by multiple clients to deliver regulatory mandated post-approval safety studies in Europe .\n\nIn each case, IQVIA was selected over preferred providers due to our deep expertise in sourcing data from the\n\nand our ability to bring multiple databases together in a harmonized manner for research.\n\nWe were awarded a five-year pregnancy exposure study from an EBP customer.\n\nTo collect and analyze health information from women who take prescription medicines\n\nand compare results with women who have not taken them. We won this award because of our rich experience in post-approval safety studies in pregnancy and deep experience in epidemiology.\n\nIn the quarter, IQUVIA has been recognized by the Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough Awards.\n\nwith the prestigious\n\nBest AI-Based Solution for Healthcare Award.\n\nIKULIA was recognized for its AI software including natural language processing and proprietary large language\n\nwhich analyzes complex and unstructured patient data.\n\nto provide unique insight into patient care and disease states.\n\nThis technology is helping clinicians identify and screen at-risk patients.\n\nenabling targeted intervention to patients in need.\n\nIQVIA continues to differentiate in the application of AI analytics with two of the top 10 pharma companies designating their use of IQVIA AI as their innovation of the years.\n\nIn addition,\n\nBoth Databricks and Snowflake, separately, named IQVIA their 2023 Health and Life Sciences Partner of the Year.\n\nThese awards recognize AI and tech partners for their exceptional accomplishments and join collaboration.\n\nThere's a lot going on at IQVIA with generative AI, and we will likely be discussing this at the appropriate time at the future investor meeting.\n\nLet me now move to R&DS segment, which had another strong quarter, including several key wins.\n\nOur expertise in oncology continues to be a differentiator for us.\n\nIn the quarter, a mid-sized pharma company awarded IQVIA two large phase 3 trials for gastric and prostate cancer.\n\nwhich are expected to last about six years.\n\nThe client selected IqDia due to our\n\ninfrastructure to run global complex oncology studies as well as our global\n\nAlso this quarter, a large FSP client renewed their partnership with Iqvia as a preferred provider this time without soliciting competing bids.\n\nThis client was a historical lockout account for the historical quintiles legacy company.\n\nWe want here due to our FSP expertise\n\nIn our lab business, the top 10 pharma awarded us a large study in the quarter for a novel drug that improves the quality of life of patients suffering from a serious autoimmune disease that\n\nThis study is our client's top R&D program and it has positioned like QVIA as the largest laboratory service provider for this client.\n\nLastly, I'm proud to share that Shekal Telang, Vice President of Therapeutic Strategy at Iqvia, has been honored with the 2023 Rising Star Award by the Healthcare Business Women's Association\n\nSheetal earned the award for a strong and innovative leadership of critical industry initiatives, including by increasing diversity and inclusion levels among patients enrolled in clinical trials.\n\nI will now turn it over to Ron for more\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone.\n\nLet's start by reviewing revenue.\n\nSecond quarter revenue of $3,728,000,000 grew 5.3% on a reported basis and 5.5% at constant currency.\n\nIn the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $120 million, which is down about $140 million versus the second quarter of 2022.\n\nExcluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 9 percent.\n\nTechnology and analytic solutions revenue was $1,456,000,000. That was up 3.4% on both a reported and constant currency basis.\n\nExcluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in tabs with 6%.\n\nR&D Solutions revenue of $2,096 million was up 7.5% reported and 7.6% at constant currency.\n\nExcluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and R&DS was 12%.\n\nLastly, contract sales and medical solutions or CSMS revenue of $176 million, declined 3.8% reported and was flat, sponsored currency.\n\nTotal company first half revenue was $7,380,000,000, which was up 3.8% on a reported basis and 5.1% of constant currency.\n\nExcluding all COVID-related work, organic growth of constant currency for the first half was 10%.\n\nAcknowledging analytic solutions revenue for the first half was $2,900,000,000. That's up 1.9% reported in 3.2% at constant currency.\n\nand excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and tax with 6% for the first half.\n\nR&D Solutions first half revenue of $4,122,000,000 was up 6.1% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency.\n\nand excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14% in the first half.\n\nContract sales and medical solutions or CSM, that's first half revenue of $358 million decline, 5.3% reported and 0.5% constant currency.\n\nLet's move down the P&L map.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $864 million for the second quarter, which represented growth of 8%, while the first half adjusted EBITDA was $1,715,000,000, which was up 6.4% year over year.\n\nSecond quarter gap net income was $297 million and gap diluted earnings per share was $1.59.\n\nFor the first half, we had GAAP net income of $586 million, or $3.12 of earnings per diluted share.\n\nAdjusted net income was $454 million for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.43.\n\nFor the first half, adjusted NAA income was $916 million or $4.88 per share.\n\nNow, excluding the year-over-year impact of the stuff up in interest rates and the increase in the UK corporate tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% in the second quarter and 11% for the first half.\n\nAs already review R&D Solutions delivered another quarter of excellent bookings. Backlog June 30th stood at a record $28.4 billion which is up 11% year over year.\n\nfor $160 million resulting in free cash flow of $242 million. As we previously announced in May, we issued $1,250,000,000 of senior secured and unsecured notes.\n\nThe proceeds from these notes were used to pay down our revolving credit facility. We also took advantage during the quarter of our stock price multiples falling to 2017 levels.\n\nThose must or must do projects, but.\n\nThe environment the climate the higher interest rates.\n\nKind of with people on settlement.\n\nOn a whole pattern if you will.\n\nThe pipeline is that no. One is spending is I am just not doing the project and therefore.\n\nWe would say well the prospects how wrong no. We we have that the projects are still there, but the decision making.\n\npushed to the right we were hoping frankly.\n\nUp to.\n\nTwo or three months ago that things would recover by now in terms of the decision making and accelerate.\n\nAnd that's why we frankly, we were hoping that we would get back to the.\n\nYou know, 8% or so growth higher single digit growth for VITAS segment for the year, we were expecting a strong acceleration, but we haven't seen it materialize in the second quarter and so as of now based on what we've seen I think is prudent.\n\nTo say.\n\nSay that you know this.\n\nThe type of growth rates, we've seen for the segment as a whole which is 6% organically.\n\nConstant currency and nothing smoothing the COVID-19 impacts.\n\nYou should be should continue the rest of the year.\n\nThank you alright. Thanks.\n\nThank you and the next now to Eric Coldwell.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nThank you very much I I had the same question is Ann and I just wanted to follow up on that the.\n\nThe way, we think about Tad this.\n\nForce broadly defined sub segments data analytics consulting real world evidence and in technology.\n\nCurious did.\n\nAny of this.\n\nCautiousness or sluggishness did it expand beyond the analytics and consulting side.\n\nWhat are what are the the growth trends in data real world evidence Tech.\n\nAny nuances or changes there and then I have one one quick follow up if I might thank you Ara show of course, Eric. Thank you. So let's start with data right. The core of the business that has not changed.\n\nNo.\n\nI would say 90 plus percent of our business for the year.\n\nOn the data side is just locked in.\n\nBy the month of December for the following year. So there's no real change there.\n\nSure.\n\nRecurring revenue and not much has happened there.\n\nThe.\n\nLevel of discretion in terms of data buys a year from the clients is much less than the analytics and consulting segment that we were just discussing.\n\nFor the faster growing businesses real world and commercial take let's take.\n\nTechnology.\n\nSuites.\n\nYou know it's not like.\n\nThe revenue is a reflection reflection of the sales in the year. It's you know the revenue generated in technology.\n\nIt is longer cycle corresponds to technology awards.\n\nFrom prior periods from prior years, So nothing has changed there on the revenue side.\n\nThere is cautiousness.\n\nto consulting and analytics on the technology side in terms of new buys and new transactions as a number of dislocation in technology going on right now by the way both on the clinical side and on the commercial side.\n\nThe main CRM competitor.\n\nDecided to change their platforms. So as a result clients are kind of reviewing.\n\nTechnology decisions.\n\nTechnology side, and you've got new innovations, we get there.\n\nThe main competitors there are many data and all there is an oracle or launching new suites. So that means dislocation so because of that clients are kind of taking.\n\nTaking the time to easy decisions, but that's not impacting our revenue in U.\n\nOn the real World side again, some of these are longer term studies, there is a little bit a little bit, but again I don't think we've seen it affect our revenue EUR that much.\n\nA little bit of cautiousness, and perhaps a little bit of delaying on the need phase real World studies that we've seen.\n\nAgain, I'm, just giving you a high level comment to rehear on just two to resist crush the business, but fundamentally it is a 25% piece of the task segment, that's true that's consulting and analytics that essentially down year.\n\nYear over year.\n\nBy I think about 5%, if I recall and so everything else is.\n\nPretty much stable as.\n\nAs expected.\n\nThank you Paulo.\n\nThank you for the follow up.\n\nI know you don't tend to get into details on M&A in the quarter.\n\nTypically these are smaller smaller companies.\n\nSometimes it's higher revenue multiples, but I did notice 426 million I believe spend on acquisitions. This quarter was hoping to get some sense of.\n\nDirectionally, what that might've been yen yesterday and I. Thank you.\n\nWe've done that towards the end of the quarter.\n\nI mean I can tell you, it's a company called cognitive, but which we paid almost $300 million. So clinical site network as we know as part of our strategy overall.\n\nWe are we've been acquiring certain assets that have strong patient enrollment capability in specific.\n\nIn specific.\n\nTherapies.\n\nSo.\n\nCognate Tvs in particular.\n\nStrong in internal medicine in CNS.\n\nIn vaccines as well.\n\nAnd has.\n\nSome large pharma customers so we.\n\nThe company's headquartered in Arizona.\n\nObviously, it's a significant multiple of revenue, but and we acquired that towards the end of the quarter.\n\nAnd we have a bunch of smaller stuff.\n\nOver here, but that's the.\n\nWhat else do we have here we have a.\n\n36 million dollar investment in a small vault we.\n\nWe've had one other.\n\nSite network right, we've bench wire backlog right.\n\nYou acquired .\n\nRight management organization Yeah.\n\nThat was that's what we do in psychiatry and smoking cessation, so again highly specialized.\n\nThe site management organizations locally we've done a couple these possible.\n\nDo you are you are.\n\nTurning to follow the path of what PPD and icon have done in prior years with moving into the opening up the marketplace for actually been fine.\n\nBeing a hybrid SMO, but probably still at a very small scale over to assume yeah. Yeah. No. So we had already we do have.\n\nWe had the network that we had to stop that ourselves.\n\nBut we.\n\nYoure correct I don't think we are I mean, we bought maybe one other one last year if I remember.\n\nHe can youre correct again. These are it's not like we are buying dozens of these but.\n\nIt happens to be going.\n\nCoincidentally, we bought two in the quarter and that's basically the bulk of.\n\nI'll just spend that you see there.\n\nThank you so much thank you.\n\nWe'll go next now to pay off the bond at Morgan Stanley .\n\nHey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for the time this morning.\n\nRon maybe one for you and a quick follow up on the M&A side Ferrari as well if I may. So firstly, you I mean margins in the mid point looks to be expanding nicely here into the fourth quarter as implied by your third quarter Guide.\n\nSo can you just walk us through sort of what drives your confidence in that sort of margin expansion until year end and then on the M&A side already.\n\nWe noticed that the propel media acquisition from earlier in the yard.\n\nBeing being blocked by the FTC at the moment, we have some new luxury view guidelines draft guidelines admittedly put out a couple of weeks ago as well does it concern you that you need to sort of reject your M&A strategy here in light of like some of these recent developments.\n\nI'll take the.\n\nThe margin question for JJ.\n\nLook there were a couple of things here number one we've had margin expansion all year, so pretty good indicator that it's credible to say, we're going to have in the back half of the year, we have a number of productivity initiatives underway to reduce cost.\n\nAnd those tend to be of course more back end loaded you get more benefit as you go through the year. So that's certainly going to support margins in the back half of the year I think another thing that's happening is the some of the labor cost pressure that we've been feeling.\n\nOver time on a year over year basis Youre starting.\n\nKind of lap that and get more.\n\nMore pricing benefit in as well so it's a combination of factors now all of those factors.\n\nOvercome a little bit of drag from mix for instance, the info business, which is tends to be a profitable business never grows as fast as the rest of the business stuff.\n\nWe're very confident in the margin outlook for the back half of the year and those are the reasons.\n\nYeah and the.\n\nThe question on the on.\n\nOn the acquisition that we're trying to do that we need so I think about the year.\n\nYou know that we have a strategy to continue to grow in the digital space our strategy remains intact.\n\nWe've seen those merger guidelines look I'm not going to comment on the pending litigation with the FTC group pending litigation. We continue to believe strongly that there is absolutely zero.\n\nJeep to blocking these transaction.\n\nBut we are aware that there are a few novel theories that are being promoted.\n\nBy this administration of the FTC and listened administrations come and go.\n\nAnd we're not going to change our M&A strategy.\n\nWe believe we are.\n\nStill a very small player in it.\n\nHugely massoud digital.\n\nPromotional market I mean, you've got the googles of this world.\n\n.\n\nThat also participate in these market and new we have a right to participate in these markets and we are serving the life sciences industry and their needs and our customers welcome.\n\nThat development and our ability to offer those services, we believe that this equity acquisition actually we did it.\n\nAgree or intensity of competition in this market.\n\nAnd it actually allows the other participants to.\n\nTo counter the.\n\nEssential strong Bam was that dominates the.\n\nThe digital space today, So we just simply do not understand.\n\nThe FTC's arguments and I'll leave it at that.\n\nThanks, guys I appreciate the color.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nWe'll go next now to loops you got at Barclays.\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks again for the questions.\n\nSo when you were talking about a little bit about decision, making getting elongated I know that that was on parts of the test business, but can you talk or can you give us a sense of how much longer that has gotten.\n\nDoes it typically take for you guys like you know like let's say to two months three months to close a certain deal and now that that six months just give us some type of framework on how.\n\nLong that has gotten and then.\n\nAs you guys think about things recovering I assume that Theres also some delayed decision making on the big.\n\nRds side so.\n\nWhen things start to turn around is it safe to assume that the Rds side comes back before the test side when on this decision making process.\n\nWell. Thanks for the question look I am not sure what you mean by RMB, yes, coming back very strong.\n\nThe the Rds segment, he is not experiencing any delays in decision, making that we can.\n\nFrankly, again, we had another record quarter of bookings.\n\nNothing's changed there.\n\nAnd our RFP flow.\n\nAgain is at a record level.\n\nI could spend time, giving you the stats on the.\n\nOn our leading indicators metrics on the R&D side.\n\nSure.\n\nOur qualified pipeline and the pipeline overall and so on the auto at a record high and we continue our sales activities as before again nothing.\n\nNo sign.\n\nDelaying as you've been making on the R&D side I want to be very clear on that on the pads segment and see SMS and again, it's largely affected the consulting and analytics segment and I would say almost exclusively the issue is.\n\nYes.\n\nI can't quantify many months they stopped that scene.\n\nIn our pipe that we've had seen at the end of last year and here. We are August one and the clients on that specific opportunity.\n\nShe hasn't decided to everything is negotiated and they know they have to do the study, but they could do this study next year.\n\nSo whatever.\n\nClients are on that side of the business clients are basically saying to themselves well do I need to do this now or can I keep the can.\n\nAnother few months.\n\nWell they started as being our pipeline six months and we haven't taken it out because the clients finished telling us that they wanted to do it.\n\nThey just haven't signed.\n\nYet so yeah, I mean, it's a bit in the timeframe that you were talking about it would have taken a month or two and.\n\nAnd he's taking six months or more.\n\nOkay, and I guess.\n\nSorry, if you are implying that you guys are seeing there rds weakness or.\n\nDelays, there and decision, making just going more of a overall pharma comment.\n\nOn that decision, making on the task is that more due to them.\n\nYour customers focusing more on where.\n\nWhere theyre going to place, our bets and deploy that capital for the for the clinical trials and then kind of the stuff is like a secondary knock on or secondary benefit that you guys offer.\n\nYou know, it's it's really all over every client has.\n\nIt's hard to it weighs on everyone is there going to be a recession is that going to be a recession.\n\nMaybe we should delay the launch in Portugal, maybe we should.\n\nNot.\n\nLook at our sales force now we should do this next year, maybe that project that we were planning to do.\n\nTwo to evaluate whether we should adjust pricing.\n\nYou bet.\n\nConsideration of there'll be I R. A.\n\nAnd vacations and so on on these draw in that market in that therapy.\n\n.\n\nE.\n\nWe pushed it back so it's not like.\n\nCan give you a blanket answer each system.\n\nIt just it's just the environment, yet MOSFET rigs are such that look.\n\nI'm sure someone's going to ask me a question and I'm, assuming it's going to be Shlomo.\n\nOur cash flow our cash flow wasn't to special.\n\nThis past quarter and is the same thing.\n\nWhy all large pharma companies that are sitting on massive piles of cash not paying their bills on time.\n\nOur collections are not where they should be.\n\nAnd it's just you know its a high interest environment. So people tend to just.\n\nFinal kinds of reasons why there was a commonly seen in invoice and therefore, we can't pay you and send me back the invoice in two weeks you know it's a it's just the environment.\n\nI don't have another answer.\n\nGot you that's helpful. Thank you.\n\nLuke.\n\nAnd we'll go next now to Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel here, we go.\n\nCRE I still get a question, even though you asked that one right yeah yeah.\n\nAlright. Thank you actually just I wanted to touch on one just just a metric and then maybe follow up with another one just more a little more broad just if you could talk to.\n\nWith the growth rate on a real world evidence was in the quarter and then maybe just if you could talk a little bit about.\n\nIn terms of AI, you give us a little bit of a teaser, but can you talk a little bit about just.\n\nYou might have unique advantages.\n\nEither because of the investments you've made in AI over the last bunch of years or just because of the.\n\nUniqueness of the information that you've aggregated is there anything thats out there in market Thats really unique right now or is this really stuff that's going to be on the come. Thank you.\n\nThank you so quickly on the real world evidence, it's been double digits for what and students strong double digits. So nothing changed there.\n\nWith respect to AI, we're obviously very excited by the opportunity. This is not new for US right. I mean, we've been working on this for an old Guy.\n\nWe've invested since 2015, 16, and we own a number of market leading in.\n\nProprietary AI software engines, we've dedicated am amount of resources.\n\nFor a long time.\n\nAnd we are extremely well positioned we apply AI in drug development.\n\nDiscovery clinical development safety market access medical affairs and of course in commercialization to inform.\n\nPromotional and sales and targeting activities.\n\nWe are using data and then it would be.\n\nprocesses and translations of medical documentation and protocols.\n\nThat's.\n\nFor the offering part of the business. If you will on the on the internal side.\n\nWe've applied AI to many of our own internal processes for example.\n\nTwo cash.\n\nYou read across a set of processes to create efficiencies operation. So it is a great opportunity for us.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd it has been for the past few years now.\n\nHow do you use AI to gain competitive advantages helps optimize site identification based on the patient populations that we derived from our that we mine.\n\nThat's our bases.\n\nHelps optimize patient recruitment techniques based on data and analytical footprint.\n\nIt has optimized development drug development protocols.\n\nWe can we have support.\n\nAs a build it.\n\nPredictive enrollment models based on all the puts.\n\nNicole criteria thresholds.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou are familiar with the next best application in our Oce suite, which leverages, the knowhow and the historical data to create predictive models of engagements with customers.\n\nWe also.\n\nDeveloping a novel biomarker database.\n\nOne natural language processing.\n\nTools.\n\nWe've used it in the old timers studies to travel and early identification of recruitment of patients with most likely to develop whole dimers.\n\nA lot of.\n\nfrankly.\n\nTo expand patient pathways. So.\n\nIf you're looking to I'm sure, it's somewhere in our websites or literature.\n\nWe have over 150 patents pending methodologies and algorithms more than 30 predictive disease models.\n\nMore than 300 lifestyle specific analytical libraries.\n\nI mean I could go on and on we get.\n\nA lot of stuff your own proprietary material.\n\nNow this whole.\n\nBuzz around generative AI.\n\nYeah.\n\nAs people are finding finding out it's not so easy to apply and actually derive precise and relevant.\n\nYes.\n\nInsights.\n\nI'm looking forward to presenting.\n\nWhy.\n\nEven using and by the way we are working with.\n\nEveryone was.\n\nAnnounced significant generative AI.\n\nApplications and models.\n\nBecause.\n\nIt's really as always.\n\nIf you.\n\nDon't have access to the business rules and to the relevant content, you're going to come up with what.\n\nWhat they call nations.\n\nAnd we've tried needs and we've we are working with.\n\nWith partners with technology partners.\n\nAnd it's very clear.\n\nThat.\n\nWe have the source.\n\nInternally that would enable those.\n\nLawshe language model pools.\n\nA lot more effective and accurate and precise.\n\nThen what they are today.\n\nIn the World of life Sciences, where they basically only have access to what's available on the on the international on publicly public sources.\n\nAlright, that's all I can say now, but again, it's a very exciting development.\n\nObviously, we are very busy.\n\nLeveraging internally and then there was a question on margins and margin expansion is and it's one of the several.\n\nInitiatives that.\n\nHelping us.\n\nGenerate margin expansion.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you and the next now to Jillian Youre seeing interest.\n\nYeah. Thank you and thanks for taking my questions I, just wanted to ask about data and information offerings business for you guys.\n\nOne of your competitors recently talked about coming up with competitive solutions in that space for pharma companies I understand it's a more stable and high margin very sticky business for you guys, but just remind us about your positioning there and what makes the barriers to entry high in that business.\n\nYou are asking about the data business, yes, yes.\n\nOkay.\n\nOn the comments that David has made in terms of entering into the data. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I mean look I don't know what to say here.\n\nIt's just not the same planet.\n\nThe only way I can put it.\n\nThis scale.\n\nThe global presence in over 100 countries.\n\nThe level of granularity.\n\nThe infrastructure.\n\nThe it infrastructure to process plans cure connect all that data on a global basis.\n\nThe business rules I mean looking at health care data is chaos.\n\nIt's you know you could have as much data as you want if you don't understand it and connected and cleanse it and know what youre dealing with.\n\nIt's not really relevant we have data on.\n\nAbout 1 billion four.\n\nThere have been two patients.\n\nAnd.\n\nYou know.\n\nI don't think there's anyone that has anything.\n\nResembling.\n\nWhat we have I mean, I just don't know.\n\nLike we've been at it since the early 19 fifties Challender that should tell you something I mean.\n\nYou don't there's nothing.\n\nThat would stop somebody technically from recreating what we have in data.\n\nIf they have 70 years and all the expertise we have.\n\nGot it thanks a lot.\n\nThank you.\n\nOkay, well, thanks, everyone for joining us today, we look forward to speaking to all of you again on our third quarter earnings call.\n\nThe team and I will be available the rest of the day to take any other follow up questions. You may have thanks for joining.\n\nThank you again, ladies and gentlemen, we will conclude the second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day Goodbye.\n\nPlease wait the conference will begin shortly.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\n[music].\n\nNo.\n\n[music].\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nPlease wait the conference will begin shortly.\n\n[music].\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music].\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\n[music]."

    "content": "Q1 2023 IQVIA Holdings Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2023 IQVIA Holdings Inc Earnings Call\n\nIQVNYSEAPR 27, 9:00 AM\n\nThis is a machine generated transcript.\n\nDon't show again\n\nincluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work.\n\nThe diversification of our short and long cycle businesses allowed us to perform well in the quarter despite the broader macroeconomic dynamics.\n\nThe demand environment for our industry continues to be healthy.\n\nglobal clinical trial activity remains resilient and the prospects for our commercial business remain favorable. A few encouraging signs I'd like to share with you this morning the 15 largest\n\nspent a record-setting $138 billion on research and development in 2022.\n\nAccording to BioWorld, the Q1 EBP funding was $15.6 billion. That was a double-digit versus prior year and up sequentially versus Q4.\n\nMarch was a particularly strong month for EBP funding, despite concerns about the impact from the banking crisis. FDA approvals are off to a strong start in 2023. There were 13 approvals in the first quarter. That's up from an average of 9.\n\nover the prior five years.\n\nThat's a positive indicator for our commercial business.\n\nThere was a significant M&A activity in Q1, which primarily is large pharma acquiring small companies.\n\nThe industry expects 2023 M&A spend to be one of the largest years in the last decade.\n\nThis highlights the ongoing demand for molecules by large pharma.\n\nInternally, our Q1 demand metrics show continued healthy growth. I'll share a couple with you this morning. That new bookings were $2.6 billion.\n\nThat represented a quarterly book to bill of 128. As a result, our backlog reached a new record and grew 10.1% versus prior year on a reported basis.\n\nand 11.3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\n\nRFP flow set a new quarterly record. It was up sequentially 15% versus Q4 2022.\n\nOperationally, attrition levels have continued to decline and they are now in fact back to pre-pandemic levels or slightly below that.\n\nSite selection was up double digits year over year.\n\nthe unfavorable impact of the staff's shortages at investigators sites that we spoke about in prior calls. R&D's organic revenue growth at constant currency excluding COVID related work was 17%.\n\nin the quarter. That was well above the\n\nWithin TAAS, we continue to see some client consciousness related to discretionary spending.\n\nTask growth for the quarter was 6% organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work and that was within our expectations but towards the lower end.\n\nIn summary, industry demand remains healthy despite some cautiousness in discretionary spending mostly in the short cycle businesses.\n\nThe diversification of our businesses allows us to balance the current slower short-cycle growth with the resilience of our long-cycle businesses.\n\ndemonstrating that IQVIA is a company that can operate effectively under different macro environments.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter grew 2.4% on a reported basis, 4.7% at constant currency, and compared to last year, and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line As a company, 11% at constant currency\n\non an organic basis.\n\nand ongoing cost management discipline.\n\nFirst quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.45 declined slightly, as expected, driven by the one-time step up in interest rates.\n\nthe prior call, our adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded 9%.\n\nI'd like to share a few highlights of business activity in the quarter.\n\nA top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA our first omnichannel marketing deal in the Asia-Pacific region. IQVIA's omnichannel marketing program provides client teams with AI ML-powered insights.\n\nrecommendations to deliver effective personalized digital engagements with\n\nHCPs in a whole.\n\nIqvya won an award for our in-home patient services offering.\n\nThis biotech client is launching a new MS treatment.\n\nand selected IQ via based on our ability to deliver testing and monitoring to the patient's home.\n\nThis differentiated capability is the burden for patients with limited mobility.\n\nMoving to the real world part of our task business, IQVIA was awarded a major post-authorization safety study to assess the impact and outcomes of prescribing a certain asthma drug to pregnant women with severe asthma.\n\nWe won this large contract with the top 10 pharma clients due to the breadth of our capabilities.\n\nincluding our relevant experience in safety trials, our strong data and analytics capabilities, and increased delivery efficiency with faster patient enrollment.\n\nAlso in the quarter, we were awarded a large global intervention study with a top 10 pharma to identify high-risk cardiovascular patients by measuring the prevalence of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\nThis protein is produced by the liver in response to inflammation in the body.\n\nElevated levels of this protein in the blood are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease including\n\nIKIVIA was selected based on our ability to connect lab and clinical capabilities with therapeutic and real-world expertise in a cost-efficient manner.\n\nThis study will have a significant impact on the future management of cardiovascular patients.\n\nmoving to our to Rnds\n\nContinued strong momentum with our 2.6 billion of net new bookings in the quarter, translating into a book to build of 128 in the quarter, which brings our LTM book to build to 135.\n\nA few highlights in the quarter.\n\nOncology continues to be our largest therapeutic area and in the quarter, a high-profile cutting-edge biotech company entered into a strategic partnership with IQVIA.\n\nThis is a big deal. In fact, we were already awarded our first trial, which is for a novel bispecific antibody with potential development opportunities across several tumor types.\n\nVise-specific antibodies are designed to bind two different target molecules simultaneously.\n\nThis project will leverage our end-to-end clinical trial solution, including protocol design, specialized medical and regulatory expertise, biomarker development, and the creation of the elastoc DHCP microscope.\n\nand our integrated clinical operations analytics and technology.\n\nWe really are the only company with the ability to bring together these capabilities, which in turn, help the client optimize trial design and reduce time to market. Importantly, going forward, this partnership creates multiple opportunities within this client's large oncology.\n\nportfolio. We continue to have strong success with our clinical FSP trials business with several recent notable wins including a significant preferred provider award with a major pharma. This was a competitive win against two\n\nsegment. We continue to deploy innovations in our clinical technology suite. Most recently, we introduced a new cloud-based platform within our research site network that will streamline document workflows and allow real-time collaboration among study teams.\n\nWe already deployed this new technology to approximately 15% of IQVIA network sites across 28 countries and we expect to deploy to 40% of our sites in the next 12 months.\n\nThe goal of deploying this technology at the site is to increase site productivity, which frees up more time for site support, compliance reviews, and continuous monitoring of patient safety and study quality, all of which are very important, especially in an environment where...\n\nthat we experience staff shortages at the site.\n\nFinally, a couple of nice accolades for our global IQVIA team. First, I am proud to share that our lab business received the prestigious Singaporean President's Certificate of Commendation, which is awarded to organizations that had a significant impact in the fight against COVID-19. In fact, we are very proud to share that our lab business received the prestigious Singaporean Certificate of Commendation, which is awarded to organizations that had a significant impact in the fight against COVID-19.\n\ntheir outstanding contributions to manage the impact of the pandemic.\n\nThis is a nice recognition of the unique role we play in supporting public health.\n\npracticing sustainable science.\n\nThis certification is recognized by the United Nations' Race to Zero Global Campaign as the international gold standard for lab sustainability best practices towards a zero carbon future.\n\nI will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nThanks Ari and good morning everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue.\n\nFirst quarter revenue of $3,652,000,000 grew 2.4% on a reported basis and 4.7% at constant prices.\n\nIn the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $150 million, which was down about $230 million versus the first quarter of 2022. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 11%. Technology and analytics solutions revenue was $1,444,000,000.\n\npoint five percent of constant currency and excluding all covered related work organic growth at constant currency and RDS with 17 percent. Finally, contract sales and medical solutions or CSM, that's revenue of one hundred and eighty two million dollars declined six point seven percent reported and one percent of constant currency.\n\nAnd excluding all COVID related work, the organic growth declined at constant currency was also 1% of CSMS. Smooth down the P and L adjusted EBITDA was 851Million dollars for the 1st quarter. That's growth at 4.8%.\n\nGap net income was $289 million and gap diluted earns per share was $1.53.\n\nAdjusted net income was $462 million and adjusted earnings per share diluted was $2.45.\n\nNow as Ari highlighted, R&D Solutions continues its swang-lam manner. This graph shows the growth of our backlog over the past three years, which demonstrates the sustained growth of our clinical business.\n\nOur backlog at March 31 stood at a record $27.9 billion, which was up over 40% over the last three years.\n\nand growing 10% year over year. Okay, reviewing the balance sheet at March 31, cash and cash equivalents total $1,494,000,000. Gross debt was $13,176,000,000 and that resulted in net debt of $11,000,000,000.\n\n682 million dollars. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter 3.4 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA.\n\nFirst quarter cash flow from operations was strong at $417 million and CapEx was $164 million, resulting in free cash flow of $253 million.\n\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $129 million in those shares.\n\nAnd that leaves us with slightly over 1.2Billion dollars remaining under the current program. Okay, let's go now to guidance guidance for the full year. 2023 remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue.\n\nExcluding COVID-related work to go organically at constant currency between 9 and 11 percent.\n\nNow this revenue guidance continues to assume about 100 basis points of contribution from acquisitions.\n\nAnd approximately 600M dollars of COVID related revenue step down versus 2022.\n\nWe're also reaffirming our guidance on adjusted EBITDA of $3,625,000,000 to $3,695,000,000, and that represents year-over-year growth of 8.3% to 10.4%.\n\nLastly, we're reaffirming our guidance on adjusted diluted EPS of $10.26 to $10.56.\n\nAnd this adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance includes a year over year impact of the step up in interest rates in the increase in the UK corporate tax rate. Together these non-operational items impact the year over year growth rate by approximately 10 percentage points.\n\nexcluding these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n\nis expected to grow 11 to 14 percent.\n\nLet's move to our second quarter guidance. In Q2, we expect revenue to be between $3,675,000,000 and $3,750,000,000. That's growth of 3.7 to 5.8 percent on a constant currency basis and 3.8 to 5.9 percent on a reported basis. We expect revenue to be between $3,750,000 and $3,750,000.\n\nAdjustity EBITDA is expected to be between $850 million and $875 million.\n\nwhich would be up 6.3 to 9.4 percent. And adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.30 and $2.44, declining 5.7 percent to flat on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAnd keep in mind the second quarter is the toughest compare for interest expense because we had a very favorable 1 billion dollars swap Roll off on March 31, and it was also a year ago that rates started riding rising So excluding the step up of an interest expense and the increased UK tax rate we expect\n\nadjusted the rooted EPS to grow between 8 and 13 percent in the second quarter. Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of April 25th continue for the balance of the year.\n\nSo to summarize, Q1 was another solid quarter of financial performance. We delivered revenue growth of 11 percent organic, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and COVID-related work.\n\nUnderlying demand in the industry and in our business remains healthy with our RFPs accelerating in Q1 up 15% sequentially versus Q4 2022.\n\nrepresenting growth of over 10% year over year. We've been navigating well through the choppy macro environment and delivering on our numbers. Despite some of the cautiousness we've observed in the short cycle discretionary span, thanks to the resilience and the rest of the portfolio, which is mostly the long cycle and that's less affected by macro turbulence. Therefore, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of nine to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency excluding COVID related work and 11 to 14% adjusted EPS growth excluding non-operational items. And with that.\n\nLet me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A.\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. We request that you please limit yourself to just one question so that others in the queue may participate as well.\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We request that you please limit yourself to just one question so that others in the queue may participate as well. We'll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\n\nHi, thank you very much for taking my questions.\n\nbookings, you got strong book to bill, but the amount of revenue expected to convert to revenue seems kind of consistent for this quarter to last quarter. Is there a change of mix over there? Is that a rounding item or is there something else that might be going on over there? Yeah, thank you, someone. Look, we had very strong…\n\nseasonality to that but it's not the first time it happens so I wouldn't read anything into it at all it's just a question of mix\n\nYou know, months of pass-throughs that are taken into the quarter or delayed. And we're reverting to more regular mix of projects with, as you know, an increasing share in oncology, which typically burn a little slower.\n\nYour line is open. Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could speak to some of the dynamics within the TAS business. In the fourth quarter, the analytics and consulting business was impacted, but some of that maybe seemed like it was unique to December purchasing pattern. So how much of this is carryover from what you saw in the fourth quarter? And then what's driving your confidence that it's going to come back in the remainder of the year so that you can.\n\nbasis.\n\nfor the year, I think our guidance is 7 to 9 percent. And therefore, 6 percent clearly is right under that. But we did tell you that we did fully expect Q1 to be just under that. So our expectations were more in the 6 to 7, 6 to 8 percent for.\n\nor as you suggest, into the Q1, and that's why we assume a slower start in the year for this business. The reason why it's a little lower than our long-term growth expectation is due to the analytics and consulting business.\n\npiece of TAZ. That is about, I want to say, just under 25% of the total business in TAZ. And as we said many times before, it's the shortest cycle and contains the most discretionary spend.\n\nactivity of the entire TAS portfolio.\n\nSo what we are seeing is not cancellations of projects, not decisions to not conduct the project. For the most part, these are projects that need to be done. Pricing and market access studies, as an example, have to be done at some point. But the discretionary aspect applies to timing.\n\nfor the most part. Okay, no one does projects that they don't need to do. These are projects that need to be done, but they don't need to be done right this second. And we are seeing customers delaying decisions and pushing things to the right. That is what gives us confidence that in the latter part of the year, those projects will have to be done.\n\nSo that's why we maintain our 7 to 9% organic constant currency ex-COVID guidance for the year. Now we expect that consciousness to continue into the second quarter and we are assuming growth so far in line with the first quarter.\n\nAgain, we're not seeing any customers walking away from projects or canceling anything. It's just consistent with what we saw at the end of Q4, delaying a project. We do expect the situation to improve in the second half because the pipelines are stronger.\n\nand the customers eventually need to actually spend on those products. That's extremely helpful, Caller. Thank you so much.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Winley at Jefferies. Your line is open. Well, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Ari, I wondered if you could talk in the RDS business as you highlight strong bookings, I guess, seasonally different from the fourth quarter. The thing that we're seeing, I guess, in our data review is that —\n\nif any of your tools can help to move those forward, or is it kind of a funding and financial issue that is keeping them from moving forward? Be curious your views there. OK, well, David, good morning, and thanks for the question. I want to use the opportunity to\n\nstate as clearly and definitively as I can. We simply are not, I repeat, we are not seeing any of what you suggest.\n\nFirst of all, on the funding question, I don't know how many times I'm going to repeat it. I've been doing this for five quarters in a row. We are not seeing any funding issues in my introductory remarks. I share some of the statistics. Maybe everything is up.\n\non a public front.\n\nSo we are not seeing any delays, any unusual cancellations, any postponing of decision-making within our portfolio. It could be that others are seeing that we just are not seeing it. Once again, the overall RFP flow is not seeing any delays.\n\nI said before it's up 15%. The qualified pipeline, which is again an even earlier indicator, is up almost 8%. It's actually over 8% year over year, and it's almost $15 billion with, again, a record qualified pipeline. The total pipeline is over...\n\nand I think from what I've seen, the highest of our peers.\n\nOur backlog is up more than 10% year over year. That's on a reported basis, excluding FX, it's up 11.3%. So again, I'm trying to share some metrics with you here. If we look at by segment, again, it's across the board, large, mid, EDP.\n\nI've got a lot of numbers here, but everything is, honestly, everything is green here. Nick, do you have any other comments to add to this? Yes, Dave, I think the only thing I would say there is, you know, we saw your question sort of earlier this week and talked to the team, and we're not seeing any sort of slowdown in terms of clients not wanting to start trials. I mean, as soon as they're signing and pushing, you know, and getting ready, they are pushing trials.\n\nthe one place where we could burn faster and the industry could burn faster if there weren't the labor issues at the sites. Right, and as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, we have been able to offset some of that unfavorable impact, the star shortages that Ron just brought up and we talked about before.\n\nbecause site selection has been accelerating. I mentioned it was up double digits year over year, and that increased productivity helped us in the quarter, and we expect we'll continue to do so the rest of the year. We also, I mentioned also in my introductory remarks, are introducing rapidly more technology at the site in order to free up minus\n\npersonnel time and increased productivity. Thank you. Yeah, very, very fulsome answer. If I could just add to that, I mean, there's been a lot of companies this week that have attributed weakness to biotech. I mean, there are a lot of other companies seeing, you know, dramatic, you know,\n\nquestion, we have a very strong momentum. We operate the vast majority of what we do is in the sweet spot of the clinical trial process. You know, it's phase three stuff.\n\nWe're not affected by the primate issue, zero, zero. And even if the primate issue continues for the next three years, you wouldn't see it at all in our numbers. We've already looked at that. And we continue to gain share. I know I gave examples on the FSP segment. It's true across the board in oncology.\n\nWe just are winning in the marketplace. We displaced incumbents in a number of occasions with large clients. I think, you know, I don't see any, really no issues whatsoever on the R&D front, save for the execution and operation issues.\n\nwe have encountered. I mentioned that the attrition levels are coming down. I mean, I said before that the peak of the attrition, you know, a year ago, so we had more than 20% attrition, which is horrendous. And we're now back to, I said, pre-pandemic levels, actually we're below that, we're just barely over 10%, which is amazing.\n\nand very good. That enables us to do a lot more work a lot faster. Thank you, David. Yeah, thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell at Baird. Your line is open.\n\nThanks good morning. I want to hit on reimbursables on on a couple of fronts. 1st off on revenue was such a big cobit comp this quarter. I would have expected. Less reimbursable revenue, it looks like it actually grew quite a bit faster. Then service revenue, so. You know, what is the dynamic there? We're seeing mixed bag all over the industry in terms of the pass through volatility.\n\nWith that big COVID headwind, I would have expected less. You did more. Is there something underlying or outside of COVID exposure that's driving the reimbursables higher, or is it just company-specific contract timing? Oh, OK. Well, look, on a full year basis, we're expecting actually obviously less.\n\nreimbursable expenses.\n\nbecause of the disappearance of the COVID work, which was, as you suggest, very high pass-through expenses.\n\nfor those COVID vaccine trials. I wouldn't read much in the quarter because this volatility depends on the mix of what you executed. So I don't.\n\nTo be honest, the book to read is more or less similar. I read your note Friday, as I religiously do that before the call, your first flash note, and you ask why we only reported our 606, which still seeks our...\n\nBook to be that 128 and I by the way, I asked the same question to the team when they gave me the first draft and I agree with their rationale. As you've seen recent quarters, essentially the numbers are tended to converge, which is essentially what we expected to happen. We will give you.\n\nthe breakdown or the X, reimbursable expenses, book to bill, when we think there is a big discrepancy and it is significant and helps give you understanding of what happened in the quarter in terms of bookings. But if it's very close, as it was last quarter, as it is this quarter.\n\nComment of your color on Eric's question. Yeah, look, we did have a little bit higher revenue from past throughs in the quarter, but as Ari says, I wouldn't read too much into the quarter to quarter and in over a longer time period, your, your analysis is correct with code work, rolling off. There should be a decline in in past through revenues and yeah, exactly on the book that bill we just, you know, we're what. You know, 5 years in 6, 7 years in now, since the change in the accounting and, you know, we'll only talk to on the book to build the services versus pass through book to bill or the 6 or 5 versus 6 or 6.\n\nThank you. I just wanted to hit on cash flow and expectations for the year and we're juggling three overlapping reports here. So I'm sorry if I missed this. Did you did you mention what the DSO was in the quarter?\n\nNo, we didn't give an explicit DSO number. In fact, we don't typically give a DSO number. You guys can back calculate. We were happy with the cash flow in the quarter. One thing I would want to remind everyone is in the first quarter, it's typically a week quarter for cash flow because most of our incentive comp, annual incentive comp is paid in the first quarter. Yeah, there's some tax impacts too. Incentive comp is probably the biggest. Yeah.\n\nThat was very strong. Yeah, it was strong. We were happy with our cash flow and not quite as strong as last year, but last year was an unusually strong first quarter for cash flow.\n\nOkay. Yes. So then you can improve its flattish, right? I think on a quarter to quarter basis, it's fairly flat on a year-over-year basis. It's up a little bit and a lot of that has to do with the burning through the COVID-related advances that we got. So.\n\nIt was fully expected. Got it. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Max Smock at William Blair. Your line is now open.\n\nI just wanted to clarify your comment in response to one of Dave's questions earlier about the NHP situation. And I just wanted to clarify that you said that you would not see any impact from the NHP shortage, even if it continues for the next three years. Just wondering, at some point, wouldn't it limit the number of drugs getting into later stage trials here? Just would it be great to hear more about the work you've done internally to kind of evaluate your potential exposure over the next couple of weeks? Thanks.\n\nAgain, in theory, yes, but we don't expect that to happen. I mean, there will be eventually other models and they will become available.\n\nWe're not worried about this at all. Yeah, the three years just related to the length of time it takes to get from the discovery work into phase two and phase three trials. And there's a long delay between that. So yeah, of course, theoretically, if there's a protracted issue, it affects everybody in the industry. We don't expect that to happen.\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper at Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nThanks very much. I think it sounds like I need to get on Eric's distribution list so I can get his quick flash notes. I can't process fast enough to do that. So my question Ari or maybe Ron is on the backlog burn. I'm trying to reconcile.\n\nwith what you were talking about and answer his question. On my calculation did look like the backlog burn stepped down a little bit from the fourth quarter from 8% to 7.4. My assumption was there's a little bit less sequentially in terms of reimbursables. So I just wanted to verify that, but then thinking about how you're expecting the backlog burn to play out.\n\nas you have less COVID work, et cetera, which is fast for Bernie. Do you think, is it reasonable to think stable after this 7.4 or would it sort of trend down over the course of the year? Thanks.\n\nLook, I wouldn't put a lot of emphasis on quarter-to-quarter backlog burn as you calculate it there. It's not something that we pay a lot of attention to internally, I can tell you. You'll get...\n\nvariations like in the fourth quarter we had very strong pass-through bookings, which pushes up the backlog some, but then those tend to burn later in the trial. And you'll see impacts like that affect any one quarter's, particularly the next quarter's burn rate.\n\nOverall, as Ari made the point, we tend to work on more complicated trials. In oncology trials in particular tend to be longer slower burn trials. So we may have slower burn on average than some of the others in the industry based upon a particular method.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Wright, TD Cowen, your line is now open.\n\nHi, this is Lucas on for Charles. Want to dig into the task segment. You guys talked about consulting and analytics, seeing some softness in one cue. You guys also called out some wins in real-world evidence. Can you talk more about the performance of the other offerings?\n\nwithin CAF and how they performed in one queue, more specifically real world evidence and technology platforms. Look, our real world in technology, we tend to talk about them together because they're the faster growers and continue to be very solid growers in the quarter as Ari pointed out.\n\nprior quarters really relates to the analytics and consulting business, some of that shorter cycle business being delayed. It's really as simple as that. That's why we saw a little bit of a slowdown in the underlying core growth rate in the TAS business. And that's why we saw a little bit of a slowdown in the underlying core growth rate in the TAS business.\n\nNext question.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Derek DeBruin at Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nHi, this is Wolf Chanoff on for Derek. Thanks for taking our questions. So I know in the prepared remarks you flagged that there's been a pickup of biotech M&A which obviously is helping the funding environment. But I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of the larger of the acquirer than reducing the R&D spend at the target.\n\nIs there any impact to you from that? If you could just explore those dynamics, that'd be great. Thank you. Thank you. Just to clarify, the M&A span has nothing to do with funding. It's not included in the funding numbers.\n\nSo these are two different and independent points. The heightened M&A activity is a plus obviously and is a tailwind for us as you know the large clients that are buying molecules for\n\nThank you. I was just hoping you could revisit that comment you made that RFPs grew 15% sequentially. I assume that's a volume number. And is there any difference between RFP volume trends and value trends? Thank you. Thank you. No, your assumption is incorrect.\n\ngrowth numbers we mentioned are in dollars.\n\nYeah, so all the growth numbers that we've given Dan on the call are all dollar based.\n\nIt's not a volume. Perfect discussion. And that's how we tend to track it because that's what's important. Yes. Thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nHi guys, thanks so much for the question. I know each of you just talked about it in terms of total dollar value. I was just wondering if you could comment on the contribution in terms of pricing in R&DS to the dollars this year. And then secondly, just in terms of the total dollar value, I'm just wondering if you could"

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\n\nNicholas Childs\n\nSVP of IR & Treasury, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Param, Senior Director, Investor Relations.\nToday, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. The actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results.\nAs we close 2022, we are very proud of what we've achieved at IQVIA. It was a record year for our R&DS business. We achieved bookings of $10.8 billion, which was the highest ever. Our backlog stands now at a record $27.2 billion, and the business added over 275 new customers in the year.\nWe improved access to clinical research. We've expanded our decentralized clinical trial capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso. Our DCT program achieved GDPR validation in Europe, marking the first time a DCT offering received this data privacy validation. And our connected devices business added 50 new customers, including wins with 2 top 10 pharma companies.\nWe made significant advancements as well in our real-world business. We increased the number of our active data sources by more than 30% across more than 50 countries, and we enhanced access to real-world data for European and U.S. regulators through our partnerships with the European Medicines Agency and the Real-World Alliance.\nWe expanded our digital marketing capabilities with the acquisition of Lasso Marketing, which offers a technology purpose-built for health care marketers to execute digital campaigns.\nWe deployed capital of $3.7 billion during the year. This included $1.3 billion in acquisitions, $1.2 billion in share repurchase, $0.7 billion in CapEx and repayment of $510 million of debt. At the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio to 3.45x adjusted EBITDA.\n2022 also marked the end of our Vision 22 3-year strategic plan. No one could have predicted the volatile macro environment we would have to operate in during this period. Despite the many headwinds we have faced since 2019, when we set these goals, we in fact exceeded our Vision 2022 goals. I am proud of the resilience, resourcefulness and creativity that our employees around the world demonstrate every day in support of IQVIA's mission. And it is these attributes that allowed our company to deliver on comment the commitments we made to you in 2019.\nNow as you know, since the beginning of '22, the industry has been reporting a slowdown in demand for clinical and commercial services caused by reductions in biotech funding as well as the higher interest rate environment and macroeconomic uncertainty. As we've discussed before, while we've of course seen anecdotal evidence of these concerns, we at IQVIA remain confident that the fundamentals of our industry and the demand from our clients remain healthy. And in fact, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2025 goals.\nAs we begin 2023, there are more molecules in development than at any other time in history. Our RFP flow was up 13% for the full year. We in fact saw acceleration in Q4 to 22%, with double-digit growth in all 3 segments: Large, midsized and EBP segments. Our net new business reached a record $3.1 billion in Q4, which is up 29% versus prior year. For the full year, we achieved bookings of $10.8 billion despite the large COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022.\nAnd yes, in our commercial business, while we are seeing some short-term fluctuations in discretionary spend categories, such as for example consulting, demand for our commercial services nonetheless remains on a favorable growth trend.\nFinally, let me just acknowledge and congratulate our employees around the world for the nice recognition the company received last week. IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the sixth consecutive year. Importantly, once again, we earned the first place ranking within our industry group. We also ranked #1 in 7 out of 9 categories, including innovation, people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of products and services, global competitiveness and long-term investment value.\nTurning now to the results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 2.8% on a reported basis, 7% at constant currency compared to last year. And excluding COVID-related work from both periods, we grew the top line 10% at constant currency on an organic basis. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.1%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.78 grew 9%, driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth.\nA few highlights of business activity this quarter. In our technology business, IQVIA recently entered into a milestone agreement with Alibaba Cloud to collaborate in China. Through this collaboration, IQVIA will be the first company to make its Salesforce-based products available on Alibaba Cloud and the only life sciences provider to have a full Salesforce-based ecosystem of products hosted locally and designed to be compliant with China's data residency and privacy regulations. Through our partnership with Alibaba Cloud and Salesforce, IQVIA will continue to extend the OCE suite, delivering innovative capabilities tailored to meet China's specific market needs.\nAs you know, IQVIA Human Data Science Cloud offers clients a combination of extensive data networks, data integration and embedded intelligence, all of which help our clients deal with the challenge of increased data complexity and volume. A top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA our largest-ever commercial managed services deal, where we will take responsibility for managing the end-to-end commercial analytics for all their commercial brands globally.\nPersonalization of care is becoming a focus of our customers' commercial strategies. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded a major patient support program by a top 10 pharma for their [kit] cardiology product, displacing the incumbent vendor and once again validating IQVIA's uniquely differentiated, integrated domain expertise, services and technology platform.\nAs I previously highlighted, demand for our -- from our EBP customers has remained high despite the funding levels returning essentially to pre-pandemic levels. As an example, a U.S.-based emerging biopharma company recently selected IQVIA to be their end-to-end clinical-to-commercial partner. IQVIA was selected due to the breadth of capabilities, our domain expertise, strong resources and technologies, such as OCE. IQVIA will support all aspects of their first commercial launch as well as provide clinical trial services for their future indications.\nIn another example, Biostage, which is a biotech company developing regenerative medicine treatments, selected IQVIA to manage its first clinical trial of their esophageal implant product. Current treatment options for patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer result in only 20% survival at 5 years. In the first use of the implant, the trial demonstrated that the product was able to successfully regenerate tissue to restore the functionality of the esophagus. IQVIA was selected due to our dedicated gastrointestinal team and our ability and expertise running the most complex, cutting-edge cell and gene therapy trials.\nWithin R&DS, we also signed a long-term collaboration with Clalit, the largest health services provider in Israel, to launch the first Prime Site in the region. The collaboration combines IQVIA and Clalit's capabilities in clinical trial delivery, real-world research, data and genomics. Clalit operates a network of 14 hospitals and more than 1,600 primary care clinics with special expertise in oncology, pediatric rare disease and genomics.\nIn oncology, which remains the largest therapeutic area for R&D outsourcing, we continue to experience strong double-digit year-over-year growth in bookings. As an example, we expanded one of our preferred partnerships with a top global pharma, which awarded IQVIA a large early and late-stage trial in multiple oncology indications. We were selected because of our analytics to optimize protocol development, site selection and operational planning, including our ability to recruit patients meeting their diversity targets.\nSo overall, the R&DS business continues its strong momentum. You saw we achieved new bookings of $3.1 billion in the quarter, the highest in our history. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.51, including pass-throughs. And excluding pass-throughs, the business delivered almost $2 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill of -- a ratio of 1.30. For the full year, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.36 including pass-throughs and 1.33 excluding pass-throughs.\nI will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.739 billion grew 2.8% on a reported basis and 7% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $190 million, which was down about $150 million versus the fourth quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is, excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 10%.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.499 billion, up 0.2% reported and 4.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 7%.\nR&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $2.058 billion was up 5.9% reported and 9.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 14%.\nFinally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS, fourth quarter revenue of $182 million declined 7.1% reported but grew 2% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was also 2%.\nFor the full year, revenue was $14.410 billion, growing at 3.9% on a reported basis and 7.8% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues totaled approximately $1 billion for the year. In our base business, again, that's excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 13%.\nFor the full year, Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.746 billion, up 3.8% reported and 8.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the year.\nFull year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7.921 billion, growing 4.8% reported and 7.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 17%.\nFull year CSMS revenue was $743 million, which was down 5.2% reported but grew 2.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 4% for the year.\nNow let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $920 million for the fourth quarter, representing growth of 11.1%, while full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.346 billion, which was up 10.7% year-over-year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $227 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.20. Full year GAAP net income was $1.091 billion or $5.72 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $524 million in the fourth quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9% to $2.78. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.937 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.16, up 12.5% year-over-year.\nNow as Ari reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of bookings. Our backlog at December 31 stood at a record $27.2 billion, which was up 9.6% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11.6% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. Without that impact of foreign exchange year-over-year, backlog would have been about $500 million higher.\nFull year net new business increased $10.8 billion, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported basis -- it increased to $10.8 billion, I should say, growing 6.2% year-over-year on a reported basis despite the significant amount of COVID bookings we had in 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022.\nOkay. Reviewing the balance sheet. As of December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.216 billion and gross debt was $12.747 billion, and that resulted in net debt of $11.531 billion. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 3.45x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $560 million and CapEx was $171 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $389 million for the quarter.\nNow as we shared on the last earnings call, early in the fourth quarter, we retired $510 million of variable rate U.S. dollar term loan that was scheduled to mature in early 2024. At the end of the year, we entered into a $1 billion -- or $1 billion of floating fixed -- floating to fixed interest rate swaps to further limit our exposure to changes in interest rates. And with these changes, our debt structure at year-end was 66% fixed. And we expect this to drop to about 58% fixed at the end of Q1, when as you know, we have a $1 billion swap expiring.\nDecember 31 marked the end of our Vision 2022 3-year plan. And as Ari mentioned, we exceeded our commitments, and here are a few highlights. We achieved a compound average growth rate for revenue of 9.1% reported and 10.2% adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. This achievement exceeded the high end of our goal range of 7% to 10%. Our 3-year CAGR for adjusted EBITDA was 11.7%, exceeding our goal of 8% to 11%. And for adjusted diluted earnings per share, the average growth rate was 16.7%, consistent with our goal of double-digit growth. Finally, our net leverage ratio exiting 2022 of 3.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA compared favorably to our goal of 3.5 to 4x.\nOkay. Let's turn now to 2023 guidance. For the full year 2023, we expect total revenue to be between $15.150 billion and $15.400 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5.1% to 6.9%. This revenue growth includes about 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity and a very slight FX tailwind of approximately 10 basis points versus the prior year.\nAdjusting for the COVID-related work step-down, which we anticipate to be approximately $600 million, the contribution of acquisitions and the FX tailwind, our guidance implies 9% to 11% underlying organic revenue growth at constant currency.\nOur adjusted EBITDA guidance is $3.625 billion to $3.695 billion, a growth of 8.3% to 10.4%. Our adjusted diluted EPS guidance is $10.26 to $10.56, representing year-over-year growth of 1% to 3.9%.\nOur EPS guidance includes about $615 million of interest expense; just under $550 million of operational D&A; an effective income tax rate of approximately 21%, which is about 1 point higher than it otherwise would have been because of the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%. And finally, our EPS guidance assumes an average diluted share count slightly above 190 million shares. Adjusting for the year-over-year impact of the onetime step-up in interest rates and the higher U.K. tax rate, our guidance implies adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 14%.\nThis guidance assumes about $2 billion of cash deployment split evenly between acquisitions and debt retirement. Regarding the latter, we expect to retire remaining term debt maturing in March 2024 towards the end of the year, that is, the end of '23. Based on these assumptions and our guidance, our net leverage ratio should drop to below 3x adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023. Finally, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 8 continue for the balance of the year.\nNow I know there are a lot of moving pieces in our guidance, so let me share some additional color on the revenue and adjusted EPS dynamics in 2023.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $600 million versus 2022. And I should highlight that about 40% of this step-down will occur in the first quarter. Now we'll more than compensate for this headwind during the course of the year as we project revenue to grow between 9% and 11% organically at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work.\nAs I also mentioned previously, our full year guidance includes about 100 basis points of M&A contribution and a very slight tailwind from foreign exchange of 10 basis points. Now that said, it's important to point out that we will actually experience a headwind from FX in the first half.\nNow at the segment level, we expect TAS revenue growth to be 6% to 8% reported. This includes a year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work. Underlying organic growth for TAS, that is, adjusting for the step-down in COVID work, FX and acquisition impacts, will be 7% to 9%.\nR&DS revenue will grow 5% to 7% reported. This reflects an even more significant year-over-year step-down in COVID-related work. Underlying organic growth for R&DS, again, adjusting for COVID-related work, FX and acquisition impacts, will be 10% to 12%.\nAnd finally, in CSMS, revenue growth is expected to be flat reported and approximately 2 percentage points organic excluding COVID-related work and FX impacts.\nOn adjusted EPS, we will experience the year-over-year impact of the step-up in interest rates and an increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate that I mentioned. Together, these nonoperational items are expected to impact growth by approximately 10 percentage points year-over-year. Excluding these items, we expect to deliver strong results with 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth.\nIt's important to note that the year-over-year increase in interest expense step-up will be most pronounced in the first half, while the operational tailwind from our cost-cutting and productivity initiatives will be skewed towards the second half of the year. And these timing issues are relevant to our first quarter guidance.\nThe first quarter will be the toughest comparison versus the prior year primarily due to 4 factors: Number one, the largest headwind from FX despite FX being a tailwind for the year; number two, the largest year-over-year COVID-related step-down; third, the toughest interest expense comparison; and finally, fourth, the phase-in during the year of the benefits of our productivity initiatives, which will increase as we progress through the year.\nSo as a result, in Q1, we expect revenues to be between $3.570 billion and $3.640 billion or growth of 2.4% to 4.3% on a constant currency basis and 0.1% to 2% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be between 9% and 11%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $835 million and $860 million, which is up 2.8% to 5.9%.\nAnd finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.46, declining 4.9% to 0.4%. Excluding the step-up of interest expense and the tax rate in the U.K., we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow between 6% and 10% in the first quarter. Again, our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of February 8 continue for the balance of the year.\nSo to summarize. Q4 was another strong quarter, capping a successful year. For the full year, revenue grew 13% organic at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. And adjusted EPS was up 13%. Underlying demand in the industry and our business remain healthy with RFP growth accelerating in Q4 and record bookings in R&DS.\nDuring 2022, we repurchased almost $1.2 billion of our shares and retired $500 million of variable rate term debt while reducing our net debt leverage ratio to 3.4x. We exceeded our Vision 2022 commitments despite the volatile macro environment. And lastly, we're projecting strong operating performance again in 2023 with 9% to 11% organic revenue growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work; and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth, excluding nonoperational headwinds.\nAnd with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.\n\nNicholas Childs\n\nSVP, IR & Corporate Communications, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Gustavo Param, Senior Director, Investor Relations, who has succeeded Bryan Stengel. Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results.\nIQVIA delivered another quarter of strong financial results despite market concerns about slowing demand, broader macroeconomic challenges and the various global geopolitical issues. In fact, indicators of demand both from customers and in the market generally remain healthy. Industry critical trial starts continue to trend ahead of last year, rising almost 7% year-to-date. The pipeline of active early-stage and late-stage molecules are both up 8% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\nEBP funding, which has been a lingering concern since the beginning of the year when one of our smaller competitors raised alarms. EBP funding improved in fact, in the quarter. According to BioWorld, third quarter funding was $18.7 billion, the highest of any quarter this year. Year-to-date, funding is running at about a $60 billion annual rate, which exceeds the average of the last 5 years pre COVID. Our own RFP flow grew mid-teens in Q3 and RFP flow in both the large pharma and EBP segment are up double digits on a year-to-date basis.\nOur Q3 book-to-bill was 1.39, excluding pass-throughs and 1.27, including pass-throughs, continuing our strong results from the first half of the year. And as a result, as you saw, our backlog grew 5.4% versus prior year on a reported basis and 9.4% excluding the impact from foreign exchange. As you can tell, we are not experiencing any signs of slowdown in demand.\nIt also helps that we are extremely diversified. Remember, we serve over 10,000 customers in more than 100 countries, including all top 25 large pharma clients across the spectrum of therapeutic areas. Now while demand remains very healthy, as you know and as we have been saying throughout the year, we have been dealing with operational challenges caused by the global macro environment, including wage inflation, high levels of attrition, obviously the ongoing Russia-Ukraine disruptions, reoccurring China lockdowns that are still going on. And perhaps that's a newer development, some staff shortages at certain investigator sites.\nAs you know, we have been able to overcome all these issues as reflected in our results for the first 9 months of the year. Although as we end the year, we are anticipating some minor delays in the timing of deliveries caused by this macro disruptions and specifically by the bottlenecks that are created by staff shortages at certain sites and that are delaying the execution of our deliveries. This is why we decided to tweak the guidance a little in the final stretch to the end of the year.\nA note on our capital allocation strategy as a result of persistent high levels of inflation, interest rates have been increasing sharply. In response, we are adjusting our capital allocation strategy to include some debt paydown in addition to continuing the M&A and share repurchase opportunistically as in the past.\nIn summary, the underlying demand in the industry and in our businesses remain strong, and we are managing through the headwinds caused by the factors I just discussed.\nNow let's review the third quarter in more detail. Revenue for the third quarter grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. The $22 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by operational upside in both TAS and R&DS services, offset by continued foreign exchange headwinds.\nCompared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 14% at constant currency on an organic basis. Notably, on the same basis, the R&DS business was up 18% and TAS was up 12%.\nThird quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 11.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline offsetting the headwinds of wage inflation that are persisting in our business. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.48 grew 14.3% driven by our adjusted EBITDA growth.\nI did provide some color on the business, starting with the commercial and technology side. The exponential increase in industry data access and complexity has created tremendous new opportunities for insight and evidence generation. But making this data usable requires robust information management capabilities. And as you know, at IQVIA, we've been building these capabilities for decades.\nIn the call, the top 10 pharma clients selected IQVIA's human data science cloud to power large-scale data and analytics programs by centralizing and harmonizing data for 35 large countries across their primary care and specialty medicine portfolio. We continue to advance digital marketing in health care. We're deploying a privacy-first, open ecosystem that delivers health care information in a timely and personalized manner to meet the fast-changing needs of the health care consumer.\nIn the quarter, IQVIA acquired Lasso Marketing, which developed an operating system that's purpose-built for health care marketers to coordinate and execute omnichannel digital campaigns from a single platform. In addition, DMD Marketing Solutions, which you will recall, we acquired about a year ago, was recently selected by a top 10 pharma client to bring to market 13 oncology and biological brands using digital insights to deliver personalized brand content to HCPs that are relevant to their practices and interest.\nDemand for our commercial technology solutions remained strong. This quarter, the top 20 pharma clients selected IQVIA's commercial technology ecosystem suite to transform its commercial operations into an AI-enabled commercial model. The customer will deploy IQVIA's orchestrated customer engagement suite, IQVIA's master data management and orchestrated analytics in more than 30 countries, driving a 20% efficiency gain in customer coverage and boosting the speed and precision of their older management process.\nIn the real-world business, IQVIA continues to lead in innovative study design that combine multiple IQVIA capabilities. For example, in the quarter, we were awarded a multiyear portfolio of real-world studies in psychiatry from a midsized pharma company. We are combining faster data-driven recruitment time lines with a comprehensive home health infrastructure to reduce the burden on both the patients and the site. In another example, we were awarded a significant contract with a major med tech company to identify early markers for organ transplant rejection to a non-interventional study that combines our med tech, real-world and translational sciences capabilities.\nMoving to RDS. Our decentralized clinical trial, DCT program, has received independent compliance validation from EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, from Trust Arc, which is the leader in GDPR validation. This is a big deal. This program is highly recognized in the industry as it requires 2 separate independent audits. It's a key achievement for IQVIA as it is the first time any DCT offering has received this European data privacy validation.\nIn addition, we've now expanded our DCT capabilities by launching the first self-collection safety lab panel for U.S. clinical trial participants in collaboration with Tasso Inc., a leader in clinical grade blood collection solutions. Participants in clinical trials can now provide a blood specimen for lab testing in the comfort of their own home without the need to visit an investigator site or have a health care professional visit them, expanding our DCT offerings and capabilities.\nAnd of course, as you've seen, the overall R&DS business continues its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. This translated into a quarterly book-to-bill ratio of 1.39 excluding pass-throughs. And including pass-throughs, the business delivered over $2.5 billion of total net new business in the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.27. Over the last 12 months, our contracted book-to-bill ratio was 1.35, excluding pass-throughs, and 1.29, including pass-throughs.\nI will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone.\nLet's start by reviewing revenue. Third quarter revenue of $3.562 billion grew 5% on a reported basis and 10.5% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $220 million, down about $160 million versus the third quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 14%.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $1.4 billion, up 4.7% reported and 11.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 12%. R&D Solutions third quarter revenue of $1.979 billion was up 6.8% reported and 10.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 18%, as Ari mentioned. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS third quarter revenue of $183 million declined 9% reported, but grew 1% at constant currency. And excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 3%.\nYear-to-date revenue was $1.671 billion grew 4.2% on a reported basis and 8.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues were about $850 million year-to-date. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency was 14%. Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue year-to-date was $4.247 billion, up 5.2% reported and 10.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech & Analytics Solutions was 11%.\nR&D Solutions year-to-date revenue of $5.863 billion was up 4.5% at actual FX rates and 7.1% at constant currency. But excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19% year-to-date. Finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS year-to-date revenue of $561 million declined 4.6% reported and grew 2.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 5%.\nNow let's move down the P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $814 million for the third quarter, representing growth of 11.8% while year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $2.426 billion, up 10.6% year-over-year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $283 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.49. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $864 million or $4.52 of earnings per diluted share.\nAdjusted net income was $470 million for the third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.3% to $2.48 and year-to-date adjusted net income was $1.413 billion or $7.39 per share.\nNow it's already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of bookings. Our backlog at September 30 stood at a record $25.8 billion, an increase of 5.4% year-over-year on a reported basis and 9.4% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange. In fact, I might point out that without the impact of foreign exchange, year-over-year backlog would be $900 million higher. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to $7.1 billion, growing 2.8% year-over-year on a reported basis and 6.7% adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange.\nNow reviewing the balance sheet. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.274 billion and gross debt was $12.394 billion resulting in net debt of $11.120 billion. Our net leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.42x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.\nThird quarter cash flow from operations was $863 million, and CapEx was $165 million, resulting in a strong free cash flow result of $698 million for the quarter. You saw in the quarter that we repurchased $150 million of our shares, which puts our year-to-date share repurchase at slightly above $1.1 billion and this leaves us with just under $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program.\nAs Ari discussed earlier, we're adjusting our cash deployment strategy in the light of higher interest rates. Earlier this month, we retired $510 million of variable rate U.S. dollar term loan scheduled to mature early in 2024. And this was in October, so you don't see it in our end of September balance sheet. We will likely retire additional term debt during 2023 while we continue to pursue acquisitions and repurchase shares as has been our practice since the merger.\nNow let's turn now to guidance. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect revenue, excluding COVID-related work to grow organically at constant currency in the low to mid-teens. On a reported basis, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has caused over $500 million of full year headwind since our initial guidance last November. And this $500 million includes a further impact since our second quarter earnings release.\nIn addition, as already mentioned, global macro environment challenges such as wage inflation, investigator staff shortages, slower-than-expected recovery of patient visits, continued lockdowns in China and the still unresolved Russia-Ukraine conflict are persisting. And so far, we've been able to offset all of these challenges and absorb them in our numbers, but we're forecasting a modest residual impact in pockets of our business during the balance of the year, and we reflected this in the updated guidance.\nSo for the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14.325 billion and $14.425 billion. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents an adjustment of about $100 million with roughly 2/3 of this driven by foreign exchange impact and the rest by the macro environment headwinds I just detailed (inaudible). Our updated guidance represents year-over-year growth of 7.4% to 8.2% at constant currency and 3.2% to 4% on a reported basis. And as a reminder, this equates to the low to mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work.\nOur projected revenue growth includes approximately 200 basis points of contribution from M&A. We're also updating our guidance on adjusted EBITDA to reflect the revenue and cost headwinds mentioned. We're now expecting the guidance range to be between -- we are now setting the guidance range to be between $3.330 billion and $3.360 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 11.2%.\nAnd lastly, we're raising the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA EPS guidance by $0.05 to reflect updated estimates of costs below the adjusted EBITDA line. We now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $10.10 and $10.20, which represents year-over-year growth of 11.8% to 13%.\nMoving to our fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be between $3.654 billion and $3.754 billion or a growth of 5.5% to 8.2% on a constant currency basis and 0.5% to 3.2% on a reported basis. Excluding all COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be over 10% at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $904 million and $934 million, that's up 9.2% to 12.8%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.72 and $2.82, growing 6.7% to 10.6%. Now all of our guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of October 24 continue for the balance of the year.\nSo to summarize before we go to Q&A, the underlying demand in the industry and our business remain very healthy. We delivered strong operational P&L and free cash flow performance in the quarter. Revenue grew mid-teens organically at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our R&DS business continued its strong momentum with services bookings in the quarter, exceeding $2 billion for the first time ever. Contracted backlog sits at a new record of $25.8 billion, up over 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We repurchased nearly $150 million of our shares while reducing our net leverage ratio to approximately 3.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And finally, we retired, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, $510 million of our variable term debt.\nWith that, let me hand it over to the operator to start the Q&A session."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.\n\nNicholas Childs\n\nSVP, IR & Corporate Communications, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations.\nToday, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. IQVIA delivered strong financial results this quarter despite the dynamics of the broader macro environment and the various global geopolitical issues. Let me address a few of the key ones.\nSome of you have continued to ask about the impact of biotech funding on the CRO industry. As we have said on several occasions, the recent decline in biotech funding has not had any significant impact on our business. Our exposure to pre-commercial EBPs remains at just over 10% of our backlog. We have not seen any impact on bookings or RFPs nor any increase in cancellations or delays in clinical trial work from the slowdown in biotech funding. Actually, RFP dollars from the overall EBP clients segment continued to grow double digits in the quarter.\nIn China, the government-imposed COVID lockdowns had a modest impact on our second quarter results, mostly from disruptions to our clinical and laboratory operations. Our commercial business was virtually unaffected. Our experience in managing through prior lockdowns during the pandemic has been helpful in minimizing the operational impacts on site closures. Our guidance assumes that modest impacts from COVID-related lockdowns in China will continue through the end of the third quarter.\nIn Ukraine, we continue to work with sites and sponsors to ensure the safety of our employees and patients while working to mitigate trial disruptions caused by the ongoing crisis. In Russia, we continue to conduct trials currently underway to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials, but we are moving recruitment on new trials to other countries. The financial impact of the Russian-Ukraine crisis are tracking in line with the expectations we communicated back in April.\nMore generally, we are, of course, monitoring, as are you, the possibility of a recession. I would just note that over the past 20 years, IQVIA along with the broader CRO industry has shown resilience to economic downturns. During recessionary times over the past 2 decades, annual S&P 500 revenue contracted by as much as 10%, while IQVIA's clinical business and the CRO industry as a whole never experienced a year of revenue decline. The resilience of the CRO industry likely reflects the long-cycle nature of our business as well as, of course, the mission-critical importance of clinical research, and more generally, the defensive nature of health care.\nWith that as background, let's review the second quarter.\nRevenue for the second quarter grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. The $46 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was primarily driven by the timing of pass-through revenues versus our expectations as well as some operational upside. Compared to last year and excluding COVID-related work from both periods, our base businesses grew 16% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional detail in his remarks, including COVID-adjusted numbers for each of our segments.\nSecond quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10.8%, reflecting our strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management discipline. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.44 grew 14.6%, driven entirely by our adjusted EBITDA growth. Let me provide some more update and color on the business in the quarter.\nThe continued strong performance at IQVIA is driven by our highly differentiated capabilities. As you know, the key differentiator for us in the clinical and commercial spaces is IQVIA's Connected Intelligence. Let me give you a few examples of how IQVIA's applications here help our clients solve their most complex problems. IQVIA's AI-driven Next Best Action platform helps our clients integrate multiple data sources, transforming raw data into personalized recommendations to sales, marketing and medical personnel, which, of course, leads to deeper relationships with health care providers.\nIn the quarter, a top 10 pharma client chose IQVIA's solution to completely transform their omnichannel commercial engagement model and to improve their go-to-market efficiency across multiple brands in 8 countries by up to 30%. Another example in the quarter, we were selected by a top 20 pharma client to optimize the delivery of brand content directly to health care providers for one of their respiratory brands. Our solution here connects digital and field sales channels to deliver highly personalized content that results in high-quality, seamless brand experience for health care providers. This will improve this client's digital engagement metrics by 3.5x.\nAnother area where demand has been growing is pharmacovigilance. Our platform here combines a unique catalog of over 500,000 safety-specific terms and patterns with natural language processing to mine vast amounts of online data and to identify potential adverse events. In the quarter, another top 10 pharma client selected our solution to reduce the risk of noncompliance and to increase data accuracy, ultimately improving that efficiency by up to 75%.\nBeyond large pharma, our commercial solutions are also resonating with EBP clients, especially when they decide to commercialize their assets on their own following approval. For example, in the quarter, we contracted with a leading EBP client to implement and manage their entire end-to-end commercial information management and to support their patient engagement and access programs. This includes data provisioning, master data management and data modeling. Our ability to offer these services on a fully integrated platform will allow for a more streamlined implementation, generating savings of up to 20% versus multi-vendor solutions.\nAs you know, IQVIA continues to be the global leader in real-world evidence. In the quarter, a top 10 pharma awarded IQVIA a major project in medical affairs. The project leverages our AI and ML capabilities to provide near-real-time disease insights across 5 different therapeutic areas. These insights will help identify misdiagnosis and suboptimal treatments, which will in turn improve patient outcomes.\nAs you know, our eCOA, or electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment, platform has won multiple awards for its breakthrough patient engagement innovations. The product includes a library of over 1,500 prebuilt clinical outcome assessments, which enables sponsors to deploy assessments to patients after 14 weeks, sooner than competitors' offerings. This efficiency reduces risks to study start-up time lines and allows our clients to capture more feedback from patients, ultimately amplifying the patient's voice real time.\nA top 5 sponsor recently engaged IQVIA to couple with eCOA platform with our patient randomization tool so that we eliminate redundant workflows, improve data accuracy and patient compliance, thereby reducing site onboarding activities by an estimated 50%.\nFinally, in the overall R&DS business, we continued our strong momentum, delivering over $2.6 billion of total net new business in the quarter, including pass-throughs. The services bookings also remained at the historic high we have seen recently of over $1.9 billion. This resulted in second quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.34 including pass-throughs and 1.32 excluding pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months, our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.32, both including and excluding pass-throughs.\nAs you can see, -- there continues to be strong positive momentum across the business and an unprecedented level of engagement with our clients across our portfolio of commercial and clinical businesses despite the broader environment.\nI will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing revenue. Second quarter revenue of $3.541 billion grew 3% on a reported basis and 7.1% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $250 million, which was down about $300 million versus the second quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was 16%.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $1.408 billion, up 4.1% reported and 9.4% at constant currency. Now excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10%. Research & Development Solutions second quarter revenue of $1.950 billion was up 3.1% reported and 6% at constant currency and excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 22%.\nContract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS second quarter revenue of $183 million declined 5.7% reported but grew 2.1% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 7%. First half revenue of $7.109 billion grew 3.8% on a reported basis and 6.9% at constant currency. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency for the first half was 14%.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first half was $2.847 billion, up 5.4% reported and 9.6% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was 10% for the first half. R&D Solutions first half revenue of $3.884 billion was up 3.3% at actual FX rates and 5.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was 19%.\nAnd finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions or CSMS first half revenue of $378 million declined 2.3% reported and grew 3.9% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was 6%.\nNow as we move down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $800 million, representing growth of 10.8%, while first half adjusted EBITDA was $1.612 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $256 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.34. For the first half, we had GAAP net income of $581 million or $3.02 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $466 million for the second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14.6% to $2.44. For the first half, adjusted net income was $943 million or $4.91 per share.\nNow as already highlighted, R&D Solutions delivered yet another strong quarter of new business. This graph that we're showing here shows the growth of our backlog over the past few years at actual currency rates, and it demonstrates the sustained strength of our clinical business through the COVID pandemic.\nNow you'll recall that as our bookings reached record levels during the pandemic, many of you expressed concern about a looming so-called COVID cliff. And we told you then that our COVID-related bookings would be replaced by new programs that span the breadth of our therapeutic expertise, and in fact, that's what happened. As of June 30, our contracted backlog stands at a record $25.6 billion, including pass-throughs. That's a 50% increase over about 3 years. The COVID contribution to our backlog, which peaked at 11% early in 2021, is now approximately 6%.\nOkay, let's turn to the balance sheet. As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.428 billion, and gross debt was $12.767 billion, resulting in net debt of $11.339 billion. Our net leverage ratio as of June 30 was 3.58x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $329 million and CapEx was $161 million, resulting in free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter. But this was somewhat lower than prior quarters, and it mainly reflected the timing of cash collection, which we expect to normalize in the second half.\nYou saw in the quarter that we are quite active in the market, repurchasing $590 million of our shares, and this puts our year-to-date share repurchase activity at just shy of $1 billion. This means this was slightly over $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program.\nOkay, moving to guidance. Our full year 2022 revenue expectation at constant currency remains unchanged. On a reported basis, the strengthening of the dollar since April has caused an incremental full year revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $125 million based on rates as of this Monday, July 18. We're updating our revenue guidance to reflect this.\nFor the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14.400 billion and $14.550 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.4% to 8.5% at constant currency and 3.8% to 4.9% at actual FX rates. Now as a reminder, this equates to low- to mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our projected revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A.\nSince FX fluctuations has had a minimal impact on our profit, our adjusted EBITDA guidance remains unchanged. We are tightening the guidance range to be between $3.345 billion and $3.395 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 10.7% to 12.3%. And our adjusted diluted EPS guidance also remains unchanged, we are tightening the range here between $10 and $10.20, which translates to year-over-year growth at 10.7% to 13%.\nOur full year 2022 guidance assumes that foreign currency rates as of July 18 continue for the balance of the year. Since issuing our initial guidance at our analyst and investor conference in November, FX fluctuations have caused full year revenue headwind of over $400 million.\nMoving to our third quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be between $3.550 billion and $3.565 billion or growth of 8.4% to 9.8% on a constant currency basis and 3.7% to 5.1% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency of being in the low to mid-teens in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $805 million and $820 million, up 10.6% to 12.6%, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.34 and $2.42, growing 7.8% to 11.5%.\nSo to summarize, we delivered a very strong second quarter. Our base business delivered mid-teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work. Our R&DS business had another strong bookings quarter with over $2.6 billion of net new business. Contracted backlog at the end of the quarter is at a new record of $25.6 billion, up over 7% year-over-year. We repurchased nearly $600 million of our shares while maintaining our net leverage ratio of approximately 3.6x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And finally, we adjusted our revenue guidance to reflect changes in foreign exchange but held our earnings guidance unchanged.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back over to our operator for Q&A."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, please begin your conference.\n\nNicholas Childs\n\nSVP, IR & Corporate Communications, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations.\nToday, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results will differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today to discuss our first quarter results.\nIQVIA has very strong financial results in the quarter, and that is despite the broader macro environment. On this note, regarding first, the tragic situation in the Ukraine, our thoughts and concerns from the beginning have been around the safety and wellbeing of our employees, the patients we support and all those affected by the ongoing events. We've been actively supporting our employees and their families on the ground with evacuation support, relocation services and financial assistance. For example, we accelerated bonus payments. And actually, we continue to pay our employees there regardless of their ability to perform any work.\nIn addition, IQVIA capabilities are being utilized to help support the resulting refugee crisis, for example. Ukrainian refugees are entering surrounding countries with medicines and prescriptions, and medical professionals in those countries are seeking to identify and convert product information on these prescriptions into their local equivalent. To help, we've established a free online service for medical professionals to search a product name, active ingredients and strength, and the tool generates a list of matching products in whichever the local country around Ukraine is.\nAlso, we've been working very closely with our customers, suppliers and clinical sites across the region to ensure continuity of our in-flight clinical trials and ensure, of course, that our clients are able to continue to support the effective delivery of medicines to vulnerable patients in the region who depend on these medicines. In Ukraine, we're providing support to ensure that trial patients who have begun receiving treatment to remain on their treatment protocols. We've established direct-to-patient shipments of investigational medical products and patient call centers in order to ensure patient care can continue.\nIn Russia, we are guided by ethical concerns to ensure the safety of patients already enrolled in clinical trials. We are utilizing our global logistics and procurement infrastructure to facilitate the movement of investigational medical products, lab kits and samples into and out of the country to minimize potential adverse impact to patient care.\nFor studies that are in startup or early phase in both countries, we are redirecting patient recruitment to other countries based on consultations with our customers. Even though a little less than 1% of our overall revenue and approximately 3% of our global patient recruitment come from the Ukraine and Russia, the operational disruptions I just described will have some financial impact, which we have incorporated into our updated guidance.\nNow another key focus area for investors in the quarter, as you well know, has been the emerging biopharma funding environment. We received a number of questions on this topic since our earnings release in February, and we have addressed those in multiple forums. However, there have been some lingering questions on the same topic, and I want to take this opportunity once again to reiterate our comments with a specific focus, A, on the funding environment; and B, on our own company's exposure to this EVP segment.\nI'll start by stating that the concern about EVP funding environment is overstated. I want to support the assertion with 4 key points. Number one, the industry has observed a slowdown in public funding compared to the record levels in '20 and '21, but the private venture capital markets have continued to be strong and funding in the first quarter of '22 was the third highest ever according to the International Venture Capital Association. I will also observe that these EVP firms are sitting on large amounts of cash from the very strong funding cycles in '20 and '21.\nNumber two, when there is a reduction in EVP funding, or the IPO market contracts, mid and large pharma companies often step up their acquisition activities of EVP companies and frankly, that benefits us as we have long-standing relationships with these customers. In fact you may have seen the recent acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals by Regeneron which illustrates this very point.\nNumber three, history tells us that when EVP funding slows, it does not have a significant effect on our business. For example, following the last EVP funding slowdown in 2015, '16, our IQVIA biotech unit saw no interruption in net new business and revenue growth nor any unusual increase in cancellations.\nAnd finally, number four, when we look at either our pipeline or RFP activity, we have simply not seen any slowdown. No unusual cancellation activity, no unusual delays in decision-making. In fact, in the quarter, our overall R&DS RFP dollars were up 13% year-over-year and RFP dollars from EVP were up over 16%. The broader industry continues to show strength. We are seeing clinical trials start up 7% in the first quarter compared to last year, with a 14% increase in oncology trial starts, which is a therapeutic area, as you well know, that's predominantly sponsored by EVP.\nNow, let me focus on our own exposure to this segment, specifically pre-commercial EVPs, which are those EVPs that have $0 revenue and are the most vulnerable and exposed to the funding environment. And here, I want to make another 4 points. Number one, as of March 31, pre-commercial EVPs represented just over 10% of our total R&DS backlog. Number two, less than 7% of our overall RFP dollars in the quarter came from pre-commercial EVPs. Number three, this exposure to pre-commercial EVP for IQVIA is not only minimal, but also, I want to point out and underline that our vetting process for taking on a pre-commercial EVP is extremely rigorous and thorough. The process includes, for example, a review of the clients' cash balances, payment history, the viability and quality of their science, and of course, progress with clinical development.\nSo again, said differently, not every EVP who knocks at our door with a molecule that they think is interesting, makes it into our backlog. Number four, I would simply remind you that this exposure primarily impacts our R&DS segment. Approximately 45% of IQVIA's total company revenue comes from our commercial businesses. And as you know, there is virtually 0 pre-commercial EVP exposure on the commercial side.\nBut we don't comment at background. Let me now delve into the first quarter results. Revenue for the first quarter grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. The $23 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by strong operational performance across all 3 segments, and that was, of course, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID-related work for both years, our core businesses grew about 13% at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide additional detail in his remarks, including COVID-adjusted numbers for each of our 3 segments.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 9.1%, reflecting our revenue growth, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.47 grew 13.3%. That was 4% above the midpoint of our guide which is -- with about $0.03 of the beat coming from operational improvements. And I'll provide an update on the business, and let's start with the commercial and technology side.\nWe've spoken before and you're familiar with IQVIA's Connected Intelligence framework, which leverages our advanced analytics, technology and domain expertise across the entire clinical and commercial portfolio, and has been critical in supporting the emerging needs of the pharma industry. I want to give a recent example of how these capabilities are being deployed. In the quarter, we entered into a multiyear agreement with argenx for the development and commercialization of new indications for their rare disease product currently approved for treatment of a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the muscles.\nOur collaboration with argenx incorporates IQVIA's Connected Intelligence to support clinical development, real-world evidence, regulatory and commercial support to accelerate the development of this product for potential treatment of other severe autoimmune diseases and to expand globally. It's an exciting product with a lot of upside potential. It's currently approved to treat 6 indications, has the potential for up to 15 indications, plus this drug has already been launched in the U.S. and has plans to launch in Europe and in Japan in the next year.\nAnother example of a client selecting IQVIA's integrated capabilities to solve complex problems is Ferrer, a European pharma client recently selected IQVIA's Vigilance Platform and regulatory information management technology. This is an area that's a real headache for our clients, and our technology solutions simplify and streamline their processes. Ferrer will benefit from our technologies integrated AI, ML capabilities, automation of labor heavy activities and easy implementation. To date, over 150 clients have adopted 1 or more solutions within our safety, regulatory and quality suite of technology.\nIn real-world evidence, I'm sure you've seen that we were selected to support DARWIN, or data analysis and real-world interrogation network. DARWIN is a strategic initiative of the EMA. This is a major win for IQVIA as it draws on our proprietary technologies, methods and deep scientific and operational expertise. It will help us deepen our relationship with health care providers and sites across Europe.\nMoving to clinical technology. IQVIA continues to lead the industry in decentralized clinical trials. Our end-to-end solution of integrated technology and services capabilities are being utilized on just over 1/3 of our full-service trials globally. To date, we've recruited over 300,000 patients across 80 countries covering over 30 indications.\nNow whether for traditional or decentralized trials, demand for our suite of digital clinical technology offerings continue to increase in the first quarter. To date, over 400 clients have adopted 1 or more modules within our Orchestrated Clinical technology suite since launch. One of these key modules, for example, is our clinical trial payment solution. This technology ensures accurate, timely and transparent investigator payment processing. It's a key driver of both site and sponsor satisfaction. All of the top 10 and 25 of the top 30 pharma clients have now selected IQVIA's payment technology solutions for their trials. This includes a major award in the quarter with a top 10 sponsor to migrate their entire payment ecosystem across several legacy platforms to our technology. The scale of this technology migration is the largest of its kind in the industry and it encompasses 120 clinical studies across all phases with over 6,000 sites globally.\nBeyond these client highlights, our overall R&DS business continued to see strong momentum in the quarter, delivering over $2.5 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs. This included a record quarter of over $1.9 billion of services bookings, resulting in a first quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.32x excluding pass-throughs and 1.31x including pass-throughs. Over the last 12 months, our contracted net book-to-bill ratio was 1.33x, excluding pass-through, and 1.32x, including pass-through.\nOur contracted backlog in R&DS grew 9.1% year-over-year to a record $25.3 billion as of March 31, 2022. As a result, our next 12 months revenue from backlog increased to over $7 billion, growing 8% from a year ago. As you can see, there is a lot of strong positive momentum across the business regardless of the choppy macro environment.\nOn a final note, IQVIA was named the top CRO in overall reputation by clinical trial sites around the world in the 2021 CenterWatch Global Site benchmark survey. This is a big deal for us. This is a rigorous and independent survey that is highly respected in the industry. Over 60,000 investigators, trial coordinators, research nurses and other clinical professionals representing clinical trial sites from around the world were asked to rank and score 29 CROs across 35 performance-related attributes. We're proud to have been selected and named the top CRO in overall reputation, but specifically, we received high marks, especially high marks for our comprehensive decentralized trials, direct-to-patient recruitment and therapeutic clinical, regulatory and technology expertise.\nI will now turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance. Ron?\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone.\nLet's start by reviewing revenue. First quarter revenue of $3.568 billion grew 4.7% on a reported basis and 6.8% at constant currency. In the quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $375 million which was down about 35% versus the first quarter of 2021. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both this year and last, organic growth at constant currency was about 13%.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $1.439 billion, which was up 6.8% reported and 9.8% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in Tech & Analytics Solutions was just over 10%. R&D Solutions first quarter revenue of $1.934 billion was up 3.5% at actual FX rates and 4.7% at constant currency. Again, excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in R&DS was approximately 17%, which was consistent with our expectations. Contract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS first quarter revenue of $195 million grew 1% reported and 5.7% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was mid-single digits.\nOkay, let's move down the P&L now. Adjusted EBITDA was $812 million for the first quarter which represented growth of 9.1% on a reported basis. First quarter GAAP net income was $325 million. That was up 53.3% year-over-year and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.68, up 54.1% year-over-year. Adjusted net income was $477 million for the quarter, up 12.2% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13.3% to $2.47.\nNow as already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered yet another outstanding quarter of net new business. Our backlog at March 31 stood at a record $25.3 billion, an increase of 9.1% year-over-year. Next 12 months revenue from backlog increased 8% year-over-year to just over $7 billion. And I would note that both the backlog and next 12-month revenue numbers I just quoted were affected by FX rates at quarter end. That is to say they were lower than they otherwise would have been due to the strengthening of the dollar during the quarter.\nOkay. Moving now to the balance sheet. First quarter cash flow from operations was $508 million and CapEx was $177 million. That resulted in free cash flow of $331 million. And as a reminder, our free cash flow in the first quarter of each year is affected by the timing of annual bonus payments. At March 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.387 billion and gross debt was $12.637 billion, which resulted in net debt of $11.250 billion. Our net leverage ratio at March 31 was 3.64x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $403 million of our shares, which leaves us with slightly over $2.1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the current program.\nNow to the guidance. For the full year 2022, our expectation remains unchanged, but organic revenue growth excluding COVID-related work, will be low to mid-teens at constant currency. Since February, FX fluctuations have caused an incremental full year revenue headwind of over $200 million as of yesterday's rates. In addition, we currently estimate the revenue disruption from the Russia-Ukraine crisis to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Accordingly, we are updating our revenue guidance range to reflect these 2 factors.\nFor the full year, we now expect revenue to be between $14.450 billion and $14.750 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 6.9% to 9% at constant currency and 4.2% to 6.3% reported both compared to 2021. Now as a reminder, in the revenue guidance we provided in our Q4 call in February, we absorbed a $70 million FX headwind versus the initial guidance we provided at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November. Our projected revenue growth includes just over 150 basis points of contribution from M&A activity.\nNow despite the macro factors that affected our revenue guidance, we're reaffirming our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance ranges that we provided on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. This includes absorbing the earnings impact of loss revenue in Russia and Ukraine as well as the costs that remain there such as salaries and assistance provided to employees.\nAccordingly, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.330 billion and $3.405 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 12.7%. And we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25 or year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 13.5%. Now our full year 2022 guidance range is assumed that foreign currency rates as of yesterday, April 26, remain in effect for the balance of the year.\nMoving on to second quarter guidance. I'll remind you that the first half of last year represented our peak for COVID-related revenues. And as a result of that, the second quarter should be the toughest year-over-year compare in terms of revenues. So for the second quarter, revenue is expected to be between $3.470 billion and $3.520 billion, representing growth of 4.6% to 6% on constant currency basis and 0.9% to 2.4% on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the low to mid-teens consistent with what we had in Q1 actuals and our projected full year revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $790 million and $805 million, up 9.4% to 11.5% and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.35 and $2.42, growing 10.3% to 13.6%.\nSo to summarize, we've delivered very strong first quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what had been a very strong first quarter of 2021. Our base business maintained low teens organic growth at constant currency, excluding COVID-related work with double-digit growth on this basis in both TAS and R&DS. Our R&DS bookings -- excuse me, business recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings. Contracted backlog exceeded $25 billion for the first time, rising over 9% year-over-year with over $7 billion expected to convert to revenue over the next 12 months. We maintained our net leverage ratio of 3.6x 12-month adjusted EBITDA on a trailing basis. And finally, and most importantly, despite the turmoil around us, we remain very confident in our outlook and accordingly have maintained our full year 2022 profit guidance.\nSo with that, let me hand it back over to the operator for our Q&A session."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the IQVIA Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Childs, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Mr. Childs, you may begin your conference.\n\nNicholas Childs\n\nSVP, IR & Corporate Communications, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Bruehlman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Eric Sherbet, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Mike Fedock, Senior Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis; and Bryan Stengel, Associate Director, Investor Relations.\nToday, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call in the Events and Presentations section of our IQVIA Investor Relations website at ir.iqvia.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results will differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings.\nIn addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.\nI would now like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.\n\nAri Bousbib\n\nChairman, President & CEO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today for our fourth quarter results. It was great to see many of you in person at our Analyst and Investor Conference in November. And as you will recall, we shared our expectations that we would meet or exceed our 3-year Vision '22 targets. .\nWe also laid out our plans to make 2022 yet another inflection point in our growth trajectory and further accelerate the company's growth rate in the next 3 phase -- 3-year phase of our journey to 2025. The team highlighted the power of connected intelligence, which brings together IQVIA differentiated capabilities and drive our leadership position in the clinical and commercial markets. This underpins our new 20 x '25 strategy, which alludes to our plans to achieve at least $20 billion of revenue by 2025. We're excited about this next phase of growth for IQVIA, and we are busy refining our strategies and action plans, and you will hear more about it as the year progresses.\n2 years -- 2 weeks ago, IQVIA was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. Importantly, we earned a first place ranking within the health care, pharmacy and other services category for the first time. We ranked #1 in the categories of innovation, capital deployment, global competitiveness, quality of product and services, and long-term investment value. I want to thank our nearly 80,000 employees worldwide for this recognition is a tribute to their innovation and drive.\nTurning now to our results. We ended 2021 on a high note despite COVID-19's continued impact on many parts of the world. We delivered robust top and bottom line growth in the quarter, which, as you know, was against a much tougher year-over-year comparison than earlier in the year. These results reinforce our confidence that we will achieve our 2022 guidance. And of course, it sets us up well to meet our ambitious 20 x '25 targets.\nLet's review the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. The $62 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by stronger operational performance across all 3 segments as well as higher pass-throughs partially offset by FX headwinds. Compared to prior year and excluding COVID-related work, our core businesses, meaning R&DS and TAS, grew mid-teens at constant currency on an organic basis. Ron will provide a lot more detail in his remarks, including additional COVID-adjusted numbers for each segment.\nFourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 12.7%, reflecting our revenue growth as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. The $27 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was entirely due to our operational performance. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 grew 20.9%. That was $0.13 above the midpoint of our guidance, with the majority of the beat coming from the adjusted EBITDA drop-through.\nLet me now provide an update on the business. On the commercial side of the business, it was a strong year for new molecules and launches as the industry continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disruption. This year, 50 new molecules were approved by the FDA and 72 new commercial launches took place. IQVIA supported nearly 80% of launches by top 20 pharma and approximately 60% of all launches. This highlights our scale globally and across all customer segments in applying advanced technology and analytics capabilities to enhance launch planning, engagement and measurement.\nOverall, we've seen significant momentum and continued demand for our technology solutions. There are now over 3,000 clients who have adopted one or more of our technology platforms, including human data science cloud, orchestrated analytics, E360, Omnichannel Navigator, Engage and of course, Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE. In fact, the footprint of our OCE platform itself has continued to grow, with over 350 clients having adopted one or more modules on the platform since launch.\nEarly in 2021, we launched IQVIA Next Best Action, which is an AI-driven omni-channel customer engagement decision engine. Two top 20 pharma clients have successfully rolled out this intelligence engine to orchestrate customer engagements in over 30 countries and across more than 40 brands each. 2 other top 20 pharmas are currently in the implementation phase.\nAnother highlight in our TAS business has been the success of DMD Marketing Solutions, a leading provider of data and digital marketing solutions that help brands deliver personalized digital content to health care professionals. In the quarter, we entered into an enterprise agreement with a top 10 pharma clients to utilize DMD's advanced analytic capabilities to power omnichannel engagement across all 8 of their brand franchises. To date, 18 of the top 20 have adopted at least one of DMD solutions. We're very excited for the future growth of this business within IQVIA.\nReal-world evidence and other highlights of the year, IQVIA continues to play a leading role in the use of second rig data to answer key questions for life science customers. In the fourth quarter, we won 2 large post-authorization safety studies in an autoimmune area with a top 10 pharma. These studies use existing health care data to observe patients over a period of 10 years to better understand long-term effects of the treatment.\nWe were also recently awarded a disease registry project for an upcoming novel gene therapy. Here, we will recruit a broad population of patients with a specific disease to understand how they are currently managed in clinical practice. This information is vital to our life science sponsors to inform the design of subsequent clinical trials so they can target patient groups with the highest unmet need.\nMoving to clinical technology. We saw increased adoption of our Orchestrated Clinical Trials, OCT platform, which supports trial planning, site management, patient engagement, trial management and clinical data analytics. During the year, we added 90 new OCT clients, bringing the total to over 50 clients who have adopted one or more modules within our clinical technology suite since launch, including all of the top 10 and 18 of the top 1.\nWithin OCT's digital patient suite this year, we secured 3 preferred provider partnerships with top 30 pharmaceutical clients to provide our interactive response technology, IRT capabilities, to support site operations across their entire clinical trial portfolios. This technology facilitates patient randomization to ensure protocol adherence and streamline site supply chain management to reduce drug wastage and to drive significant cost reductions. Our solution was awarded a top-ranking by industry leaders in a recent ISR report for randomization and chart supply management capabilities.\nWe also saw increased demand for our industry-leading decentralized clinical trial offering. Approximately 1/3 of our active full-service clinical trials incorporate 1 or more of our DCT technology or services capabilities, and we expect this to continue to grow as the need for these capabilities in complex studies becomes more evident. For example, we are currently executing a full-service trial for treatment of multiple system atrophy, a severe degenerative neurological disorder affecting the body's involuntary functions. We are deploying our full suite of capabilities, including eCOA, eConsent and home research nurses on this study to significantly reduce the travel burden on these patients who have significant mobility challenges.\nFinally, our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum with over $2.4 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs, and it set a record for quarterly service bookings, achieving over $1.9 billion of service bookings for the first time ever. This resulted in a fourth quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.36 excluding pass-throughs and 1.24, including pass-throughs. For the calendar year, we delivered over $10 billion of total net new bookings for the first time ever, an increase of 14.6% compared to 2020. This led to an LTM contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.35 excluding pass-throughs and 1.34 including pass-throughs. Our contracted backlog in R&DS, including pass-throughs, grew 10.2% year-over-year to a record $24.8 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nAnd now I will turn it over to Ron for more details on our financial performance.\n\nRonald E. Bruehlman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IQVIA Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone.\nLet's start by reviewing revenue. Fourth quarter revenue of $3.636 billion grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency. You'll recall that last year's fourth quarter was a much tougher comparison than earlier quarters as we picked up incremental demand from mega vaccine studies in R&DS and government-related COVID work within TAS. Also, the core business began to rebound from the effects of COVID-19. In this year's fourth quarter, COVID-related revenues were approximately $325 million, down about 25% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both 2021 and 2020, organic growth at constant currency was mid-teens.\nTechnology & Analytics Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.496 billion, up 5% reported and 6.6% at constant currency. Year-over-year, TAS experienced just over 400 basis points of headwind due to a step-down in COVID-related work. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits.\nR&D Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $1.944 billion was up 15.4% at actual FX rates and 16.3% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency and R&DS was approximately 25%.\nContract Sales & Medical Solutions, or CSMS, fourth quarter revenue of $196 million grew 3.7% reported and 7.4% at constant currency. Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits.\nFor the full year, revenue was $13.874 billion, growing at 22.1% reported and 21.1% at constant currency. COVID-related revenues in 2021 were approximately $1.8 billion, with just under 80% of that attributable to R&DS, about 20% due to TAS and the remainder in CSMS. The incremental COVID-related revenues in 2021 versus 2020 accounted for approximately half of our growth in 2021.\nFull year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue was $5.534 billion, up 13.9% reported and 12.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits. Full year revenue in R&D Solutions was $7.556 billion, growing at 31.2% reported and 30.4% at constant currency. Excluding COVID-related work, R&DS organic growth at constant currency for both total revenue and services revenue was low double digits. Full year CSMS revenue was $784 million representing 5.8% growth on a reported basis and 5.7% at constant currency. And excluding COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in CSMS was low single digits.\nNow moving down to P&L. Adjusted EBITDA was $828 million for the fourth quarter, which was 12.7% growth on a reported basis. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $3.022 billion, up 26.8% year-over-year on a reported basis. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $318 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Full year GAAP net income was $966 million or $4.95 of earnings per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $496 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.7% year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20.9% to $2.55. For the full year, adjusted net income was $1.760 billion or $9.03 per share, up 41%.\nNow as already reviewed, R&D Solutions delivered another outstanding quarter of net new business. R&DS backlog now stands at a record $24.8 billion, an increase of 10.2% year-over-year. Full year 2021 net new bookings, including pass-throughs, rose over $10 billion for the first time, and that's 14.6% growth compared to 2020.\nOkay. Let's move to the balance sheet now. Cash flow was again quite strong in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $692 million and CapEx was $184 million which resulted in free cash flow of $508 million. This brought our free cash flow for the full year to a record $2.3 billion, up 70% versus the prior year. At December 31, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.366 billion and gross debt was $12.125 billion, resulting in net debt of $10.759 billion. Our net leverage ratio at December 31 was 3.56x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.\nNow it's worth highlighting that our improved free cash flow over the last 2 years allowed us to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital to internal investments, acquisitions and share repurchase, while at the same time, we were able to reduce our net leverage ratio from a high of 4.8x in Q2 2020, which you'll recall was the height of the pandemic to nearly 3.5x. And in doing this, we achieved our Vision '22 net leverage ratio target of 3.5x to 4x a full year early.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $174 million of our shares which resulted in full year share repurchase of $395 million, and we ended the year with 195 million fully diluted shares outstanding and $523 million of share repurchase authorization remaining under our existing program. Now last week, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization, which increases our remaining authorization to just over $2.5 billion.\nNow let's turn to the guidance. As you saw, we're reaffirming the full year 2022 revenue guidance that we issued at our analyst and investor conference in November. And in maintaining this guidance, we actually absorbed a $70 million revenue headwind from FX since we initially guided in November. Now additionally, we're raising our full year 2022 profit guidance versus what we provided you in November.\nSo to summarize the overall guidance for the full year, we expect revenue to be between $14.700 billion and $15 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7.1% to 9.2% at constant currency and 6% to 8.1% on a reported basis compared to 2021. Now we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.330 billion and $3.405 billion representing year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 12.7%. And we also now expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $9.95 and $10.25 and which represents year-over-year growth of 10.2% to 13.5%. Now our full year 2022 guidance assumes at December 31, 2021 foreign currency exchange rates remain in fact, for the balance of the year.\nNow compared to the prior year, I should mention FX is now a headwind of 110 basis points to our full year revenue growth and our projected revenue growth includes a little bit over 100 basis points of contribution from M&A activity. Now with our analyst and investor conference in November, we told you to anticipate that our COVID-related revenue will step down by approximately $1 billion in 2022, but will more than compensate for that headwind with strong growth in our base business. And let me give you some additional detail around this that I think will be helpful.\nExcluding COVID-related revenue, the FX headwind and the contribution of acquisitions, our total company revenue guidance implies organic growth at constant currency in the low to mid-teens. At the segment level, we anticipate full year Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue growth of between 5% and 7%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in TAS to be in the high single digits. Research & Development Solutions revenue growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%. Excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in R&DS to be in the upper teens. And finally, Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue was anticipated to be down about 2%, but excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency in CSMS to be in the low single digits.\nLet's move to the first quarter now. As you all know, the first quarter of last year marked a continued rebound in our base business after the 2020 pandemic-related decline. In addition, Q1 and Q2 of last year represented our peak COVID-related revenues. As a result of this, the first half of the year will have the most challenging year-over-year compares. For the first quarter, our revenue is expected to be between $3.515 billion and $3.575 billion, representing growth of 4.8% to 6.6% on a constant currency basis and 3.1% to 4.9% on a reported basis. Now excluding COVID-related work, we expect organic revenue growth at constant currency to be in the mid-teens. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $800 million and $815 million, up 7.5% to 9.5%. And finally, adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.40 and $2.46, growing 10.1% to 12.8%.\nSo to summarize, we delivered very strong fourth quarter results on both the top and bottom line against what was also a very strong fourth quarter of 2020. R&DS recorded its largest ever quarter of service bookings and for the first time, had over $10 billion of total net new bookings in a year. Our contracted backlog improved to a record of nearly $25 billion, up over 10% year-over-year. We delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow, bringing the full year to a record $2.3 billion. We closed 2021 with net leverage of 3.6x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.\nOur Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. And finally, we're reaffirming the full year of 2022 guidance that we provided in November for revenue, and we're raising our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS guidance.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions and answers."

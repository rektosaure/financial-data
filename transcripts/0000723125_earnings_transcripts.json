Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Micron delivered fiscal Q3 revenue, gross margin and EPS all above the high end of guidance ranges. Micron drove robust price increases and industry supply-demand conditions continue to improve. This improved pricing, combined with our strengthening product mix, resulted in increased profitability across all our end markets. In data center, rapidly growing AI demand enabled us to grow our revenue by over 50% on a sequential basis, and we grew share in high-margin AI-related product categories such as HBM, high-capacity DMs and data center SSDs.\nOur mix of data center revenue is on track to reach record levels in fiscal 2024 and to grow significantly from there in fiscal 2025. Robust AI-driven demand for data center products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes. Consequently, we expect continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones. As we look ahead to 2025, demand for AI PCs and AI smartphones and continued growth of AI in the data center creates a favorable setup that gives us confidence that we can deliver a substantial revenue record in fiscal 2025 with significantly improved profitability, underpinned by our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin products.\nMicron is ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and NAND. Over 80% of our DRAM bit production is now on leading edge 1 alpha and 1 beta nodes. Over 90% of our NAND bit production is on our 2 leading-edge NAND nodes. One gamma DRAM pilot production using extreme ultraviolet lithography is progressing well, and we are on track for volume production in calendar 2025. Our next-generation NAND node is on track with high-volume production planned for calendar 2025.\nWe experienced some operational disruptions after the recent Taiwan earthquake but were able to recover quickly thanks to diligent efforts from Micron Taiwan team members working together with our global operations teams. Despite impacts from the earthquake we now expect our fiscal 2024 DRAM front-end cost reductions, excluding HBM to be in the high single-digit percentage range. We expect our fiscal 2024 NAND front-end cost reductions to be in the low teens percentage range. These cost reductions are supported by our industry-leading 1 beta DRAM and 2 32-layer NAND nodes.\nDuring the quarter, Micron signed a nonbinding preliminary memorandum of terms or PMT with the U.S. government for $6.1 billion in grants under the CHIPS and Science Act. These brands support our planned leading-edge memory manufacturing expansions in Idaho and New York. Federal and State incentives, projected power cost advantages and R&D colocation synergies, will enable Micron to achieve cost competitive, leading-edge memory manufacturing in the United States when these projects reach efficient manufacturing scale.\nSAP construction in Idaho is underway, and we are working diligently to complete the regulatory and permitting processes in New York. This additional leading-edge greenfield capacity, along with continued technology transition investments in our Asia facilities is required to meet long-term demand in the second half of this decade and beyond. These investments support our objective to maintain our current bit share over time and to grow our memory bit supply in line with long-term industry bit demand. Micron retains flexibility under the PMT to manage construction and timing of supply growth in a manner that allows us to remain responsive to market conditions.\nNow turning to our end markets. We are in the early innings of a multiyear race to enable artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which will revolutionize all aspects of life. Enabling AGI will require training ever-increasing model sizes, with trillions of parameters and sophisticated servers for influencing. AI will also permeate to the edge via AI PCs and AI smartphones as well as smart automobiles and intelligent industrial systems. These trends will drive significant growth in the demand for DRAM and NAND, and we believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear growth opportunity driven by AI.\nMost data center customer inventories have normalized and demand from customers continues to strengthen. PC and smartphone customers have built additional inventories due to the rising price trajectory, the anticipated growth in AI PCs and smartphones as well as the expectation of tight supply as an increasing portion of DRAM and NAND output is dedicated to meeting growing data center demand. Due to expectations for continued leading-edge node tightness, we are seeing increased interest from many customers across market segments to secure 2025 long-term agreements ahead of their typical schedule.\nIn data center, industry server unit shipments are expected to grow in the mid- to high single digits in calendar 2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers and the return to modest growth for traditional servers. Micron is well positioned with our portfolio of HBM, D5, LP5, high-capacity DIMM, CXL and data center SSD products.\nRecently, our customers have announced their long-term AI server product road map with an annual cadence of new products with significantly improved capabilities for the next several years. Micron's technology and product leadership puts us in an excellent position to support this growth. Customers continue to provide feedback that our HBM3E solution have 30% lower power consumption compared to competitors' solutions.\nOur HBM shipment ramp began in fiscal Q3 and we generated over $100 million in HBM3E revenue in the quarter at margins accretive to DRAM and overall company margins. We expect to generate $700 million of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024 and multiple billions of dollars in revenue from HBM in fiscal 2025. We expect to achieve HBM market share commensurate with our overall DRAM market share sometime in calendar 2025.\nOur HBM is sold out for calendar 2024 and 2025, with pricing already contracted for the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply. We are making significant strides towards expanding our HBM customer base in calendar 2025, as we design in our industry-leading HBM technology with major HBM customers. We have sampled our 12 high HBM3E product and expect to ramp it into high-volume production in calendar 2025, an increase in mix throughout 2025.\nWe have a robust road map for HBM and are confident we will maintain our technology leadership with HBM4 and HBM4E. Our next generations of HBM will provide further performance and capacity enhancements while we continue to evolve our industry-leading low-power innovations. We achieved full validation on our 1 beta 32-gigabit monolithic die-based 128 gigabyte high-capacity server DIMM products and are on track to achieve several hundred million dollars of revenue from high-capacity DIMMs in the second half of fiscal 2024. Additionally, we continue to see strong interest in our industry-leading 1 beta LPDRAM in data center applications.\nData center SSD is in the midst of a strong demand recovery as customers have worked through their 2023 inventory. Hyperscale demand is improving driven primarily by AI training and inference infrastructure and supplemented by the start of a recovery of traditional compute and storage infrastructure demand. Micron is gaining share in data center SSDs as we reach new revenue and market share records in this important product category.\nDuring the quarter, we more than tripled bit shipments of our 232 layer-based 6500 30 terabyte SSDs, which offer best-in-class performance, reliability and endurance for AI data lake applications. We continued our leadership and innovation by becoming the first NAND vendor to supply 200-plus layer QLC for the enterprise storage market.\nIn PC, unit volumes remain on track to grow in the low single-digit range for calendar 2024. We are optimistic that the planned Windows 10 end of life in 2025, the launch of Windows 12 and the introduction of new generation of AI PCs will accelerate the PC replacement cycle starting in late calendar 2024. The PC replacement cycle should gather momentum through calendar 2025 as new AI applications are rolled out.\nDuring Computex in Taiwan, we saw several announcements of next-generation chipsets and AI PCs. These devices feature high-performance neural processing unit chipsets and we expect these devices will have 40% to 80% more DRAM content than today's average PC. Microsoft's minimum system requirement for Copilot Plus PCs such as the Surface Pro is 16 gigabyte of DRAM.\nWe expect next-generation AI PCs to make up a meaningful portion of total PC units in calendar 2025, and growing each year until most PCs ultimately support next-generation AI PC specs. AI PCs are also likely to require higher performance and higher average capacity SSDs than traditional PCs, aligning well with our leading technology portfolio on our 2 32-layer NAND with our Performance 3500 SSD and our industry-leading value QLC 2500 NVMe SSDs.\nTurning to mobile. Smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 remain on track to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. Leading smartphone OEMs recently announced new AI capabilities, and we are optimistic that delivering high-quality AI experiences can accelerate the smartphone refresh cycle. Smartphones have tremendous potential for personalized AI capabilities that offer greater security and responsiveness when executed on device.\nMicron's leading LP 5x is enabling the [indiscernible] 12 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte AI phone releases at all Android Tier 1 customers, representing a 50% to 100% increase over last year's flagship models. Micron's leading mobile solutions provide the critical performance, capacity and power efficiency needed to unlock AI capability. Our mobile DRAM and NAND solutions are now widely adopted an industry-leading flagship smartphones.\nIn calendar Q1, we received recognition for being #1 in quality by 5 of the world's leading smartphone OEMs. Qualifications are on track for our second duration, 1 beta LP5X products and we see broadening use of our 232 layer NAND, moving beyond flagship phones into high capacity, high and mid-tier phones.\nTurning to auto and industrial. The automotive sector continues to experience robust demand for memory and storage and Micron achieved a record quarter for automotive revenues. Car production volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels and broader adoption of intelligent digital cockpits and more advanced driver assistance capabilities are driving content growth. We anticipate further content growth as additional intelligence including Generative AI-based technologies is adopted in vehicles.\nMicron continues to be a leader in automotive with high-quality and industry-first product introductions. In the fiscal third quarter, we launched the world's first multiport Gen4 NVMe SSD in support of next-generation centralized compute architectures.\nIn Industrial and Retail consumer segments, which are a smaller part of our business, we are seeing some near-term demand uncertainty from our distribution partners and end customers. We remain confident in the long-term fundamentals and growth drivers of these businesses, especially with the increasing adoption of AI in a variety of applications.\nNow turning to our market outlook. We forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth for the industry to be in the mid-teens percentage range for both DRAM and NAND. Over the medium term, we expect industry bit demand growth CAGR of mid-teens in DRAM and high teens in NAND.\nTurning to supply. We expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and NAND. As discussed previously, the ramp of HVM production will constrain industry supply growth in non HBM products. Industry-wide, HBM3E consumes approximately 3x the wafer supply as D5 to produce a given number of bits in the same technology node. With increased performance and packaging complexity across the industry, we expect this trade ratio for HBM4 to be even higher than the trade ratio for HBM3E. We anticipate strong HBM demand due to AI combined with increasing silicon intensity of the HBM road map to contribute to tight supply conditions for DRAM across all end markets.\nAs the memory industry is still recovering from the challenging environment in 2023, this tight supply environment will help drive the considerable improvements in profitability and ROI, that are needed to enable the investments required to support future growth.\nMicron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 remains below our demand growth for both DRAM and NAND. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline and focus on improving profitability while maintaining our bit market share for DRAM and NAND. We continue to project we will end fiscal 2024 with low double-digit percentage less wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND than our peak levels in fiscal 2022. We intend to use our existing inventory to drive a portion of the bit growth supporting our revenue in fiscal 2025 to enable a more optimized use of our CapEx investments.\nMicron's fiscal 2024 CapEx plan will be approximately $8 billion and WFE spending will be down year-on-year in fiscal 2024. We expect to increase our capital spending materially next year with CapEx around mid-30s percentage range of revenue for fiscal 2025, which will support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility construction as well as technology transition investment to support demand growth.\nThe construction CapEx in the planned Idaho and New York greenfield fabs in fiscal 2025 will be half or more of the expected increase in total CapEx. In fact, the growth in both greenfield fab construction and HBM CapEx investments is projected to make up the overwhelming majority of the year-over-year CapEx increase. These fab construction investments are necessary to support supply growth for the latter half of this decade.\nThis Idaho fab will not contribute to meaningful bit supply until fiscal '27 and the New York construction CapEx is not expected to contribute to best supply growth until fiscal 2028 or later. The timing of future WFE spend in these fabs will be managed to align supply growth with expected demand growth.\nI will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.\n\nMark J. Murphy\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Delphi Automotive Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in fiscal Q3 with revenue, gross margin and EPS above the high end of the guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call. Improving market conditions and strong pricing cost execution drove the financial outperformance.\nTotal fiscal Q3 revenue was $6.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and up 82% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 69% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 13% sequentially, with bit shipments declining in the mid-single-digit percentage range and prices increasing by approximately 20%. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, representing 30% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 32% sequentially and with bit shipments increasing in the high single-digit percentage range and prices increasing by approximately 20%.\nNow turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking business unit revenue was $2.6 billion, up 18% sequentially. DRAM data center revenue more than doubled year-over-year. Revenue for the mobile business unit was $1.6 billion, down 1% sequentially as the planned decline in volume was partially offset by improved pricing. Embedded business unit revenue was $1.3 billion, up 16% sequentially driven by record revenue in automotive. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.4 billion, up 50% sequentially with growth across all end markets. We achieved record data center SSD revenue, which nearly doubled sequentially.\nThe consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was approximately 28%, up over 8 percentage points sequentially, driven primarily by higher pricing and helped by product mix and cost reductions. Excluding the effects of previously written down inventories on fiscal Q2 gross margin, the sequential improvement in fiscal Q3 would have been 15 percentage points. As a reminder, previously written down inventories had no impact on fiscal Q3 gross margin and will not affect our gross margin moving forward.\nOperating expenses in fiscal Q3 were $976 million, up $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Continued spend discipline and ongoing operational efficiencies helped deliver operating expenses at the low end of the guidance range. We generated operating income of $941 million in fiscal Q3, resulting in an operating margin of 14%, which was up 10 percentage points sequentially and up 53 percentage points from the year ago quarter.\nFiscal Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 million, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 43%, up 6 percentage points sequentially and up 30 percentage points or $2.4 billion from the year ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 taxes were $227 million, lower than expectations at the time of our guidance driven by onetime discrete items.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal Q3 was $0.62, compared to $0.42 in the prior quarter and a loss per share of $1.43 in the year ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.10, and driven by better revenue and profitability.\nTurning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were $2.5 billion in fiscal Q3, representing 36% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.1 billion during the quarter, and we generated free cash flow of $425 million. Our fiscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.5 billion or 155 days, a decline of 5 days from the prior quarter. Our leading-edge supply continues to be very tight for both DRAM and NAND.\nOn the balance sheet, we held $9.2 billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintain near $12 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. Considering our ample liquidity, return to free cash flow generation and strong outlook, during the quarter, we repaid $650 million of debt maturing in November 2025. We ended the quarter with $13.3 billion in total debt, low net leverage and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031.\nNow turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect DRAM bit shipments to be flattish and NAND shipments to be up slightly in fiscal Q4. We forecast shipment growth to strengthen modestly in the November quarter. We project continued gross margin expansion. Pricing trends remained positive, supported by favorable supply-demand conditions. Portfolio mix will be an important contributor over time as HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, data center SSDs and other high-value products increase as a portion of our mix.\nThe high mix for our leading-edge nodes support front-end cost reductions in line with our long-term cost reduction CAGRs, excluding HBM on DRAM. Keep in mind that higher mix of HBM will offset non-HBM DRAM cost reductions. But HBM will be at accretive gross margins.\nWe forecast operating expenses to increase sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter due to an increase in R&D program expenses and a nonrecurring Q3 asset sale gain contemplated in our Q3 guidance.\nWe estimate fiscal Q4 tax expense of approximately $320 million. For fiscal 2025, we estimate our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the mid-teens percent range. We project days of inventory outstanding to decline through fiscal 2025 and DIO to approach our target by the end of fiscal year 2025.\nWe forecast capital expenditures to increase sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter to approximately $3 billion. Despite this increase in CapEx we project continued positive free cash flow in fiscal Q4. We expect full year fiscal 2024 CapEx of around $8 billion.\nRecord revenue and significantly improved profitability in fiscal 2025 will help support average quarterly CapEx in fiscal 2025 to be meaningfully above the fiscal Q4 2024 level of $3 billion. We expect CapEx around mid-30s percentage range of revenue for fiscal 2025, which will support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility construction as well as technology transition investment to support demand growth.\nAs noted earlier, half or more of the expected CapEx increase in fiscal 2025 will be to support U.S. greenfield fab construction. As we have noted in the past, the CHIPS grants, ITC and state incentives offset a significant portion of U.S. fab CapEx investments. Receipt of some of these incentive reimbursements occur well after when we incur the spend, resulting in higher CapEx for a period while we ramp our greenfield U.S. investments. Micron will remain disciplined in our capital spending and we'll modulate our WFE investments to grow bit supply in line with industry demand.\nWith all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue to be $7.6 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 34.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $1.06 billion, plus or minus $15 million; we expect tax expenses of approximately $320 million; based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be $1.08 per share, plus or minus $0.08.\nIn closing, market conditions are improving with price increases driven by favorable supply-demand trends and tightness on the leading edge. Micron is executing well on leveraging our technology leadership to grow our mix of high-value solutions, especially in products that support AI applications.\nFinally, our leading-edge investments and productivity initiatives are delivering cost downs and operating leverage during this market recovery. We expect record revenue and significantly better profitability in fiscal 2025 and to support disciplined investment to maintain stable bit share and deliver free cash flow growth.\nI will now turn it back over to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Mark. I want to close by commending our team in Taiwan for their response to the significant earthquake in fiscal Q3. In many ways, that response exemplifies Micron, an agile prepared team that assesses and reacts quickly supported by a brilliant network of colleagues around the globe. That collaboration, planning, discipline and experience are precisely what ensures Micron is so well positioned today. I look forward to our teams accelerating Micron's memory and storage leadership as AI solutions present increasing opportunities to provide greater value from data centers to the edge. Thank you for joining us today.\nWe will now open for questions.",

Please go ahead Sir.\n\nThank you and welcome to Micron technologies fiscal second quarter 2024 financial conference call.\n\nOn the call with me today are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO and Mark Murphy our CFO.\n\nToday's call is being webcast from our Investor Relations site at investors got micron dot com, including audio and slides in.\n\nIn addition, the press release detailing our quarterly results has been posted on the website along with the prepared remarks for this call.\n\nToday's discussion of financial results as being presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website.\n\nWe encourage you to visit our web site at Micron Dot com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the company, including information on financial conferences that we may be attending.\n\nCan also follow us on X at Micron Tech.\n\nAs a reminder, the matters. We're discussing today include forward looking statements regarding market demand and supply market and pricing trends and drivers our technology product ramp plans and market position, our expected results and guidance and other matters.\n\nThese forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.\n\nWe refer you to the documents, we filed with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-Q and upcoming 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may affect our future results.\n\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable.\n\nWe cannot guarantee future results levels of activity performance or achievements.\n\nWe are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements to confirm these statements to actual results.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Sanjay.\n\nThank you good afternoon, everyone I'm pleased to report that Micron delivered fiscal Q2 revenue gross margin and EPS well above the high end of guidance Micron has returned to profitability and delivered positive operating margin a quarter ahead of expectations.\n\nI would like to thank all our micron global team members for their dedication and excellent execution that made this result possible.\n\nMicron drove robust price increases as the supply and demand balance tightens.\n\nThis improvement in market conditions was due to a confluence of factors, including strong AI server demand a healthier demand environment in most end markets and supply reductions across the industry.\n\nAI server demand is driving rapid growth in HBM, DDR, five and data center, Ssds, which is tightening leading edge supply availability for DRAM and NAND.\n\nThis is resulting in a positive ripple effect on pricing across all memory and storage end markets.\n\nWe expect DRAM and NAND pricing levels to increase further throughout calendar year, 2024, and expect to record revenue and much improved profitability now in fiscal year 2025.\n\nMicron is at the forefront of ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and NAND.\n\nReinforcing our leadership position over three quarters of our DRAM bits are now on leading edge, one alpha and one beta nodes and over 90% of our NAND bits are on 176 layer and 232 layer nodes.\n\nWe expect fiscal 2020 for front end cost reductions.\n\nExcluding the impact of HBM to track in line with our long term expectations of mid to high single digits in DRAM and low teens in NAND supported by the continued volume ramp of one beta DRAM and 232 layer NAND.\n\nWe continue to mature our production capability with extreme ultraviolet lithography and have achieved equivalent yield and quality on our one alpha as well as one beta nodes between and non flows.\n\nWe have begun one gamma DRAM pilot production using and are on track for volume production in calendar 2025.\n\nThe development of our next generation NAND node is on track with volume production plans for calendar 2025.\n\nWe effect to maintain our technology leadership in NAND.\n\nNow turning to our end market.\n\nInventories for memory and storage have improved significantly in the data center and we continue to expect normalization in the first half of calendar 2024.\n\nIn PC and smartphone there were some strategic purchases in calendar Q4 in anticipation of a return to unit growth.\n\nInventory remained near normal levels for auto industrial and other markets.\n\nWe are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society.\n\nThat is on to create artificial general intelligence on.\n\nAgi Mitchell require ever increasing module sizes with trillions of parameters.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum. There is considerable progress being made on improving AI models. So that they can run on edge devices.\n\nPcs and smartphones and create new and compelling capabilities.\n\nAs AI training workloads remain a driver of technology and innovation in finance growth is also rapidly accelerating.\n\nMemory and storage technologies are key enablers of Eni in both training and inference workloads and micron is well positioned to capitalize on these trends in both the data center and the edge.\n\nWe view micron as one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry.\n\nMultiyear growth opportunity driven by AI.\n\nIn data center total industry server unit shipments are expected to grow mid to high single digits in calendar 2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers, and a return to modest growth for traditional servers.\n\nMicron is well positioned with our portfolio of HBM D. Five LP five high capacity them, CSL and datacenter SSD products.\n\nDelivering improved memory bandwidth power consumption and overall performance is critical to enable cost efficient scaling of AI workloads insight modern GPU, our ASIC accelerated AI servers.\n\nOur customers are driving an aggressive roadmap on their GPU and ASIC based server platforms that require significantly higher content and higher performance memory and storage solutions.\n\nFor example earlier this week Nvidia announced its next generation Blackwell GPU architecture based AI systems.\n\nprovides a 33% increase in the HBM content, continuing a trend of steadily increasing HBM content our GPU.\n\nMicron's industry, leading high bandwidth memory E solution provides more than 20 times, the memory bandwidth compared to standard , Jim server module.\n\nWe are executing well on our HCM product ramp plans and have made significant progress in ramping our capacity yield and quality.\n\nWe commenced volume production and recognized our first revenue from in fiscal Q2, and now have began high volume shipments of our III product.\n\nCustomers continue to give strong feedback that our solution has a 30% lower power consumption compared to competitors' solutions.\n\nThis benefit is contributing to strong demand.\n\nOur product will be part of , H 200, tensor core Gpus, and we're making progress on additional background qualifications with multiple customers.\n\nWe are on track to generate several $100 million of revenue from HBM in fiscal 2024, and expect revenues to be accretive to our DRAM and overall gross margins starting in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nOur is sold out for calendar 2024, and the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated.\n\nWe continue to expect HBM bit share equivalents to our overall DRAM bit share sometime in calendar 2025.\n\nEarlier this month, we sampled our product, which provides 50% increased capacity of DRAM to 36 gigabyte.\n\nThis increase in capacity allows our customers to pack more memory per GPU, enabling more powerful AI training and inference solutions.\n\nWe expect well high E will start ramping in high volume production and increase in mix throughout 2025.\n\nWe have a robust roadmap and we are confident we will maintain our technology leadership with for the next generation of HBM, which will provide further performance and capacity enhancements compared to .\n\nWe are making strong progress on our suite of high capacity server dem products.\n\nDuring the quarter, we completed validation of the industry's first mono based 128 gigabyte server DRAM module.\n\nThis new product provides.\n\nThe industry's highest bandwidth D five capability with greater than 20% better energy efficiency and over 15% improved latency performance compared to competitors CD TSV based solutions.\n\nWe see strong customer pool, and expect a robust volume ramp for our 128 gigabyte product with several hundred million dollars of revenue in the second half of fiscal 2024.\n\nAdditionally, we also started sampling our $2 56, gigabyte and see our dem module, which further enhances performance and increases DRAM content per server.\n\nWe achieved record revenue share in the datacenter SSD market in calendar 2023.\n\nDuring the quarter, we grew our revenue by over 50% sequentially for our 232 layer base 60, 530, terabyte, Ssds, which offer best in class performance reliability and endurance for AI it'll leak application.\n\nIn PC after two years of double digit declines unit volumes are expected to grow modestly in the low single digit range for calendar 2024.\n\nWe are encouraged by the strong ecosystem momentum to develop next generation , which feature high performance neural processing unit chipsets, and 40% to 80% more DRAM content.\n\nToday's avid hbc's.\n\nWe expect next generation AI PC unit to grow and become a meaningful portion of total PC units in calendar 2025.\n\nAt CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, Micron launched the industry's first low power compression of dashed memory module on LP Cam two for PC applications.\n\nbrings a modular form factor with a maximum capacity point of 64 gigabyte for PC module and 128 gigabyte per server module, along with a number of benefits such as higher bandwidth lower power and smaller form factor.\n\nDuring the quarter, we launched our 232 layer based crucial T 705, Gen five consumer SSD, which won several editors choice awards and was recognized by a leading publisher as the fastest amdocs to SSD ever.\n\nWe increased our client SSD ULC bit shipments to record levels with TLC, representing nearly two thirds of our client SSD shipments.\n\nNormally establishing micron as a leader in client Ssds.\n\nTurning to mobile smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 remain on track to grow low to mid single digits.\n\nSmartphones offer tremendous potential for personalized AI capabilities that offer greater security and responsiveness when executed on device.\n\nEnabling these on device AI capabilities is driving increased memory and storage capacity needs and increasing demand for new value add solutions.\n\nFor example, we expect iphones to carry 50% to 100% greater DRAM content compared to non AI flagship phones today.\n\nMicron's, leading mobile solutions provide the critical high performance and power efficiency needed to unlock an unprecedented level of AI capability.\n\nIn DRAM, we are now sampling our second generation, one beta LP DRAM LP, five X product, which delivers the industry's highest performance at improved power or flagship smartphones.\n\nAnd in NAND, we announced our second generation of 232 layer NAND Uff's for all devices, featuring the industry's smallest package and breakthrough features that enable greater reliability and significantly higher.\n\nperformance for complex workloads.\n\nOur mobile DRAM and NAND solutions are now widely adopted and industry, leading flagship smartphones with two examples being Samsung Galaxy F. 'twenty four and the honor magic fix grow announced this year.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy F. 'twenty four can provide two way real time voice and text our translations during life phone calls.\n\nThe honor Magic fix drove features the magic L M. A $7 billion parameter large language model.\n\nCan intelligently understand our users' intent.\n\nOur language image I have movement, and gestures and proactively offer services to enhance and simplify the user experience.\n\nTurning to auto and industrial.\n\nThe automotive sector continues to experience robust demand for memory and storage as non memory semiconductor supply constraints have eased and as new vehicle platforms are launched.\n\nIn the past quarter, we experienced strong growth with partners, who are driving the most advanced capabilities within the automobiles increasingly intelligent and connected digital cockpits.\n\nIn addition.\n\nThe option of level, two plus Adas capabilities continues to gain momentum further expanding content per vehicle.\n\nThe industrial market fundamentals for memory are also healthy with improving distributor inventory book to bill and demand visibility improvements as well as pricing benefits from the tight supply for products, especially those built on leading edge nodes.\n\nNow turning to our market outlook.\n\nCalendar 2023, DRAM bit demand growth was in the low double digit percentage range.\n\nAnd NAND bit demand growth was in the low 20 percentage range.\n\nBoard, a few percentage points higher than previous expectations.\n\nWe forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth for the industry to be near the long term CAGR for DRAM and around mid teens for NAND.\n\nGiven the higher baseline of 2023 demand these expectations of 2024 bit growth have driven an increase in the absolute level of 2024 bit to demand in our module for DRAM and NAND versus our prior expectations.\n\nThe industry supply demand balance is tight for DRAM and NAND and our outlook for pricing has increased for calendar 2024.\n\nOver the medium term, we expect bit demand growth CAGR of mid teens in DRAM and long low twenties percentage range and net.\n\nTurning to supply the supply outlook remains roughly the same as last quarter.\n\nWe expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and NAND.\n\nMicron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 remains below our demand growth for both DRAM and NAND.\n\nAnd we expect to decrease our days of inventory in fiscal year 2024.\n\nMicron's fiscal 2020 for Capex plan remains unchanged at a range between $7 5 billion and $8.01 billion.\n\nWe continue to project, our spending will be down year on year in fiscal 2024.\n\nMicron's capital efficient approach to reuse equipment from older nodes to support conversions to leading edge nodes has resulted in a material structural reduction of our DRAM and NAND, we referred capacities.\n\nWe are now fully utilized on our high volume manufacturing nodes and are maximizing output against the structurally lower capacity.\n\nWe believe this approach to node migration and consequent reaffirm the capacity reduction is an industry wide phenomenon.\n\nWe project to end fiscal 2024, mid low double digit percentage less wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND.\n\nThen our peak levels in fiscal 2022.\n\nSignificant supply reductions across the industry have enabled the pricing recovery that is now underway.\n\nAlthough our financial performance has improved our current profitability levels are still well below our long term targets and significantly improved profitability as required to support R&D and capex investments needed for long term innovation and supply growth.\n\nMicron will continue to exercise supply and capex discipline and focus on restoring improved profitability, while maintaining our bid market share for DRAM and NAND.\n\nAs discussed previously the ramp of HBM production will constrain supply growth and non HBM products.\n\nIndustry wide CE consumes approximately three times the wafer supply as D. Five to produce a given number of bids in the same technology node.\n\nWith increased performance and packaging complexity across the industry. We expect the trade ratio of four four to be even higher than the trade ratio for III.\n\nWe anticipate strong HBM demand due to AI combined with increasing silicon intensity of the HBM roadmap to contribute to tight supply conditions for DRAM across all end markets.\n\nFinally, as we consider these demand and technology trends, we're carefully planning, our global Fab and assembly test capacity requirements to ensure the diversified and cost competitive manufacturing footprint.\n\nAnnounced projects in China, India, and Japan are proceeding as planned.\n\nOn potential U S expansion plans, we have assumed chip plans in our Capex plans for fiscal 2024.\n\nOur planned Idaho, and New York projects require micron to receive the combination of sufficient chips grants investment tax credits and local incentives to address the cost difference compared to overseas expansion.\n\nI will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.\n\nThanks, Sanjay and good afternoon, everyone.\n\nMicron delivered strong results in fiscal Q2 with revenue gross margin and EPS well above the high end of the guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call.\n\nMuch improved market conditions, along with the team's excellent execution on pricing products and operations.\n\nDrove the strong financial results.\n\nTotal fiscal Q2 revenue was $5 8 billion.\n\nUp 23% sequentially and up 58% year over year.\n\nFiscal Q2, DRAM revenue was approximately $4 $2 billion, representing 71% of total revenue.\n\nDRAM revenue increased 21% sequentially with pet shipments increasing by a low single digit percentage and prices increasing by high teen.\n\nFiscal Q2, NAND revenue was approximately $1 6 billion.\n\nRepresenting 27% of Micron's total revenue.\n\nNAND revenue increased 27% sequentially.\n\nWith shipments decreasing by a low single digit percentage and prices increasing by over 30%.\n\nYes.\n\nNow turning to revenue by business unit.\n\nCompute and networking business unit revenue was $2 2 billion up.\n\nUp 26% sequentially.\n\nData center revenue grew robustly.\n\nAnd cloud more than doubled sequentially.\n\nRevenue for the mobile business unit was $1 6 billion.\n\nUp 24% sequentially as an expected decline in volume was more than offset by improved pricing.\n\nEmbedded business unit revenue was $1 1 billion up.\n\nUp 7% sequentially on solid demand for leading edge products in the industrial market.\n\nYeah.\n\nRevenue for the storage business unit was $905 million.\n\nUp 39% sequentially with strong double digit growth across all end markets.\n\nData center SSD revenue more than doubled from a year ago, driven by share gains from micron's products.\n\nOur consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q2 was 20%.\n\nUp 19 percentage points sequentially driven by higher pricing.\n\nFiscal Q2 gross margins benefited from $382 million.\n\nAssociated with selling the remainder of previously written down inventory.\n\nIn our second fiscal quarter.\n\nUtilization charges were modest and related to our legacy manufacturing capacity.\n\nWe access we expect to sustain these lower levels of Underutilization charges moving forward.\n\nOperating expenses in fiscal Q2 or $959 million.\n\nDown $33 million quarter over quarter and in line with our guidance range.\n\nOpex was modestly above the midpoint of our guidance range.\n\nAs variable compensation expense was higher on an improved fiscal 2020 for outlook.\n\nWe generated operating income of $204 million in fiscal Q2.\n\nResulting in an operating margin of 4%.\n\nAnd turning positive a quarter earlier than originally forecasted.\n\nWe recognized a net benefit for income taxes in fiscal Q2 of $294 million.\n\nWe had previously guided that we would recognize tax expense of $45 million based on expected quarterly results for fiscal Q2.\n\nWith our improved fiscal 2020 for our outlook, we can now estimate more reliable annual effective tax rate.\n\nAnd have reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method.\n\nThe second fiscal quarter tax benefit.\n\nArises from applying this estimated annual effective tax rate.\n\nSo our year to date results.\n\nnon-GAAP diluted earnings per share in fiscal Q2 was 42 .\n\nCompared to a loss per share of 95.\n\nIn the prior quarter and a loss per share of $1 91.\n\nIn the year ago quarter.\n\nFiscal Q2, EPS benefited from the aforementioned favorable income tax effect of.\n\nOf approximately 34 per share.\n\nTurning to cash flows and capital spending.\n\nOur operating cash flows were approximately $1 2 billion in fiscal Q2, representing 21% of revenue.\n\nCapital expenditures were $1 $2 billion during the quarter and free cash flow was near breakeven.\n\nOur fiscal Q2, ending inventory was $8 $4 billion or 160 days.\n\nin line with the prior quarter.\n\nFinished goods were down in the quarter.\n\nOur leading edge supply both for DRAM and NAND is very tight.\n\nWe expect to reduce inventory levels and.\n\nAnd excluding strategic inventory stock.\n\nWithin a few weeks of our 120 days target by the end of fiscal 2024.\n\nWe project DIR improvements to continue into fiscal year 2025.\n\nOn the balance sheet, we held $9 7 billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintain $12 $2 billion of liquidity, when including our untapped credit facility.\n\nDuring fiscal Q2, we refinanced approximately $1 billion of existing debt.\n\nExtending our debt maturities and lowering our near term borrowing costs.\n\nWe ended the quarter with $13 7 billion in total debt.\n\nLow net leverage.\n\nAnd a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031.\n\nNow turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter.\n\nFiscal Q3 bit shipments are expected to be down modestly for DRAM and up somewhat for NAND.\n\nCompared to fiscal Q2 levels.\n\nWhile demand continues to improve supply is constrained.\n\nEspecially at the leading edge.\n\nWe expect to improve sequentially in fiscal Q3.\n\nNote that fiscal Q2 gross margins had the benefit from previously written down inventories.\n\nWhich have cleared completely in fiscal Q2.\n\nDespite this benefit in fiscal Q2, we expect solid sequential improvement in fiscal Q3 gross margins.\n\nDue to robust price increases across both DRAM and NAND.\n\nWe forecast operating expenses to increase by approximately $30 million in the fiscal third quarter driven by R&D expenses.\n\nFor the fiscal year, we now project opex to be approximately $4 billion.\n\nHaving delivered operating profit in fiscal Q2 ahead of prior expectations.\n\nForecast continued improvement in operating income through the remainder of the year.\n\nBased on an improved taxable income outlook.\n\nOur tax forecast for fiscal year 2024 has increased from our prior projection of over $300 million.\n\nApproximately $400 million.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the mid teens percentage range.\n\nWe plan fiscal Q3 capital expenditures to be higher than in the second quarter.\n\nFull year fiscal 2020 for Capex plan is unchanged at a range between $7 $5 billion and $8 billion.\n\nWe now expect to generate positive free cash flow in fiscal Q3 and Q4.\n\nWith all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows.\n\nWe expect revenue to be $6, 6 billion, plus or minus $200 million.\n\nGross margin to be in the range of 26, 5% plus.\n\nPlus or minus 150 basis points.\n\nAnd operating expenses to be approximately $990 million.\n\nOr minus $15 million.\n\nWe expect tax expenses of approximately $240 million.\n\nBased on a share count of approximately $1 1 billion shares we expect earnings per share of 45.\n\nPlus or minus seven.\n\nIn closing with a significantly improved supply demand balance in the industry, coupled with excellent execution.\n\nMicron is driving a strong inflection in pricing and a richer mix of high value solutions.\n\nWe remain disciplined with our investments in supply growth and focused on driving efficiency across the company.\n\nWe expect positive free cash flow for the second half of fiscal 2024 and project record revenue in fiscal 2025.\n\nI will now turn it back over to Sanjay.\n\nThank you Mark.\n\nOkay.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please remain on your line your program will resume momentarily. Once again. Please remain on your line. Your program will begin moment will resume momentarily.\n\nOnce again, ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your line your program.\n\nWe will resume momentarily once again please remain on your line your program will resume momentarily.\n\nOnce again, ladies and gentlemen, please remain on your lines.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you.\n\nMay proceed.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay.\n\nAre you able to hear me.\n\nOnce again, ladies and gentlemen, please standby your program will resume momentarily once again, please remain on the line.\n\nOkay.\n\nLadies.\n\nAnd gentlemen, your program will resume momentarily once again, please standby your program will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience. So please continue to hold.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce again, please remain on your line your program will resume momentarily.\n\nThank you for your patience and please continue to hold.\n\nOkay.\n\nHi can you hear us yes welcome.\n\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen, we will resume.\n\nYes, we are.\n\nApologize for the technical difficulty here, but operator, if you can go ahead and start the Q&A section. Please.\n\nCertainly one moment for our first question.\n\nAnd our first question comes from the line of tissue Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question. Please.\n\nHi can you guys hear me okay.\n\nYes, we can.\n\nOkay great. Thank.\n\nThank you for taking the question.\n\nSanjay on HBM, Hugh you mentioned that you continue to expect your market position in 'twenty fiber at some point in 'twenty five to be similar to be in line with your overall position in DRAM.\n\nGiven your your revenue outlook for for 24.\n\nThat seems to imply that I don't know could quadruple anger quintuple any of your business in HBM year to year.\n\nI guess part one am I thinking about the trajectory.\n\nCurrently and then part two.\n\nHow does what does that mean for your Capex over the next 12 18 months and more importantly, your wafer capacity United in fiscal year, 'twenty, four youre down low double digits.\n\nYour wafer capacity likely to be down again in fiscal 'twenty five thank you.\n\nSo H B M.\n\nHe first of all it's a great product as I mentioned, you know well received by our customers high performance and 30% lower power than any other product that's out there. So of course it has strong demand and as we have highlighted we are sold out for the calendar year 'twenty four.\n\nSupply and our calendar year 'twenty five supply is also mostly vast majority is on.\n\nallocated a V.\n\nA J we have just begun production shipments and these will continue to increase through the course of calendar year 'twenty four as well as continue to increase through calendar year 'twenty five.\n\nWe are continuing to work on increasing our capacity and making good progress with respect to capacity as well as overall leaned in of quality. So certainly.\n\nIn calendar year, 'twenty five versus calendar year 'twenty four given that we are just starting our production here now will certainly be a significant growth over our.\n\nCalendar year 'twenty for our numbers and you can look at it same way for fiscal 'twenty four versus 25. So it will be definitely a significant increase with us achieving our shares in HBM are in line with our industry share sometime in calendar 'twenty five I'm not in a position to.\n\nSpell it out exactly for you in terms of what is the volume increase but certainly H B M .\n\nOur strong product position.\n\nWill that be a strong driver of revenue growth fiscal year 'twenty for fiscal year 'twenty five all in fiscal year 'twenty four regarding the wafer capacity by end of this fiscal year, we have said low double digit.\n\nAs Jeff Sloan and reduction in capacity and of course, we will be managing this capacity in fiscal year 'twenty for keeping in mind our.\n\nFocus on.\n\nSupply demand discipline, I'm, staying extremely disciplined risk with respect to supply growth staying extremely disciplined with respect to our HBM shared as well.\n\nAnd managing our technology transitions.\n\nAs we go through the year and onward.\n\nCapex and 25.\n\nThen in fiscal 'twenty, five we'll be higher than fiscal 2004, will be higher as well and of course .\n\nSection Capex related to the Greenfield that is required for the second half of the.\n\nThe decade will contribute to some of the Capex increase in fiscal 'twenty five but some of those details will provide you as we get closer to fiscal year 'twenty five.\n\nSo most important thing is that we will manage our wafer capacity technology transitions to really maintain.\n\nOur bit share that as part of our strategy to have stable mid share even with increasing penetration of HBM.\n\nAnd again, just keep in mind that our overall framework of our capex being 35% of our revenue across the cycles still applies.\n\nThank you for all the details.\n\nThank you one moment for our next question.\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question. Please.\n\nYes. Thank you very much for taking the question I guess two real quick ones.\n\nOne I just want to understand or maybe I appreciate the context of the accretive nature of the HBO three iron owner in the prepared remarks, I think or that are in the slide deck. It notes that youll be accretive gross margin from HBM in the in the current quarter and then I know you talk a little bit about P season.\n\nAnd smartphones I'm curious of what Youre seeing in terms of traditional server demand and whether or not your forecast assumes any improvement of shipments in that end market. Thank you.\n\nSo with respect to the accretive nature of H B M.\n\ncarries a higher cost, but it also carries a significantly higher pricing because it brings such great value in the application in terms of its performance and power and we are executing well our yield ramp is going well as well according to plan.\n\nAnd therefore, we are pleased that in this quarter than we had begun production shipments vivo be having it accretive to our gross margins in the quarter and of course. This momentum will continue to build in the quarters ahead and regarding the second part of your question on traditional server demand.\n\nSo yes, we do see that in calendar 'twenty five.\n\nTraditional server demand will grow modestly.\n\nAnd of course, it's coming after.\n\nThe significant decline in server unit sales in calendar 'twenty three.\n\nWe are very pleased to see the increasing momentum of content growth in the traditional server demand, but also AI server units are going up.\n\nAnd we have said overall server units.\n\nGrowing up in.\n\nMid to high single digits range with AI server, driving a higher growth percentage year over year and traditional servers being modest and.\n\nAnd I May have said 25 here I just wanted to clarify that im talking more 2000 2040 here. So when I'm talking about modest several unit growth, if they're referring to 2024 versus 2023.\n\nAnd if you had actually seeing strong demand for both our DRAM products and NAND products in server and actually we are shifting some of our portfolio toward these higher mix.\n\nOur solutions are HBM being one of them high density dams being another one that's in strong demand for satellite applications.\n\nAnd then data center Ssds all of this is we are seeing healthy demand drivers and just remember we had said that for memory and storage.\n\nCustomer inventories.\n\nData center market will be largely normalized in first half of 'twenty four and we are seeing the market play out just as we had predicted several quarters ago.\n\nThank you.\n\nSure.\n\nThank you one moment for our next question.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of C. J Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question. Please.\n\nYes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question I guess Sanjay would love to hear your thoughts around.\n\nWafer movement.\n\nFree to HBM, and what impact Thats, having.\n\nOn the supply demand outlook for DDR by then sort of any any context around customer engagement and longer term.\n\nAnd then more on the gross margin side.\n\nTalking about the inventory previously written down now behind US can you walk through the moving parts.\n\nThat should get Gabe.\n\nWe're seeing gross margins throughout the remainder of calendar 'twenty four thanks, so much.\n\nSo on your question regarding the first shift to H B M as.\n\nAs we have highlighted that H b M.\n\nAdrian three three.\n\nneeds three times more wafers than nearly three times more wafers than DDR five in the same technology node of the same capacity to produce the same beds. So this is of course high.\n\nReally silicon intensive technology and this factor of three of the trade ratio between HBM and five is really common across the industry.\n\nSo what and H B M demand is increasing rapidly youll see all the recent announcements that are only showing you that even greater attach rate of H B M to the latest GPU solutions that were just announced earlier this week.\n\n192 gigabyte.\n\nAnd the Blackwell platforms versus the.\n\n144, gigabyte and of course this is a phenomenon thats occurring across the board.\n\nEven today I think broadcom talked about.\n\nHBM content is going to further increase so HBM is enough high demand growth phase and this demand growth will continue in terms of bids in terms of revenue over the course of foreseeable future and this is putting tremendous pressure on the non HCM supply.\n\nThe trade ratio of three to one infusing demand in HBM, increasing growth and increased profitability of HBM is putting a non HCM part of the memory and tight supply. This is why we say that leading edge nodes are in very tight supply and.\n\nAs a result, we would fully expect that as well as other DDR products will improve in their profitability.\n\nPicture as well given their very much.\n\nTight supply there and of course HBM being again.\n\nOur strong positioned.\n\nAnd when you look at the FDA as we have talked to you about our supply already being locked up.\n\nFor 2014 25, and this then increases our confidence in our defined as well as L. P. Five LP evolutions with our customers.\n\nAnd good afternoon C. J, it's mark on on the gross margin side as you mentioned it's been a.\n\nTough year, plus year, and a half on a lot of timing differences difficult.\n\nGage cost downs and gross margin progression monitor utilization of facts, Florida transitions structural capacity reduction and so forth or kantar.\n\nContributing to weaker cost downs.\n\nAnd as you mentioned the lower the.\n\nThe rent down inventories.\n\nFinally cleared.\n\nIn the second quarter.\n\nIt was a bit of a headwind actually in the sense that it was less of a benefit.\n\nThen the first quarter.\n\nBut still nonetheless, it was it was a favorable benefit that we will not get in the third quarter.\n\nAnd then the period costs.\n\nAlso reduced.\n\nFrom first to second quarter. So we're now under $50 million on period costs related Underutilization as I mentioned in my comments that some.\n\nThats legacy related capacity now only in and that would continue going forward. So now we see more normal conditions.\n\nOn cost downs and related margin effects recede node transitions occurring those are positive.\n\nThe under utilization of facts or are fading away as we mentioned.\n\nWe're getting volume leverage and the associated absorption in that just the business being able to focus on efficiencies so as.\n\nAs we mentioned the average we've mentioned before we're now on the front end would expect mid to high single digit cost downs.\n\nAs as as normal.\n\nAs you look forward in.\n\nAnd Sanjay alluded to this you will begin to see.\n\nCosts related to H B M a.\n\nWeigh on our costs down performance now that's a good trade of course, because the the.\n\nThe mix is favorable the prices higher on those products. So it's an accretive margin trade, but that will impact the cost downs.\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nThank you one moment for our next question.\n\nAnd our next question.\n\nIt comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question. Please.\n\nThanks, a lot on Sunday I had a question just around the tenor of the discussions that youre, having with your customers.\n\nI mean, the industry is bigger this year in terms of bits.\n\nSounds like mostly due to a higher baseline coming off last year.\n\nBut it sounds like supply hasn't really increased to match that higher bids. This year. So the balance has gotten even tighter over the past three months so.\n\nHow has that changed the dynamics of your discussions with your customers I know you had a $600 million prepay last quarter did you get any prepays. This quarter are you talking about new sort of contract structures with customers, where they may be fund some of your Capex can you kind of talk about all that thanks.\n\nSo.\n\nJust keep in mind that in.\n\nFiscal year 'twenty four.\n\n24 versus 23.\n\nThe shipments will increase substantially.\n\nAnd as you noted.\n\nThe year over year increase in shipments will be substantial.\n\nAnd as you noted the supply is very tight supply is tight due to the factors that we have discussed before due to the downturn that the industry experienced last year Capex cuts were made utilization.\n\nKurzweil made structural shift.\n\nFrom traditional older nodes to newer nodes of equipment was made in order to support the leading edge nodes and that resulted in a structural reduction in wafer capacity in the industry as well and then there is the HBM factor that trade ratio three two.\n\nOne that I've discussed today all of this has contributed to a very tight supply situation and as I noted earlier in my remarks, non HBM supply is tight so some of our discussions with customers, particularly with respect to each be M. When we talk about that HCM is sold out those type of contracts.\n\nHave both pricing as well as.\n\nVolumes as well as other stricter terms baked in as part of our LTE as.\n\nAnd 2024 unit volume as well as pricing is all locked up 2025 as I mentioned the volumes are.\n\nLargely allocated a vast majority of our prediction supply is allocated.\n\nAnd some of the pricing is already firmed up keep in mind. This has never happened before right that you are talking about 2025, and we are sitting in CQ, one and we already have.\n\nSo much discussion around supply and pricing for 2025 getting logged up yet as we speak.\n\nAnd of course. This is then as I said earlier impacting our.\n\nIn a positive way our discussions with non HCM part of the market bed other customers and so I mean, this overall tight supply environment bodes well for all of the ability to manage the pricing increases as.\n\nAs well as keep an eye on demand supply balance and demand extremely disciplined.\n\nIn driving the growth of our business and revenue and profits while continue to execute our strategy of maintaining stable bridge here.\n\nSo leading edge is very tight and we are continuing to work on maximizing our outboard, which means leading edges of running at full utilization.\n\nAt this point.\n\nOkay.\n\nGreat. Thanks, but I guess that means that there were no prepays this quarter correct.\n\nWell, we have not commented on that we have not provided any color on that.\n\nOkay. Okay. Thank you Sandra.\n\nThank you one moment for our next question.\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question. Please.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nThe 128 gig that you talked about getting qualified it seems like that's a pretty important market in AI and you guys are approaching Monolithically, where I know your competitor has used the stack approach can you talk about the reception to that and you spoke of several hundred million dollars, how big do you think that opportunity could be.\n\nAnd as I said I mean in my prepared remarks that this Florida has very strong customer pool there.\n\nThis really offers a significantly improved latency as well as energy efficiency and this is simply due to the architecture that we chose to pursue a fully focusing on what is ultimately important to our customers.\n\nMono Die architecture, just gives you versus a stacked architecture gives you the benefit of.\n\nMore simplified interconnect, which results in pollen efficiency as well as greater performance advantage. So yes, I mean, we are seeing strong reception to this product.\n\nAnd this will we have said that this will have a meaningful revenue this fiscal quarter for us and several hundred million dollars of revenue in our fiscal 2024, so clearly on a strong growth rate and you know our goal again would be to continue to manage the mess.\n\nof our business across our portfolio in a prudent fashion and so.\n\nSo that we continue to shift the mix of other products to word more profitable parts of the business, particularly like data centers.\n\nSolutions, including these highest capacity dams that we just discussed as H B M data Center now.\n\nSSD. So all of this really just shows you that how we are continuing to deliver successfully on strengthening our portfolio product portfolio and targeted targeting at.\n\nWe're increasing the mix of our business towards more profitable parts of the market.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nThank you one moment for our next question.\n\nAnd our next question.\n\nComes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question. Please.\n\nHi, great. Thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the.\n\nResults.\n\nI guess.\n\nIs it sort of a extrapolation question, but with H B M, where 20% of Micron's DRAM revenue and you have said out again at some point next year do you think on a bit basis. It could be equivalent to your market share that H b M, where 20% of micron's DRAM revenue as opposed to a much lower percentage today could you maybe help quantify how accretive to .\n\nGross margins just that richer mix would represent.\n\nBrian It's mark.\n\n.\n\nBreak it out specifically, but maybe just to give you a sense of.\n\nThe trajectory of gross margins.\n\nYes, the increase from first quarter of a percent to 20% in the second quarter was dominantly.\n\n.\n\nAnd.\n\nObviously, a lot of other things going on but the dominant feature of that increase was.\n\nWas price.\n\nLikewise in the.\n\n20% second quarter.\n\nActuals to the $26 five.\n\nGuy.\n\nPrice remains the largest contributor.\n\nAnd offsetting part of that is of course, what CJ mentioned on there.\n\nThe benefit of those lower cost inventories fade away so.\n\nBut price is still the largest factor bowel begins to come in.\n\nOr both.\n\nThe resumption of cost Downs, and then we're starting to see some favorable mix effects for the products that Sanjay talked about including HBM and then as we move into the fourth quarter, where we would expect our margin increase.\n\nComparable to the to the levels that we saw.\n\nSecond the third quarter.\n\nThat becomes more balanced between price effects and product mix effects and cost downs and.\n\nMost notably H B M .\n\nbegins to become more material in that would that would then proceed into 'twenty five as we look in 'twenty five we see continued.\n\nPricing strength in 25, we see favorable product mixes product mix in 'twenty five and then our cost downs, excluding the H band attacks, we expected to have good cost out.\n\nAll contributing to our margin expansion.\n\nOkay. Thank you very helpful.\n\nThank you one moment for our next question.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd for our last question for today comes from the line of Chris Daily from Citi. Your question. Please.\n\nHey, Thanks, I guess just another.\n\nMulti part question on margins like everybody else.\n\nSo you mentioned that Theres still some under utilization charges related to legacy manufacturing capacity.\n\nWhen do those go away and then as a follow up to all these HBM.\n\nMargin questions can you just talk about the gross margin arc of your HBM products as more competition and capacity comes onto the market like when would the gross margins peak and then start to decline as .\n\nSamsung starts to increase capacity or capacity goes up all that stuff.\n\nI'll deal with the first question.\n\nOn the Underutilization charges, Chris they went from.\n\nWell I think it was 165 in the first quarter down to under $50 million in the second quarter.\n\nWe believe they will stay at low levels, well below 50 for the foreseeable future. So we will no longer comment on those.\n\nAnd again as I mentioned in my comments, there related to the legacy capacity.\n\nAnd regarding your question on gross margin projections for H B M. So we're not going to do that here, we are totally focused on.\n\nIncreasing our production capability and bringing in 2025 bps shares or visa upon H P. M to be in line with our DRAM share and of course this will bring about greater profitability. Unfortunately, but we are really not.\n\npricing of H B M here in the future, but clearly HBM brings tremendous value and the applications. You are seeing these new platform that are hungry for more H B M and H B M has been in shortage and we have talked about our 'twenty four and 'twenty five supply being scores spoken.\n\nFour so all of that I think bodes well for .\n\nHigh revenue growth and highly profitable HBM business photos and of course, we will stay extremely focused on maintaining disciplined maintaining our capex discipline and maintaining our shared target discipline for the HBM and .\n\nReally staying very disciplined on.\n\nOverall supply growth being in line with our DRAM share for the whole DRAM part of our business. So I think these will be key as we continue to look ahead at our execution and driving it opportunities forward.\n\nGot it thanks guys.\n\nThank you. This does conclude the question and answer session as well as today's program. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation you may now disconnect. Good day.",

I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Sameer. Good afternoon, everyone. In fiscal Q4, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin above the midpoint of our guidance with EPS above the high end of the range. These results reflect our strong execution, and we are well positioned to drive significant improvements in our financial performance. We believe pricing has now bottomed. Ongoing demand growth, customer inventory normalization and industry-wide supply reductions have set the stage for increased revenue along with improved pricing and profitability throughout fiscal 2024.\nWe continue to expect record industry TAM in calendar 2025, with more normalized levels of profitability. Fiscal 2023 was a challenging year for the memory and storage industry as the revenue TAM reached a multiyear low, resulting in a significant impact to financial performance. Despite this difficult backdrop, the Micron team stayed focused on our strategy, executed well and accomplished several important milestones.\nWe achieved record annual automotive revenue, record NAND QLC bit shipments for the full fiscal year and reached record levels in calendar Q2 for revenue share in data center and client SSDs. We were the first in our industry to introduce 1-beta, DDR5 and LP5X DRAM products and the first to ship HBM3E samples with industry-leading performance and power efficiency. We were also the first to introduce 232layer NAND SSD products in data center, client and consumer markets. These accomplishments were underpinned by our leadership technology and continued strong progress in manufacturing execution.\nWe achieved world-class mature yields in record time on our industry-leading 1 beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND technologies. In addition, Micron took several prudent and timely actions to reduce our CapEx and supply in order to address the market imbalances through the course of fiscal 2023. Our industry-leading technology road map continues to progress well.\nAs we have mentioned before, the vast majority of our bits are on leading-edge nodes, 1-alpha and 1-beta in DRAM and 176-layer and 232-layer in NAND. We continue to make good progress on 1-gamma DRAM development using EUV and are on track for production in calendar 2025. Development of our next-generation NAND node is also well on track.\nNow turning to our end markets. Customers continue to reduce their excess inventory for memory and storage in fiscal Q4. Most customer inventories for memory and storage in the PC and smartphone markets are now at normal levels, consistent with our prior forecast. Inventory levels are normal across most customers in the automotive market as well. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize in early calendar 2024. Consequently, we see demand continuing to strengthen, which has led to an inflection in pricing. Some customers have made strategic purchases in DRAM and NAND to take advantage of unsustainably low pricing as the market begins its recovery.\nIn data center, traditional server demand remains lackluster while demand for AI servers has been strong. Data center infrastructure operators have shifted budgets from traditional servers to higher-priced AI servers. Total server unit shipments are expected to decline in calendar 2023, the first year-over-year decline since 2016. We expect total server unit growth will resume in calendar 2024 to help fulfill ever-increasing workload demand. We also expect content growth in both AI and traditional servers. Compared to traditional servers, AI training servers contain significantly higher DRAM and NAND content with greater technology complexity, robust product value and higher profitability. We believe our data center revenue has bottomed, and we expect growth in fiscal Q1 and increasing momentum through fiscal year's '24 and '25 in our data center business.\nMicron has a strengthening portfolio of solutions optimized for bandwidth, capacity and power. These include HBM3E, DDR5 and associated high-capacity modules, LPDRAM and data center SSDs. This portfolio of industry-leading products positions us well to capture the opportunities presented by data-centric computing architectures and AI. The introduction of our HPM3E product offering has been met with strong customer interest and enthusiasm. Our HBM3E provides superior bandwidth, power and capacity for generative AI workloads. We developed this industry-leading design using our 1-beta technology, advanced TSV and other innovations that enable a differentiated packaging solution. We have been working closely with our customers throughout the development process and are becoming a closely integrated partner in their AI road map.\nMicron HBM3E is currently in qualification for NVIDIA compute products, which will drive HBM3E-powered AI solutions. We expect to begin the production ramp of HBM3E in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5. We expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 in early calendar 2024, ahead of the industry. We expanded our high-capacity D5 DRAM module portfolio with a monolithic die-based 128-gigabyte module and have started shipping samples to customers to help support their AI application needs. We expect revenue from this product in Q2 of calendar 2024. Last month, we announced the introduction of 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte CXL 2.0 memory expansion modules.\nBy leveraging a unique dual channel memory architecture, we are able to deliver higher module capacity and increased bandwidth. We have shipped samples to several customers and key partners. In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio utilizes 176-layer or 232-layer NAND in production, a testament to our product and technology leadership. We are well positioned to serve the growing demand for fast storage as data-intensive AI applications proliferate. We saw strong demand for our data center NVMe SSDs across our AI focused, industry-leading 30-terabyte product as well as our mainstream products.\nMicron ended the second calendar quarter with a record high revenue share in data center SSDs based on independent industry assessments. We expect to build on this momentum in fiscal 2024. In PCs, we continue to forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024. AI-enabled PCs will drive content growth and an improved refresh cycle over the next 2 years.\nIn fiscal Q4, we saw a strong sequential bit shipment growth at PC OEMs, driven by demand for LPDRAM in thin client notebooks. We expect to begin revenue shipments of our industry-leading 1-beta based client D5 in fiscal Q1 to PC OEMs. According to third-party analysts, in calendar Q2, we reached record revenue share in client SSDs for PC OEMs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our 232-layer NVMe client SSD is now qualified at large OEMs and shipping in volume production. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the second consecutive quarter with growth in both client and consumer markets. We continue to expand our footprint in the high-end consumer SSD space, with the launch of 3 new products that extends our reach into professional content creators and enthusiast PC gamers. In mobile, we expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down by mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024. Elasticity, along with a mix shift towards premium phones with greater capacity is contributing to memory content growth. About 1/3 of smartphones sold today have at least 8 gigabytes of DRAM and 256 gigabytes of NAND, up more than 7 percentage points versus smartphone units a year ago. Similar to our view on PCs, AI-enabled mobile phones could drive content growth and a stronger refresh cycle over time.\nLonger term, we see generative AI applications executing on handsets. These applications will continue to drive new requirements for higher capacity, lower power and increased performance in memory and storage. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets which contribute to more stable revenue and profitability.\nFiscal 2023 marked another record revenue year for our automotive business. Micron continues to lead in automotive market share in quality. Long term, we expect memory and storage content per vehicle to increase in both ADAS and in-cabin applications. In addition, fast-growing EVs typically contain higher memory and storage content. Our automotive design win trajectory remains strong. The industrial market showed signs of recovery in fiscal Q4. Inventory levels for memory and storage are stabilizing at distribution partners and as the majority of our customers. We expect the volume recovery that we observed in the second half of fiscal 2023 to continue into 2024. We see strong growth prospects in this market over time as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement IoT, AI and machine learning solutions\nAs previously discussed, the CAC or cybersecurity Administration of China decision earlier this year has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking markets in China. We remain committed to serving our customers in China for those areas of their business, not impacted by the CAC decision. While there is near-term impact to our demand due to these challenges in China, we remain focused on maintaining Micron's global market share. Our team's grit and Micron's deep relationships with our customers, underpinned by our technology leadership, increasing product momentum, excellent product quality and extensive manufacturing and supply chain capabilities position us well towards these goals. Now turning to our market outlook, starting with demand.\nWe expect calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. In NAND, our expectations for demand growth this calendar year have increased from high single digits to high teens percentage. These are below the expected long-term bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and low 20s percentage range in NAND. While calendar 2023 DRAM demand has been in line with expectations, NAND growth expectations have increased due to stronger-than-expected demand in certain parts of the consumer market and the trend of greater elasticity in per unit content.\nWhile macroeconomic factors remain a risk, we expect robust year-over-year bit demand growth in calendar 2024 for both DRAM and NAND driven by improving end market demand, normalized customer inventory levels, content growth across products and ongoing growth in AI. Calendar 2024 bit demand growth is expected to exceed the long-term CAGR for DRAM and to be near the long-term CAGR for NAND.\nTurning to supply. Significant supply and CapEx reductions across the industry have helped to stabilize the market and are enabling the recovery that is now underway. We see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth in calendar 2023 to be negative for the industry. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. In calendar 2024, we expect industry DRAM and NAND supply growth to be below industry demand growth and meaningfully so for DRAM.\nWe believe calendar 2024 is positioned to be a year of recovery in the memory and storage industry. A sustained period of supply growth less than demand growth will strengthen the pace of recovery. HBM production will be a headwind to industry bit supply growth. Across the industry, the HBM3E die is roughly twice the size of equivalent capacity D5. The HBM product includes a logic interface die and has a substantially more complex packaging stack that impacts yields. As a result, HBM3 and 3E demand will absorb an outsized portion of industry wafer supply. The ramp of HBM3 and 3E production will reduce overall DRAM bit supply growth industry-wide, with particular supply impact on non-HBM products as more capacity is diverted to addressing HBM opportunities.\nMicron is experiencing a similar impact of our planned HBM3E ramp on our bit supply capability. Micron's bit supply growth in fiscal 2024 is planned to be well below demand growth for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect to decrease our days of inventory in fiscal 2024. We continue to execute to our strategy of maintaining global bit shipment market share for DRAM and NAND while sustaining tight supply and CapEx management discipline. Micron's fiscal 2024 CapEx is projected to be up slightly compared to fiscal 2023 levels.\nWFE CapEx will be down again year-over-year in fiscal 2024. We remain focused on carefully managing overall supply growth. In last quarter's earnings call, we communicated that total wafer start reductions in both DRAM and NAND are approaching 30% versus peak 2022 levels. Amid an intense focus on capital efficiency over the last few quarters, we have redeployed a portion of the underutilized equipment to support production ramp of leading-edge nodes in both DRAM and NAND.\nGiven the higher process step count of these leading edge nodes, transitioning this equipment results in a significant and structural reduction to our overall wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND. Due to the structural reduction in capacity, our DRAM and NAND wafer starts will remain significantly below 2022 levels for the foreseeable future. Our industry supply projections assume a similar structural reduction in vehicle capacity industry-wide. Lead times to increase this wafer capacity will be long and will depend on improving demand, pricing and financial performance.\nWe expect underutilization to continue in our legacy nodes well into calendar 2024. We see our demand at leading-edge nodes exceeding our supply in fiscal and calendar 2024, particularly in the second half of the year. Construction CapEx will be elevated to support our plans to build leading-edge memory fabs in Idaho and New York, for which we filed CHIPS applications in August. As we have highlighted before, the requested level of CHIPS grants for our Idaho and New York projects are essential to the viability and global competitiveness of each of these projects. Our CapEx plans assume that a certain level of CHIPS grant funds will be made available to us in fiscal year 2024.\nAssembly and Test CapEx is projected to double year-over-year in fiscal 2024, predominantly driven by investments to support HBM3E production. Our planned fiscal 2024 CapEx investments in HBM capacity have substantially increased versus our prior plan in response to strong customer demand for our industry-leading product. Over the course of calendar 2024, we see accelerating AI-driven opportunities for memory and storage across multiple market segments from the data center to the edge. We are encouraged by the improving industry demand and supply fundamentals. We believe that the CapEx constraints created by the industry profitability environment, coupled with improved inventories, announced supply reductions and the impact of the HBM ramp on DRAM bit supply growth will create conditions that will increasingly tighten the supply-demand balance, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year.\nOur Micron team is executing well and is taking prudent and proactive actions to navigate through the near-term environment and position the company to emerge stronger from the current downturn. We look forward to a recovery in our business financials taking shape in fiscal 2024. I will now turn it over to Mark for our financial results and outlook.\n\nMark J. Murphy\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Delphi Automotive Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjay, and good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin higher than the midpoint of the guidance range and EPS above the high end of the range. We are exiting the fiscal year with the business improving due to multiple factors, including higher volumes and inflection in the pricing environment, strong productivity and ongoing capital discipline. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was approximately $4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down 40% year-over-year. Fiscal 2023 total revenue was $15.5 billion, down 49% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $2.8 billion, representing 69% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 3% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the mid-teens percentage range and prices declining in the high single-digit percentage range. .\nFor the fiscal year, DRAM revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $11 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $1.2 billion, representing around 30% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 19% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing over 40%, driven by the timing of shipments, including strategic purchases and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range.\nFor the fiscal year, NAND revenue declined 46% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, representing 27% of total revenue. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking business unit revenue was $1.2 billion, down 14% sequentially. Data center revenue remained weak as customers continue to adjust inventories and as a result of the CAC decision. In fiscal Q1, we expect sequential growth in data center.\nRevenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.2 billion, up 48% sequentially due to seasonal effects and timing of shipments. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $860 million, down 6% sequentially. Embedded Consumer revenue increased sequentially, helped by seasonality, while automotive and industrial revenue declined modestly. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $739 million, up 18% sequentially driven by increased shipments across most of the product portfolio.\nSBU bit shipments set records for fiscal Q4 and the fiscal year. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was negative 9%, improving 7 percentage points sequentially. Gross margin was impacted by lower pricing and underutilization costs while the sell-through of previously written-down inventory provided some uplift.\nFor the fiscal year, consolidated gross margin was negative 8%, down 54 percentage points year-over-year, driven by price effects, inventory write-downs and the burden of underutilization. Approximately 6 percentage points of the reduction is from net inventory write-downs. Operating expenses in fiscal Q4 were $842 million down $24 million sequentially due to ongoing expense reduction initiatives and the timing of certain R&D program expenditures. For the fiscal year, operating expenses were $3.6 billion, down $209 million year-over-year, driven by expense reduction initiatives.\nOn OpEx for the fourth quarter and year, we ended below the target we communicated starting with our September call a year ago. As market conditions improve, we will remain disciplined in all spending, including operating expenses, focusing R&D on the most critical programs and leveraging a competitive and more productive overhead structure. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.2 billion in fiscal Q4, resulting in an operating margin of negative 30%, improved from negative 39% in the prior quarter. Fiscal 2023 operating loss was $4.8 billion, resulting in an operating margin of negative 31%. We recorded a tax benefit of $14 million in fiscal Q4, better than expectations and due primarily to lower-than-expected foreign taxes related to currency effects.\nFor fiscal 2023, total taxes were $142 million. The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q4 was $1.07 compared to a loss per share of $1.43 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $1.45 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was a loss per share of $4.45 for the fiscal year. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $250 million in fiscal Q4. For the fiscal year, we generated $1.6 billion of cash from operations, representing 10% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $1 billion during the quarter and totaled $7 billion for the fiscal year.\nThis was in line with recent guidance and for the year, at the low end of the range of estimates we provided on our December 2022 earnings call. Free cash flow was negative $758 million in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 ending inventory was $8.4 billion or 170 days. As mentioned last quarter, we are holding approximately $1 billion of strategic inventory stock associated with build ahead of products for cost optimization and risk mitigation.\nWe see days of inventory improving into the first half of the fiscal year. And adjusting for this strategic stock, expect to have only a few weeks of above-target inventories as we enter the second half of fiscal 2024. Inventory levels and profitability will remain principal factors in our decisions around wafer starts and capacity planning. Continuing with the balance sheet, we maintained historically high levels of liquidity. At year-end, we held $10.5 billion of cash and investments and had $13 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility. We ended the year with $13.3 billion in total debt, a weighted average maturity of 2030 on debt and low net leverage.\nNow turning to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter. Demand is improving as customer inventory levels continue to normalize, and secular growth drivers remain intact. We expect record DRAM bit shipments in fiscal Q1. For NAND, we expect fiscal Q1 bit shipments to decline somewhat from fiscal Q4 levels, but remained relatively strong. In China, the Cyberspace Administration of China decision continues to impact our revenue opportunity and the associated headwinds is reflected in our guidance.\nFiscal Q1 gross margin is projected to improve sequentially on a greater mix of DRAM and more sell-through of written down inventories. We expect approximately 60% of the remaining benefit from lower cost inventories to clear in fiscal Q1. Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate any additional inventory write-downs due to pricing. Period costs associated with underutilization will weigh on gross margins in the quarter as first quarter period costs are projected to be similar to the prior quarter.\nBeyond fiscal Q1, we project gross margin improvement to continue as prices increase and period costs become less of a factor. We expect the rate of price improvement in the second fiscal half to exceed the first half. We now forecast gross margins to be positive throughout the second half of fiscal 2024. As mentioned last quarter, we expect fiscal Q1 operating expenses to increase sequentially, driven by an increase in R&D and as temporary reductions to employee compensation come to an end.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, we expect operating expenses to be up by a low single-digit percentage versus fiscal 2023. On taxes, we project a material, sequential quarterly increase as we move from a credit in Q4 to a more normal expense. As discussed previously, so overall profitability remains low, a minimum level of taxes will occur based primarily on local jurisdiction profit. As we are forecasting a consolidated pretax loss in fiscal 2024, these local factors will drive tax expense again this year. We estimate our full year fiscal 2024 taxes to be under $200 million.\nOur first quarter tax estimate of $80 million reflects our forecasted Q1 results in proportion to full year projected tax expense. Changes in the distribution of profit within the year may result in changes in the tax expense recognized each quarter. We project our fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to increase slightly versus fiscal 2023 as we balance the long-term capacity needs of the business with ongoing capital discipline and near-term cash flow objectives. Consistent with our comments in the last few quarters, we do see WFE CapEx decreasing from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024. When factoring higher construction spend and expected grants in fiscal 2024, we forecast our CapEx to be more evenly distributed over fiscal 2024.\nA sequential increase in quarterly CapEx, together with improving but still challenging profitability levels in the near term, means free cash flow will remain significantly negative in the first half of the fiscal year. We forecast improved free cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year. We project our balance sheet to remain strong and net leverage ratio to peak in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. To support the long-term investment priorities of the business, we have ample liquidity and ready access to multiple sources of credit.\nWe will continue to manage our business to maintain financial flexibility and in a manner consistent with our commitment to our investment-grade rating. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q1 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 4%, plus or minus 200 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million.\nWe expect tax expense of approximately $80 million. Based on the share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07 plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2023 despite facing a historic downturn. We sustained our technology, product and manufacturing leadership and achieved mature yields in record time on the industry's most advanced nodes in DRAM and NAND.\nMicron's leading product announcements position us well to address the growing performance requirements of data-centric computing. In response to severe market conditions, we acted quickly and decisively to cut supply and capital spend to reduce operating costs and improve productivity and to maintain a solid and flexible balance sheet. As the business improves in fiscal 2024, we will leverage our strengths in technology, product and manufacturing while maintaining the productivity and capital discipline that we displayed in fiscal 2023. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Mark. The past 4 quarters tested the resilience and agility of our entire industry. While the recovery from this downturn has begun, Micron will exercise continued supply discipline to drive a return to sustained profitability. I'm proud of our team's response to adversity, sustaining our technology leadership, improving time to mature yield and launching a suite of leading-edge products that represent one of the strongest portfolio expansions in Micron's 45-year history.\nAs our global investment announcements throughout the year clearly show, Micron remains keenly focused on building our business to meet future demand driven by the proliferation of AI from the data center to the edge. I have full confidence in our team, the position we have built for Micron and our collective ability to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.\nThank you for joining us today. We will now open up for questions.",

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal third quarter revenue within our guidance range with gross margin and EPS above the range. The ongoing improvement of customer inventories and memory content growth are driving higher industry demand while production cuts across the industry continue to help reduce excess supply. As a result, pricing trends are improving, and we have increased confidence that the industry has passed the bottom for both quarterly revenue and year-on-year revenue growth.\nOur technology leadership and strengthening product portfolio position us well across diverse growth markets, including AI and memory-centric computing. Beyond this downturn, we expect to see record TAM in calendar 2025, along with a return to more normalized levels of profitability.\nThe impact of the May 24 decision by the Cyberspace Administration of China on Micron's business remains uncertain and fluid. Several Micron customers, including mobile OEMs have been contacted by certain critical information infrastructure operators or representatives of the government in China concerning the future use of Micron products.\nAs discussed before, Micron's revenue with companies headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, accounts for approximately 1/4 of Micron's worldwide revenue and remains the principal exposure. We currently estimate that approximately half of that China headquartered customer revenue, which equates to a low double-digit percentage of Micron's worldwide revenue, is at risk of being impacted.\nThis significant headwind is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time and expect increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability. Micron's long-term goal is to retain its worldwide DRAM and NAND share.\nTurning to technology. Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing CapEx, node ramps and wafer start reductions to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. Our industry-leading 1 beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes are achieving world-class yields and the yield ramp for these nodes has been faster than any of our prior nodes. These leadership nodes provide a strong cost capability along with best-in-class power and performance specifications that will be leveraged across the portfolio of DRAM and NAND products.\nIn fiscal Q3, we achieved several important product qualifications on these advanced nodes and are well positioned to ramp them in fiscal 2024. We are also making good progress towards the introduction of our EUV-based 1-gamma node in 2025. This node will be manufactured first in our Taiwan site, where we already have EUV capability installed and operating in preparation for this ramp.\nWe also recently announced plans to bring EUV technology to our fab in Hiroshima, Japan with support from the Japanese government. Micron will be the first company to bring EUV technology to Japan for production.\nWe are also advancing our global assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. In China, we announced an investment of approximately $600 million over the next several years in our operations in Xian. This builds on our long history of significant investment in our Xian assembly, packaging and test operations.\nAs a part of this investment, we have decided to purchase the assembly equipment of our partner, Power Tech Semiconductor Xian, who has been operating inside our Xian facility for the last 8 years. We also intend to construct a new building at our Xian site to provide space to add more product capabilities. This will allow us, over time, to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xian side.\nIn India, with the strong support of the Indian government, we will build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat to address demand for the latter half of this decade. We are also increasing our investments in assembly and test capacity in Taiwan for high-bandwidth memory products as we gear up for stronger demand in this segment, driven by the AI wave.\nNow turning to our end markets. Customers continue to make progress in reducing their excess inventory in fiscal Q3. Most customer inventories in the PC and smartphone segments are close to normal levels now consistent with our forecast 6 months ago. Some of these inventory levels can get distorted by customer attempts to leverage current prices, which are deemed to be transient and unsustainable at these levels to purchase additional volumes before prices rise significantly. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize around the end of this calendar year or somewhat thereafter, depending on the growth in traditional data center spending.\nIn data center, we saw strong sequential revenue growth in both cloud and enterprise in fiscal Q3, driven by some recovery from depressed sales levels in fiscal Q2. The recent acceleration in the adoption of generative AI is driving higher-than-expected industry demand for memory and storage for AI servers, while traditional server demand for mainstream data center applications continues to be lackluster.\nMicron's product portfolio and road map of innovative products position us to capture growth opportunities from AI and data-centric computing architectures for both training and inferencing. Increasingly large AI models with an exponentially growing number of parameters are driving demand for dramatically higher memory content.\nAs we have said before, AI servers have 6x to 8x the DRAM content of a regular server and 3x the NAND content. In fact, some customers are deploying AI compute capability with a substantially higher memory content. A striking example is NDL, DGX, GH 200 supercluster, which shows just how memory-intensive AI workloads can be. It provides developers the ability to support giant models with a massive shared memory space of 144 terabytes.\nA significant majority of that memory footprint is enabled by a joint development project between our 2 companies that extends Micron's low-power DRAM leadership to server-class applications. We are proud to pioneer this differentiated LPDRAM innovation to deliver a significant reduction in data center power consumption compared to DDR-based solutions helping to support our customers' green initiatives.\nHigh-bandwidth memory used in high-performance computing is seeing very strong demand this year, driven by demand for generative AI. We are working closely with our customers and have begun sampling our industry-leading HBM3 product offering.\nThe customer response has been strong, and we believe our HBM3 product delivers significantly higher bandwidth than competing solutions and establishes the new benchmark in performance and consumption supported by our 1 beta technology, TSV and other innovations, enabling a differentiated advanced packaging solution.\nWe expect to begin a mass production ramp for this exciting HBM3 product in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5, which is the latest generation of DDR memory. Our D5 percentage of DRAM shipments has more than doubled from fiscal Q2 to Q3 and and we expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 at the end of first calendar quarter of 2024 versus mid-calendar 2024 for the industry.\nMicron's 1 alpha D5 modules are qualified and shipping to data center customers. We are also making good progress on our 1 beta-based high-density 128 gigabyte D5 modules using a 32 gigabit die that optimizes cost and performance to provide customers with a lower cost of ownership solution for memory-intensive workloads like AI. We expect these high-density modules to ramp in calendar Q2 of 2024 and with significant cost improvements over today's expense sales, TSV-based solutions in the industry.\nOur 96-gigabyte D5 high-density module built on 1 alpha technology using 24 gigabit die is already shipping in volume and delivers equivalent performance for the majority of workloads versus the more expensive TSV, dual die package-based 128-gigabyte modules.\nIn data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio is now on 176 layer or 232 layer NAND, demonstrating our product and technology leadership. We are in a strong position to serve AI demand for fast storage as these data-intensive applications proliferate. In fiscal Q3, we launched the world's first 200-plus layer NAND data center SSD, and qualification is in progress at multiple key customers to support AI cluster installations. In fact, we have already passed qualification of this product at a critical server OEM partner. We also launched our Extreme endurance data center SSD, which offers superior scalability and affordability versus hard drives.\nIn PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year with PC units expected to be below the pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019. We are excited about the ongoing industry transition to D5 and are well positioned for it with our strong D5 product lineup. Industry clients D5 mix is expected to cross over from D4 in early calendar 2024.\nIn fiscal Q3, we achieved record quarterly client SSD bit shipments driven by share growth in client SSDs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the third consecutive quarter with growth in both client and consumer.\nLast month, we launched crucial T700, the world's fastest Gen 5 PCIe consumer SSD built with our 232 layer NAND. In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics TAM growth CAGR to outpace the broader market supported by applications across client and data center. We expect customer inventories to normalize in calendar Q3. We plan to introduce our next-generation G7 product on our industry-leading 1-beta node in the first half of calendar year 2024.\nIn mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volumes to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. While units are weaker, we are seeing stronger memory content growth driven by a mix shift toward premium phones and elasticity. We expect sequential growth in fiscal Q4 as customers prepare for upcoming product launches in the back half of calendar 2023.\nIn fiscal Q3, we achieved key mobile customer qualifications on our 1 beta base LP5X and started high-volume revenue shipments to Tier 1 OEMs. In addition, we achieved significant milestones in UFS with the qualification and ramp of a high-capacity UMCP5 featuring 16 gigabyte of DRAM and 512 gigabytes of NAND. We have also started to sample a new UFS4 product based on our latest 232-layer NAND technology, which enables industry-leading performance for flagship handsets.\nLast, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which represent over 20% of our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and profitability. Micron continues to lead in automotive, which is a key market and growth driver for us. In fiscal Q3, auto revenue reached another quarterly record and grew by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in auto memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by easing non-memory semiconductor supply, normalizing customer inventory levels and increasing memory content per vehicle.\nThe industrial market saw early signs of recovery in fiscal Q3. Inventory levels are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. As a result, we expect an improvement in demand in the second half of calendar 2023. We are excited about our growth prospects in this market as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement IoT, AI and machine learning in the factory.\nNow turning to industry outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit demand growth has been further reduced to low to mid-single digits in DRAM and to high single digits in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low 20s percentage range in NAND. While the AI-driven demand has been stronger than our expectations 3 months ago, the PC, smartphone and traditional server demand forecasts are now lower.\nWe continue to expect stronger industry bit shipments for DRAM and NAND in the second half of the calendar year, driven by secular content growth and continued improvement in customer inventory. While the industry demand forecast for calendar 2023 is now lower, the significant supply reductions across the industry have started to stabilize the market.\nWe see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth to be negative for the industry in calendar 2023, as utilization and CapEx cuts across the industry impact supply growth. While supply/demand balance is improving due to the excess inventory, profitability and cash flow will remain extremely challenged for some time. Market recovery can accelerate if there is further reduction in industry production and these cuts are sustained well into calendar 2024.\nIn response to the industry environment, Micron has taken decisive actions to bring our supply back in balance with demand. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022.\nOur fiscal 2023 CapEx plan of $7 billion is down more than 40% from last year, with WFE down more than 50%. We continue to expect fiscal '24 WFE to be down year-on-year. Recently, we have further reduced wafer starts to approach 30% in both DRAM and NAND. We currently expect to reduce wafer starts will continue well into calendar 2024, as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply.\nI will now turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark J. Murphy\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Delphi Automotive Plc\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal Q3 results were in line to better than expectations, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin and EPS exceeding the high end of the range.\nTotal fiscal Q3 revenue was approximately $3.8 billion, up 2% sequentially and down 57% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 revenue included $72 million from an insurance settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 2% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the 10 percentage range and prices declining by approximately 10%.\nFiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 14% sequentially with bit shipments increasing in the upper 30 percentage range and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range.\nNow turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking business unit revenue was $1.4 billion, up 1% sequentially. Strong sequential growth in server and graphics revenues was offset by a decline in client. Embedded business unit revenue was $912 million, up 5% sequentially. On a sequential basis, automotive and consumer revenues were strong.\nRevenue for the mobile business unit was $819 million, down 13% sequentially due to timing of shipments. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect growth in mobile revenues in fiscal Q4. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $627 million, up 24% sequentially and driven by increased shipments across most of the portfolio.\nThe consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was negative 16%, improving 15 percentage points sequentially. This result was negatively impacted by approximately $400 million or 11 percentage points of write-downs associated with inventory produced in the quarter.\nOperating expenses in fiscal Q3 were $866 million, down roughly $50 million sequentially. OpEx benefited from ongoing expense reduction initiatives and gains on sales of certain assets. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.5 billion in fiscal Q3 resulting in an operating margin of negative 39%, improved from negative 56% in the prior quarter.\nFiscal Q3 taxes were $102 million, higher than expectations at the time of our guidance driven by onetime discrete items. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies.\nThe non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q3 was $1.43, down from a loss per share of $1.91 in the prior quarter, and earnings per share of $2.59 in the prior year. Fiscal Q3 EPS included approximately $0.37 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-down associated with inventory produced in the quarter.\nTurning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $24 million. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $7 billion for the fiscal year. that's near $1 billion in fiscal Q4.\nFree cash flow was negative $1.4 billion in the quarter and improved from the previous 2 quarters. Our fiscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.2 billion or 168 days. Due to increases in process steps and product complexity, we now target inventory levels of around 120 days, which at present would equate to approximately $6 billion. Our current inventories include strategic stocks of approximately $1 billion over target levels associated with build-ahead of product for cost optimization and risk mitigation.\nAt quarter end, we held cash and investments of $11.4 billion and had total liquidity of $13.9 billion, including our untapped credit facility. We issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter. And with part of those proceeds paid down $600 million of our term loan facility resulting in a net increase to debt of $900 million. Our fiscal Q3 ending debt was $13.2 billion.\nNow turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. As mentioned in filings and our comments today, the CAC decision is a headwind to our outlook. We expect the revenue impact to vary by quarter with the impact in fiscal Q4 being less than the quarterly impact in the first half of fiscal 2024. Over time, we have a goal of retaining our global market share in both DRAM and NAND.\nIn fiscal Q4, as the industry demand continues to improve and despite the effects on our business from the CAC decision, we still see record bit shipments. Fiscal Q4 gross margin will be impacted by costs from underutilization, weak pricing levels and product mix. In the current business environment, the gap between our DRAM and NAND profitability is significant, and changes in the mix can drive large variability in gross margins.\nOur gross margin guidance does not contemplate additional write-downs of inventory. We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and remain on track to exit the fiscal year at less than $850 million.\nLooking beyond fiscal Q4, we expect OpEx to increase over $50 million in fiscal Q1 2024 on R&D program expense timing. And as reductions to employee compensation end. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue to be $3.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 10.5% plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $845 million plus or minus $15 million; we expect tax expenses of approximately $40 million; based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.19 plus or minus $0.07.\nIn closing, we continue to act quickly and tenaciously to navigate this downturn, making the investments to maintain our leading capabilities across technology, products and manufacturing while preserving our solid balance sheet. In this environment, we remain sharply focused on improving our profitability and free cash flow.\nAs market conditions improve, we will continue to drive efficiencies to hold on to productivity gains. Despite the impact of this downturn and effects of the CAC decision, we remain confident in our financial model and our ability to deliver long-term profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns.\nI will now turn it back over to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Mark. I'm proud of the execution of the Micron team and the progress we've made this quarter. The leadership products we released and qualified our strengthening Micron's portfolio across multiple key markets.\nWhile there are near-term headwinds, I'm excited about the new product introductions that we have planned for the next several quarters, which will further enable us to leverage the dramatic growth in AI that is ahead of us. I'm confident that this portfolio momentum, combined with our technology capability, manufacturing excellence, financial discipline and excellent customer relationships will position us well for the future.\nI also want to call attention to Micron's 2023 Sustainability Report, which published yesterday. The report underscores our continued commitment to innovation the environment, our people and the communities where we operate, outlining our progress and escalations across our environmental, social and governance programs. I encourage you to review the full report on Micron's website.\nThank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.",

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered record annual revenue in fiscal 2022 with solid profitability and free cash flow despite a challenging environment in the latter part of the year. In 2022, we ramped our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176 layers NAND nodes across our portfolio and returned a record amount of cash to shareholders. We strengthened our product portfolio significantly during the year as evidenced by record revenue in mobile, auto, industrial and networking end markets. Our share gains in client and data center SSDs contributed to record revenue in SSDs and also in our consolidated NAND business.\nWe also ramped new product categories like high-bandwidth HBM2E memory and GDDR6X. In addition, a record number of customers recognized Micron as the industry leader in product quality. Our fiscal Q4 financial results were impacted by rapidly weakening consumer demand and significant customer inventory adjustments across all end markets. We are responding decisively to this weak environment by the decreasing supply growth through significant cuts to fiscal 2023 CapEx and by reducing utilization in our fabs. We are confident that the memory industry supply-demand balance will be restored as a result of reduced industry supply growth combined with the long-term demand growth drivers for memory.\nMicron's technology and manufacturing leadership, deep customer relationships, diverse product portfolio and strong balance sheet put us in a solid footing to navigate this industry down cycle and position the company for strong long-term growth. Our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes drove strong cost reductions in fiscal 2022. In fiscal Q4, we led the industry again in introducing our 232-layer NAND, becoming the first company to enter volume production on a node with more than 200 layers. We also remain on track to begin the ramp of our 1-beta DRAM node in manufacturing by the end of calendar 2022. Both the 1-beta DRAM node and 232-layer NAND node will provide us with robust cost reduction when they ramp in high volume.\nArtificial intelligence, cloud computing, electric vehicles and the ubiquitous connectivity offered by 5G and our strong long-term demand drivers for memory and storage. As we have discussed previously, to support memory demand in the second half of the decade and beyond, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity. The recently passed CHIPS and Science Act will help to reduce the memory manufacturing cost disparities that exist between the U.S. and Asia. Following passage of the CHIPS Act, Micron announced our intent to invest $40 billion through the end of the decade in leading-edge memory manufacturing in the U.S., contingent on CHIPS Act support. These investments will ultimately create tens of thousands of American jobs, strengthen U.S. supply chain resiliency and further diversify our global fab footprint.\nEarlier this month, we announced that we have chosen Boise as 1 of 2 leading-edge DRAM manufacturing fab sites that we are planning in the U.S. and we expect to invest approximately $15 billion at this site through the end of the decade. The co-location of this new manufacturing facility with our existing R&D site at our headquarters in Boise, provides multiple strategic benefits, including improving efficiency across both R&D and manufacturing, simplifying technology transfer and reducing time to market for leading-edge products.\nWe will soon announce a second high-volume U.S. DRAM manufacturing site. These new fabs will fulfill our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond. We plan to build these sites in stages. Tool installation and production output will be ramped in line with industry demand growth, which is consistent with our goal to maintain stable bit supply share as well as supply discipline.\nNow turning to our end markets. Micron's product portfolio has become significantly stronger and contributed to our momentum in the most attractive markets. In fiscal 2022, data center and graphics revenue grew approximately 35%, and auto, industrial and networking revenue grew approximately 40%. The combined revenue mix of these important markets grew from approximately 45% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 to 52% in fiscal 2022, putting us on track to hit our target of 62% by fiscal 2025, as outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year.\nThis portfolio transformation will increase our exposure to the most attractive and stable profit pools in the industry. In fiscal Q4, data center revenue was down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven primarily by declines in ASP. In fiscal 2022, we set a new revenue record for our cloud revenues, which grew more than 30% year-over-year. Cloud end demand remains healthy, driven by secular growth in AI and the digital economy. However, the data center market, including both cloud and enterprise, continues to face some supply constraints that are limiting server bills. And customers are reducing memory and storage inventory due to macroeconomic uncertainties.\nWith a diverse set of products across DDR4, DDR5, graphics memory, high-bandwidth memory and data center SSDs, Micron offers a wide portfolio of solutions targeting this market with industry-leading quality. Building on our recent momentum of market share gains in data center SSDs in the first half of calendar 2022, we continue to make solid progress in ongoing qualifications of our 176-layer NVMe data center SSDs at hyperscalers and OEMs around the world.\nFiscal Q4 client revenue was down both sequentially and year-over-year as PC unit end demand declined and customers reduced inventory. We now forecast calendar 2022 PC unit sales to decline by an approximately mid-teens percentage year-over-year. In fiscal Q4, we began ramping 16 gigabit DDR5 in high-volume production ahead of anticipated client platform launches. We also commenced volume production of Gen 4 QLC NVMe client SSDs, and are the only company with a full portfolio of 176-layer TLC and Gen 4 QLC NVMe SSDs qualified and shipping to PC OEMs. In fiscal Q4, graphics revenue declined both sequentially and year-over-year. Micron continues to hold an excellent position as the performance leader in the graphics market. In fiscal Q4, we began shipping the industry's fastest graphics memory with 24 gigabits per second GDDR6X shipping in high-volume production. We are excited to see our proprietary GDDR6X memory featured in the recent launch of NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 GPUs.\nFiscal Q4 mobile revenue declined both sequentially and year-over-year. Despite the weakness in end unit sales, we achieved 2 consecutive years of record mobile revenue in fiscal 2021 and 2022. We now project calendar 2022 smartphone unit volume to decline by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. 5G continues to drive digital content per device and we project 5G penetration to exceed 50% of the smartphone unit TAM in calendar 2022. We continue to execute well on our mobile product road map. In fiscal Q4, 1-alpha comprised over 70% of our LPDRAM mobile bit shipment and 176-layer made up approximately 95% of our mobile NAND bit shipments.\nMicron is exceptionally well-positioned as the leader in automotive and industrial markets, which are attractive because of strong long-term growth and relatively stable margins. In fiscal Q4, our automotive business delivered another record revenue quarter, and fiscal 2022 auto revenues grew 30% year over year, setting a new all-time high. In fiscal Q1, we see some slowdown in our automotive demand as our customers rebalance DRAM and NAND inventory levels as they deal with nonmemory semiconductor shortages and production challenges. However, we see continued strong growth in our second half of fiscal 2023 with volume ramp of advanced next-generation in-vehicle infotainment systems as well as the broader adoption of more advanced driver-assistance systems. We are extremely excited by the long-term prospects for memory and storage in the automotive market and expect long-term CAGR for DRAM and NAND in autos to be at about twice the rate of the overall DRAM and NAND markets.\nWhile long-term fundamentals remain strong, our industrial IoT business saw sequential and year-over-year revenue declines in fiscal Q4. Softening macroeconomic conditions have led some customers to reduce overall purchases of DRAM and NAND. Nevertheless, our long-term outlook remains strong for our industrial business driven by the proliferation of factory automation and digitization.\nTurning to the market outlook. The memory and storage industry environment has deteriorated sharply since our last earnings call. Calendar 2022, industry bit demand growth for DRAM is now expected to be in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range; and for NAND, slightly higher than 10%. An unprecedented confluence of events has affected overall demand, including COVID-related lockdowns in China, the Ukraine war, the inflationary environment impacting consumer spending and the macroeconomic environment, influencing customers' buying behavior in multiple segments. In addition, inventory adjustment at customers across all end markets are also contributing to demand weakness. These factors are depressing demand for DRAM and NAND to well below end market consumption levels. We are also seeing an extremely aggressive pricing environment. Due to the sharp decline in near-term demand, we expect supply growth to be significantly above demand growth in calendar 2022, contributing to very high supply inventories for both DRAM and NAND.\nLooking ahead, in calendar 2023, while macroeconomic uncertainty is high and visibility is low, we currently expect demand growth to be closer to the long-term growth rates of both DRAM and NAND, bouncing back from very weak levels in calendar 2022. We expect the inventory at our customers to improve in early calendar 2023, causing demand to rebound starting from the second quarter of calendar 2023. We expect calendar 2023 industry DRAM supply to grow well below demand growth. We are modeling a mid-single-digit percentage growth in DRAM industry supply in 2023, which would represent the lowest ever industry supply growth. NAND supply growth in calendar 2023 is also expected to fall below demand growth.\nGiven the elevated supplier inventories entering calendar 2023, we expect industry profitability to remain challenging in 2023. Following a weak first half of fiscal 2023, we expect strong revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2023 as bit demands rebounds following substantial improvement in customer inventories. Projections for long-term demand trends remain strong across multiple end markets. We expect long-term demand bit growth to be in the mid-teens percentage, slightly lower than our prior expectation of mid- to high teens due to a moderation in the expectation of long-term PC unit sales. We continue to expect the NAND market, which benefits from elasticity, to grow around 28% over the long term.\nTurning to our supply. Given the change in market conditions, we have been taking immediate action to reduce our supply growth trajectory and align it to market demand.\nWe made significant reductions to CapEx and now expect fiscal 2023 CapEx to be around $8 billion, down more than 30% year-over-year. CapEx would be lower if it were not for more than doubling our construction CapEx year-over-year to support the supply growth required to meet demand for the second half of this decade as well as investments for EUV lithography systems to support 1-gamma node development. WFE CapEx will decline nearly 50% year-over-year, and reflects a much slower ramp of our 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND versus prior expectations. Fiscal 2023, WFE CapEx is focused on developing the technology capability of our leading nodes and new product introductions.\nTo immediately address our inventory situation and reduced supply growth, we are reducing utilization in select areas in both DRAM and NAND. Our CapEx and utilization actions will have an adverse impact on our fiscal 2023 costs but they are necessary to bring our supply and inventory closer to industry demand. We will aim to grow our DRAM and NAND supply in line with demand over time while continuing to optimize our cost and portfolio to improve our profitability.\nBefore passing it over to Mark, I want to reflect on the tremendous progress that the Micron team has made over the last few years. Today, we are a technology leader in both DRAM and NAND with a very competitive cost structure. We have leadership products and a strong portfolio that is transitioning towards high-value solutions. And we are gaining share in products that represent a more attractive profit pool in our industry. Our balance sheet is strong and allows us to invest appropriately to maintain technology, product and manufacturing leadership going forward. Our world-class quality and manufacturing expertise is recognized by our customers worldwide. We have delivered record revenues in multiple end markets in fiscal 2022 and while returning record levels of cash to our shareholders.\nWhile the near-term environment is challenging, we are confident in our ability to emerge stronger and deliver financial performance in line with our long-term financial model. The long-term manufacturing investments we are making will further strengthen our diversified fab footprint and position us to capitalize on the exciting long-term opportunities ahead of us.\nI will now turn it over to Mark.\n\nMark J. Murphy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Our fiscal Q4 revenues stand consistent with our August 9 update, while EPS was within the original guidance range. Fiscal Q4 capped off a strong fiscal year in which we set a record for total revenue, generated substantial free cash flow and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders. Total fiscal Q4 revenue was $6.6 billion, down 23% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. Fiscal 2022 total revenue was a record at $30.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $4.8 billion, representing 72% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 23% sequentially and was down 21% year-over-year. Sequentially, bit shipments decreased by roughly 10%, while ASPs declined in the low teens percent range.\nFor the fiscal year, DRAM revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $22.4 billion, representing 73% of total fiscal year revenue. Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $1.7 billion, representing 25% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue declined 26% sequentially and was down 14% year-over-year. Sequential bit shipments declined in the low 20s percentage range and ASPs declined in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range. For the fiscal year, NAND revenue increased 11% year-over-year to a record $7.8 billion, representing 25% of total fiscal year revenue.\nTurning to our fiscal Q4 revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.9 billion, down 25% sequentially and down 23% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily driven by client, while declines in server and graphics were less pronounced. Networking revenue hit a new record in fiscal 2022. Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was approximately $1.5 billion, down 23% sequentially and down 20% year-over-year. Mobile revenue for fiscal 2022 set a new record. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $891 million, down 34% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year.\nFor the fiscal year, NAND revenue in the Storage Business Unit was its highest ever with share gains in both client and data center SSDs. Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $1.3 billion, down 9% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year.\nFor fiscal 2022, EBU delivered $5.2 billion of revenue supported by revenue records in automotive and industrial markets. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q4 was 40.3%, down approximately 7 percentage points sequentially. Lower pricing was the primary driver of the decline. For the fiscal year, the consolidated gross margin was 45.9%, up approximately 6 percentage points year-over-year.\nOperating expenses in fiscal Q4 were just over $1 billion and below the guidance range provided on our last earnings call, due in part to lower variable compensation in the quarter. Sequentially, OpEx was up around $60 million, due primarily to the timing of technology development spend. For the fiscal year, operating expenses were $3.8 billion, up approximately $500 million year-over-year driven by R&D to support our product and technology road maps.\nFiscal Q4 operating income was $1.7 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 25%, down approximately 11 percentage points sequentially and down 12 points from the prior year. Fiscal 2022 operating income was $10.3 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 33.4%, up approximately 6 percentage points from the prior year. Fiscal Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $3.6 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 53.5%, down 390 basis points sequentially. For the fiscal year, adjusted EBITDA was $17.4 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 56.7%. Fiscal Q4 taxes were $74 million or over 4% of pretax income. For fiscal 2022, total taxes were $793 million or approximately 8% of pretax income. Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q4 was $1.45, down from $2.59 in fiscal Q3 and $2.42 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.35 for the fiscal year, up from $6.06 in the prior year.\nTurning to cash flows capital spending. We generated $3.8 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q4, representing 57% of revenue. For the fiscal year, we generated $15.2 billion of cash from operations, representing 49% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $3.6 billion during the quarter and $12 billion for the fiscal year. We generated $196 million of free cash flow in fiscal Q4 and $3.2 billion for the fiscal year.\nFiscal year 2022 was the sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow for Micron. During the quarter, we completed share repurchases of $784 million or 13.2 million shares. For the fiscal year, we completed share repurchases of $2.4 billion, representing 35.4 million shares. Including our dividend payments, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2022, representing 90% of free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 100% of free cash flow across the cycle through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.\nOur ending fiscal Q4 inventory was $6.7 billion, and average days of inventory for the quarter was 139 days, reflecting weaker market conditions during the quarter. Our balance sheet is rock solid with strong liquidity, low leverage ratio and a net cash position. We ended fiscal 2022 with $13.6 billion of liquidity, exceeding our mid-30s percentage of revenue target. Fiscal Q4 ending cash and investments were $11.1 billion and total debt was $6.9 million.\nNow turning to our outlook for the fiscal first quarter. As a result of the demand challenges described by Sanjay earlier, we expect fiscal Q1 bit shipments and pricing to decline in both DRAM and NAND. We expect that inflationary pressure will continue to be a headwind to costs in Q1 in fiscal 2023. We remain disciplined in our expense management and have taken specific actions with more planned. As we look ahead, macroeconomic uncertainty is high and visibility is low. In fiscal Q2, we currently expect revenue to be in a similar range as fiscal Q1 with bit shipments up but still weak for both DRAM and NAND. We also expect a recovery in volumes and revenues in the second half of the fiscal year. We expect our inventory to increase in the fiscal first half of 2023 and days of inventory to improve as demand recovers in the second half of the fiscal year.\nAs Sanjay mentioned, we expect our fiscal 2023 capital spending to be around $8 billion, down more than 30% year-over-year, driven by a near 50% decline in wafer fab equipment CapEx. We expect capital spending to be weighted toward the first half of the fiscal year. And as a result, we project to be over $1.5 billion negative free cash flow in the November quarter. We continue to evaluate ways to improve free cash flow, including reducing CapEx, lowering expenses and managing working capital as we respond to market conditions.\nIn fiscal 2023, we expect our tax rate to be elevated. Unless Congress repeals or delays recent changes to R&D deductibility, recent legislation requires that for tax purposes, we capitalize and amortize R&D expense this fiscal year. In addition, based on our income mix and U.S. and foreign tax rules, our taxes become more fixed at these lower profitability levels. These factors result in an estimated tax of approximately $300 million at a minimum. Beyond this level, the actual tax expense will depend on the level of operating income through the year.\nSo in this lower pretax profitability, fiscal year 2023, we expect a materially higher tax rate. Long term, as our profitability normalizes, we expect our tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens percentage range. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $4.25 billion, plus or minus $250 million; gross margin to be in the range of 26%, plus or minus 200 basis points; and operating expenses to be $1 billion, plus or minus $25 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.12 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.04, plus or minus $0.10.\nIn closing, we had many meaningful accomplishments in fiscal 2022, including delivering record revenue, achieving clear technology leadership in both DRAM and NAND, increasing share in client and data center SSDs, further strengthening our balance sheet and returning a record amount of capital to our shareholders. While the near-term environment is challenging, the Micron of today is extremely well prepared to navigate it with our competitive cost structure, strong product portfolio and rock-solid balance sheet. Beyond fiscal 2023, a year starting out with a challenging set of external events, we are confident in our ability to deliver financial performance consistent with our long-term cross-cycle financial model, including revenue growth of high single digits, operating margins of 30% and free cash flow margin of over 10%.\nI will now turn it back to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra\n\nCEO, President & Director, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. The current macroeconomic environment presents an unprecedented challenge for the industry. Our rapid actions to both moderate utilization and sharply reduce CapEx illustrate our commitment to supply discipline and our focus on bringing our supply and demand back into balance. The Micron team continues to execute with agility to changing business conditions. We remain committed to our strategy of maintaining stable bit share and growing profitability with a portfolio of higher value solutions. And we are confident in the long-term technology drivers for memory. New data-centric applications and technology will drive long-term memory demand on the trajectory that outpaces growth in other semiconductor categories. Our strategic investments underscore this confidence and will ensure Micron is able to capitalize on these long-term trends in the decade ahead.\nThanks for joining us today. We will now open for questions.",

After the speaker presentation, it will be a Q&A session. To ask a question, press star one on your touch tone telephone. I would now like to hand the call over to Fahim Ahmad, Vice President and Best Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nThank you, Latif. Welcome to Micron Technologies fiscal third quarter 2022 Southside Analyst, ALBAC. On the call with me today are Sumit Sadana, our chief business officer.\n\nManish Patia, our EVP of Global Operations and Mark Murphy, our CFO .\n\nAs a reminder, the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements regarding market demand and supply, our expected results, and other matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made today.\n\nWe refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q, for a discussion of the risks that may affect our future results. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. Ratif, you can now open the call for Q&A.\n\nYes sir, again to ask a question please press star 1 at this time. Our first question comes from Tom O'Malley of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the long term, the long term through cycle model, you guys laid out 30% from an operating margin perspective.\n\nI understand that there are some China headwinds that are impacting that I think are, you know, slightly more exacerbating this down cycle, but you're already in the guidance moving below that 30% and it sounds like there may be some more weakening to come. Can you just talk to if you think that 30% is still viable now that you've seen these cuts and just any of the moving parts as to how you think that that can sustain through a cycle. Thank you.\n\nTommy Mark, I'll start. I mean, it is a through cycle model. So it's not intended to be a floor. It's not intended to be any point in time. So I think that...\n\nI think the way to look at it is we're not going to base any given quarter on where it stands relative to the long-term model because there are a lot of conditions that impact obviously the short-term results.\n\nYeah, we are in or we have entered a period of year where the market we can considerably in a very short period of time. And we're just...\n\nWe've given a fourth quarter guide to reflect the best view we have at the moment and we'll update through the quarter.\n\nGotcha. I appreciate it. And then my follow up is just on the cost side, going into the quarter, you guys had talked about just limited cost reductions in both DRAM and NAND. Can you just give any color on just the reported quarter on how costs kind of shook out between the two buckets?\n\nYeah, well, we do expect for the full year for our cost to still outpace industry costs, but in the third and the fourth quarter improvements have been flattish. A little bit better on the front end because.\n\nthe leading node activities and those benefits. A little bit of inflation, or inflation, but that inflation's more manifest on the back end where.\n\nyou know and the net is that we end up with with basically flatish\n\ncost down and third fourth quarter. Long term, we're still playing to be in line.\n\nwith industry cost rents. I'll just add in there that a lot of that has to do.\n\nreported COGS, obviously we have a lot of mixed adjustments. So when we have strong growth, record, quarter and SSDs.\n\nYou know, we have strong growth in some of these high value solutions. Obviously, the COG's number is mixed-adjusted, but when we talk about outperforming the industry in terms of cost reduction for the year, we're talking about at the memory level where our technology leadership in one alpha and 176 layer have allowed us to outpace the industry this year and perform well at the front end level.\n\nBut obviously, moving towards high-value solutions and as that happens over the last quarter and this next quarter, those are...\n\nimpacting the all-in cost, but obviously providing higher margin as well for higher price.\n\nThank you and next question comes from Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley . Your line is open.\n\nGreat, thank you. I wonder if you could quantify at all the impact of the supply reduction that you guys are looking to do that the utilization impact of that. And I guess, is it, can you compare it to what you did in 2019? Do you think it's something similar to that more significant than that less significant than that? Just any color would be helpful.\n\nSure, I go. So, you know, we're still evaluating, you know, what we will finally do. I think what was important for us to give guidance and clarity to everyone on was that we are reducing WSE. And you know, that will have impact on supply big growth for both DRAM and NAND from our prior levels.\n\nNext in 23.\n\nAnd at this time, not really ready to compare it, we're still working to finalize what our plans are. As we mentioned, we're going to have a combination of trying to manage Chapeck.\n\nmanage utilization, particularly for some of our legacy nodes and take a look at maybe less cost-effective nodes, how we can optimize those, how we can optimize the manufacturing footprint space as we transition to more advanced nodes. We're going to be ramping our one beta and 232 technologies. We think it's very important to make sure that we continue to maintain leadership and launch those technologies so that we can have the product portfolio benefits from those as well as the cost benefits from those.\n\nAnd then the other piece of course is managing inventory as Mark was talking about on the call. So we'll kind of look at all those areas together to be able to determine what the right mix of supply big growth, you know, capex utilization and inventory and cost reduction is for next year. And we'll provide more color I think on the next call.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tishia Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nGreat, thank you. I have one quick clarification, then one quick question. On the clarification for the fiscal Q4 guide, based on your commentary, it seems like the sequential decline in revenue that's mostly coming from bits and pricing is perhaps down low singles or something like that based on sort of the strategy that you're taking. Is that a fair assumption?\n\nYeah, if you do the math on things, you'll see that volume's roughly 2 thirds sequential.\n\nGot it. And then as my question, this one for you as well, probably Mark, on OpEx, you talked about some of the initiatives having a bigger impact in fiscal 23.\n\nI guess last time you were kind of in the zip code from a revenue perspective.\n\nop-x was kind of in the low eight hundred millions of dollars and i realize there's been broad-based inflation but how should we think about op-x in the early part of fiscal twenty three as you guys flexed down\n\nYeah, you know, you can back into OptX long-term as a percentage sales through the model. I won't give you a number for OptX in 23 because we haven't done our plans, we'll give guidance on that at a future call. I think the comments today were meant to reflect that, it is an invite.\n\nchange very quickly and the demand environments weakened and we've responded quickly.\n\nacross all major areas of spend and we are, you know, the the op-x number is...\n\ndown from what it was in our original forecast here.\n\nSo that gives you a sense of we're already dealing with it. And our expectation is that as the market outlook becomes clear, we will adjust our off-expand appropriately.\n\nIt's not a, this isn't a, a company's in great position of leadership across technology products and manufacturing. So this is not a, you know, take a sledge.\n\nyou know, op-X, it's a scalpel exercise and we work to get op-X down and an appropriate level for the conditions of the business.\n\nAnd Mark's are just to be clear the sequential increase in op-x this quarter. That's just timing of Qualls as you guys noted on the call\n\nYeah, we had in the third quarter, the OpEx was low, was actually about 100 million off of the, I think the guidance and two major drivers. One, product and technology spend, as you talked about. That was actually...\n\nNot due to, for fewer programs, it was due to actually very good performance and fewer wafers required for technology qualification. That was the largest part of the variance. The next was just, as you can imagine, our forecast came way down. So the incentive comp was adjusted and since we're this far in the year, it was a sizable, you know, a cruel adjustment. So those two things were drivers.\n\nin the fourth quarter of course those benefits.\n\nbecome headwinds for the fourth course or kind of back up to this level yeah just over a billion\n\nand sort of makes it look like more of a sequential decline in reality it is and we'll just continue to work it in a disciplined way from here.\n\nThank you our next question comes from CJ Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nYeah, I wanted to just follow up on prior question around cost downs and whether you're contemplating any material kind of change to utilization rates and how we should think about that impacting cost downs, you know, the common quarters.\n\nHi, CJ. So we are evaluating, I think, as I said, we are evaluating utilization. I would say that we're really having technology leadership. We definitely believe that the inventory at the leading edge that we're generating is very cost effective relative to the rest of the industry, relative to even what will be available for us in future quarters. So we're really on the utilization front focus on thinking about optimizing older nodes, legacy nodes.\n\nYou know, of course, keeping in mind the legacy demand that we have for certain customers as well. But it's not as if I think we're at a position we're on the leading edge, we're gonna be making, you know.\n\nsignificant action, for drastic action. And then, you know, and as I mentioned before, when...\n\nPreviously when I think Joe or Tom had asked about this, we're still planning on ramping our one beta in two, three, two technologies later this year. We think it's very important that we maintain that technology cadence and the learning and drive the adoption of those technologies and that will happen in just a year, 23 years.\n\nWe're helpful and I guess it's just quick follow up. Are there any targets you have for inventory that you can share with us and what kind of time frame?\n\nYou know, we can provide as the previous level of discomfort target, I guess. Maybe you'd call it the, you know, I think we'd like to keep it below 150 days. We do think it'll go up in the, well, we...\n\nIt will go up in the fourth quarter on DIO. I think it gave a number of a couple of weeks. And we'll just have to see where it goes from there. That's a function of market conditions, as you know.\n\nThank you. Next question comes from Serini Pajuri of SMBC Nico. Your line is open.\n\nThank you, a couple from me as well. First on the PC and smartphone weakness, you talked about inventory correction. Just curious, do you think it's a one quarter event, meaning do you think the inventories, customers will normalize after this quarter, or do you see further potential for a correction going forward if assuming that demand kind of stabilizes here. Then I have follow.\n\nTypically, we see that in any given segment when customers start to correct inventory, it is a couple of quarters.\n\nworth of a process, it takes several months to get down to their own internal target levels of inventory. That of course assumes a predictable macroeconomic environment and demand trends in their own segment.\n\nAnd so obviously, you know, there is concern about the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment. So that can further create another vector of uncertainty that has to be dealt with. But typically it takes a couple of quarters for the inventory to get normalized.\n\nAnd we're talking both PC and smartphone submit that started this quarter. So we're talking to quarters basically from current quarter. Yeah, I mean, that's the reason we said that, you know, we see this playing out sort of in the second half of calendar 22 as the biggest portion of the impact of the load cell-through rates in the end markets in those segments as well as the inventory correct.\n\nOkay, got it. And then on your own balance sheet inventory mark, you know, you talked about 150 is kind of, you know, where.\n\nyou'll start getting uncomfortable. But if I look at your historic inventory, I think it peaked out around one in a 30s, in a mid one 30s. So I'm just curious.\n\nWhat changed in the last year or two that you are more comfortable even at 150, I guess? Why is that level gone higher? And then the other side of the question is that you did say that you want kind of, you know.\n\nyou're going to maintain pricing discipline and also use your inventory to kind of supply into the market next year. So I guess at some point the inventory will come down as you lower your production growth.\n\nat what is the minimum level that you're comfortable i mean i'm looking at i guess you know a few quarters ago you're in the low 90s i'm just curious you know what is the minimum level that you're comfortable either when when you have to wrap up you know production again at what\n\nYeah, so there was no news today on the call. Actually, it was more validation of ranges that had been set before. I did comment on, you know, there's some headwinds in the sense of, on DIO around more complex processing. And, you know, that the cycle time in the fab would be longer and more web. There's more complex modules. And there's the associate components with those.\n\nassembly times and so forth. So I think all that.\n\nis a headwind but at the same time um... you know the team's doing a lot of things offset those and so i was\n\nvalidating that the number that we've provided before, of about 150 is a maximum level. Normal levels have also been talked about before, around 100 days. So the number that you cited low 90s is a level that we would view as good lean inventory levels for our business.\n\nOkay, I have the FABs one comment they're just treeneys. I mean, these things, we always hard, the trend in the industry and it doesn't matter whether you look the logic in this subject side or you look at memory, the trend is longer and longer processing time and cycle time in the FABs, right, so that's more of FAB with.\n\nFor us, specifically then, you add in the fact that we're transforming more of our business and, in general, more industry demand moving towards high-value solutions like SSDs, like data center DRM modules. These things have longer cycle time in the back end, as well as more component inventory required to be held for the back end as well. So when you think about all of those things, all of these...\n\nWhether you're talking about the lean inventory range or the max comfortable inventory range, those are things that, you know, generally across this industry as technology becomes more complex and products become more complex. We're going to continue to keep going up, you know.\n\nAnd the other thing just to keep in mind, and we talked about this at our investor days, one of the trends in the industry over the last several years now against speaking about memory, that are helpful to allow us to hold more injuries across the climbs are lower now, than they were a decade ago from technology transition. So.\n\nThat's another one of the areas where we're able to hold more inventory because we have very good cost effective inventory, especially being at the leading edge now at the industry. And we expect that inventory to continue to be cost effective through the next, you know, through this next period while we're working down our inventory.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Fox of Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nThanks. Good afternoon. Two questions first. On the Gross Margin Guidance for the Quarter, I think your your guiding down about 500 basis points roughly quarter over quarter. Can you sort of break that out between, I assume a bulk of that is just sheer volume, but anything you can provide color on how much is related to mix, pricing, et cetera. And then I had to follow up.\n\nYeah, I won't go into the details, but the sequential decline third to fourth is just driven by market trends or dynamics in the market.\n\nThe second quarter, third quarter, was driven by a higher mix of NAND. That's a climb.\n\ntheir quarter of second from second quarter. Yeah, I got that. And then I would just, I would just, I'm sorry, just one thing to add. So, you know, beyond the fourth quarter.\n\nAs we've talked about, as these inventories are elevated and the market works through this period, we would expect that to weigh on gross margins. So I just want to make sure that's clear.\n\nand then just on the long-term agreement, but I mean, I understand this is unusual times, but I mean, you just spent the last several quarters putting some long-term agreements into place and they seem as soon as things got tough to unraveled a bit. So I guess you would kind of, it sounded like you were kind of describing some benefits that are still coming through from the long-term agreements, even as demands close here. I'm just not clear on what those are. So can you maybe talk to the, I guess that comment and the question. I just have to put it out.\n\nSo in terms of the long-term agreement, you know, we...\n\nWe have been working on these for several years, used to be just over 10% of our revenue under long-term agreements five years ago when it's now 75% of our revenue under long-term agreements. So potentially, all of our large customers are under long-term agreements in terms of purchases. And I have mentioned this in the past that these agreements were never structured to be take or pay agreements.\n\nthat our customers would buy the volume, come in the high water. It's more like very strong.\n\ngood level of planning between our customers and us to ensure that we are driving alignment between their demand, our supply, allocation of bids to different customers, different segments.\n\nand the mechanism to drive shared dynamics and different customers and different segments.\n\nSo our goal with these agreements is really to use these as a mechanism to drive the portfolio in the portfolio make.\n\nto where we want it to be. And we have mentioned in the past that our goal is to keep our supply-bit share consistent over time in both DRAM and NAND, and strive for a bigger and bigger portion of the industry profit pool through.\n\nmoves in our product portfolio and mix and that's where we have had\n\nTremendous success, not just in improving our product portfolio, but also using these agreements to drive our product portfolio mix into a place which gives us...\n\nbetter profitability and improved stability. One example is that in the\n\nAuto Industrial Networking Graphics Title Segment The\n\nmargins stability through the cycle is much better compared to other segments of the market. And so our goal has been to drive higher share in those segments and these long-term agreements become critical over time in driving that share. Now, that does not mean that we don't work with customers to have them purchased and that is consistent with these long-term agreements. Of course, we do.\n\nI think to be fair to our customers as well when you're kind of significant macro events occur It's not like You know that is feasible outcome\n\nSo I think we use these in a way that meets our old company goals in a very effective manner, recognizing what the limitations are of these agreements and what they are meant to do and what they are not meant to do. So hopefully that helps.\n\nThank you our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh, Mazar, your line is up.\n\nYeah, hi guys, just a quick question here. I know you mentioned inventories are high on PC handset and I think people are seeing that, but let me give us some, we have quantifying that, what are the inventory levels on the PC handset and on the cloud side now and versus what are normal levels?\n\nYeah, so I think in terms of the C and Smartphone.\n\nAnd then you look at Cloud, I think it's a generalized comment across the industry that\n\nas the industry over the last semiconductor industry and this goes beyond memory and storage. As the industry went through a significant shortage in semiconductors, definitely that was one driver of customers wanting to have higher levels of inventory. Another was all of the geopolitical risks in terms of impact reshapement.\n\nAnd then the last piece was shutdowns happening in different parts of the world due to COVID related.\n\nrestrictions being put by individual local and federal governments around the world. So all of these conspired to cause\n\ncustomers to feel like they need to have better level of inventory and customers who couldn't get to those inventory levels and one good example of automotive companies. You can see the significant impact on revenue that those segments and those companies have suffered as the result of not having adequate inventory. So I think across several segments\n\nhigher level of inventory than what existed pre-COVID. And the question is how will that trajectory of inventory in terms of weeks of sales change? Yes.\n\nespecially as the industry gets to a phase, the whole semiconductor industry gets to a phase where fewer and fewer components are in short supply. So I think that part is different customers and different parts of the market will make their own determination on these things.\n\nbut coming specifically to the PC and smartphone portion of the business, the volumes in each of these in terms of time for 22 are down to roughly 10%.\n\nfrom the expectations for 22 at the start of this calendar year.\n\nSo with that degradation and self-through expectations, obviously the...\n\ninventory levels consequently from a week's surface perspective appears even bigger. And so there is a need for that adjustment. So I think those were some of the\n\ncatalyst that created that impact on RQ4 and what we have projected for\n\nyou know, the rest of the calendar year, this year, in terms of when we expect the inventory collection to sort of play out in those seconds.\n\nGod is and so looks like you're talking more to a 10% discrepancy but and if you are you seeing a higher inventory level on the DRAM side or the NAND side if you can get a little bit of color around that and that's it. Thank you.\n\nSo, you know, just for clarity, right, that 10% was a number. It was the number of units.\n\nthat are lower in the TAM expectation for calendar 22 for PC and smartphone global unit sales versus expectations from six months ago. And the impact on our revenue, of course,\n\nis not just on the reduction and end demand self-rule, but also on top of that the inventory reduction. I just wanted to clarify that the inventory reduction is on top of the...\n\nreduction on the end market week. So I just I just want to make sure that it's not just\n\n10% is for the full year. Okay, the impact to us in the second half.\n\nmore. He said in the morning, well, that's a very good, very important point that for us, most of the impact of our full year is going to happen.\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Sydney Hall of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nHey, thanks. So in terms of the demand side of things, we talked a lot about PC smartphones, but you also make a comment that enterprise OEMs are adjusting the memory and storage inventory because of shortages in non-memory components and macro. Why don't we see if we can give us a little more color? And any president that you can point is to see how long this correction to play out and maybe the magnitude of those kind of adjustments in the past. And I'll have a follow-up question.\n\nYeah, I think the issue on that side is different than the issue on the PC and smartphone side. So whereas in PC and smartphones, the M demand trends are clearly weak and the cell...\n\nand there has been a substantial degradation in expectations for this year's time from six months ago to now. By contrast, the server business and the trends of end demand\n\nEven an enterprise over on our OEM customers in that space are held in.\n\nAnd our customers continue to report robust backlogs.\n\nand good server demand. I think the concern...\n\nSome of them are obviously data center, generally across cloud and enterprise and including small and medium businesses. The builds of servers are not being able to be completed to the extent of the end demand because of shortages of certain parts that are still persisting, including for example network interface cards as an as one example. And then there are others.\n\nSo that's one factor that's preventing them from completing builds and meeting end demands. And then the other factor is just the general cautiousness.\n\nthat is creeping in, driven by some of these macroeconomic factors. But we are trying to just be extremely transparent and lay out what we see and what we hear very openly.\n\nbecause that caution is happening, causing them to reduce some of their inventories or wanting to reduce their inventories.\n\nIn spite of at least today what is clearly robust demand on the end customer side.\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Maybe a follow-up question is, Mark, I wanted to elaborate on a comment earlier that he said, the Yon Fisco fourth quarter, that the planned inventory bill to be way on gross margin. But I thought it would actually help you gross margin because you keep your utilization highest and the current demand indicates.\n\nBut the other question I have is there a framework that we can use to help understand where close margin is going to bottom and when is the any kind of selection point we think about obviously pricing is a big factor here but are there things that are within your control what is technology transition or maybe utilization starts to improve? Thanks.\n\nYeah, there's no comment about the, or not guiding the quarter. Am I just a market commentary that the market's gotten weak and these conditions of the market will continue to weigh on margins. That was the only comment.\n\nnot a guide and I'm certainly not going to comment on the\n\nanything beyond that. It was more a comment on inventory in the market of the customer inventory adjustments and that environment continuing rather than anything about our inventory. Yes. Okay, that's clear. All right. Thanks.\n\nThank you. I have a question. It comes from Roger Gill of Needham & Company. Your question.\n\nYes, thank you. And this question is kind of a follow-up on the sequential decline. So if you look at the August decline, it's 17% down sequentially. That's the biggest decline sequentially for August in kind of recent.\n\nkind of company history and you talked about uh... you know and abrupt change to demand a considerable change in demand but i just wanted to see if you can compare and contrast with your scene with this level of abruption demand versus say when you know revenue decline pretty significantly back in ten of that boy of nineteen or may have nineteen when we're in the middle of the trade war with with china their sanctions against china\n\nIs it similar in terms of certain dynamics, in terms of a significant cut in inventory that you're seeing from your customers? Is it more concentrated? It seems to be more concentrated in mobile and PC versus say last time, but I'm just curious about how you're thinking about that. Because we've got a few of these of very abrupt macro impacts to demand.\n\nYeah, I mean, I think if we get the environment and I understand the desire to use the frambole from path\n\nfrom past declines. But if you look at 2019 environment, that was the time that we had been seeing some weeks just in the demand trend.\n\nseven or eight quarters of extraordinarily high increases in DRAM pricing that had caused DRAM margins to unsustainably high and the pricing to become unsustainably high due\n\nsignificant shortage in the market. So I think that environment was entirely different and the motivations of customers.\n\nand the actions of the customers was also pretty different. And so, each environment brings with it its own sets of unique issues. And so I think the way to think about the FQ4 number, yes, I mean definitely the environment wasn't quickly late in our FQ3. And we have had...\n\nPrimarily, the consumer portions of the market, the PT smartphone and consumer segments channel, et cetera, be the ones that are driving the lot of this weakness, especially in our...\n\nI will call out that within that context, you know, we spoke about in the Q&A in the earlier today, the impact of China has been pretty significant. The weakness in China is very pronounced.\n\nspoke about the project tree we were on, that we believe we were on a quarter ago, 4 FQ4 versus a current guide for China revenue. Our China revenue is down 30% approximately from that project tree to our latest forecast. And that itself has impacted our consolidated revenue by approximately 10%.\n\nSo very significant impact coming from China. And then of course, you know, we mentioned some inventory collection here and there in the other segments that we mentioned, not prepared remarks with endoplasalian. So that's sort of the...\n\nthe big picture that we just wanted to highlight. Now, like we said, every environment is different and how this plays out. You know, I'm sure you'll be watching for friends when other company's report to try and triangulate you know, where this is going.\n\nYeah, that's super helpful. And just to follow up on that, sizing up the China impact was important to understand that. Any kind of fresh data points or insights now that China has reversed all of the data.\n\nBecause this appears to be primarily a China lockdown since which combined with some of the other factors you talked about, but the China lockdown's reverse.\n\nAre there any indications of that region is stabilizing or is it still to be determined?\n\nI think the recent data points from the last month on smartphone sales in China still continue to be pretty weak.\n\nSo a lot of the consumer spending remains to be seen how it actually starts to improve towards electronics and those types of items versus...\n\nyou know, pent up demand for travel and things like that. So it's not just about the overall consumer spending. It's also about the categories of those spending. Their consumers are choosing to shift their dollars. You know, a lot of inflation out there, just like everywhere else. So I think there is a lot of that, but also just keep in mind that the China economy and its weakness\n\nyou know, was lot more pronounced than most parts of the world and did proliferate beyond just the consumer segment of the market, right? So the weakness in China was a broader economic weakness when the shutdown just shut down all economic activity, right? Much of the economic activity gets shut down. And so that has been pretty damaging. And even though everyone thought of\n\nintellectually knows and understands that that is happening. You know, this is probably one of the first few data points to understand the magnitude of some of these impacts.\n\nThank you for your next question comes from Nick Kodarov of Longbow Research. Your line is old.\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Two questions on inventory, and that summit you touched on one of them. When you speak to your customers in those conversations, where are they trying to land in terms of inventory on their shelves? Do you anticipate the inventory downstream to normalize to pre-COVID levels or you think there's gonna be a new normal?\n\nWe think that the inventory will normalize\n\nto a level that is higher than where the pre-COVID levels were. I don't think enough distance has been put between the shortages and, you know,\n\nThe experiences and memories are still very raw at that time. So I would be surprised as the inventories went all the way down to pre-COVID levels.\n\nThere is still uncertainty around, for example, China's COVID, zero COVID policies, and what that means in case more COVID cases come up in different parts of China. So those kind of uncertainties will probably cause customers to have...\n\nEven after they rationalize the inventory, a higher level of stable base, at least in the near term to medium term, compared to pre-COVID levels at a little bit higher levels.\n\nHow all of this transpires? I mean, this is just something we'll have to see. We're working very closely with customers. And as things improve, you know, sell through, improve over time. China may decide to...\n\nstimulate the economy in a significant way and you know that can improve and demand so those kind of trends Then can quickly eat up the inventory once the cell through improves right so\n\nThese are all very dynamic numbers. They have their individual weeks of sales targets, but then the absolute value of the inventory is heavily determined by the trajectory of the future sales expectations. And that's really where...\n\nyou know, change in that trajectory improvement in expectations of future sales can quickly cause things to improve. But again, you know, there is the environment of the macroeconomic weakness that everyone focused on. So it will take some time.\n\nYeah, it makes sense. And second question is, can you talk about the inventory levels between DRM and NAND, maybe both internally in the channel and the customers? Are there any meaningful differences between...\n\nI mean our inventory levels are higher in NAND than in DRAM.\n\nSo I think if you look at the impact in terms of the dam, on all of these changes in unit forecast for PC smartphones, consumer markets, obviously that's being felt in both DRAM and NAND markets.\n\nbut internally our own inventory is lower in the data.\n\nOkay, and then customers is it fairly similar or is you think that there's more than that again?\n\nI can't see too many differences between DRAM and NAND when customers go into this inventory reduction mode. They tend to reduce all semiconductor inventory of parts that they feel are readily available. So when different parts, even beyond memory and storage, are not in shortage across the semiconductor space, they tend to.\n\ngo up and down sort of in a similar trajectory. Now the inventory of products as customers may be at different levels. Different customers may have different levels of inventory of different semiconductor products, but.\n\nGenerally when they're going to inventory reduction mode, it's pretty broad-based approach.\n\nNext question comes from Timothy, our Curie of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBye thanks. I just wanted to go back to this issue of LTAs.\n\nAnd I guess I'm a little surprised that customers would be able to reduce demand this quickly unless you're getting something out of it. I mean, I certainly understand that it provides you visibility and it helps you plan cat-back.\n\nBut is there something that you were in a better position today versus if this same thing happened three or so years ago when you had less on LTA? Are you selling at a higher price? Maybe in August than you otherwise would have if you didn't have these LTAs. I'm just trying to, because people will say, well, what good are these LTAs if customers can stop buying to this magnitude? And then I had a second question.\n\nSure, I mean, I think if you look at customers in the past, going back five years.\n\nThere would be situations where customers would not be very clear or specific as to how much they intend to purchase from each of the suppliers. And the end result could, in many cases, be that the amount of\n\nthe suppliers are targeting to produce for any given customer is 10 or 120% of the customer's time.\n\nSo, you know, when there are these health issues that are used pretty pervasively in the industry now, it definitely helps to rationalize and bring supply and demand into a better balance from a planning perspective.\n\nAnd the reason I say from a planning perspective is of course actual can deviate from plans when the kind of macro events occur. But when they occur and you know these LTS provide us with a very good basis to better understand how our customers are thinking. How do you say about the next quarter, you decide what to do?\n\nIt just gives us a mechanism to have a dialogue for longer visibility into how they expect things to proceed. And as you can expect, when we think about our own supply.\n\nWe think about making changes to our CAPX plans or supply plans. Any changes that we make have an impact several months out. Right now these cycle times are pretty long. And consequently, you know, we...\n\nlonger views from our customers in order to understand exactly how best to create a better balance between supply and demand in the industry. So I understand you're concerned that okay if they're not going to buy based on the LTA volume what good are these LTAs and you know we have repeatedly said that these LTAs are never meant to be takeoff here agreements. That was not the goal for which they were set up.\n\nAnd there is no pricing in these agreements either. They're more of volume-based agreement and the prices negotiated every quarter or every month depending on.\n\nwhat kind of customer arrangements there are. And so, I think the way to think about it is, it's a very useful mechanism to drive alignment between supply and demand over the medium term.\n\nto drive portfolio direction share gain and things of that nature and reduce You know and the parent level of\n\nCustom suppliers targeting 100, 10, 120% of a customer's hand because the customer will have LTS with pretty much all the suppliers. So more difficult to do that on a normal environment.\n\nCan I just follow up on that? So in this case, if a PC and a smartphone customer is taking this down by, I mean, it has to be at least 40, 50% sequentially. If they're doing that, they pay the exact same price that they would have if they took what they said they would. There's not even like a little bit of a price kicker you get if they, you know, this they have 40, 50% sequentially for a customer.\n\nWell, there are things that happen on the pricing front which I can't get into.\n\nBut those are all things that we discussed with customers based on what their needs are and how it deviates from the LTA and so on. So what exactly do we do with these customers when those kind of situations occur? I'm not at liberty to discuss.\n\nin this call. But clearly the intent is that\n\nIf there are things that are happening that are outside the control of our own customers\n\nyou know, we work with them to come to a resolution that both sides can feel good about. So that's what we do. So the details of that and how it changes with price, et cetera, is not something I can address.\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference.\n\nThank you for participating. You may now dis-\n\nThe what.\n\nReally.\n\nThank you for standing by and welcome to Micron Technologies, fiscal 3rd quarter, 2022, post earnings analyst call. After the speaker presentation, there will be a Q&A session to ask a question, press star one, and you're touched on telephone. I would now like to hand the call over to Fahann Ahmad, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nThank you, Lapis. Welcome to my phone technologies, fiscal third quarter, 2022, self-side, annual, or back. On the call with me today, our Sumit Fadhana, our chief business partner.\n\nManish Pachya, our EVP of Global Operations and Mark Murphy, RCA4.\n\nAs a reminder, the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements regarding market demand and supply are expected results in other matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to defer materially from the statements made today.\n\nWe refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, specifically as most recent form 10K and 10Q for a discussion of the risks that may affect our future results. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. But if you can now open the call for Q&O.\n\nYes sir, again to ask a question please press star one at this time. Our first question comes from Tom O'Malley, a Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the long term, the long term through cycle model, you guys laid out 30% from an operating margin perspective.\n\nI understand that there are some China headwinds that are impacting that. I think are slightly more exacerbating this down cycle, but you're already in the guidance moving below that 30%. And it sounds like there may be some more weakening to come. Can you just talk to, if you think that 30% is still viable, now that you've seen these cuts, and just any of the moving parts is to how you think that that can sustain through a cycle.\n\nTommy Mark, I'll start. I mean, it is a through-spycle model. So it's not intended to be a floor, it's not intended to be any point in time. So I think that, you know, I think the way to look at it is we're not gonna, base any given quarter on where it stands relative to the long-term model because there are a lot of conditions that impact obviously the short-term results.\n\nYou know, we are in or we have in our depurion year where the market we can considerably in a very short period of time. And we're just...\n\nyou know we've we've given a force corridor reflect the best view we have at the moment and and well well update through the court\n\nI appreciate it. And then my follow-up is just on the cost side, going into the quarter, you guys had talked about just limited cost reductions in both DRM and NAND. If you just give any color on just a reported quarter on how cost kind of shook out between the two buckets.\n\nYeah, well, we do expect for the full year for our cost to still outpace industry costs, but in the third and the fourth quarter improvements have been flatish. A little bit better on the front end because...\n\nthe leading node activities and those benefits. Little bit of inflation or inflation, but that inflation's more manifest on the backend where...\n\nand the net is that we end up with basically flatish\n\ncosts down and third, fourth quarter. Long term, we're still playing to be in line.\n\nindustry cost. And I'll just come. I'll just add in there that a lot of that has the\n\nreported COGS, obviously we have a lot of mixed adjustments. So when we have strong growth, record, quarter and SSDs.\n\nWe have strong growth in some of these high-value solutions. Obviously the COG number is mixed-adjusted, but when we talk about outperforming the industry in terms of cost reduction for the year, we're talking about at the memory level where our technology leadership in one alpha and 176 layer have allowed us to outpace the industries this year and perform well at the front end level.\n\nBut obviously, moving towards high-value solutions and as that happens over the last quarter and this next quarter, those are...\n\nyou know, impacting the all-in cost, but obviously providing higher margin as well, for higher price.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore, Morgan Stanley . Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could quantify it all the impact of the supply reduction that you guys are looking to do, that the utilization impact of that. And I guess, is it, can you compare it to what you did in 2019? Do you think it's something similar to that? More significant than that, less significant than that? Just any color of your health.\n\nSure, I go. So, you know, we're still evaluating, you know, what we will finally do. I think what was important for us to give guidance and clarity to everyone on was that we are reducing WSE. And you know, that will have impact on supply big growth for both DRAM and NAND from our prior levels.\n\nlungs, people in can\n\nAnd at this time, not really ready to compare it, we're still working to finalize what our plans are. As we mentioned, we're going to have a combination of trying to manage Chapex.\n\nManage utilization, particularly for some of our legacy nodes and take a look at maybe less cost-effective nodes, how we can optimize those, how we can optimize the manufacturing footprint space as we condition to more advanced nodes. We're gonna be ramping our one data and 232 technologies. We think it's very important to make sure that we continue to maintain leadership and launch those technologies so that we can have the product portfolio benefits from those as well as the cost benefits from those.\n\nAnd then the other piece of course is managing inventory as Mark was talking about on the call. So we'll kind of look at all those areas together to be able to determine what the right mix of supply big growth, you know, capex utilization and inventory and cost reduction is for next year. And we'll provide more color I think on the next call.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tashiyahari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nGreat, thank you. I have one quick clarification, then one quick question. On the clarification for the fiscal Q4 guide, based on your commentary, it seems like the sequential decline in revenue that's mostly coming from bits and pricing is perhaps down low singles or something like that based on sort of the strategy that you're taking. Is that a fair assumption?\n\nYeah, if you do the math on things, you'll see that volumes roughly two thirds sequential.\n\nGot it. And then as my question, this one for you as well, probably Mark, on OpEx, you talked about some of the initiatives having a bigger impact in fiscal 23.\n\nI guess last time you were kind of in the zip code from a revenue perspective, OpEx was kind of in the low 800 millions of dollars and I realized there's been broad-based inflation, but how should we think about OpEx in the early part of fiscal 23 as you guys select down?\n\nYeah, you know, you can back into OptX long-term as a percentage sales through the model. I won't give you a number for OptX in 23 because we haven't done our plans. We'll give guidance on that at a future call. I think the comments today were meant to reflect that, you know, it is an invite.\n\nchange very quickly and the demand environments weakened and we've responded quickly.\n\nacross all major areas that spend and we are, you know, the op-x number is...\n\ndown from what it was in our original forecast here.\n\nSo that gives you a sense of we're already dealing with it. And our expectation is that as the market outlook becomes clear, we will adjust our off-expend appropriately.\n\nIt's not a, this isn't a, a company's in great position of leadership across technology products and manufacturing. So this is not a, you know, take a sledgehammer.\n\nyou know, op-ex, it's a scalpel exercise and we work to get op-ex down and an appropriate level for the conditions of the business.\n\nMark's are just to be clear the sequential increase in op-ex this quarter that's just timing of Qualls as you guys noted on the call\n\nYeah, we had in the third quarter, the OpEx was low, was actually about 100 million off of the, I think the guidance and two major drivers. One, product and technology spend, as you talk about. That was actually,\n\nNot due to, for fewer programs, it was due to actually very good performance and fewer wafers required for technology qualification. That was the largest part of the variance. The next was just, as you can imagine, our forecast came way down. So the incentive comp was adjusted and since we're this far in the year, it was a sizable, you know, a cruel adjustment. So those two things were drivers.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of course, those benefits.\n\nbecome headwinds for the fourth course or kind of back up to this level yeah just over a billion\n\nand sort of makes it look like more of a sequential decline in reality it is and we'll just continue to work it in a disciplined way from here.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nYeah, I wanted to just follow up on prior question around cost downs and whether you're contemplating any material kind of change to utilization rates and how we should think about that impacting cost downs, you know, the common quarters.\n\nHi, CJ. So we are evaluating, I think as I said, we are evaluating utilization. I would say that we're really having technology leadership. We definitely believe that the inventory at the leading edge that we're generating is very cost effective relative to the rest of the industry, relative to even what will be available for us in future quarters. So we're really on the utilization front focus on thinking about optimizing older nodes, like if he nodes.\n\nYou know, of course, keeping in mind the legacy demand that we have for certain customers as well. But it's not as if I think we're at a position where on the leading edge we're going to be making, you know,\n\nsignificant action, for drastic action. And then, you know, and I, as I mentioned before, when,",
    "content2": "previously went to the show or Tom had asked about this. You know, we're still planning on ramping our one beta in two, three, two technologies later this year. We think it's very important that we maintain that technology cadence and the learning and drive the adoption of those technologies and that'll happen in just a year, 23 years.\n\nWe're helpful and I guess it's just quick follow up. Are there any targets you have for inventory that you can share with us and what kind of time print?\n\nYou know, we can provide as the previous level of discomfort target, I guess, maybe you call it. I think we'd like to keep it below 150 days. We do think it'll go up in the...\n\nIt will go up in the fourth quarter on DIO. I think it gave a number of a couple of weeks. And we'll just have to see where it goes from there. That's a function of market conditions, as you know.\n\nThank you. Next question comes from Serini Pajuri of SMBC Nico. Your line is open.\n\nThank you, a couple for me as well. First on the PC and smartphone, the weakness, you know, you talked about inventory correction. Just curious, I mean, do you think it's a one quarter event, meaning do you think the inventories, you know, will, customers will normalize, you know, after this quarter, or do you see, you know, further, you know, potential for kind of a correction, going forward, assuming that, you know, demand kind of stabilizes here, then I have a follow-up.\n\nTypically, we see that in any given segment when customers start to correct inventory, it is a couple of quarters.\n\nBoth of us are able to get down to their own internal target levels of inventory. That of course assumes a critically booked macroeconomic environment and demand trends in their own segment.\n\nAnd so obviously, you know, there is concern about the trajectory of the macroeconomic environment. So that can further create another vector of uncertainty that has to be dealt with. But typically it takes a couple of quarters for the inventory to get normalized.\n\nAnd we're talking both PC and smartphone submit that started this quarter. So we're talking to quarters basically from current quarter. Yeah, I mean, that's the reason we said that, you know, we see this playing out sort of in the second half of calendar 22 as the biggest portion of the impact of the load cell-through rates in the end markets in those segments as well as the inventory correct.\n\nOkay, got it. And then on your own balance sheet inventory, Mark, you know, you talked about 150 is kind of, you know, where.\n\nYou'll start getting uncomfortable. But if I look at your historic inventory, I think it peaked out around one in a 30s and a mid one 30s. So I'm just curious.\n\nwhat changed in the last year or two that you are more comfortable even at 150? Why is that level gone higher? The other side of the question is that you did say that you want...\n\nyou're going to maintain pricing discipline and also use your inventory to kind of supply into the market next year. So I guess at some point the inventory will come down as you lower your production growth.\n\nWhat is the minimum level that you're comfortable? I mean, I'm looking at I guess, you know, a few quarters ago, you're in the low 90s. I'm just curious, you know, what is the minimum level that you're comfortable? When you have to wrap, you know, production again, at what level?\n\nYeah, so there was no news today on the call. Actually, it was more validation of ranges that had been set before. I did comment on, you know, there's some headwinds in the sense of, on DIO around more complex processing and, you know, that the cycle time in the fab would be longer and more with. There's more complex modules and there's the associate components with those.\n\nassembly times and so forth. So I think all that.\n\nis a headwind but at the same time uh... you know the team doing a lot of things are offset those and so i was\n\nvalidating that the number that we've provided before of about 150 is a maximum level. Normal levels have also been talked about before around 100 days. The number that you cited in low 90s is a level that we would view as good, lean inventory levels for our business.\n\nOkay, I'll just add one comment there, just three needs to come in. These things, we always hard, the trend in the industry, and it doesn't matter whether you look the logic into subject side or you look at memory. The trend is longer and longer, processing time and cycle time in the fab, right? So that's more of fab way.\n\nFor us, specifically then, you add in the fact that we're transforming more of our business and, in general, more industry demand moving towards high-value solutions like FSDs, like data center DRM modules. These things have longer cycle time in the back end, as well as more component inventory required to be held for the back end as well. So when you think about all of those things, all of these...\n\nWhether you're talking about the lean inventory range or the max comfortable inventory range, those are things that generally across this industry has technology become more complex and products become more complex, we're gonna continue to keep going up.\n\nI mean the other thing just to keep in mind and we talked about this at our investor days, one of the trends in the industry over the last several years now against speaking about memory that's helpful to allow us to hold more injuries across the clients are lower. Now then they were a decade ago from technology transition. So\n\nThat's another one of the areas where we're able to hold more inventory because we have very good cost effective inventory, especially being at the leading edge now at the industry. And we expect that inventory to continue to be cost effective through the next period while we're working down our inventory.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Fox of Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nThanks. Good afternoon. Two questions first. On the Gross Margin Guidance for the Quarter, I think your your guiding down about 500 basis points roughly quarter over quarter. Can you sort of break that out between, I assume a bulk of that is just sheer volume, both anything you can provide color on how much is related to mix, pricing, et cetera. And then I had to follow up.\n\nYeah, I won't go into the details, but the sequential decline third to fourth is just driven by market trends or dynamics in the market.\n\nYeah, the second quarter, the third quarter, was driven by a higher mix of man, that decline.\n\ntheir quarter effect from second quarter. Yeah, I got that. And then I would just, I would just, I'm sorry, just one thing to add. So, you know, beyond the fourth quarter.\n\nAs we've talked about, as these inventories are elevated and the market works through this period, we would expect that to weigh on gross margins. So I just want to make sure that's clear.\n\nThat's helpful. And then just on the long term agreement, so I mean, I understand this is unusual times, but I mean, you just spent the last several quarters putting some long term agreements into place and they seem as soon as things got tough to unraveled a bit. So I guess you would kind of, it sounded like you were kind of describing some benefits that are still coming through from the long term agreements, even as demand slows here. I'm just not clear on what those are. So can you maybe talk to the, I guess that comment and the question. I just have to put it in.\n\nSo in terms of the long-term agreement, you know, we...\n\nWe have been working on these for several years, used to be just over 10% of our revenue under long-term agreements five years ago and it's now 75% of our revenue under long-term agreements. So potentially, all of our large customers are under long-term agreements in terms of purchases. And I have mentioned this in the past that these agreements were never structured to be take or pay agreements.\n\nthat our customers would buy the volume, come, come, Hello high water. It's more like very strong.\n\nYou know, good level of planning between our customers and us to ensure that we are driving alignment between their demand or supply allocation of this to different customers, different segments.\n\nand the mechanism to drive shared dynamics and different customers and different segments.\n\nSo our goal with these agreements is really to use these as a mechanism to drive the portfolio of your mine.\n\nto where we want it to be. And we have mentioned in the past that our goal is to keep our supply-bit share consistent over time in both DRAM and NAND, and strive for a bigger and bigger portion of the industry profit pool through...\n\nmoves in our product portfolio and mix and that's where we have had\n\nRemend the success not just in improving our product portfolio, but also using these agreements to drive our product portfolio mix into a place which gives us\n\nbetter profitability and improved stability. One example is that in the\n\nAuto Industrial Networking Graphics Title Segment The\n\nmargins stability through the cycle is much better compared to other segments of the market. And so our goal has been to drive higher share in those segments and these long-term agreements become critical over time in driving that share. Now that does not mean that we don't work with customers to have them purchase that is consistent with these long-term agreements. Of course we do.\n\nI think to be fair to our customers as well when you kind of significant macro events occur. It's not like, you know, that is feasible outcome.\n\nSo I think we use these in a way that meets our old company goals in a very effective manner, recognizing what the limitations are of these agreements and what they are meant to do and what they are not meant to do. So hopefully that helps.\n\nThank you our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh, Mazzouha, your line is up.\n\nYeah, hi guys, just a quick question here. I know you mentioned inventories are high on PC handsets and I think people are seeing that, but let me give us some, we have quantifying that what are the inventory levels on the PC handset and on the cloud side now and versus what are normal levels.\n\nYeah, so I think in terms of VC and smartphone\n\nAnd then you look at Cloud, I think it's a generalized comment across the industry that\n\nas the industry over the last semiconductor industry and this goes beyond memory and storage. As the industry went through a significant shortage in semiconductors, definitely that was one driver of customers wanting to have higher levels of inventory. Another was all of the geopolitical risks in terms of impact reshapement.\n\nAnd then the last piece was shutdowns happening in different parts of the world due to COVID related.\n\nrestrictions being put by individual local and federal governments around the world. So all of these conspired to cause\n\ncustomers to feel like they need to have better level of inventory and customers who couldn't get to those inventory levels and one good example of automotive companies. You can see the significant impact on revenue that those segments and those companies have suffered as a result of not having adequate inventory. So I think across several segments.\n\nhigher level of inventory than what existed pre-COVID. And the question is how will that trajectory of inventory in terms of weeks or sales change?\n\nespecially as the industry gets to a phase, the whole semiconductor industry gets to a phase where fewer and fewer components are in short supply. So I think that part is different customers and different parts of the market will make their own determination on these things.\n\nbut coming specifically to the PC and smartphone portion of the business, the volumes in each of these in terms of time for 22 are down to roughly 10%.\n\nfrom the expectations for 22 at the start of this calendar year.\n\nSo with that degradation and self-through expectations, obviously the...\n\ninventory levels consequently from a week. So sales perspective appears even bigger. And so there is a need for that adjustment. So I think those were some of the\n\ncatalyst that created that impact on RQ4 and what we have projected for\n\nyou know, the rest of the calendar year, this year, in terms of when we expect the inventory correction to sort of play out in those seconds.\n\nGod is and so looks like you're talking more to a 10% discrepancy but and if you are you seeing a higher inventory level on the DRAM side or the NAND side if you can get a little bit of color around that and that's it. Thank you.\n\nSo, you know, just for clarity, right? That 10% was a number. It was the number of units.\n\nthat are lower in the TAM expectation for calendar 22 for PC and smartphone global unit sales versus expectations from six months ago. And the impact on our revenue, of course,\n\nis not just on the reduction and end demand self-rule, but also on top of that the inventory reduction. I just wanted to clarify that the inventory reduction is on top of the...\n\nreduction on the end market week. So I just I just I just want to make sure that it's not just\n\n10% is for the full year. Okay, the impact to us in the second half.\n\nThat's a very good, very important point that for us most of the impact of our full year is going to happen.\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Sydney Hall of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nHey, thanks. So in terms of the demand side of things, we talked a lot about PC smartphones, but you also make a comment that enterprise OEMs are adjusting the memory and storage inventory because of shortages in memory components and macro. Why don't we see if you can give us a little more color? And any president that you can point is to see how long this correction to play out and maybe the magnitude of those kind of adjustments in the past. And I'll have a follow-up question.\n\nYeah, I think the issue on that side is different than the issue on the PC and smartphone side. So whereas in PC and smartphones, the MDM trends are clearly weak and the cell...\n\nand there has been a substantial degradation in expectations for this year's time from six months ago to now. By contrast, the server business and the trends of end demand\n\nEven an enterprise server on our OEM customers in that space are held in.\n\nand our customers continue to report robust backlogs.\n\nand good, good forward to man. I think the concern...\n\nSome of them are obviously data center, generally across cloud and enterprise, and including small and medium businesses. The builds of servers are not being able to be completed to the extent of the end demand because of shortages of certain parts that are still persisting, including, for example, network interface cards as an as one example. And then there are others.\n\nSo that's one factor that's preventing them from completing builds and meeting end demands. And then the other factor is just the general cautiousness.\n\nthat is creeping in, driven by some of these macroeconomic factors. But we are trying to just be extremely transparent and lay out what we see and what we hear very openly.\n\nbecause that caution is happening, causing them to reduce some of their inventories or wanting to reduce their inventories.\n\nin spite of, at least today, what is clearly robust demand on the end customer side.\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Maybe a follow-up question is, Mark, I want to elaborate on a comment earlier that he said beyond fiscal fourth quarter, that the planned inventory bill to be way on gross margin. But I thought it would actually help you, gross margin because you keep your utilization highest and the current demand indicates.\n\nBut the other question I have is there a framework that we can use to help understand where gross margin is going to bottom and when is the any kind of selection point we think about obviously pricing is a big factor here. But are there things that are within your control what is technology transition or maybe utilization starts to improve? Thanks.\n\nYeah, there's no comment about the, or not guiding the quarter. Am I just a market commentary that the market's gotten weak and these conditions of the market will continue to weigh on margins. That was the only comment.\n\nnot a guide and I'm certainly not going to comment on the S.\n\nanything beyond that. It was more a comment on inventory in the market of the customer inventory adjustments and that environment continuing rather than anything about our inventory. Yes. Okay, that's clear. All right, thanks.\n\nThank you. I next question comes from Rajee Gil of Needham and Company. Your question.\n\nYes, thank you. And this question is kind of a follow-up on the sequential decline. So if you look at the August decline, it's 17% down sequentially. That's the biggest decline sequentially for August in kind of recent.\n\nkind of company history and you talked about uh... you know and abrupt change to demand a considerable change in demand but i just wanted to see if you can compare and contrast with your scene with this level of abruption demand versus a when you know revenue decline pretty significantly back in kind of that boy of nineteen or may have nineteen when we're in the middle of the trade war with with china their sanctions against china\n\nIs it similar in terms of certain dynamics, in terms of significant cut inventory that you think from your customers, is it more concentrated? It seems to be more concentrated in mobile and PC, versus say last time, but I'm just curious how you're thinking about that. Because we've got a few of these of very abrupt macro impacts to demand.\n\nYeah, I mean, I think if we detect the environment and I understand the desire to use the flamble from past.\n\nfrom past declines. But if you look at 2019 environment, that was the time that we had seen some wishes in the demand trend on...\n\nseven or eight quarters of extraordinarily high increases in DRAM pricing that had caused DRAM margins to unsustainably high and the pricing to become unsustainably high due\n\nsignificant shortage in the market. So I think that environment was entirely different and the motivations of customers.\n\nand the actions of the customers was also pretty different. And so, each environment brings with it its own sets of unique issues. And so I think the way to think about the FQ4 number, yes, I mean, definitely the environment wasn't quickly laid in our FQ3. And we have had,\n\nPrimarily, the consumer portions of the market, the BT smartphone and consumer segments channel, et cetera, be the ones that are driving the Lord of this weakness, especially in our actual...\n\nI will call out that within that context, you know, we spoke about in the Q&A in the earlier today, the impact of China has been pretty significant. The weakness in China is very pronounced.\n\nspoke about the trajectory we were on, that we believe we were on a quarter of a row, 4FQ4 versus a current guide for China revenue. Our China revenue is down 30% approximately from that trajectory to our latest forecast. And that itself has impacted our consolidated revenue by approximately 10%.\n\nSo very significant impact coming from China. And then of course, you know, we mentioned some inventory collection here and there in the other segments that we mentioned, not prepared remarks with endoplasalian. So that's sort of the\n\nthe big picture that we just wanted to highlight now. Now, like we said, every environment is different and how this plays out. I'm sure you'll be watching for friends when other company's report to try and triangulate where this is going.\n\nYeah, that's super helpful. And just to follow up on that, sizing up the China impact was important to understand that. Any kind of fresh data points or insights now that China has reversed all of that.\n\nBecause this appears to be primarily a China lockdown situation combined with some of the other factors you talked about but the China lockdown's reverse\n\nAre there any indications of that region that if stabilized, New Yorkers are still to be determined?\n\nI think the recent data points from the last month on smartphone sales in China still continue to be pretty weak.\n\nAnd so a lot of the consumer spending remains to be seen how it actually starts to improve towards electronics and those types of items versus...\n\nyou know, pent up demand for travel and things like that. So it's not just about the overall consumer spending. It's also about the categories of those spending. Their consumers are choosing to shift their dollars. You know, a lot of inflation out there, just like everywhere else. So I think there is a lot of that, but also just keep in mind that the China economy and its weakness.\n\nyou know, was lot more pronounced than most parts of the world and did proliferate beyond just the consumer segment of the market, right? So the weakness in China was a broader economic weakness when the shutdown just shut down all economic activity, right? Much of the economic activity gets shut down. And so that has been pretty damaging. And even though everyone thought of\n\nintellectually knows and understands that that is happening, this is probably one of the first few data points to understand the magnitude of some of these impacts.\n\nThank you. Next question comes from Nick Kodarov of Longbow Research. Your line is old.\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Two questions on inventory, and then some of you touched on one of them. When you speak to your customers in those conversations, where are they trying to land in terms of inventory on their shelves? Do you anticipate the inventory downstream to normalize to pre-COVID levels or you think there's gonna be a new normal?\n\nWe think that the inventory will normalize\n\nto a level that is higher than where the pre-COVID levels were. I don't think enough distance has been put between the shortages and, you know,\n\nThe experiences and memories are still very raw at that time. So I would be surprised as the inventories went all the way down to pre-COVID levels.\n\nThere is still uncertainty around, for example, China's COVID, zero COVID policies, and what that means in case more COVID cases come up in different parts of China. So those kind of uncertainties will probably cause customers to have...\n\nEven after they rationalize the inventory, a higher level of stable base, at least in the near term to medium term, compared to pre-COVID levels at a little bit higher levels.\n\nHow all of this transpires? I mean, this is just something we'll have to see. We're working very closely with customers. And as things improve, you know, sell through, improve over time. In China, may decide to...\n\nstimulate the economy in a significant way and you know that can improve and demand so those kind of trends Then can quickly eat up the inventory once the cell through improves right so\n\nThese are all very dynamic numbers. They have their individual weeks of sales targets, but then the absolute value of the inventory is heavily determined by the trajectory of the future sales expectations. And that's really where...\n\nyou know, change in that trajectory improvement in expectations of future sales can quickly cause things to improve. But again, you know, there is the environment of the macroeconomic weakness that everyone focused on. So it will take some time.\n\nYeah, it makes sense. And second question is, can you talk about the inventory levels between DRM and NAND, maybe both internally in the channel and customers? Are there any meaningful differences between...\n\nI mean our inventory levels are higher than NAND than in DRAM.\n\nSo I think if you look at the impact in terms of the TAM, on all of these changes in unit forecast for PC smartphones, consumer markets, obviously that's being felt in both DRAM and Man Market.\n\nbut internally our own inventory is lower in the data.\n\nAnd then the customers is it fairly similar or is you think that there's more than and again?\n\nI can't see too many differences between DRAM and NAND when customers go into this inventory reduction mode, they tend to reduce all semiconductor inventory of parts that they feel are readily available. So when different parts, even beyond memory and storage, are not in shortage across the semiconductor space, they tend to...\n\ngo up and down in a similar trajectory. Now, the inventory of products at customers may be at different levels. Different customers may have different levels of inventory of different semiconductor products. Butiggiofoid, as individual users, the utility of the equipment could be built against different user interfaces and AC, as individual users are very grateful for their awesome power of\n\nGenerally when they're going to inventory reduction mode, it's pretty broad based approach.\n\nNext question comes from Timothy, our Curie of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, thanks. I just wanted to go back to this issue of LTAs.\n\nAnd I guess I'm a little surprised that customers would be able to reduce demand this quickly unless you're getting something out of it. I mean, I certainly understand that it provides you the visibility and a healthy plan, CapEx.\n\nBut is there something that you were in a better position today versus if this same thing happened three or so years ago when you had less on LTA? Are you selling at a higher price? Maybe in August than you otherwise would have if you didn't have these LTAs. I'm just trying to, because people will say, well, what good are these LTAs if customers can stop buying to this magnitude? And then I had a second question.\n\nSure, I mean, I think if you look at customers in the past, going back five years.\n\nThere would be situations where customers would not be very clear or specific as to how much they intend to purchase from each of the suppliers. And the end result could in many cases be that the amount of\n\nthe suppliers are targeting to produce for any given customer is 10 or 120% of their customers.\n\nSo, you know, when there are these health issues that are used pretty pervasively in the industry now, it definitely helps to rationalize and bring supply and demand into a better balance from a planning perspective.\n\nAnd the reason I say from a planning perspective is, of course, actual scan DVAs from plans when these kinds of macro events occur. But when they occur, and these LTS provide us with a very good basis to better understand how our customers are thinking, what is about the next quarter, but about multiple.\n\nIt just gives us a mechanism to have a dialogue for longer visibility into how they expect things to proceed. And as you can expect, when we think about our own supply.\n\nWe think about making changes to our CAPX plans or supply plans. Any changes that we make have an impact several months out. Right now these cycle times are pretty long. And consequently, you know, we...\n\nlonger views from our customers in order to understand exactly how best to create a better balance between supply and demand in the industry. Understand, you're concerned that if they're not going to buy based on the LTA, volume, what good are these LTAs? And we have repeatedly said that these LTAs are never meant to be take-off agreements. That was not the goal for which they were set up.\n\nAnd there is no pricing in these agreements either. They're more of volume-based agreement and the price is negotiated every quarter or every month depending on.\n\nyou know, what kind of customer arrangements there are. And so, you know, I think the way to think about it is, it's a very useful mechanism to drive alignment between supply and demand over the medium term.\n\nto drive portfolio direction share gain and things of that nature and reduce You know and the parent level of\n\nCustom suppliers targeting 100, 10, 120% of a customer's hand because the customer will have LTS with pretty much all the suppliers. So more difficult to do that on a normal environment.\n\nCan I just follow up on that? So in this case, if a PC and a smartphone customer is taking bits down by, I mean, the equity at least 40, 50% sequentially. If they're doing that, they pay the exact same price that they would have if they took what they said they would. There's not even like a little bit of a price kicker you get if they're down 40, 50% sequentially for a customer.\n\nWell, there are things that happen on the pricing fund which I can't get into.\n\nBut those are all things that we discussed with customers based on what their needs are and how it deviates from the LPA and so on. So what exactly do we do with these customers when those kind of situations occur? I'm not at liberty to discuss.\n\nand just call. But clearly the intent is that\n\nIf there are things that are happening that are outside the control of our own customers\n\nyou know, we work with them to come to a resolution that both sides can feel good about. So that's what we do. So the details of that and how it changes with price, et cetera, is not something I can address.\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference.\n\nThank you for participating. You may now dis-"

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered record quarterly revenue with strong profitability and free cash flow, enabled by our team's excellent execution and our industry-leading technology and product portfolio. Micron achieved revenue records in the auto, industrial and networking markets and in SSDs for both data center and client. Our NAND business delivered record quarterly revenue and our embedded business unit and storage business unit, NAND revenues also hit all-time highs.\nOur 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND ramps are several quarters ahead of the industry and progressing well as we continue to qualify new products that use these nodes. The Micron team delivered these excellent results despite supply chain challenges and COVID-19 control measures in China, which impacted our business on both the demand side and the supply side.\nThere are consumer demand and inventory-related headwinds impacting the industry and consequently, our fiscal Q4 outlook. However, we remain confident about the secular demand for memory and storage, the attractiveness of our market opportunity, Micron's excellent competitive position and strong execution capabilities and our cross-cycle financial model.\nMicron is leading the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology, and we are also well poised to continue this lead into calendar 2023. In DRAM, our 1-alpha node DRAM is several quarters ahead of the industry. And in fiscal Q3, 1-alpha represented the largest DRAM node in our shipment mix. Our newest node, 1-beta is on track to ramp in manufacturing by the end of calendar 2022.\nIn NAND, our industry-leading 176-layer node continues to grow and mix of sales, having previously reached the majority of our NAND bit shipments in fiscal Q2. This technology node is contributing to a competitive cost structure across our product portfolio. And in FQ3, we achieved several important 176-layer product qualifications. We are also making excellent progress on our 232-layer node and expect to ramp production by the end of calendar 2022.\nAcross the industry, there are cost challenges stemming from supply chain and inflationary pressures. However, we continue to expect our cost reductions to outpace those of the industry this year. Driven by excellent productivity improvements in our fabs and the well-executed ramp of our world-class 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes.\nDespite COVID-19 control measures in China that created challenges for the global electronic supply chain, Micron's strong execution enabled record assembly output in fiscal Q3 supporting record quarterly revenue. However, these COVID-19 control measures in China impacted our outsourced assembly and test subcontractors and led to some impact to fiscal Q3 results.\nNow turning to our end markets. AI, ongoing cloud adoption, EVs and the ubiquitous connectivity offered by 5G are strong secular demand drivers, enabling the memory and storage industry to outpace the broader semiconductor industry. Micron's product portfolio has become significantly stronger, and we are established product momentum in several attractive growth markets. We are also driving a portfolio mix shift towards higher growth and more stable markets.\nFiscal 2021's 55% to 45% revenue split in favor of the more mature mobile, PC and consumer markets is expected to shift by fiscal 2025 to a 38% to 62% split in favor of the higher growth data center, auto, industrial, networking and graphics markets. Several of these end markets also exhibit more stable profitability. Our fiscal Q3 new product launches and customer qualifications reflect solid execution towards this portfolio transformation.\nData center is the largest market for memory and storage today and the rapid growth of AI and memory intensive workloads ensures that it will sustain strong growth through the end of the decade, corporations around the world are investing in digitization and extracting more value from data, and this approach remains 1 of the primary ways of improving efficiency and driving competitive advantage.\nData center fiscal Q3 revenue grew by double-digit percentage sequentially and well over 50% year-over-year. Data center end demand is expected to remain strong in the second half of calendar 2022, driven by robust cloud CapEx growth. Despite the strong end demand, we are seeing some enterprise OEM customers wanting to pair back their memory and storage inventory due to non-memory component shortages and macroeconomic concerns.\nIn fiscal Q3, we achieved several product and customer milestones. We began volume shipments of HBM2E, 1 of the fastest-growing product categories driven by the growth in AI and machine learning workloads. Micron continues to lead in DDR5. However, delays in the rollout of new server CPU platforms have slowed the industry DDR5 ramp versus prior expectations.\nIn data center SSDs, we more than doubled revenue year-over-year and achieved a new revenue record in the fiscal third quarter. We are excited by the strong reception of our industry-leading 176-layer data center NVMe SSDs, which are already in volume production. And in fiscal Q3, we completed qualifications with 3 OEMs. We recently launched the world's first 176-layer data center SATA SSD, which will help sustain our industry leadership in this product category.\nIn fiscal Q3, we achieved client revenue growth in the mid-teens percent range sequentially, driven by DRAM shipments and shared gains in client SSD. A number of factors have impacted consumer PC demand in various geographies. As a consequence, our forecast for calendar 2022, PC unit sales is now expected to decline by nearly 10% year-over-year from the very strong unit sales in calendar 2021. This compares to an industry and customer forecast of roughly flat calendar 2022 PC unit sales at the start of this calendar year. We expect PC per unit memory and storage content growth trends to remain healthy in calendar 2022, driven by a mix shift toward enterprise PCs and the increasing content and new architectures such as Apple's M1 Ultra platform, which features up to 128 gigabyte of DRAM.\nMicron has a strong product portfolio and is well positioned in this market. We are leading the DDR5 transition and expect our DDR5 revenue to continue to grow as multiple client customers launch next-generation notebooks. Increased availability of non-memory bill of materials will also improve our ability to shift DDR5-based modules. In addition, we continue to lead the industry and client QLC SSD technology and expect QLC to increase as a percentage of 176-layer bit output in fiscal Q4 and beyond.\nIn fiscal Q3, graphics revenue grew at a strong long double-digit percentage rate sequentially and year-over-year, driven by the strength of Micron's products and customer relationships. Micron continues to be the industry performance leader in graphics. We announced volume shipments of our new 1Z 16-gigabit GDDR6X in fiscal Q3, which features twice the capacity and up to 15% higher performance than the previous 1Y generation. The 24-gigabit per second peak bandwidth or GDDR6X is made possible by Micron's groundbreaking PAM4 signal transmission technology. No other memory vendor offers this capability or level of performance. We also began volume shipments of our newest 1Z 16-gigabit GDDR6 product to our largest graphics customers.\nFiscal Q3 mobile revenue declined slightly year-over-year, but grew quarter-over-quarter due to strong customer partnerships and product execution. Smartphone unit sales expectations have declined meaningfully for calendar 2022. We are now projecting smart phone unit volume to decline by mid-single digits percent range year-over-year in calendar '22 well below the industry and customer expectation earlier in the year of mid-single-digit percentage growth.\n5G unit sales are expected to grow and reach approximately 50% penetration of the smartphone unit TAM this year. The growth of 5G units will also drive higher DRAM and NAND content. We continue to deliver key mobile customer qualifications and strong mobile product ramps on our leading nodes. In fiscal Q3, we expanded our 1-alpha LPDRAM leadership with industry's first ramp of 1-alpha LPDDR5. In addition, 176-layer NAND made up over 90% of our mobile NAND bit shipments.\nMicron is the market share and quality leader in the fast-growing auto and industrial end markets. And in fiscal Q3, we achieved record revenue in both. These markets also exhibit higher stability in their gross margin profile through the cycle. Auto growth has been driven by robust demand that remains constrained by auto unit production. We see robust auto content growth as OEMs adopt significant architectural changes to support ADAS, infotainment and electric vehicles.\nIn fiscal Q3, there were announcements of several new EVs featuring content-rich ADAS, including the Ford F-150 Lightning, Mercedes EQS, SUV and EQE sedan and BMW IX1. We expect the auto market to have a strong long-term bit growth CAGR in DRAM and NAND that is roughly twice the CAGR of overall DRAM and NAND markets. And consequently, our strength in this market will become increasingly important. Industrial IoT achieved record revenue in fiscal Q3, demonstrating broad-based growth with various end market applications. We continue to see tailwinds from secular growth drivers as industrial customers invest in increasing factory automation and digitization.\nTurning to the market outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2022, industry bit demand growth have moderated since our last earnings call. Near the end of fiscal Q3, we saw a significant reduction in near-term industry bit demand primarily attributable to end demand weakness in consumer markets, including PC and smartphone. These consumer markets have been impacted by the weakness in consumer spending in China, the Russia, Ukraine war and rising inflation around the world.\nCOVID-19 control measures in China have exacerbated supply chain challenges for some customers and the macroeconomic environment is also creating some caution amongst certain customers. Several customers, primarily in PC and smartphone are adjusting their inventories, and we expect these adjustments to take place mostly in the second half of calendar 2022.\nWhile end demand in the mobile, PC and consumer markets has weakened, cloud, networking, automotive and industrial markets are showing resilience. Due to weaker demand in the second half of calendar 2022, we now expect year-over-year calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth to be below the long-term CAGRs of mid- to high-teens percentage for DRAM and high-20s percentage for NAND. Despite the near-term weakness, secular demand trends remain strong, and our view of long-term DRAM and NAND bit demand CAGR remains unchanged from prior expectations.\nTurning to supply. Given the change in market conditions, we are taking immediate action to reduce our supply growth trajectory. To protect profitability, we will maintain pricing discipline, manage capacity utilization and use inventory as a buffer to navigate through this period of demand weakness. Additionally, we are planning for the reduced level of bit supply growth in fiscal 2023, and will use inventory to supply part of the market demand next year. This approach will enable us to reduce wafer fab equipment CapEx for fiscal year 2023 versus our prior plans, and we now expect our fiscal 2023 wafer fab equipment CapEx to decline year-over-year.\nOverall, industry supply is also being impacted. Manufacturing equipment shipment delays, challenges for some in the industry in ramping new nodes of technology and DRAM supply discipline evident in the industry are all expected to limit supply growth over the next few quarters. These supply reductions will help offset some impact of the weaker demand.\nI will now turn it over to Mark Murphy, Micron's Chief Financial Officer.\n\nMark J. Murphy\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered strong results in fiscal Q3, marked by record quarterly revenue and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Total fiscal Q3 revenue was $8.6 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Growth was strong across most end markets. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $6.3 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up 15% year-over-year. Sequentially, bit shipments increased by slightly over 10%, while ASPs declined slightly. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $2.3 billion, representing 26% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 17% sequentially and was up 26% year-over-year. Sequential bit shipments increased in the high teens percent and ASPs declined slightly.\nNow turning to our fiscal Q3 revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the compute and networking business unit was $3.9 billion, up 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Data center graphics and networking contributed to both year-over-year and sequential growth. Revenue for the mobile business unit was approximately $2 billion, up 5% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. Strong execution and product momentum allowed MBU to deliver sequential growth in a challenging smartphone market demand environment.\nRevenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 15% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year. We achieved record SSD revenue with both data center and client SSD revenues reaching all-time highs. Data center SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year. Finally, we achieved record revenue for the Embedded Business Unit at $1.4 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year. Both automotive and industrial revenues set records in the quarter.\nThe consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was 47.4%, down approximately 40 basis points sequentially. An increasing mix of NAND contributed to the decline. Operating expenses in fiscal Q3 were approximately $950 million, below the low end of the guidance range and down approximately $20 million sequentially. OpEx benefited from the timing of our technology and product qualifications and from lower variable compensation. Although we are taking actions to reduce OpEx in light of current market conditions, we expect OpEx to increase sequentially due to the timing of technology and product qualifications.\nFiscal Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 36.4%, up approximately 110 basis points sequentially and up 450 basis points from the prior year. Fiscal Q3 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $5 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 57.4%, down approximately 40 basis points sequentially and up over 400 basis points versus the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q3 were $2.59, up from $2.14 in fiscal Q2 and up from $1.88 in the year ago quarter.\nTurning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $3.8 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q3, representing 44% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion during the quarter. We expect fiscal 2022 CapEx to be approximately $12 billion. Our free cash flow for fiscal Q3 was $1.3 billion.\nDuring the quarter, we completed share repurchases of $981 million or approximately 13.8 million shares. Including our dividend payment, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal Q3. Since the share repurchase program's inception in fiscal 2019 through the end of fiscal Q3. We have deployed $5.7 billion towards repurchasing 108 million shares at an average price of approximately $53 per share.\nAs we discussed at Investor Day, we are committed to returning to shareholders all of the free cash flow generated over the cycle through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases will be both programmatic and opportunistic and we expect to purchase more as the stock trades at bigger discount to intrinsic value.\nOn dividends, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share, a 15% increase over the prior dividend to be paid on July 26 to shareholders of record on July 11. Our ending fiscal Q3 inventory was $5.6 billion and average days of inventory for the quarter were down to 109 days from 113 days last quarter. We ended the quarter with $12 billion of cash and investments and $14.5 billion of total liquidity. Our fiscal Q3 total debt was $7 billion.\nNow turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Long-term demand trends remain constructive. However, select market weakness and macroeconomic uncertainty are impacting our near-term outlook and visibility. Currently, we do project sequential bit shipments to be down for both DRAM and NAND in fiscal Q4. We intend to maintain pricing discipline and walk away from business which doesn't meet our pricing objectives.\nWhile we are taking proactive steps to control OpEx and CapEx, we expect the impact of these actions to be limited in fiscal Q4 and to become more material in fiscal year '23. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for the fiscal Q4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $7.2 billion, plus or minus $400 million; gross margin to be in the range of 42.5% plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $1.05 billion, plus or minus $25 million.\nWe expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 9% for fiscal Q4. Based on a share count of approximately 1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.63 plus or minus $0.20. We remain on track to deliver record revenue and solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal year 2022. In closing, we delivered strong results in our fiscal Q3, but near-term headwinds are impacting our fiscal Q4 outlook.\nBeyond the near term, we project secular growth drivers such as data center, automotive and other areas to support robust DRAM and NAND growth and strong cross-cycle financial performance by Micron. At our Investor Day event last month, we laid out a cross-cycle financial model for the company that reflects the key attributes of our business, a strong revenue growth CAGR of high single digits, robust cross-cycle operating margins of approximately 30% and healthy free cash flow margins that exceed 10% of revenues. Given our long-term financial outlook and the strength of our balance sheet, we see the current share price is very attractive. And at these levels, intend to repurchase shares more aggressively in fiscal Q4.\nI will now turn it back to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra\n\nCEO, President & Director, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mark. The memory and storage TAM is expected to grow to $330 billion by 2030, and become an increasing portion of the semiconductor market. The near-term market environment notwithstanding, we are executing extremely well on all aspects of the business that are within our control.\nMicron's continuing technology, product and manufacturing leadership puts us in an excellent position to capitalize on the long-term opportunity and to extend the frontiers of what is possible with memory and storage. We will continue to exercise supply discipline and take appropriate actions to navigate through the near-term headwinds, and we remain focused on creating value for shareholders and generating healthy free cash flow cross cycle.\nThanks for joining us today. We will now open for questions.",

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered an excellent performance in fiscal Q2 with levels above the high end of our guidance. We grew revenue and margins sequentially while driving favorable mix and cost reductions amid ongoing global supply chain challenges. We saw broad-based demand for our products with our SSD products achieving record revenue and our auto market revenue also reaching an all-time high.\nExecution was outstanding with our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND technology node ramps delivering strong cost reductions. Our portfolio transformation continues to gain momentum as we lead the industry on the DDR5 transition and grow our mix of NVMe data center SSDs. Following a solid first half, we are on track to deliver record revenue and robust profitability in fiscal 2022 and remain well positioned to create significant shareholder value in fiscal '22 and beyond.\nIn fiscal Q2, 1z and 1-alpha DRAM combined represented the majority of our DRAM bit shipments, while 176-layer NAND represented the majority of our NAND bit shipments. Our 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND products are achieving excellent yields, providing us with solid front-end cost reductions and contributing meaningful revenue. We qualified additional products on these advanced nodes with a broad set of customers, which sets us up for continued strong revenue ramp in the second half of the fiscal year.\nWe are tracking several quarters ahead of the industry in ramping products based on these leading-edge process technologies. We are also investing to maintain technology leadership for the next decade and making good progress in the development of future technology nodes. Micron is not only a technology leader, but also the industry leader in quality with the majority of our customers ranking us #1. Our leadership in quality is an important differentiator for Micron, particularly in fast-growing data center and automotive markets, where our quality scores are excellent.\nWe have also strengthened our position as a strategic supplier to our customers as demonstrated by our commitment to supply continuity amid ongoing semiconductor supply chain challenges this past quarter. In late December, a government-mandated COVID-19 lockdown impacted production output at our back-end facility in Xian, China. The Micron team executed with tenacity to return the Xian site back to normal output levels post lockdown. As a result of this outstanding effort, we mitigated the lost output from Xian and delivered on our customer commitments for the quarter by leveraging our global manufacturing network. Additional COVID-19-related lockdowns in the region present a risk to the global electronic supply chain, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.\nThe global semiconductor supply chain is experiencing pressure due to impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The region is an important source for the global supply of noble gases and other critical minerals that are used in semiconductor manufacturing. We have strategically diversified our supply chain over the last several years and maintain appropriate inventories of materials and noble gases. We currently do not expect any negative impact to our near-term production volumes because of the Russia-Ukraine war, but we do expect an increase in our costs as we secure supply of certain raw materials that could be at risk. We also remain vigilant in this dynamic situation and are engaged with our key suppliers to ensure continuous availability of materials to support our operations.\nNow let's review our end markets. Demand for memory and storage is broad, extending from the data center to the intelligent edge and to a growing diversity of user devices. Memory and storage revenue has outpaced the rest of the semiconductor industry over the last 2 decades, and we expect this trend to continue over the next decade, thanks to ongoing advancement of AI, 5G and EV adoption. Our team's execution on strengthening our product portfolio has been outstanding with several new product launches and customer qualifications in fiscal Q2, achievements that we are very proud of.\nLast year, data center became the largest market for memory and storage, eclipsing the mobile market. Looking ahead, we expect data center demand growth to outpace the broader memory and storage market over the next decade, fueled by secular drivers in cloud and healthy enterprise IT investment. Memory and storage share of server bond costs already exceeds 40%, and this number is even higher for servers optimized for AI and ML workloads. This growth is supported by new heterogenous computing architectures, the increase in data-intensive workloads and ongoing displacement of HDDs by SSDs.\nIn the fiscal second quarter, data center revenue grew more than 60% year-over-year, supported by robust demand across our DRAM and SSD portfolio. We have broadened the qualifications for our 1-alpha DRAM products and are well positioned to support the data center DDR5 transition driven by new CPU platforms, which are targeted to begin ramping later this calendar year and gain momentum in 2023.\nFollowing the introduction of our 7400 SSD, in fiscal Q2, we introduced the 7450, which is the industry's first 176-layer vertically integrated data center NVMe SSD. These Gen4 NVMe data center drives are generating an enthusiastic response from our customers. We are making robust progress in our qualifications of these drives with data center customers, which has contributed to a doubling of our fiscal Q2 data center SSD revenues year-over-year. We expect strong growth of data center SSD revenues to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year.\nIn fiscal Q2, we saw recovery in our client revenue driven by strength in enterprise PCs, which more than offset softer consumer and Chromebook demand. We expect that calendar '22 PC unit sales will be flattish versus last year's sales, but we expect solid growth in DRAM and NAND content driven in part by increasing mix of content-rich enterprise desktops and laptops.\nWe are leading the industry's client DDR5 transition, and our DDR5 revenue continues to increase as multiple PC customers launch next-generation notebooks. Client DDR5 demand continues to outstrip supply, and we are seeing meaningful price premiums over DDR4 alternatives. Building on our QLC leadership, in fiscal Q2, we also launched our 2400 NVMe SSD, the world's first client SSD built on 176-layer QLC NAND.\nMicron maintains a leading position in the fast-growing graphics market. We have a broad product portfolio, featuring industry-leading product performance and deep partnerships with leading GPU suppliers. In fiscal Q2, revenues grew year-over-year driven by strong demand for the latest generation of gaming consoles and graphics cards. Our advanced GDDR6X continues to lead the industry in performance. And in fiscal Q2, we began revenue shipments of our next-generation GDDR6X solutions.\nFiscal Q2 mobile revenue grew slightly year-over-year as the 5G transition continues in smartphones. We see some weakness in the China market as the local economy slows, smartphone market share shifts and some customers take a more prudent approach to inventory management. Mobile memory and storage demand continues to be supported by content-hungry applications and the ongoing transition from 4G to 5G, which is driving 50% higher DRAM content and the doubling of NAND content. 5G smartphone sales are expected to grow to 700 million units in calendar year '22.\nIn fiscal Q2, we achieved the first qualification of our 1-alpha LP5 DRAM, which delivers more than a 15% power improvement over the previous generation, enabling our customers to offer an improved 5G experience with better battery life. We are also seeing a very strong revenue ramp for our 176-layer NAND UFS products, which are now qualified in nearly 50 different OEM platforms.\nThe automotive and industrial segments are expected to be the fastest-growing memory and storage markets over the next decade. Today, more than 10% of our revenue comes from these end markets, and we are exceptionally well positioned as a market share leader. In fiscal Q2, our auto revenue set a new record driven by robust demand for memory and storage. Auto unit production remains below demand constrained by numerous supply chain challenges, including logic and analog semiconductor component shortages.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has also impacted auto bills. Nevertheless, the demand for memory and storage remains strong driven by auto content growth. New EVs are becoming like data center on wheels, and we expect over 100 new EV models to launch worldwide in this calendar year alone. These new EVs include advanced ADAS and in-vehicle infotainment features that have significantly higher memory and storage requirements. In fact, some of these Level 3 autonomous EVs have about $750 in memory and storage content, which is 15x higher than the average car. In industrial IoT, we saw approximately 60% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled by the continued ramp in applications such as factory automation and security systems.\nTurning to the market outlook. Our expectation for calendar '22 industry demand is largely unchanged from our last earnings call. We expect calendar '22 industry bit demand growth to be in the mid- to high teens for DRAM and at approximately 30% for NAND. We anticipate underlying demand in calendar '22 to be led by data center, ongoing adoption of 5G smartphones and continued strength in automotive and industrial markets. Currently, we see a healthy supply-demand balance across both DRAM and NAND given these demand trends, supply discipline across the memory industry, long semiconductor manufacturing equipment lead times and reduced NAND supply from some of our competitors that experienced a contamination issue in their fab.\nNonmemory component shortages are improving, and we expect that further improvements should support memory and storage demand growth for the rest of this year. However, there are some pockets where semiconductor shortages have not improved as fast as we had expected, and these shortages are likely to continue into calendar year 2023. We are mindful of increased macroeconomic uncertainty and remain vigilant of any changes in market conditions.\nTurning now to Micron's bit supply growth expectations for the year. Consistent with the rest of the industry, we are experiencing a challenging environment for equipment and material suppliers. However, due to strong execution by Micron's operations team, our calendar year '22 bit supply growth for DRAM and NAND remains unchanged from prior expectations and will be in line with industry demand. We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability in fiscal year '22, and we continue to expect strong bit shipment growth in the second half of the fiscal year.\nWe expect our cost reductions to outpace that of the industry this year driven by the exceptionally well-executed ramp of our world-class 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes. However, across the industry, there are cost challenges stemming from supply chain and inflationary pressures, which will limit cost reductions this year for the industry. We remain confident in our long-term technology road map and our ability to drive competitive cost reductions for years to come.\nI will now turn it over to Sumit.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Business Officer & Interim CFO, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sanjay. Micron delivered excellent fiscal Q2 results marked by record revenues across multiple products and markets, strong profitability and generation of over $1 billion in free cash flow. I'm particularly excited by the execution of our industry-leading 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND technology ramp and the accelerating momentum of our product portfolio transformation.\nFiscal Q2 revenue was approximately $7.8 billion, up 1% quarter-over-quarter and up 25% year-over-year. Revenue was particularly strong in client and cloud markets. Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was $5.7 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 2% quarter-over-quarter and was up 29% year-over-year. Sequentially, bit shipments increased in the high single-digit percentage range, while ASPs declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range.\nFiscal Q2 NAND revenue was $2 billion, representing 25% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 4% quarter-over-quarter and was up 19% year-over-year. Sequential bit shipments were flat, and ASPs increased in the mid-single-digit percentage range due to stronger mix of SSDs, more than offsetting like-for-like price declines. Our ongoing portfolio transformation and a solid front-end cost reduction drove sequential gains in gross margin in NAND despite sequential price declines in most products.\nNow turning to our fiscal Q2 revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.5 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 31% year-over-year. Cloud generated record DRAM revenue, and client DRAM revenues also performed well in the quarter.\nRevenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.9 billion, down 2% sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. Our mobile business continues to perform well, building on our leadership in managed NAND and MCPs as well as our strong relationships with all smartphone customers.\nRevenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.2 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year. We achieved record SSD revenues, which were up approximately 80% year-over-year. Our storage business is gaining momentum, growing revenue as well as profitability as we become the first in the industry to ramp several 176-layer NAND SSDs from QLC and TLC client products to vertically integrated data center SSDs.\nFinally, revenue from the Embedded Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-over-year. Our Embedded Business Unit saw strong demand across automotive and industrial markets, with auto revenue hitting a new record. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q2 was 47.8%, up approximately 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Gross margins benefited from improvements in our portfolio mix as we ramped several high-value solutions and from manufacturing cost reductions. Operating expenses in fiscal Q2 were $974 million, near the midpoint of our guidance range.\nFiscal Q2 operating income was strong at $2.8 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 35%, flat quarter-over-quarter and up from 20% in the prior year. Fiscal Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 58%, up from 57% in the prior quarter and up from 45% in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal Q2 were $2.14, down slightly from $2.16 in fiscal Q1 and up more than 100% from the $0.98 in the year ago quarter. The sequential increase in fiscal Q2 tax rate impacted Q2 EPS by $0.04 per share.\nTurning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $3.6 billion in cash from operations in fiscal Q2, representing 47% of revenue. Net capital spending was $2.6 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect fiscal 2022 CapEx to be in the range of $11 billion to $12 billion with the CapEx being roughly even between the first and second half of the fiscal year.\nOur free cash flow for fiscal Q2 was strong at slightly over $1 billion. We remain confident in our ability to generate significant free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year, substantially higher than that in the first half. We completed share repurchases of $408 million or approximately 4.8 million shares in the quarter. Including our dividend payment, we returned around $520 million to shareholders in fiscal Q2. From the inception of the share repurchase program in fiscal 2019, we have deployed $4.7 billion towards repurchasing 94 million shares at an average price of $50 per share. In addition, we have deployed approximately $800 million towards settling convert premiums, which reduced our diluted share count by 19 million shares.\nCombining the share repurchases, convert premiums and dividends, we have returned to shareholders $5.8 billion or 64% of our cumulative free cash flow in this time frame. We remain committed to returning more than 50% of the cross-cycle free cash flow through a combination of dividends and buybacks. As we have mentioned before, we will be opportunistic in share repurchases and more aggressive when the shares are trading at larger discounts to intrinsic value. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.10 to be paid on April 26 to shareholders of record on April 11.\nOur ending fiscal Q2 inventory was $5.4 billion, and average days of inventory for the quarter was 113 days. Our fiscal Q2 DIO increased sequentially due to an increase in raw materials and WIP to support demand for the second fiscal half. Finished goods inventory declined quarter-over-quarter in both DRAM and NAND. We ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of total cash and investments and $14.4 billion of total liquidity. Our fiscal Q2 total debt was $7.1 billion.\nNow turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter. Our overall business is tracking ahead of our plans a quarter ago, and demand is strong across most end markets with some regional challenges that Sanjay referenced earlier. Near-term supply and pricing trends are constructive. Our improved fiscal year financial outlook is increasing our variable compensation expenses, which will impact our costs in fiscal Q3. We are also seeing cost impacts from continuing inflationary pressures and from supply chain mitigation actions resulting -- related to industry-wide shortages.\nAdditionally, due to the pull-in of cost reductions in Q2, we expect more modest front-end cost reductions in Q3 on a sequential basis. We do expect both DRAM and NAND gross margins to increase sequentially in fiscal Q3. A higher mix of NAND revenue in our consolidated total will affect our consolidated gross margin as our DRAM gross margins are substantially higher than our NAND gross margins.\nWith all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q3 is as follows: we expect revenue to be $8.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, which will represent a new record for quarterly revenues; gross margin to be in the range of 48%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $1.05 billion, plus or minus $25 million.\nWe expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% for fiscal Q3. Based on the share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $2.46, plus or minus $0.10. We remain on track to deliver record revenue and solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2022.\nIn closing, Micron continues to deliver strong cross-cycle performance. Revenue growth has significantly outpaced the broader semiconductor industry, gross margins have averaged over 40%, and operating margins have averaged around 30%. Micron's financial foundation and outlook have never been stronger as we build on the momentum created by our portfolio transformation, leadership technology road map and manufacturing excellence.\nI will now turn it back to Sanjay.\n\nSanjay Mehrotra\n\nCEO, President & Director, Micron Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sumit. I'm proud to note that earlier this month, Micron was named one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. This recognition reflects our global team's dedication to holding ourselves the highest ethical standards both in how we operate and how we pursue environmental and social responsibility.\nWe continue to manage our business with a discipline and foresight that is driving industry-leading technology ramps, improving our product portfolio and strengthening our customer relationships. A strong first half performance and our guidance for an all-time record quarter show our continued progress toward delivering record fiscal '22 revenues and robust profitability. Given our technology leadership, Micron is in an excellent position to capitalize on the broad trends that are driving demand for DRAM and NAND solutions solutions that transform data into better customer experiences and greater business value.\nI look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day presentation on May 12 in San Francisco, where we will discuss the technology drivers behind these trends in greater depth and detail Micron's strategies to seize the opportunity ahead.\nThanks for joining us today, and we'll now open for questions.",

    "content": "Q1 2026 Micron Technology Inc Post-Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2026 Micron Technology Inc Post-Earnings Call\n\nMUNASDAQDEC 17, 6:00 PM\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question and doing the group call. I guess my first question is, you know, Mark, you, you talked a lot about being constrained and, and unable to meet some of the demand out there. I know in the quarter you talked about kind of a slight increase in bit shipments of DRAM this quarter. I, I guess as part of that, did, did the non-HBM DRAM bits grow sequentially in this quarter? And how, you know, how has your guide, you know, factored in bit shipments between NAND and flash in this current quarter? Thank you.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nSo I think, Aaron, one thing I wanted to mention was, you know, we are doing all we can to increase bit supply now. And we, you know, we're able to provide additional bits to do 20% bit shipment growth in our fiscal 2026. And, you know, we're doing that through, you know, efforts within existing footprint and just efficiencies in the fabs. We're doing that with node transitions, as we've said, you know, 1-beta and, or I'm sorry, 1-gamma and G9 to get additional bits for DRAM and NAND. And, you know, we're pulling in what we can on construction that will help us, largely in 2027, but we are able to provide growth that we think will be in line with the market in fiscal 2026 or calendar 2026.\nYou know, I think we did have very modest bit shipment growth sequentially in Q1. We expect a little bit more in Q2, but it's again a quarter primarily driven by price, as it relates to revenue growth.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYep. That's helpful, Mark. And then as a real quick follow-up, you know, I, as we look forward, I know you, you mentioned the 14-week period for fiscal Q4, but how would you have us think about the OpEx trajectory from here over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. You know, I mean, we've guided the Q2. It'll be sort of flat-ish in the Q3 relative to the second. Then it'll be up in the Q4, and up, plus the additional week.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYep. Thanks, Mark.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Please go ahead, Vijay.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nYeah. Hi, thanks. Great quarter. So just a quick question, Sumit, Mark, and Manish, on when you look at the, you know, DRAM pricing has up pretty nicely, 20% sequentially, and NAND has up pretty nicely too. I was just wondering how, when you look at the demand side, how do you decide to allocate capacity versus conventional DRAM versus HBM? Because it looks like, you know, conventional DRAM profitability is improving very significantly. So just wondering how that reasoning, how you look at that as you look through 2026, 2027. Thanks. Follow-up.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. Yeah. So, good question. I mean, we are in a very interesting environment where the aggregate demand for both DRAM and NAND is substantially higher than the ability to supply it, not just from a Micron perspective, but, you know, even at an aggregate industry level. So, we are not really able to meet the demand for customers across any segment. So all segments are short in terms of what they need from us versus what we are able to supply. And, we are also short on the HBM side, non-HBM side, you know, all parts of the market. There is a mismatch between supply and demand, and that, that continues for the foreseeable future because over the course of the last few months, there has been a very significant and pervasive step-up in demand across the data center customer base. So it has created a set of challenges in being able to meet the demand from our customers, on a very broad level. So in terms of allocation, I can't get into too much specifics, but suffice to say that we are working very hard to find the threshold level of supply for all of our customers, to minimize the impact to their businesses, due to lack of adequate supply.\nAnd we are working hard to ensure, you know, adequate level of diversification in our business across segments, across customers, and focus on our strategic customers when it comes to, you know, doing some of these longer-term strategic deals that can improve foundationally our business model. So those are some of the things that we are attempting to do. In the course of all of this, our mix over time will tilt more towards the data center, but we're also trying to remain focused on having diversification across all the other segments of the market as well.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGot it. And then on the ESSD side, you know, you're seeing a very strong pickup with your QLC. It's in 98th[uncertain] ESSDs, as you mentioned, 122 terabyte, 245 terabyte. Is there a way to kind of look at what is the attach rate that you're seeing now, with ESSDs on AI servers, versus last year, especially as some of these, inferencing vectors with, reasoning and answer and, you know, all that stuff to pick up? How do you see that attach rate growing year on year? Thanks.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nThe attach rate is certainly growing, and these AI servers do need more high-capacity SSDs. They also need a significant amount of high-performance SSDs. This is where our Gen 6 SSDs have come into the picture. So we have been the first company to supply qualified Gen 6 SSDs to the market. So that is gaining rapid market traction and contributing to our improved share position in the data center SSD space. And then these high-capacity SSDs that you mentioned, Micron has the leadership position in QLC workloads. And so, overall, QLC bit mix is higher than the rest of the industry. So that's an additional capability that we have. And, if you look at workloads like KV cache, they do require a lot of higher-capacity SSDs. Now, one additional thing that has happened is that, beyond the underlying growth trend of AI servers using more of these SSDs, we've also had our customers not have adequate amounts of HDDs, as well. And because of that, there has been a lot of demand coming towards SSDs. And consequently, the ability to supply NAND to our customers has also been oversubscribed, due to a combination of all of these trends.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nI do want to note that on SSDs, that if you remember, our business was over $1 billion in Q1 2025. And in Q1 2026, the business did clear that. And, as Sumit mentioned, sort of the industry's able to get on top of the supply chain-related issues, we expect, and given the demand in that business, we expect that growth to accelerate through the year.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mark.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open, Vivek.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you. I actually had two questions. First, back on the gross margin, I think you, you know, are at 68%. Is there a reasonable way to think about, you know, what can be the, you know, path forward? Like, is it 70%? Is it 75%? I know you have not given a specific number, but Mark, is there a way to logically think about where your margins can go in this, you know, in this cycle? Because this is well above the prior peak, so is there a certain business model you have in mind? And the reason I ask the question is because, you know, you have, you know, close to 70% gross margins. You're right. Your customers, NVIDIA, AMD, are also talking about, you know, very high gross margins or expanding gross margins for their, for their business. I'm just curious to know how you think conceptually about the path forward for your gross margins.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYou know, we're at record-setting levels, and that's positive. We guided to that. There are a lot of favorable factors in that that are driving that. You know, first is the demand driven by this, you know, generational change in tech, with AI. And, you know, that's a multi-year build-out, done by well-capitalized companies. We think that's sustainable. And fortunately, you know, AI needs more and better memory to perform better. So, you know, the underlying, you know, secular driver for memory is positive. You know, we're just in a fantastic position with leadership technology, best products in memory and storage, and then we're operating really well, yielding quickly. Cost performance is good. Capital discipline is good. Then you've got these general structural supply constraints. So when combined with the demand from AI, data center to the edge, actually, you know, we've got this supply shortfall, and you see the price movement associated with that. And that this is a supply gap that's not easy to address in the near term, given, you know, we can do a node transition, but you've got, you know, greenfield capacity needs to be put in place. You've got increasing HBM and the capital intensity associated with that or silicon intensity associated with that.\nAnd these are, you know, putting on Earth the most, you know, some of the largest and most complex factories, you know, on the planet. So we need partnership to do that, and we're gonna do it carefully. So, you know, with all that, we do expect that margin can go up from Q2. It'll go up on the basis of, we believe, market conditions that should remain, you know, positive beyond 2026. We believe it's possible based on our ability to deploy bits to premium products in which we're best positioned. And we believe that our cost performance is such that it will help us sustain or expand these margins. Now, just the math of being at these levels for a, you know, equivalent increase in price, we're gonna get less gross margin expansion. So, you know, there can be, you know, as we mentioned on the call, on the primary earnings call, there's, you know, the increase from here would be more gradual than you've seen in, you know, Q4 to Q1 or Q1 to Q2 guide. But we do believe that margins can go up.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nGot it. For my follow-up, you know, every time the customer, right, or the, whether it's NVIDIA or Broadcom or AMD, every time they report, they seem to be upsiding numbers for next year. When you say you're sold out for HBM, does it mean that you don't have an ability to upside your production or, you know, does it mean that you're sold out based on the current level of forecast and you have kind of unit and ASP certainty around that? I'm just trying to understand, you know, what scenarios let them continue to upside the numbers unless it's just a sheer shift between you and your peers. Like, if they continue to upside the numbers, you know, can you help them, you know, do that? How much more flex is there in your production for HBM? Thank you.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. So I think the way to read what we are saying is that, you know, we have visibility to our supply. And of course, we're always trying to improve that. But we have a good understanding of what our supply is. The current situation, you know, when we say sold out for HBM, for example, the HBM supply for 2026, we have reached agreements on volume and price with our customers. Of course, if there are upsides to supply, we are able to very quickly be able to place that upside supply at our customers at, you know, good terms. But when it comes to the overall aggregate business, the demand on us is so much higher than the supply that even, you know, small increases in supply are not going to be able to make a dent in that demand. So we are, you know, more than sold out. I mean, we have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models. And this is just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially higher than supply for the foreseeable future.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nVivek, I'll just add on, you know, HBM and DRAM, because the whole market is short, and, you know, HBM, you know, production in, fab output is shared with DRAM production, right, all on our 1-beta node. So, you know, this constraint is kind of across the entire DRAM market, as Sumit mentioned, and as we said, before, which is, you know, incredibly constrained. So we are working hard to try to increase supply for, you know, DRAM, HBM, and NAND, you know. Yields have come up really well for both our 1-gamma and our G9. And those are gonna be, as we gave colors, majority of the big growth for next year is coming from those transitions.\nAnd we're also, you know, gonna have the majority of those of our DRAM bits on 1-gamma in the second half of next year. And Gen 9, as we go through the year, will become the highest volume node for us in NAND. So, you know, technology transitions are moving aggressively. We're optimizing and looking to maximize production where we can. And I just wanna point out that we've also said that we expect HBM4 yield ramp to be faster than our HBM3E 12-high yield ramp was, which was already faster than our HBM3E 8-high yield ramp. So we're gaining confidence in our HBM capability at scale. So, you know, all those are things that we're continuing to work on, but just the demand environment is such that it's really, you know, way over supply, whatever we can or what the rest of the industry can supply.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nComes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open, Kevin.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThank you very much. My question, you know, along those lines of you saying the HBM4 yield is better than HBM3, what, how does this work with the process node, with the qualification time taking so much longer with HBM? Does this change your cadence for process technology? You know, do they stay in production longer?\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nI'm not quite sure. I mean, I think both our HBM3E and HBM4 are on our 1-beta process technology. They both use the similar assembly, architecture, and process that we've had now from HBM3E 8 high, 12 high, and now at HBM4. So the reason I said that we expect our HBM4 yields to ramp faster than HBM3E 12 high did once we go to production, you know, in the early part of calendar year 2026 and start shipments in calendar Q2, is because of being able to leverage the learnings that we have both on 1-beta for HBM as well as on the packaging and test side, because we have common architectures between those products.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nYeah. My question was more, in a bigger picture of, will 1-gamma get qualified for HBM4 or will it always be 1-beta?\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nHBM4 is on 1-beta. And, you know, we, you know, we haven't given specific guidance on, you know, how future generations will be, but HBM4 will be on 1-gamma. And, you know, the cadence of.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nWhat?\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nPlatform.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\n1-beta.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nI'm sorry. 1-beta. The cadence of our customers' platforms continues to be, you know, rapid every 12 months. So we are just gonna be focused on delivering new high bandwidth memory solutions for our customers on an approximately 12-month cadence. So, you know, that's not slowing down.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nOkay. Maybe another question, just, how quickly can you change your wafer allocation, you know, from HBM to low power to high performance? You know, I guess, how, how far into the process technology, process, can you change what the, final product is?\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nSo they are shared process between the two, between the various different designs that we have on a given DRAM technology node. But the design itself is unique. So when you start one design, whether it's a low power design, a DDR design, or an HBM design, obviously, that's gonna be the timeframe. So the real time, the answer to your question is that basically it's one process cycle time that we can change between any of these different products.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nI think, Kevin, I just want to make sure it's clear that we, you know, we have extensive planning that we do around all the products and the product roadmaps and, you know, what products go on what node at what time. You know, there are a lot of factors that go into that. Cost is not the only factor. And in fact, in HBM, it's such a complex product that stability and, you know, turning quickly with the customer is an important factor. So there is some value in 1-beta and as stable and strong a node as that is. And then, you know, when 1-gamma's available, at the right time, you know, that we can use that node. Otherwise, you know, we have plenty of other beta requirements that 1-gamma we're ramping that as quickly as we can to get that supply.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nI mean, generally speaking, we tell our customers that it takes us five months if they want to make changes that use different data in the fab, three months, three and a half months to get to the front end, and six to eight weeks depending on the complexity of the product on the back end. So roughly speaking, five plus months of lead time. Our customers understand that. They, they know that these things take a long time.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Fox Advisors LLC. Your line is open. Steven.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nFounder & CEO, Fox Advisors LLC\n\nHi. Good afternoon. I just had one question. On the CapEx spending that you talked about on the call, are you giving any sort of sense for the breakdown between facilities, equipment, construction, all of that, say, from how and how it might change between 2026 and 2027? That mix? Thanks.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. We've not indicated, you know, anything about 2027 other than, other than it will be, 2027 total CapEx will be up versus 2026. I did on the call, I believe, indicate that, you know, 2025 to 2026, the plans to, you know, our fiscal or plans to roughly double, you know, the construction CapEx. And so that gives you sort of an indication on direction of travel. Now, we've got, you know, 2027 we'll have, you know, Idaho 1 finishing. We've got Idaho 2. We've got Japan. We've got, you know, we've got a lot of construction sites. So, you know, those are gonna contribute to that, sequential, you know, 2026 to 2027 CapEx increase. And Manish, I don't.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. I mean, we'll be.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nHBM and NAND.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nWe do have a considerable amount of construction, I was gonna say.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nIn Singapore as well where we've got that. We're gonna be equipping our India assembly site, which is just now going from pilot production to production ramp in the beginning of calendar 2026. So, yeah, there's gonna be a mix of growth in terms of construction CapEx to fund the midterm and long-term equipment CapEx into, you know, existing clean room that we have right now. Then, of course, assembly investments for both HBM as well as conventional packaging that we'll be making as well.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. I'll just maybe add to this point, you know, Tim asked about capital intensity on the earlier call. You know, we had CapEx as a percent of sales in Q1 was, you know, below 35% that we talked about. And then on Q2, basically where our guide is to the both on the revenue and the CapEx guidance we gave you, you could tell it's in the mid-20s on CapEx as a percent of sales. And, you know, we've talked about strengthening free cash flow. So we're, you know, not only increasing investment in order to get the bit supply, we are generating a lot more cash. We had, you know, near 30% free cash flow margin in Q1. And we talked about free cash flow increasing through the year. We paid down debt, you know, $2.7 billion of debt in Q1, bought back $300 million of shares, and went to net cash, all in the quarter. It was a record-setting free cash flow in Q1.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nFounder & CEO, Fox Advisors LLC\n\nGot it. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, Jim.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood evening. Thanks for taking my questions. First one would be, just in terms of the capacity allocation question that came up earlier, maybe to put it a different way, I know you're, you know, sort of a key supplier in many embedded and other kind of mission-critical applications, automotive and the like. You know, can you give us a sense about, like, a floor level, a minimum floor level that some of those sort of legacy or embedded applications would reach or not below in terms of production, kind of giving your importance in that market? Or conversely, can we maybe talk a little bit about sort of, you know, what is the maximum level of data center capacity or data center exposure you feel comfortable having?\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. I mean, I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, the overall TAM is also shifting more towards data center. That's just how the dynamics of the industry are playing out. So certainly our portfolio and our mix is shifting towards data center. Our whole goal over time is to keep mixing our products within each segment and across segments towards, you know, higher ROI type of homes for our bits and for our output. And that just means that, for some time now, the portfolio mix has been an important tailwind for Micron and continues to be a driver of our longer-term financial performance because we have over time shifted more and more of our revenue towards higher margin products and taken a bigger share of the industry profit pool based on that initiative. So that will continue. With that said, you're right. I mean, we do have a large share in automotive, industrial, and several mission-critical applications. So we are making investments in our Manassas, Virginia fab, in the US, to modernize it, bring 1-alpha technology, DRAM technology into that fab. And so that is going to be an important initiative to continue the support of long lifecycle, legacy products. We intend to continue to support them.\nOf course, we also support a lot of these products and customers and segments from our high-volume fabs. And certainly the demand environment, and the structural challenges on supply, for us as well as for the industry just make it very difficult to meet all of the demand for customers across different segments. So a lot of work that we are doing is to try and assess the threshold level of supply that each of our customers need, encourage them to also, you know, figure out other sources of supply in this environment where we may not be able to meet all of the demand. Of course, we also continue to make sure that our commitments towards our customers are kept. We are certainly very big on that. So, it's a delicate balancing act. It's a difficult environment to meet all of our customers' needs. We're working very, very hard to do the best we can on that front across the different segments of the market, including the ones that you mentioned.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. And then just a quick clarification relative to the Hiroshima clean room expansion you referenced on the call. Can you talk about when that kind of would turn into volume production capability? Thank you.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nSure, Jim. You know, what we've said is that, you know, we are working to develop and deploy next-generation DRAM technologies there with the support of METI and, you know, our Boise R&D team working with our Hiroshima R&D team. So it will be future generations of technology we'll be deploying. And the clean room space will support those future technologies. So, it will be timed to be able to support those, the space needed for those new nodes.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nBut not in 2026, to be fair.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nNo, not in 2026.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Joseph.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Along the same lines, you had talked about the PC market could be limited by DRAM availability. How do you make those kinds of allocation decisions? You know, is it kind of just highest gross margin is the focus? And, you know, how do you make sure that the mid-tier PC companies kind of have enough that their customers, when you need them down the road? Just how are you kind of thinking about balancing the allocation across these different markets?\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nWith a lot of difficulty. Certainly there are competing requirements. We are not just focused on optimizing gross margin. Of course, when we think about pricing in different markets, we try to ensure that the pricing reflects the value of the product that we are selling. And so a lot of the margin performance of different segments starts to get very close to each other in situations like this. With that said, we have had customers of different sizes across different parts of the world for a number of years, decades sometimes. And so we are very mindful of our responsibility to them. And we try to do our best to manage the allocation in an appropriate way to ensure diversity across segments, ensure that we are supporting our strategic customers, and doing the best to maximize our supply towards these customers in times like this, as well as to minimize any impact that could occur to our customers' business due to lack of adequate DRAM on that, as the case may be.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up. You mentioned a few minutes ago, you know, paying down some debt. I mean, it seems like you're gonna generate a really large amount of cash here in the next few quarters if your view that gross margins continue to improve comes true. Just what are the priorities for that cash over time, you know, just what between dividend, buybacks, you know, or other uses of cash that you might think about?\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah, Joe, the priority for our cash generation is always to reinvest in the business. So we're gonna make sure that we're, you know, investing in this case the capacity we need to support the market and ensure that we're getting a clear line of sight to return on that. And, you know, that includes in this case now looking to strike commercial arrangements with customers that reflect the value of our products and our assurance on supply. So that's priority. And also with that, you know, maintaining, you know, the technology leadership that we enjoy today and that we tend to maintain. You know, the balance sheet also will always be a priority. And, you know, that's moving in the right direction. It was already strong and getting stronger every day. In fact, today, on this call, we have record liquidity. You know, we recently got put on positive watch by one of the agencies. You know, we effectively have no net leverage now. In fact, we're positive cash, net cash. Our gross leverage is very low. Now, we do have, on an absolute basis, more debt than we've had historically. So we would expect to bring that down some. And then, you know, we would, as we've said before, intend to grow the dividend over time.\nAnd then, you know, repurchase shares with excess liquidity that we believe we have. Now, we repurchased $300 million in the Q1. If you recall, I mentioned a couple quarters ago, I believe, that when we signed the definitive agreement for the CHIPS program, our repurchases have some limitations. You know, for the first two years, we've ended that first year. We're in that limitation period, the second year. We are able to buy back some stocks this year a little bit more than what we bought back in the Q1. But then we're this time next year, we're largely unconstrained. I mean, there are some requirements on CapEx and R&D, which we'll, you know, we believe we'll easily be able to surpass those. So I think that's the rough cut of the capital allocation.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley of Barclays. Please go ahead, Tom.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. I just have one. Could you remind us as a mix of your CapEx this year, how much was construction CapEx? Or if you haven't given that, where it trends on a normalized basis? Thanks.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nYeah, Tom. So we haven't, but we did say, I think Mark did say that from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, we're doubling our construction CapEx. That gives you some sense. We got, you know,\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nYeah. Just looking for the base.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. Higher.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nAll good.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Your line is open, Aaron.\nWe are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. We can now open the call up for Q&A.\nAs a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone. To remove yourself from the queue, you may press star 11 again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, Aaron.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question and doing the group call. I guess my first question is, you know, Mark, you talked a lot about being constrained and unable to meet some of the demand out there. I know in the quarter you talked about kind of a slight increase in bit shipments of DRAM this quarter. I guess as part of that, did the non-HBM DRAM bits grow sequentially in this quarter? And how, you know, how has your guide, you know, factored in between bit shipments between NAND and flash in this current quarter? Thank you.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nSo I think, Aaron, one thing I wanted to mention was, you know, we are doing all we can to increase bit supply now. And we, you know, we're able to provide additional bits to do 20% bit shipment growth in our fiscal 2026. And, you know, we're doing that through, you know, efforts within existing footprint and just efficiencies in the fabs. We're doing that with node transitions, as we've said, you know, 1-beta and 1-gamma and G9 to get additional bits for DRAM and NAND. And, you know, we're pulling in what we can on construction that will help us largely in 2027, but we are able to provide growth, what we think will be in line with the market in fiscal 2026 or calendar 2026. You know, I think we did have very modest bit shipment growth sequentially in the Q1.\nWe expect a little bit more in Q2, but it's, again, a quarter primarily driven by price as it relates to revenue growth.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, that's helpful, Mark. And then, as a real quick follow-up, you know, as we look forward, I know you mentioned the 14-week period for fiscal Q4, but how would you have us think about the OpEx trajectory from here over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah, I mean, we've guided Q2. It'll be sort of flattish in Q3 relative to the second. Then it'll be up in Q4 and up and plus the additional week.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYep. Thanks, Mark.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho. Please go ahead, Vijay.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nYeah, hi, thanks. Great quarter. So just a quick question, Sumit, Mark, and Manish. When you look at the, you know, DRAM pricing, it was up pretty nicely, 20% sequentially, and NAND was up pretty nicely too. I was just wondering, when you look at the demand side, how do you decide to allocate capacity versus conventional DRAM versus HBM? Because it looks like conventional DRAM profitability is improving very significantly. So just wondering how that reasoning, how you look at that as you look through 2026, 2027. Thanks. I have a follow-up.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nYeah, so good question. I mean, we are in a very interesting environment where the aggregate demand for both DRAM and NAND is substantially higher than the ability to supply to it, not just from a Micron perspective, but, you know, even at an aggregate industry level. So we are not really able to meet the demand for customers across any segment. So all segments are short in terms of what they need from us versus what we are able to supply. And we are also short on the HBM side, non-HBM side, you know, all parts of the market. There is a mismatch between supply and demand, and that continues for the foreseeable future because over the course of the last few months, there has been a very significant and pervasive step-up in demand across the data center customer base.\nSo it has created a set of challenges in being able to meet the demand from our customers on a very broad level. So in terms of allocation, I can't get into too much specifics, but suffice to say that we are working very hard to find the threshold level of supply for all of our customers to minimize the impact to their businesses due to lack of adequate supply. We are working hard to ensure, you know, an adequate level of diversification in our business across segments, across customers, and focus on our strategic customers when it comes to, you know, doing some of these longer-term strategic deals that can improve foundationally our business model. So those are some of the things that we are attempting to do. In the course of all of this, our mix over time will tilt more towards the data center, but we're also trying to remain focused on having diversification across all the other segments of the market as well.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGot it. Then on the ESSD side, you know, you're seeing a very strong pickup with your QLC. It's in 98th ESSDs, as you mentioned, 122 TB, 245 TB. Is there a way to kind of look at what is the attach rate that you're seeing now with ESSDs on AI servers versus last year, especially as some of these inferencing vectors with reasoning and answer and all that stuff to pick up? How do you see that attach rate growing year on year? Thanks.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nThe attach rate is certainly growing, and these AI servers do need more high-capacity SSDs. They also need a significant amount of high-performance SSDs. This is where our Gen 6 SSDs have come into the picture. So we have been the first company to supply qualified Gen 6 SSDs to the market. So that is gaining rapid market traction and contributing to our improved share position in the data center SSD space. And then these high-capacity SSDs that you mentioned, Micron has the leadership position in QLC workloads. And so overall, QLC bit mix is higher than the rest of the industry. So that's an additional capability that we have. And if you look at workloads like KV cache, they do require a lot of higher-capacity SSDs. Now, one additional thing that has happened is that beyond the underlying growth trend of AI servers using more of these SSDs, we've also had our customers not have an adequate amount of HDDs as well. And because of that, there has been a lot of demand coming towards SSDs. And consequently, the ability to supply NAND to our customers has also been oversubscribed due to the combination of all of these trends.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nI do want to note that on SSDs, that if you remember, our business was over $1 billion in Q1 2025. In the Q1 of 2026, the business did clear that. As Sumit mentioned, as sort of the industry is able to get on top of the supply chain-related issues, we expect, and given the demand in that business, we expect that growth to accelerate through the year.\n\nVijay Rakesh\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mark.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open, Vivek.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you. I actually had two questions. First, back on the gross margin, I think you are at 68%. Is there a reasonable way to think about, you know, what can be the path forward? Like, is it 70%? Is it 75%? I know you have not given a specific number, but Mark, is there a way to logically think about where your margins can go in this, you know, in this cycle? Because this is well above the prior peak. So is there a certain business model you have in mind? And the reason I ask the question is because, you know, you have, you know, close to 70% gross margins, right? Your customers, NVIDIA, AMD, are also talking about, you know, very high gross margins or expanding gross margins for their business. So I'm just curious to know how you think conceptually about the path forward for your gross margins?\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah, we're at record-setting levels, and that's positive. We guided to that. There are a lot of favorable factors in that that are driving that. You know, first is the, you know, the demand driven by this, you know, generational change in tech with AI. You know, that's a multi-year build-out done by well-capitalized companies. We think that's sustainable. Fortunately, you know, AI needs more and better memory to perform better. You know, the underlying, you know, secular driver for memory is positive. You know, we're just in a fantastic position with leadership technology, best products in memory and storage, and then we're operating really well, yielding quickly, cost performance is good, capital discipline is good, and then you've got these general structural supply constraints. So when combined with the demand from AI, data center to the edge, actually, you know, we've got this supply shortfall, and you see the price movement associated with that. And this is a not-insignificant, you know, supply gap that's not easy to address in the near term, given, you know, we can do a node transition, but you've got, you know, greenfield capacity needs to be put in place. You've got increasing HBM and the capital intensity associated with that, or silicon intensity associated with that.\nAnd these are, you know, putting on earth the most, you know, some of the largest and most complex factories, you know, on the planet. So we need partnership to do that, and we're going to do it carefully. So, you know, with all that, we do expect that margin can go up from Q2. It'll go up on the basis of, we believe, market conditions that should remain, you know, positive beyond 2026. We believe it's possible based on our ability to deploy bits to premium products in which we're best positioned. We believe that our cost performance is such that it will help us sustain or expand these margins. Now, just the math of being at these levels for a, you know, equivalent increase in price, we're going to get less gross margin expansion. So, you know, there can be, you know, as we mentioned on the call, on the primary earnings call, there's, you know, the increase from here would be more gradual than you've seen in, you know, Q4 to Q1 or Q1 to Q2 quarter guide. But we do believe that margins can go up.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nGot it. And for my follow-up, you know, every time the customer, right, whether it's NVIDIA, Broadcom, or AMD, every time they report, they seem to be upsiding numbers for next year. So when you say you're sold out for HBM, does it mean that you don't have an ability to upside your production? Or, you know, does it mean that you're sold out based on the current level of forecast and you have kind of unit and ASP certainty around that? I'm just trying to understand, you know, what scenarios let them continue to upside the numbers unless it's just a sheer shift between you and your peers. Like, if they continue to upside the numbers, you know, can you help them, you know, do that? How much more flex is there in your production for HBM? Thank you.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. So I think the way to read what we are saying is that, you know, we have visibility to our supply. And of course, we're always trying to improve that. But we have a good understanding of what our supply is. The current situation, you know, when we say sold out for HBM, for example, the HBM supply for 2026, we have reached agreements on volume and price with our customers. Of course, if there are upsides to supply, we are able to very quickly be able to place that upside supply at our customers at, you know, good terms. But when it comes to the overall aggregate business, the demand on us is so much higher than the supply that even, you know, small increases in supply are not going to be able to make a dent in that demand. So we are, you know, more than sold out. I mean, we have a significant amount of unmet demand in our models. And this is just consistent with an environment where the demand is substantially higher than supply for the foreseeable future.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nVivek, I'll just add on, you know, HBM and DRAM, because the whole market is short, and, you know, HBM, you know, production in fab output is shared with DRAM production, right, all on our 1-beta node. So, you know, this constraint is kind of across the entire DRAM market, as Sumit mentioned, and as we said before, which is, you know, incredibly constrained. So we are working hard to try to increase supply for, you know, DRAM, HBM, and NAND. You know, yields have come up really well for both our 1-gamma and our Gen 9. And those are going to be, as we gave colors, the majority of the big growth for next year is coming from those transitions. And we're also, you know, going to have the majority of those of our DRAM bits on 1-gamma in the second half of next year.\nGen 9, as we go through the year, will become the highest volume node for us in NAND. You know, technology transitions are moving aggressively. We're optimizing and looking to maximize production where we can. I just want to point out that we've also said that we expect HBM4 yield ramp to be faster than our HBM3E 12-high yield ramp was, which was already faster than our HBM3 8-high, HBM3E 8-high yield ramp. We're gaining confidence in our HBM capability at scale. You know, all those are things that we're continuing to work on, but just the demand environment is such that it's really, you know, way over supply, whatever we can or what the rest of the industry can supply.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nComes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open, Kevin.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nThank you very much. My question, you know, along those lines of you saying the HBM4 yield is better than HBM3, how does this work with the process node? With the qualification time taking so much longer with HBM, does this change your cadence for process technology? You know, do they stay in production longer?\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nI'm not quite sure, but I think both our HBM3E and HBM4 are on our 1-beta process technology. They both use the similar assembly architecture and process that we've had now from HBM3E 8-high, 12-high, and now at HBM4. So the reason I said that we expect our HBM4 yields to ramp faster than HBM3E 12-high did once we go to production in the, you know, early part of calendar year 2026 and start shipments in calendar Q2 is because of being able to leverage the learnings that we have both on 1-beta for HBM as well as on the packaging and test side because we have common architectures between those products.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nYeah. My question was more in a bigger picture. Will 1-gamma get qualified for HBM4, or will it always be 1-beta?\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nHBM4 is on 1-beta. I know we haven't given specific guidance on, you know, how future generations will be, but HBM4 will be on 1-gamma. You know, the cadence of platform.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\n1-beta.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nI'm sorry, 1-beta. The cadence of our customers' platforms continues to be, you know, rapid every 12 months. We are just going to be focused on delivering new memory solutions, new high-bandwidth memory solutions for our customers on an approximately 12-month cadence. You know, that's not slowing down.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nOkay. And maybe another question, just how quickly can you change your wafer allocation, you know, from HBM to low power to high performance? You know, I guess how far into the process technology process can you change what the final product is?\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nSo they are shared process between the two, between the various different designs that we have on a given DRAM technology node. But the design itself is unique. So when you start one design, whether it's a low power design, a DDR design, or an HBM design, obviously, that's going to be the time frame. So the real time, the answer to your question is that basically it's one process cycle time that we can change between any of these different products.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology",
    "content2": "I think, Kevin, I just want to make sure it's clear that, you know, we have extensive planning that we do around all the products and the product roadmaps, and, you know, what products go on what node at what time. And, you know, there are a lot of factors that go into that. Cost is not the only factor. And in fact, in HBM, it's such a complex product that stability and, you know, turning quickly with the customer is an important factor. So there is some value in 1-beta and as stable and strong a node as that is. And then, you know, when 1-gamma is available at the right time, you know, that we can use that node. Otherwise, you know, we have plenty of other beta requirements that 1-gamma we're ramping that as quickly as we can to get that supply.\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nI mean, generally speaking, we tell our customers that it takes us five months if they want to make changes that use different data in the fab, three months, three and a half months to get to the front end, and six to eight weeks, depending on the complexity of the product on the back end. So roughly speaking, five plus months of lead time. And our customers understand that. They know that these things take a long time.\n\nKevin Cassidy\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Rosenblatt Securities\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Fox Advisors LLC. Your line is open, Steven.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nFounder & CEO, Fox Advisors LLC\n\nHi. Good afternoon. I just had one question. On the CapEx spending that you talked about on the call, are you giving any sort of sense for the breakdown between facilities, equipment, construction, all of that, say, from now and how it might change between 2026 and 2027? That mix? Thanks.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. We've not indicated, you know, anything about 2027 other than that 2027 total CapEx will be up versus 2026. I did on the call, I believe, indicate that, you know, 2025 to 2026, the plans to, you know, our fiscal plans to roughly double, you know, the construction CapEx. And so that gives you sort of an indication on direction of travel. Now, we've got, you know, 2027 we'll have, you know, Idaho 1 finishing. We've got Idaho 2. We've got Japan. We've got, you know, we've got a lot of construction sites. So, you know, those are going to contribute to that sequential, you know, 2026 to 2027 CapEx increase. And Manish.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. I mean, we'll be.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nHBM and.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nWe do have a considerable amount of construction, I was going to say, in Singapore as well, where we've got that. We're going to be equipping our India assembly site, which is just now going from pilot production to production ramp in the beginning of calendar 2026. So, yeah, there's going to be a mix of growth in terms of construction CapEx to fund the midterm and long-term equipment CapEx into, you know, existing clean room that we have right now. And then, of course, assembly investments for both HBM as well as conventional packaging that we'll be making as well.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. I'll just maybe add to this point. You know, Tim asked about capital intensity on the earlier call. You know, we had CapEx as a percent of sales in Q1 was, you know, below 35% that we talked about. And then on Q2, basically where our guide is to the both on the revenue and the CapEx guidance we gave you, you could tell it's in the mid-20s on CapEx as a percent of sales. And, you know, and we've talked about strengthening free cash flow. So we're, you know, we're not only increasing investment in order to get the build supply, we are generating a lot more cash. We had, you know, near 30% free cash flow margin in Q1. And we talked about free cash flow increasing through the year.\nWe paid down debt, you know, $2.7 billion of debt in Q1, bought back $300 million of shares, and went to net cash all in the quarter. It was a record-setting free cash flow in Q1.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nFounder & CEO, Fox Advisors LLC\n\nGot it. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, Jim.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood evening. Thanks for taking my questions. First one would be just in terms of the capacity allocation question that came up earlier. Maybe to put it a different way, can we, I know you're, you know, sort of a key supplier in many embedded and other kind of mission-critical applications, automotive and the like. You know, can you give us a sense about, like, a floor level, a minimum floor level that some of those sort of legacy or embedded applications would reach or not below in terms of production, kind of giving your importance in that market? Or conversely, can we maybe talk a little bit about sort of, you know, what is the maximum level of data center capacity or data center exposure you feel comfortable having?\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. I mean, I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, the overall TAM is also shifting more towards data center. That's just how the dynamics of the industry are playing out. So certainly our portfolio and our mix is shifting towards data center. Our whole goal over time is to keep mixing our products within each segment and across segments with, you know, higher ROI type of homes for our bits and for our output. And that just means that for some time now, the portfolio mix has been an important tailwind for Micron and continues to be a driver of our longer-term financial performance because we have over time shifted more and more of our revenue towards higher margin products and taken a bigger share of the industry profit pool based on that initiative. So that will continue. With that said, you're right. I mean, we do have a large share in automotive, industrial, and several mission-critical applications. So we are making investments in our Manassas, Virginia fab in the US to modernize it, bring 1-alpha technology, DRAM technology into that fab. And so that is going to be an important initiative to continue the support of long life cycle legacy products. And we intend to continue to support them.\nOf course, we also support a lot of these products, customers, and segments from our high-volume fabs. And certainly the demand environment and the structural challenges on supply for us as well as for the industry just make it very difficult to meet all of the demand for customers across different segments. So a lot of work that we are doing is to try and assess the threshold level of supply that each of our customers need, encourage them to also, you know, figure out other sources of supply in this environment where we may not be able to meet all of the demand. Of course, we also continue to make sure that our commitments towards our customers are kept. We are certainly very big on that. So it's a delicate balancing act. It's a difficult environment to meet all of our customers' needs. We're working very, very hard to do the best we can on that front across the different segments of the market, including the ones that you mentioned.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. And then just a quick clarification. Relative to the Hiroshima clean room expansion you referenced on the call, can you talk about when that kind of would turn into volume production capability? Thank you.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nSure, Jim. You know, what we've said is that, you know, we are working to develop and deploy next-generation DRAM technologies there with the support of METI and, you know, our Boise R&D team working with our Hiroshima R&D team. So it will be future generations of technology we'll be deploying. And the clean room space will support those future technologies. So it will be timed to be able to support those, the space needed for those new nodes.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nBut not in 2026, to be fair.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nNo, not in 2026.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Joseph.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. Along the same lines, you had talked about the PC market could be limited by DRAM availability. How do you make those kinds of allocation decisions? You know, is it kind of just highest gross margin is the focus? And, you know, how do you make sure that the mid-tier PC companies kind of have enough that their customers, when you need them down the road, just how are you kind of thinking about balancing the allocation across these different markets?\n\nSumit Sadana\n\nChief Business Officer, Micron Technology\n\nWith a lot of difficulty. Certainly, there are competing requirements. We are not just focused on optimizing gross margin. Of course, when we think about pricing in different markets, we try to ensure that the pricing reflects the value of the product that we are selling. And so a lot of the margin performance of different segments starts to get very close to each other in situations like this. With that said, we have had customers of different sizes across different parts of the world for a number of years, decades sometimes. And so we are very mindful of our responsibility to them. We try to do our best to manage the allocation in an appropriate way to ensure diversity across segments, ensure that we are supporting our strategic customers, and doing the best to maximize our supply towards these customers in times like this, as well as to minimize any impact that could occur to our customers' business due to lack of adequate DRAM on that, as the case may be.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up. You mentioned a few minutes ago, you know, paying down some debt. I mean, it seems like you're going to generate a really large amount of cash here in the next few quarters if your view that gross margins continue to improve comes true. Just what are the priorities for that cash over time, you know, just between dividend, buybacks, you know, or other uses of cash that you might think about?\n\nMark Murphy\n\nCFO, Micron Technology\n\nYeah, Joe, the priority for our cash generation is always to reinvest in the business. So we're going to make sure that we're, you know, investing in this case the capacity we need to support the market and ensure that we're getting a clear line of sight to return on that. And, you know, and that includes in this case now looking to strike commercial arrangements with customers that reflect the value of our products and our assurance on supply. So that's priority. And also with that, you know, maintaining, you know, the technology leadership that we enjoy today and that we intend to maintain. You know, the balance sheet also will always be a priority. And, you know, that's moving the right direction. It was already strong and getting stronger every day. In fact, today on this call, we're record liquidity. You know, we recently got put on positive watch by one of the agencies. You know, we effectively have no net leverage now. In fact, we're positive cash, net cash. Our gross leverage is very low. Now, we do have on an absolute basis more debt than we've had historically. So we would expect to bring that down some. Then, you know, we would, as we've said before, intend to grow the dividend over time and then, you know, repurchase shares with excess liquidity that we believe we have.\nNow, we repurchased $300 million in Q1. If you recall, I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, I believe that when we signed the definitive agreement for the CHIPS program, our repurchases had some limitations. You know, for the first two years, we've ended that first year. We're in that limitation period the second year. We are able to buy back some stocks this year a little bit more than what we bought back in the Q1. But then we're this time next year, we're largely unconstrained. I mean, there are some requirements on CapEx and R&D, which we'll, you know, we believe we'll easily be able to surpass those. So I think that's the rough cut of the capital allocation.\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley of Barclays. Please go ahead, Tom.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nHey, guys, I just have one. Could you remind us as a mix of your CapEx this year how much was construction CapEx? Or, if you haven't given that, where it trends on a normalized basis? Thanks.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nYeah, Tom. So we haven't, but we did say, I think Mark did say that from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, we're doubling our construction CapEx. That gives you some sense. We got, you know.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nYeah. Just looking for the base.\n\nManish Bhatia\n\nEVP of Global Operations, Micron Technology\n\nYeah. Higher. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our time. So that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

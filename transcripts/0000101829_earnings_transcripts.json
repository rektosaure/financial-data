[Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Calio.\n\nChristopher T. Calio\n\nPresident, Pratt & Whitney Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a very strong quarter of results in Q3, which reflects our intense focus on execution, the broad utilization of our core operating system and the durable demand for our products. On the top line, sales were up 13% organically year-over-year with double-digit growth in each of commercial OE, commercial aftermarket and defense. Adjusted segment operating profit was up 19% year-over-year, with growth in margin expansion across all 3 segments. And free cash flow was robust at $4 billion in the quarter, keeping us on track for the full year. Underpinning these results is the continued strength in the global demand for our products and services.\nIn commercial aerospace, passenger air travel has remained resilient with global RPKs on track for approximately 5% growth this year. We continue to see positive OE production trends, which drove a significant increase in production at Collins in the quarter as well as at Pratt, which saw a 6% growth in large commercial engine deliveries. Commercial aftermarket also remained strong, supported by our large and growing installed base, including over $100 billion of out of warranty content at Collins and heavier shop visit content across our MRO activities.\nAircraft retirements have remained low, with only 1.5% of the V2500 fleet retired so far this year. In Pratt Canada, nearly 70,000 engines in service, has seen over 15% growth year-to-date in commercial aftermarket. On the defense side, we continue to be exceptionally well positioned to meet the growing needs of our U.S. and international customers in particular with respect to munitions and integrated air and missile defense, both core capabilities of our company.\nOn the orders front, our book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.63, resulting in a backlog of $251 billion, up 13% year-over-year. The activity in the quarter included $37 billion of new awards, with $23 billion of defense and $14 billion of commercial orders. On the commercial side, through Q3, our book-to-bill this year is 1.71, and our backlog has grown 18% since the end of 2024, showing the exceptional demand for our products and technologies at both Collins and Pratt.\nAt Raytheon, we booked over $8 billion of orders from munitions, including approximately $2.5 billion for GEM-T to support multiple international customers and $2.1 billion for AMRAAM the largest order in the 30-year history of that program. Raytheon was also awarded a significant counter drone contract for Coyote production from the U.S. Army. Coyote has proven to be extremely effective in the field. and we've recently developed a lower cost nonkinetic Coyote payload to combat drone swarms. And Pratt was awarded over $3 billion to support the F135 engine, including the lot 18 production contract.\nSo overall, our end markets and operational performance remains strong as we enter the fourth quarter. Based on this, we're raising our full year outlook for adjusted sales and EPS and maintaining our free cash flow outlook of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. Neil will take you through the details in a few minutes. But before that, want to provide an update on our strategic priorities on Slide 4.\nStarting with executing on our commitments. Our focus on driving performance improvements through our core operating system has continued to generate productivity across RTX. Through Q3, we have delivered 10% organic sales growth this year while keeping head count flat across the organization. This has been a key enabler in driving 6 consecutive quarters of year-over-year adjusted segment margin expansion. With respect to the GTF fleet management plan, our financial and technical outlook remains on track. PW1100 MRO output was up 9% in the quarter and is up 21% year-to-date. We continue to work with our supply chain partners to increase the flow of critical value stream material to ramp MRO output.\nIn Q3, we saw another quarter of solid progress with growth in isothermal forgings, up 16% and structural castings up 29% year-over-year. Exiting the third quarter, this material flow has supported a record high number of PW1100 Gate 3 starts which is where we reassemble engines during a shop visit, putting Pratt in a position to deliver about 30% MRO output growth for the year. And across the company, we continue to focus on increasing critical manufacturing capacity to support growth, including investing over $600 million this year in expansion projects.\nFor example, Raytheon is on track to invest $300 million in capacity expansion to deliver the growing backlog. This includes the Redstone Missile integration facility in Huntsville, Alabama, which will increase site capacity by 50% and support the growing demand for our naval programs, including the standard missile franchise. Shifting to innovating for future growth. Pratt Canada was selected by the EU's Clean aviation program to design and integrate a hybrid electric propulsion demonstrator for regional aircraft. This system integrates a 250-kilowatt electric motor and advanced Propeller technology from Collins and is expected to improve fuel efficiency by approximately 20%.\nAdditionally, Collins is nearing final certification of its next-generation braking system for the A321 XLR aircraft. The design incorporates proprietary carbon technology and is expected to extend break life and drive improved profitability and our maintenance support portfolio. And Raytheon recently demonstrated 2 significant effector technology achievements. The AMRAAM team successfully completed the longest ever air-to-air shot from the fifth-generation fighter. In the storm breaker team in just 50 days, designed, developed and tested a new ground launch demonstrator version of this air launched effector, which will expand the capabilities and future applications for this product.\nAnd finally, we remain focused on leveraging the breadth and scale of RTX. As we've highlighted before, we continue to develop and deploy our data analytics and AI tools to improve productivity and the speed and quality of decision-making in our business. We're strategically using these tools to support the highest impact opportunities across the company, including increasing munitions in OE production rates, growing GTF MRO output and improving sales and inventory planning and management. For example, the Raytheon AMRAAM team has deployed multiple proprietary digital AI tools to proactively identify production bottlenecks and reduce rework which has contributed to output more than doubling year-to-date through Q3 on the program. These examples highlight the progress that we continue to make across our strategic priorities, and I'm pleased with the results they are yielding throughout the company.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Neil to take you through the third quarter results and our updated outlook for the full year. Neil?\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nChief Financial Officer & Vice President, The Pratt & Whitney Co., Inc.\n\nAll right, Chris. Thanks. I'm on Slide 5. In the third quarter, adjusted sales of $22.5 billion were up 12% on an adjusted basis and 13% organically. As Chris mentioned, this was a very strong result in the quarter with commercial aftermarket up 18% and commercial OE and defense, both up 10%. Adjusted segment operating profit of $2.8 billion was up 19%, and we saw 70 basis points of consolidated segment margin expansion with contributions from all 3 segments.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.70 was up 17% from the prior year, driven primarily by segment operating profit growth. In addition, the quarter also benefited from several tax items, including legal entity reorganizations which impacted EPS by approximately $0.12. These items more than offset a $0.04 headwind from the recently enacted tax legislation.\nOn a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $1.41 and included $0.29 of acquisition accounting adjustments. Free cash flow was very strong at $4 billion driven by working capital improvement, including strong collections and some advanced payments tied to contract awards in the quarter that were accelerated from Q4. Cash flow for the quarter also included approximately $275 million for powder metal related compensation and $220 million of tariff-related impacts.\nWith respect to capital allocation, we returned over $900 million to shareowners through dividends in the quarter. And with our focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we paid down $2.9 billion of debt in the quarter. And finally, during the quarter, we completed the sale of the actuation business. And earlier this month, we also completed the sale of Collins Simmons Precision Products business for $765 million.\nOkay. Turning to Slide 6. Let me provide a few details on our updated outlook for the full year. As you've seen with our third quarter results, execution and momentum across all 3 segments continues to be strong. Given this operating performance, along with the strength of our end markets, we are updating our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we are raising our full year adjusted sales outlook to a range of $86.5 billion to $87 billion, up from our prior range of $84.75 billion to $85.5 billion. This now translates to between 8% and 9% organic sales growth for the year, up from our prior range of 6% to 7%.\nBy channel, at the RTX level and adjusting for divestitures, we now expect commercial aftermarket sales to grow mid-teens year-over-year, up from our prior outlook of low teens, primarily driven by heavier shop visit content that we saw in Q3 at Pratt. On the commercial OE side, we expect sales to grow around 10% for the year, up from our prior outlook of high single digits year-over-year. And on defense, we continue to expect sales to grow mid-single digits. On the bottom line, given the performance across all 3 segments, we are increasing adjusted earnings per share $0.30 on the low end of our range and $0.25 on the high end.\nAt the midpoint, the increase is primarily driven by approximately $0.20 of improved segment operating profit with the rest coming from a few below-the-line items. And within this updated outlook, there is no change to the net tariff headwind we discussed on our last earnings call. All in, we now see adjusted EPS at a new range of between $6.10 and $6.20 for the full year up from our prior range of $5.80 to $5.95. Specific to Q4, we expect another quarter of strong operational performance at the segment level. with segment profit up around 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of tariffs and recent divestitures at Collins.\nBelow the line, the Q3 $0.12 tax benefit I mentioned will not repeat; we expect a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. On free cash flow, we are on track to achieve our outlook of between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the year. The primary drivers of our fourth quarter free cash flow will be the same as we saw in the third quarter: segment operating profit growth and working capital improvement.\nAnd as we look beyond this year, we feel good about the momentum we're seeing across our business, including our growing backlog and end market strength that continues to position us well for continued top line growth, margin expansion and solid free cash flow conversion. And like we do every year, we'll be back on our fourth quarter earnings call in January with our detailed outlook for 2026.\nSo with that, let me hand it over to Nathan to take you through the segment results for the third quarter.\n\nNathan Ware\n\nSenior Director-Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.\n\nAll right. Thanks, Neil. Starting with Collins on Slide 7. Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, up 8% on an adjusted basis and 11% organically, driven by strength across all 3 channels. Adjusting for divestitures by channel, Commercial OE sales were up 16% versus prior year, driven primarily by higher volume on narrowbody platforms. Recall, last year included the impact of the Boeing work stoppage in the quarter.\nCommercial aftermarket sales were up 13%, driven by a 17% increase in mods and upgrades, a 13% increase in parts and repair and a 10% increase in provisioning. Defense sales were up 6% versus the prior year, driven by higher volume across multiple programs and platforms, including a survivable airborne operations center program. Adjusted operating profit of $1.2 billion was up $98 million versus the prior year as drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket, defense and commercial OE volume, along with lower R&D expense was partially offset by unfavorable commercial OE mix and the impact of higher tariffs across the business.\nTurning to Collins full year outlook. We continue to expect sales to grow mid-single digits year-over-year on an adjusted basis and high single digits organically. And we now expect operating profit growth between $325 million and $375 million versus 2024, up from our prior expectation of between $275 million and $350 million driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume. Keep in mind, this updated profit range includes an approximately $60 million year-over-year headwind associated with the business divestitures completed this year.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 8. Sales of $8.4 billion were up 16% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven by strength across all channels. Commercial OE sales were up 5%, driven by increased volume in large commercial engines and favorable mix in Pratt Canada. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 23% and driven by higher volume in both large commercial engines and Pratt Canada. In military engines, sales were up 15% in the quarter driven primarily by the F135 program, including higher volume associated with Lot 18 contract award.\nAdjusted operating profit of $751 million was up $154 million versus the prior year, driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military volume. This growth more than offset increased large commercial OE deliveries, higher SG&A expense and the impact of higher tariffs across the business.\nTurning to Pratt's full year outlook. We now expect sales to grow low to mid-teens on an adjusted and organic basis. an increase from our prior range of up low double digits, driven by strength in commercial aftermarket and favorable commercial OE mix. And we now expect operating profit growth between $350 million and $400 million versus 2024, up from our prior expectation of between $200 million and $275 million driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable commercial OE mix.\nNow turning to Raytheon on Slide 9. Sales of $7 billion in the quarter were up 10% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven by higher volume on land and air defense systems, including international Patriot and higher volume on naval programs, including multiple classified programs, SM-6 and the Evolved SeaSparrow missile. Adjusted operating profit of $859 million was up $198 million versus the prior year, driven by favorable program mix, including international Patriot, improved net productivity and higher volume. Net productivity improved $57 million year-over-year.\nRecall, Q3 of last year included an unfavorable impact of $53 million related to a classified program. Bookings in the quarter were $15.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 2.27 and a record backlog of $72 billion. International backlog represented 44% of Raytheon's total at the end of the quarter and was up 18% on a dollar basis year-over-year. Other key awards in the quarter included $1.5 billion for LTMs production and over $500 million for Stinger production. These awards will support both domestic and international customers. And on a rolling 12-month basis, Raytheon's book-to-bill is 1.43.\nTurning to Raytheon's full year outlook. We continue to expect sales to grow low single digits year-over-year on an adjusted basis and mid-single digits organically. And we now expect operating profit growth between $400 million and $450 million versus 2024, up from our prior expectation of between $225 million and $300 million driven by the favorable international program mix we saw during the third quarter.\nWith that, I'll hand it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher T. Calio\n\nPresident, Pratt & Whitney Company, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Nathan. We have great momentum across RTX. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth this quarter, and our end markets remain robust as seen by our recent customer wins and 1.63 book-to-bill in the quarter. Our backlog now stands at $251 billion and we remain focused on our strategic priorities across the company, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver strong growth in sales, earnings and free cash flow well beyond this year.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your operator for today.\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nOn the call today are Chris Calio, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Nathan Ware, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nThis call is being webcast live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from RTX website at www.rtx.com.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments and net nonrecurring and/or significant items often referred to by management as other significant items.\nThe company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nRTX's SEC filings, including its forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\n[Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Calio.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We delivered very solid results in the second quarter as we continued to execute in a dynamic operating environment. On the top line, sales were up 9% organically year-over-year, including 16% commercial aftermarket growth, continuing the momentum from Q1. Segment operating profit was up 12% year-over-year, supported by growth across all 3 of our segments. And free cash flow for the quarter was approximately breakeven as we previously discussed, primarily related to the 4-week work stoppage at Pratt in May, which we expect to recover in the second half of this year.\nWe also continued to see exceptionally strong demand for our products with a Q2 book-to-bill of 1.86. And our backlog now stands at $236 billion, up 15% year-over-year and 9% sequentially driven by several notable wins in the quarter.\nPratt booked over 1,000 GTF engine orders, including up to 177 aircraft for Wizz Air and 91 aircraft for Frontier Airlines as they further expand their GTF-powered fleets. And Raytheon booked over $5 billion of integrated air and missile defense awards, including $1.1 billion for AIM-9X effectors. This is the largest order in the history of the program and will benefit the U.S. and international customers.\nI'll now turn to the current operating environment. In commercial aerospace, OE production was strong and in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. And we remain positive on the ramp continuing in the back half, supporting growing demand for our products.\nGlobal RPKs are also expected to continue to grow over 5% for the year, which supports low retirement levels and strong commercial aftermarket demand. For example, our V2500-powered aircraft fleet has seen a 1% retirement rate so far this year.\nOn the defense side, the growing need for air dominance is creating unprecedented demand for our core defense products across RTX. The U.S. budget reconciliation legislation that passed earlier this month contains over $150 billion for additional defense spending with about $50 billion of funding for Golden Dome and munitions, again, both core areas for RTX.\nIn longer term, NATO allies have agreed to increase core defense spending to 3.5% of GDP over the next decade with an increased focus on integrated air and missile defense.\nTo support the growing demand across Europe, we continued to expand our regional partnerships. For example, in the quarter, Raytheon entered into an industrial cooperation agreement with the Spanish Ministry of Defence that will support the production ramp for Patriot in the local region. So overall, demand remains strong across our end markets and supports continued top line growth across the business.\nOn the trade front, it continues to be fluid, but our outlook on the impact of tariffs has improved for the year as there have been some positive announcements to date such as the U.K. agreement, which provides exemptions for aerospace components.\nWe also continued to improve our ability to mitigate tariff headwinds, including optimizing material flow where possible and through pricing actions.\nAs a result of these developments and our strong first half performance, we're increasing our adjusted sales outlook for the full year. We're also revising our adjusted EPS outlook to incorporate drop-through on the higher sales, continued cost discipline across the business, and our current assessment of tariff impacts.\nAnd for free cash flow, we are maintaining our full year outlook.\nNeil will take you through these details in a few minutes. But before he does, let me provide an update on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities on Slide 4. First is executing on our commitments. On the GTF fleet management plan, our financial and technical outlook remains consistent with our prior comments. Isothermal forging output was up 12% versus the prior year and 10% sequentially, which supported a 22% year-over-year improvement in PW1100 MRO output this quarter despite the Pratt work stoppage. And we remain on track for over 30% MRO output improvement for the full year, which is a key enabler to reducing AOGs in the second half.\nAnd at Raytheon, the team is leveraging our core operating system to significantly increase production this year for multiple sectors, including GEM-T, Coyote and AMRAAM. In the quarter, both GEM-T and Coyote saw output more than double year-over-year.\nNext is innovating for future growth. Autonomy and AI are significant parts of our RTX cross-company technology road map. Earlier this month, we announced a new partnership with Shield AI to integrate AI-based sensor and target recognition capabilities into select Raytheon products. This includes loitering munitions and our Multi-Spectral Targeting System, which is a battle-tested sensor package that provides long-range surveillance and target tracking for a variety of munitions.\nAlso in the quarter, Raytheon announced the collaboration with Kongsberg to co-develop subassemblies of the GhostEye radar. The GhostEye system adapts the fundamental technology of LTAMDS into a smaller 360-degree solution for advanced medium-range tracking that will detect drones, cruise missiles and other airborne threats. This system builds on the battle-tested NASAMS solution, which has 13 partner countries and over 1,000 intercepts over just the last few years. And it's another example of how we're expanding our regional partnerships in Europe.\nAnd lastly, we continued to leverage the breadth and scale of RTX. Across the company, we're implementing our proprietary data analytics and AI platform to accelerate our backlog and increase productivity across our operations. This platform is our digital backbone that connects our enterprise systems, thousands of shop floor machines and millions of hours of product data to enable more efficient operations and smarter and faster decision-making.\nFor example, in Collins avionics business, our engineers are using this platform to reduce software development times by around 30%, allowing us to deliver faster and more frequent software upgrades to our customers.\nShifting to the portfolio. In the quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell Collins' Simmonds Precision Products business for $765 million. And yesterday, we completed the $1.8 billion sale of our actuation business. Both transactions highlight our efforts to focus and invest in our core capabilities with proceeds to be used to further strengthen our balance sheet.\nLastly, we raised our dividend by 8% in the quarter, reflecting our confidence in executing our backlog and the long-term cash generation capability of our company. With this dividend increase, we now expect to deliver $37 billion of capital to shareowners from the date of the merger through the end of this year. And we remain committed to a long-term capital return policy that includes growing our dividend and returning excess capital to shareowners.\nOverall, we continue to make steady progress on our key priorities, and I'm pleased with the performance and momentum through the first half of the year.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Neil to take you through the results and our updated outlook for the full year. Neil?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nAll right, Chris. Thanks. I'm on Slide 5. In the second quarter, adjusted sales of $21.6 billion were up 9% on both an adjusted and organic basis. Growth was led by strength across all 3 channels with commercial aftermarket up 16%, commercial OE up 7% and defense up 6%.\nSegment operating profit of $2.7 billion was up 12%, driven by drop-through on higher volume and improved defense mix. And we saw 30 basis points of consolidated segment margin expansion.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.56 was up 11% from the prior year, driven by segment operating profit growth and a lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share included approximately $0.06 of higher tariff costs.\nOn a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $1.22 and included $0.28 of acquisition accounting adjustments and $0.06 of restructuring and other items.\nAs expected, free cash flow was an outflow of $72 million. This included approximately $250 million for powder metal-related compensation and $175 million related to tariff impacts.\nSo overall, our first half results were strong, driven by end market demand and execution across all 3 segments.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll take you through our outlook. Starting with the top line, given our strong first half performance we are increasing our full year adjusted sales outlook to a range of $84.75 billion to $85.5 billion, up from our prior range of $83 billion to $84 billion.\nThis translates to between 6% and 7% organic sales growth for the year, up from our prior range of 4% to 6%.\nLooking at it by channel at the RTX level and adjusting for divestitures, we now expect commercial aftermarket sales to grow low teens, up from our prior outlook of around 10% growth.\nOn the commercial OE side, sales are expected to grow high single digits year-over-year, up from our prior outlook of mid-single digits.\nAnd we continue to expect defense sales to grow mid-single digits across the company.\nOn the bottom line, we continue to improve our ability to mitigate tariff headwinds, including expanding USMCA coverage, qualifying additional parts for military duty-free exemptions and maximizing the use of free trade zones in addition to the items that Chris mentioned.\nAs a result, our current assessment of 2025 tariff costs, net of mitigation, is around $500 million with approximately $125 million already incurred in the first half of the year. In addition, we see the associated cash impact to be around $600 million for the full year, again, a notable improvement. We have incorporated these impacts into our updated full year outlook.\nWith respect to taxes, we are pleased with several elements of the recently enacted legislation that restores the full expensing of research and development costs and maintains stability in the corporate tax rate, and we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 19.5% for the full year.\nIn addition, improved operating performance, including additional profit growth at Raytheon and volume drop-through at Pratt and Collins is providing $0.10 of EPS improvement, which partially offsets the $0.30 tariff headwind.\nAll in, we now see adjusted EPS at a new range of $5.80 to $5.95 for the full year versus our prior range of $6 to $6.15.\nOn free cash flow, we continue to expect between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year as the headwind from tariffs will be offset by the benefit from improved cash taxes. The primary drivers of our second half cash flow growth will come from segment profit and working capital improvements, including the recovery from the work stoppage at Pratt.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Nathan to take you through the segment results for the second quarter.\n\nNathan Ware\n\nSenior Director-Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Neil. Starting with Collins on Slide 7. In Sales were $7.6 billion in the quarter, up 9% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven by strength in commercial aftermarket and defense.\nAdjusting for divestitures, by channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 13%, driven by a 20% increase in mods and upgrades, a 12% increase in parts and repair and a 9% increase in provisioning.\nDefense sales were up 11%, driven by higher volume across multiple programs and platforms, including the F-35 and the Survivable Airborne Operations Center programs.\nCommercial OE sales were up 1% versus the prior year as expected lower volume on the 737 MAX was more than offset by higher volume on other platforms, including the 787.\nAdjusted operating profit of $1.2 billion was up $104 million versus the prior year as drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and defense volume, favorable defense mix and lower R&D expense more than offset unfavorable commercial OE mix and the impact of higher tariffs across the business.\nTurning to Collin's full year outlook. We now expect sales to grow mid-single digits on an adjusted basis and high single digits organically, up from our prior range of up low single digits on an adjusted basis and up mid-single digits organically, driven by strength in commercial aftermarket and defense.\nWith respect to operating profit, we now expect growth between $275 million and $350 million versus 2024 compared to our prior expectation of up between $500 million and $600 million, driven by the expected impact of tariffs, which was partially offset by increased volume drop-through.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 8. Despite the impact of the 4-week work stoppage that occurred in the quarter, sales of $7.6 billion were up 12% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven by strength in commercial aftermarket and commercial OE.\nCommercial aftermarket sales were up 19%, driven by higher volume in large commercial engines and favorable mix in Pratt Canada.\nCommercial OE sales were up 15%, driven by favorable mix in large commercial engines and higher Pratt Canada volume. In military engines, sales were flat driven by F135 volume, including the impact of contract award timing.\nAdjusted operating profit of $608 million was up $71 million versus the prior year as favorable commercial OE mix, drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and lower R&D expense more than offset unfavorable commercial aftermarket mix, the impact of higher tariffs across the business and the 4-week work stoppage.\nTurning to Pratt's full year outlook. We now expect sales to grow low double digits on an adjusted and organic basis, an increase from our prior range of up high single digit driven by strength in commercial aftermarket and commercial OE mix.\nWith respect to operating profit, we now expect growth between $200 million and $275 million versus 2024 compared to our prior expectation of up between $325 million and $400 million, driven by the expected impact of tariffs partially offset by increased volume drop-through.\nNow turning to Raytheon on Slide 9. Sales of $7 billion in the quarter were up 6% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven by higher volume on land and air defense systems, including international Patriot and NASAMS and higher volume on naval programs, including SPY-6 and Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile. This was partially offset by expected lower development program volume within air and space defense systems.\nAdjusted operating profit of $809 million was up $100 million versus the prior year, driven by favorable program mix including international Patriot and higher volume.\nBookings in the quarter were $9.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.35 and a backlog of $63.5 billion. On a rolling 12-month basis, Raytheon's book-to-bill is 1.49.\nOther key awards in the quarter included over $1.2 billion for SM-3 production and approximately $650 million for SPY-6 production.\nTurning to Raytheon's full year outlook. We continue to expect sales to grow low single digits on an adjusted basis and mid-single digits organically with operating profit growth between $225 million and $300 million versus 2024, up from our prior expectation of between $150 million and $225 million, driven by favorable international program mix.\nWith that, I'll hand it back over to Chris for some closing remarks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nAI Assigned\n\nOkay. Thanks, Nathan. I'm on Slide 10. We have great momentum across RTX through the first half of the year. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and our end markets remain robust as seen by our recent customer wins and 1.86 book-to-bill in the quarter. And our backlog now stands at $236 billion.\nLooking toward the second half of the year. We are focused on what we can control: executing our backlog, driving cost discipline and investing in innovation.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nOn the call today are Chris Calio, President and Chief Executive Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Nathan Ware, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from RTX website at www.rtx.com.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments and net nonrecurring and/or significant items often referred to by management as other significant items.\nThe company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. RTX SEC filings, including its forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Calio.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We're clearly in the middle of a highly dynamic operating environment right now, and we'll, of course, talk about that today. But first, I want to highlight the strong financial and operational performance we delivered in the first quarter.\nStarting with the top line, we generated 8% organic sales growth. We also drove 120 basis points of segment margin expansion, which included strong contributions from each business segment. And we generated strong free cash flow, an improvement of more than $900 million versus the prior year. On an organic basis, commercial aftermarket sales were up 21%, commercial OE sales were up 3% on a difficult prior year compare and defense sales were up 4%. Underlying these results is our continued focus on execution and the deployment of our core operating system.\nStarting with the GTF program, PW1100 MRO output was up 35% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, and we remain on track for over a 30% improvement for the full year. This output is a key enabler for reducing AOGs, which we continue to expect to trend down in the back half of the year. Isothermal forging output also continued to be strong in the quarter after record output last year, up over 10% versus prior year. And our outlook for the fleet management plans remains consistent with our prior comments.\nOur focus on supply chain also continues to yield results. At Collins, overdue line items across all suppliers were down over 20% versus the prior year. And at Raytheon, material receipts were up again, marking 8 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth.\nAlso in the quarter, we made significant progress on 2 future franchises in our innovation pipeline. Pratt received FAA certification for the GTF Advantage, an important milestone for the program. The Advantage incorporates all of the learnings from the first 10 years of the GTF engine in service. We expect it to provide up to 2x the time on wing compared to the current engine, and it will enter service with full life LLPs. We remain on track for initial deliveries to Airbus later this year. We're also certifying an upgrade package to incorporate roughly 90% to 95% of the GTF Advantage durability improvements into the existing fleet during MRO visits. We are targeting next year to have this package available for customers.\nAnd at Raytheon, we have completed the prototyping and development phase of the lower-tier air and missile defense sensor or LTAMDS program. LTAMDS brings advanced 360-degree performance to the market and more than twice the tracking range compared to the existing Patriot radar system, enhancing protection against complex threat scenarios, including large quantities of unmanned aircraft systems and hypersonic weapons.\nLTAMDS can be integrated with battle-tested, industry-leading capabilities of Patriot, which is the backbone of air and missile defense for 19 partner countries around the world. LTAMDS will now transition into the production and deployment phase with continued deliveries to the U.S. this year and next, followed by deliveries to European customers. So overall, we've made good progress in the quarter on multiple fronts, and we're pleased with our performance.\nOkay. Let me turn to the operating environment and our current thinking on tariffs, which we have outlined in terms of potential direct impacts on Slide 4. Generally speaking, the aerospace and defense sector has operated in a duty-free environment, and that has been instrumental to the industry maintaining one of the largest trade surpluses across American manufacturing industries for decades. Our industrial base is largely located in the U.S., including about 70% of our employees and the majority of our total labor manufacturing hours. And on the supply chain side, about 65% of our product spend is with U.S. suppliers.\nWe also continue to invest in our U.S. industrial base. Over the last 5 years, we've invested nearly $10 billion to enhance our domestic manufacturing footprint and capabilities. And this year, we're planning another $2 billion of investment to further increase our U.S. capacity. For example, in the first quarter, Raytheon completed a $60 million expansion project in Tucson, Arizona, which will significantly increase capacity to support growing effector demand. And this year, Pratt has kicked off a $285 million investment to expand our foundry in Asheville, North Carolina. This is part of our broader turbine airfoil production strategy to support growing demand and to maintain a competitive cost structure.\nCombined, this industrial base and significant investment supports our position as a net exporter of goods out of the U.S. with exports exceeding imports by over $12 billion last year. But like many companies in the industry, our supply chain and customer base are global, and we import raw materials, parts and modules from around the world. In light of this, we would be impacted if the current environment were to stay in place because not all regulatory and operational mitigations would address our tariff exposure.\nBut the situation remains fluid, and it's difficult to assess the impact of multiple variables, from a change in the duration and size of the current tariffs to countermeasures taken by other countries, to the potential secondary effects of customer reactions and supply chain and operational disruptions. As a result, we have not included the potential tariff impacts in our outlook for the year at this time.\nThat said, we believe it is prudent and helpful to at least share some estimates of the direct impact of the current tariffs on our outlook, assuming they were to stay in effect throughout the year. Now these estimates don't include secondary tariff-related impacts, such as changes to customer demand.\nSo let me turn it over to Neil to take you through our assessment of the impacts. Neil?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nOkay. Thanks, Chris. Let me take you through the various categories of incremental direct tariff exposure and the level of pretax operating profit impacts, net of available mitigations we have currently assessed for each category.\nStarting with Canada and Mexico, assuming the USMCA agreement continues, we estimate there would be a cost impact of around $250 million, assuming current tariff rates remain in place for the rest of the year. With respect to China, at current U.S. and China tariff rates, we estimate there would also be a cost impact of around $250 million, again, assuming the tariffs remain in place through year-end. Keep in mind, our business in China primarily serves local customers, and China accounts for only about 2% of our global imports.\nAs it relates to the rest of the world, we estimate there would be a cost impact of around $300 million at the 10% tariff rate currently in place. And finally, on steel and aluminum, we estimate the cost will be around $50 million for the year. For all of these scenarios, we would expect to see most of the impact in the back half of the year as inventory is liquidated.\nAnd from a cash perspective, we assume there would be a bit larger drag due to the timing of inventory consumption and duty drawback recovery, and this impact would be evenly spread over the rest of the year. Going forward, we expect the landscape to continue to evolve, and we'll update our assessment accordingly.\nNow let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nAI Assigned\n\nAs Neil said, we're closely tracking the changes in the global trade environment. While some of the exemptions we have had in the past will continue to apply, such as the military duty-free exemption for U.S. government and foreign military sale contracts, we are also working to implement and capture additional mitigations. These include regulatory mechanisms, such as temporary imports under bond, duty drawbacks, free trade zones, contractual and pricing actions and implementing operational changes such as leveraging different suppliers and assembly sites.\nDespite these near-term uncertainties, I want to remind everyone that our company remains exceptionally well positioned in all of our key end markets given the strength of our product portfolio, which is reflected in our backlog. We exited the quarter with a backlog of $217 billion, which was up 8% year-over-year and includes $125 billion of commercial orders and $92 billion of defense awards.\nOn the commercial side, we remain cautiously optimistic that aircraft utilization will remain strong, supporting continued aftermarket demand. But of course, we will closely monitor consumer sentiment as we approach the busy summer travel season.\nOn the OE front, we expect production of new aircraft to remain strong given the backlog levels at our OEM customers. On the defense side, we're encouraged that the continuing resolution passed with funding for key priorities, including next-generation adaptive propulsion, standard missile effectors, LTAMDS radars and our Coyote counter-UAS system.\nThere's also a growing commitment to increase defense budgets globally. Of note, the European Union has pushed for an additional $850 billion in defense spending over the next 4 years, focused on munitions and integrated air and missile defense products, which are fully aligned to our core capabilities, such as Patriot, NASAMS, Coyote and F-35. These are all battle-proven and tested systems that our partners and allies rely on each and every day for national security.\nAdditionally, we have strong and long-standing international coproduction and co-sustainment agreements with European companies, including MBDA and Kongsberg that position us well to help meet the increased demand across the region.\nBefore I hand it back over to Neil, let me reiterate that we are very pleased with the performance in the first quarter and the progress we are making on our 3 strategic priorities: executing on our commitments, innovating for future growth and leveraging our breadth and scale. And while the industry's operating environment is dynamic, our team is experienced and will remain focused on execution and the things in our control.\nOkay. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to take you through the first quarter results. Neil?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nThanks, Chris. I'm on Slide 5.\nAs Chris said, operationally, we're off to a strong start to the year. In the first quarter, adjusted sales of $20.3 billion were up 5% and up 8% organically, led by strength in commercial aftermarket. Segment operating profit of $2.5 billion was up 18% as drop-through on higher volume, the benefit of cost reduction activities and improved defense mix drove 120 basis points of segment margin expansion, with strong performance in all 3 segments and highlighting the continued momentum on our cost transformation activities across the company.\nWe've now seen 4 consecutive quarters of year-over-year consolidated segment margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 was up 10% from the prior year, driven by segment operating profit growth, which was partially offset by an expected higher effective tax rate and a higher share count. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $1.14 and included $0.27 of acquisition accounting adjustments and $0.06 of restructuring and other items. And free cash flow was $792 million in the quarter, which included approximately $200 million for powder metal-related compensation.\nOn the capital deployment front, we returned $890 million of capital to shareowners during the quarter, primarily through dividends. And on the sale of the actuation business at Collins, we continue to make good progress on key milestones and are working through the remaining items required to close.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Nathan to take you through the segment results for the first quarter. Nathan?\n\nNathan Ware\n\nSenior Director-Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Neil.\nStarting with Collins on Slide 6. Sales were $7.2 billion in the quarter, up 8% on an adjusted basis and 9% organically, driven by strength in commercial aftermarket and defense. Adjusting for divestitures, by channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 13%, driven by a 15% increase in parts and repair, an 18% increase in mods and upgrades and a 1% increase in provisioning.\nDefense sales were up 10%, primarily due to higher volume across multiple programs and platforms, including multiple C4I programs, the Survivable Airborne Operations Center program and F-35. And commercial OE sales were up 2% versus the prior year as higher A220, regional and 787 volume was partially offset by lower 737 MAX volume.\nAdjusted operating profit of $1.2 billion was up $179 million versus the prior year, driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and defense volume. The resulting margins at Collins expanded 130 basis points in the quarter versus prior year.\nTurning to Collins full year outlook. Excluding the potential impact of the tariffs that Neil discussed, we continue to expect sales to grow low single digits on an adjusted basis and mid-single digits organically, with operating profit growth between $500 million and $600 million versus 2024.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 7. Sales of $7.4 billion were up 14% on both an adjusted and organic basis, with sales growth across all 3 channels. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 28% in the quarter, driven by higher volume and favorable mix across both Large Commercial Engines and Pratt Canada. In military engines, sales were up 4%, driven by increased engine deliveries on the Tanker program and higher volume on the F135 Engine Core Upgrade program.\nCommercial OE sales were up 3% in the quarter, primarily driven by increased deliveries. As a reminder, commercial OE sales were up 64% in Q1 of 2024. Adjusted operating profit of $590 million was up $160 million versus the prior year as increased deliveries in Large Commercial Engines was more than offset by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable commercial aftermarket mix. Lower R&D expense more than offset higher SG&A expense. All of this resulted in margin expansion of 130 basis points in the quarter versus prior year.\nTurning to Pratt's full year outlook. Excluding the potential impact of tariffs, we continue to expect sales to grow high single digits on an adjusted and organic basis, with operating profit growth between $325 million and $400 million versus 2024.\nNow turning to Raytheon on Slide 8. Sales of $6.3 billion in the quarter were down 5% on an adjusted basis as a result of the cybersecurity divestiture completed at the end of the first quarter of last year. As expected, on an organic basis, sales were up 2%, driven by higher volume on land and air defense systems, including international Patriot and LTAMDS, which was partially offset by lower development program volume within air and space defense systems.\nAdjusted operating profit of $678 million was up $48 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by favorable mix and $15 million of improved net productivity. This was partially offset by the absence of the cybersecurity business. The resulting margins at Raytheon expanded 120 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year.\nBookings in the quarter were $4.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.7. And on a rolling 12-month basis, Raytheon's book-to-bill is 1.35. Key awards in the quarter included over $750 million for Netherlands' air and missile defense capabilities, about $650 million of classified awards and about $250 million of Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile orders for Japan.\nTurning to Raytheon's full year outlook. Excluding the potential impact of tariffs, we continue to expect sales to grow low single digits on an adjusted basis and mid-single digits organically, with operating profit growth between $150 million and $225 million versus 2024.\nWith that, I'll hand it back over to Chris for some closing remarks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nAI Assigned\n\nOkay. Thanks, Nathan.\nI'm on Slide 9. Before we open up to questions, I want to emphasize that RTX is built to perform in any environment. The fundamentals of our business remain intact, and our continued focus on execution has delivered a strong start to the year. We have industry-leading products on the highest-growth platforms in commercial aerospace and defense. And our commitment to innovation over the long term continues to pay off with next-generation products such as the GTF Advantage and LTAMDS, demonstrating our leadership in future growth opportunities.\nThe long-term structural demand for our products and technologies all remain in place today. Additionally, the need for our defense solutions that provide critical security to the U.S. and our allies has never been stronger. And so I'm confident that these trends will drive significant growth for us over the coming years.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter adjusted sales, EPS and free cash flow capped off a year of very strong performance for RTX. In 2024, we delivered $80.8 billion in adjusted sales, up 11% organically, driven by 14% growth in commercial OE, 13% growth in commercial aftermarket and 9% organic growth in defense sales.\nAdjusted EPS was up 13% year-over-year to $5.73. We delivered 90 basis points of consolidated segment margin expansion with contributions from all 3 business segments, and $4.5 billion in free cash flow.\nCustomer demand for our technologies and solutions remains robust, and we ended the year with a backlog of $218 billion, up 11% year-over-year, including $125 billion of commercial backlog and a record $93 billion of defense backlog.\nOn the defense side, Raytheon's backlog continues its favorable mix shift and is now 44% international, up 8 points year-over-year.\nWe'll walk through the fourth quarter details in a few minutes, but I know everyone is interested in 2025. So let me first share a few comments on that front.\nA favorable demand environment and the strength of our advanced products across commercial aerospace and defense position us for sustained growth in 2025 and beyond. On the commercial side, passenger air travel remains robust, and IATA estimates that global RPKs will grow approximately 8% this year. Commercial airframer backlogs also remain at record levels. We have significant content on the fastest-growing platforms.\nOn the defense side of the business, there continues to be tremendous need for our products such as Patriot, NASAMS, F135, GEM-T, F117 and Coyote, all critical equipment being used around the world. We also expect continued strength in international demand for many of these products with key partners and allies in NATO, in the Indo-Pacific committed to increasing defense spending.\nAnd as everyone knows, it's pretty dynamic right now on the macroeconomic front, but RTX is positioned to perform in any environment. Over the last several years, we've continued to qualify new and second sources in our supply chain, and we've made substantial investments in capacity expansion and modernization of our infrastructure in the United States. And we have strong partnerships around the world that support production and deliver services within the markets that we serve.\nAll of these factors support another year of positive momentum for RTX and we expect full year 2025 adjusted sales to be between $83 billion and $84 billion, which translates to organic growth of between 4% and 6% year-over-year. For segment profit, we expect 10% to 13% growth resulting in continued segment margin expansion, with all 3 businesses again contributing to the year-over-year growth.\nFrom an EPS perspective, we expected adjusted EPS of between $6 and $6.15, up 5% to 7% year-over-year. And for free cash flow, we expect between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the year.\nThis growth supports capital returns to our shareowners with over $33 billion returned already since the merger, including $3.7 billion in 2024. Today, we have clear line of sight to deliver towards the high end of our $36 billion to $37 billion capital return commitment by the end of this year, and we are committed to continuing our strong capital deployment strategy as we move forward.\nOur performance will continue to be underpinned by the strategic priorities we've been discussing in the last few quarters: executing on our commitments, innovating for future growth and leveraging our breadth and scale.\nLet's move to Slide 4, and I'll provide an update on each of these priorities. First, executing on our commitments. On the GTF fleet management plan, our outlook remains consistent with our prior comments. As we've discussed, we expect to gradually reduce PW1100 AOGs throughout this year, driven by continued improvement in engine throughput and our MRO facilities. Last year, MRO output was up 30% with a significant increase in forging production, and this year we expect MRO output to grow above 30%.\nMore broadly, we continue to leverage our core operating system, Industry 4.0 improvements and focused capacity enhancements to drive productivity across the company. Last year, enabled by core, we continued to improve productivity across the company, growing sales 11% organically with less than a 2% increase in headcount across RTX. And this year, we expect to complete a record number of core projects to drive operational performance and continued segment margin expansion, with an emphasis on improving on-time delivery, reducing inventory and reducing the cost of scrap, rework and repair.\nAdditionally, we completed our goal of connecting 40 of our top factories to our proprietary data analytics platform. We continue to harness this value to drive company-wide productivity improvements through equipment efficiency, better quality and enhanced product flow visibility. For example, last year, we saw a 50% improvement in on-time delivery for Raytheon circuit card assembly production line. We also saw a 50% increase in equipment utilization in pilot cells at Pratt's module center for the F135. This year, we plan to double the number of product families leveraging this digital infrastructure, which will allow us to expand our use of data and AI in our aftermarket operations and product development.\nNext, let's talk innovating for future growth. In 2024, we spent over $7.5 billion in company and customer-funded research and development to advance technologies that address the immediate and emerging needs of our customers. Through our ability to rapidly bring new technology to production and meet rigorous customer requirements, we are uniquely positioned to deliver capabilities at scale. For example, Raytheon's upgraded Coyote Effector recently demonstrated enhanced capabilities against complex drone targets. Designed, produced and fielded in less than 18 months these enhancements showcase our ability to rapidly integrate software and hardware technology into products. And as you may have seen, the army highlighted the effectiveness of this upgrade with over 170 threats intercepted in recent conflicts.\nWe're leveraging the same rapid development cycle across the company, including on multiple classified programs to meet our customers' urgent need to field improved capabilities. And we continue to make good progress on the GTF advantage at Pratt with the completion of all engine testing requirements, including a test schedule with more than double the endurance testing of the original program. We're pleased with the results and are on track for engine certification in the first half of this year with deliveries to follow in the second half.\nThis type of innovation will continue in 2025 as we plan to spend over $7.5 billion again on company and customer-funded R&D to both field new products and develop advanced capabilities that are critical for the next generation of commercial and defense platforms such as fuel efficiency, resilient networks, directed energy, autonomy, AI and advanced materials.\nWe're also innovating how we do our work as we continue to implement AI applications across RTX. Last year, we saw benefits in areas including product testing, first article inspections and RFP responses. For example, using generative AI, Collins' avionics business has seen software testing cycle times improve by 3x, while maintaining our same quality standards. We have a plan this year to deploy another 40 use cases.\nThrough our continued initiatives to leverage machine learning and generative technologies, we expect to improve operational speed, cycle times and capital utilization, while decreasing our dependency on external labor.\nAnd lastly, leveraging the breadth and scale of RTX. As part of our broader infrastructure plan to maximize utilization of RTX facilities, Collins is building out 125,000 square feet of production space in Raytheon's Richardson, Texas facility to support new wins, including the multibillion-dollar award last year for the Survivable Airborne Operations Center program. Through leveraging an existing RTX facility, we've been able to reduce the investment for this capacity expansion by 50%.\nAnd as we continue to evaluate our footprint, we've launched a significant number of projects across the company to lean out our manufacturing floor space and increase utilization, all with the goal of reducing our fixed costs and creating additional capacity. Bringing this all together, we feel very good about the momentum we've created heading into 2025 and where our business is positioned.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Neil and Nathan to take you through more details on the fourth quarter and our 2025 outlook. Neil?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nThanks, Chris. I'm on Slide 5. As Chris said, we had strong financial performance to finish the year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted sales of $21.6 billion were up 9% and up 11% organically, ahead of our prior expectations, primarily driven by commercial OE at Pratt. By sales channel, growth was led by commercial aftermarket, which was up 15%, and Defense, which was up 10% organically. Commercial OE sales grew 10% as higher deliveries at Pratt more than offset the lower narrow-body volume we expected at Collins.\nSegment operating profit of $2.7 billion was up 29%, with segment operating margin expansion of 180 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 was up 19% from the prior year, driven by segment operating profit growth, which was partially offset by expected higher taxes and lower pension income.\nOn a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $1.10 and included $0.30 of acquisition accounting adjustments, $0.05 of restructuring and $0.09 of other nonrecurring items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $492 million, bringing the full year total to $4.5 billion, which included approximately $1.1 billion of powder metal compensation and slightly higher year-end disbursements, including capital expenditures. In total, the full year included approximately $2.6 billion of impacts from powder metal, legal matters and the Raytheon contract matter that we've previously discussed.\nAlso in the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of the Collins Hoist & Winch business as we continue to prioritize investments in our core. Lastly, we returned $852 million of capital to shareowners, primarily through dividends, and we paid down $800 million of debt in the quarter, bringing our total debt paydown for 2024 to $2.5 billion.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Nathan to take you through the segment results, and then I'll come back and share some additional details on our 2025 outlook.\n\nNathan Ware\n\nSenior Director-Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.\n\nThanks, Neil. Starting with Collins on Slide 6. Sales were $7.5 billion in the quarter, up 8% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven by strength in defense and commercial aftermarket. By channel, defense sales were up 13%, primarily due to higher volume across multiple programs and platforms. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 12%, driven by a 21% increase in provisioning, an 18% increase in mods and upgrades and a 9% increase in parts and repair. And as expected, commercial OE sales for the quarter were down 6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower narrow-body volume on the 737 MAX.\nAdjusted operating profit of $1.2 billion was up $172 million versus the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and defense volume was partially offset by lower commercial OE volume and unfavorable commercial OE mix. For the full year, Collins generated $28.3 billion of adjusted sales and $4.5 billion of adjusted operating profit, resulting in 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 7. Sales of $7.6 billion were up 18% on both an adjusted and organic basis, with sales growth across all 3 channels. Commercial OE sales were up 31% in the quarter, primarily driven by increased deliveries and favorable mix in Large Commercial Engines. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 17% in the quarter, driven by higher volume in Large Commercial Engines, primarily GTF and Pratt Canada.\nIn military engines, sales were up 8%, driven by higher volume across F135 production, the F135 Engine Core Upgrade program and F135 sustainment. This was partially offset by lower sustainment volume across other legacy platforms, primarily the F100 and F117.\nAdjusted operating profit of $717 million was up $312 million versus the prior year, driven by favorable OE volume and mix in Large Commercial Engines, favorable mix in Pratt Canada aftermarket and drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military volume. Pratt also benefited from an approximately $70 million insurance recovery in the quarter.\nAlso in the quarter, Pratt booked $8.9 billion of awards, including $1.4 billion for F135 sustainment. For the full year, Pratt & Whitney generated $28.1 billion of adjusted sales and $2.3 billion of adjusted operating profit, resulting in 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. In addition, GTF engine shipments in 2024 were up 14% on a year-over-year basis.\nNow turning to Raytheon on Slide 8. Sales of $7.2 billion in the quarter were up 4% on an adjusted basis and 10% organically. The sales growth was driven by higher volume on land and air defense systems, including Global Patriot, NASAMS and counter-UAS programs as well as 5 points from higher volume associated with the restart of contracts with the Middle East customer. This growth was partially offset by the impact from a cybersecurity divestiture and lower volume on air and space defense systems.\nAdjusted operating profit of $728 million was up $110 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by drop-through on higher volume, improved net productivity and favorable mix, partially offset by the impact from the cybersecurity divestiture. Year-over-year, net productivity improved by approximately $50 million in the quarter.\nBookings in the quarter were $9.5 billion, resulting in a backlog of $63 billion and a full year book-to-bill of $1.48 billion. Key awards included $848 million to supply Romania with additional Patriot systems, highlighting the continued demand for air missile defense solutions. Raytheon also booked $1.9 billion of classified awards, $763 million for Stinger Air Defense Missiles and $591 million for the next-generation GEM airborne electronic warfare system.\nFor the full year, Raytheon generated $26.8 billion of adjusted sales and $2.7 billion of adjusted operating profit, resulting in 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. Net productivity at the business was up approximately $160 million on a year-over-year basis in 2024.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to provide some more color on our 2025 outlook.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nThanks, Nathan. Turning to Slide 9. Let me talk through the drivers of our 2025 outlook that Chris highlighted.\nStarting with sales, supported by the demand environment we've discussed, we expect total RTX sales to be between $83 billion and $84 billion for the year. Within this outlook, we've assumed that Collins actuation divestiture is completed by the end of the second quarter. Therefore, on an organic basis, this translates to between 4% and 6% top line growth.\nLooking at it by channel at the RTX level and adjusting for divestitures, we expect approximately 10% commercial aftermarket growth. On the commercial OE side, sales are expected to be up mid-single digits year-over-year as we align with our customers on delivery requirements, which we see ramping throughout the year. And defense sales are also expected to grow mid-single digits across the company.\nWith respect to EPS, let me take you through the year-over-year walk. Starting at the segment level, at the midpoint of our outlook range. Operating profit growth of 12% is expected to drive approximately $0.66 of EPS growth. Included in this segment growth is a headwind of roughly $0.07 associated with the divestitures we completed last year and the expected actuation divestiture this year. And due to the progress we've made on paying down debt from the accelerated share repurchases completed in 2024, we expect a tailwind from lower interest of about $0.05. Partially offsetting these items is approximately $0.15 from lower FAS/CAS and nonservice pension income, driven primarily by the actions we've taken to improve the funded status of our plans, as well as $0.06 from a higher share count.\nAnd finally, we also expect a $0.16 headwind from other items, which is primarily comprised of $0.06 of higher corporate expenses as we invest in our digital systems and capabilities and $0.05 of higher taxes. All of this brings us to our adjusted EPS outlook range of $6 to $6.15 per share.\nMoving to our cash walk. The first piece of our year-over-year growth comes from segment operating profit and working capital. Combined, this will drive an operational improvement of approximately $2.3 billion.\nSpecific to working capital, we expect a year-over-year improvement of approximately $1.3 billion, with the majority coming from inventory and contract assets as we deliver commercial OE product, achieve defense delivery milestones and improve our supplier inputs and material throughput. This also includes CapEx where we expect to invest between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion during the year as we continue to expand capacity and accelerate automation efforts to support our long-term organic growth.\nNext, the onetime legal and contract matters that we paid last year will not repeat in 2025, resulting in a tailwind of approximately $1.5 billion. We also see a headwind of approximately $900 million, primarily driven by the absence of an R&D tax-related benefit in the prior year and higher cash taxes in 2025.\nFinally, we expect powder metal compensation impacts to be between $1.1 million and $$1.3 billion, which is up around $100 million year-over-year at the midpoint. All in, we expect free cash flow to be between $7 billion to $7.5 billion in 2025.\nWith that, let's turn to Slide 10, and I'll provide some details for the segment outlooks. Starting with Collins. We expect full year sales to be up low single digits on an adjusted basis and up mid-single digits organically. As I already noted, this outlook assumes the completion of the sale of the actuation business around midyear. Adjusting for this divestiture, we anticipate commercial aftermarket to be up high single digits to low double digits driven by growth in passenger air travel and mods and upgrades volume. Commercial OE sales are expected to be up mid-single digits as increased volume on multiple platforms is partially offset by impacts from the expected timing of our customers' production ramps. And defense is expected to be up low single digits on top of the 9% growth we saw in 2024.\nWith respect to Collins' adjusted operating profit, we expect it to grow between $500 million and $600 million versus the prior year, driven by drop-through on higher volume across all 3 channels as well as higher pricing and continued progress on cost reduction efforts across the business. Finally, this includes an approximately $80 million headwind associated with the actuation divestiture.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney. We expect full year sales to be up high single digits on both an adjusted and organic basis. By channel, we expect commercial aftermarket to be up low double digits due to higher volume across Large Commercial Engines and Pratt Canada. Commercial OE is expected to be up mid-single digits with another year of similar large commercial engine unit delivery growth, partially offset by mixed headwinds. And military sales are expected to be up mid-single digits, driven by sustainment activity across the F135 and F100 platforms and the F135 Engine Core Upgrade program.\nFor Pratt's adjusted operating profit, we expect growth of between $325 million and $400 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by drop-through on commercial aftermarket and military growth. This will be partially offset by increased commercial OE deliveries and mix within that channel.\nAnd at Raytheon, we expect sales to grow mid-single digits organically as double-digit growth in land and air defense systems is partially offset by lower development volume. Raytheon's adjusted operating profit is expected to be up between $150 million and $225 million versus the prior year, driven by drop-through on higher volume, favorable contract mix and improved net productivity. Also keep in mind, there is an approximately $35 million headwind associated with the sale of the cybersecurity business in the first quarter of last year.\nIn addition, we've included an outlook for some of the below-the-line items in the appendix of our webcast.\nAll in, 2025 is expected to be another strong year of performance for RTX. A lot has changed since we issued the original 2025 target several years ago. And while there have been some updates, the fundamental value drivers of the company and cash generation potential have not changed.\nOkay. With that, I'll turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nAI Assigned\n\nOkay. Thanks, Neil. I'm on Slide 11. As I said upfront, I'm pleased with how we ended 2024 and the momentum we have heading into 2025. The growth we've achieved over the last few years has been remarkable, and we continue to make the right investments to advance our market-leading technologies and capabilities well into the future.\nLooking ahead, we are a focused, technology-driven aerospace and defense company that is aligned with strong macroeconomic growth drivers and well positioned on the right industry growth platforms. Combined with technology synergies across our products and a strong balance sheet that enables us to innovate at scale, I'm confident we can drive sustainable growth in sales, margin and cash flow generation, resulting in significant long-term returns to shareowners.\nOkay. With that, let's open it up for questions.",

To ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You may ask any further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Calio.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release this morning, RTX delivered strong operational and financial performance in the second quarter as we continue to execute on our customer commitments and strategic priorities. Let me start the highlights on slide three. We saw another quarter of excellent top line growth with adjusted sales of $19.8 billion, which were up 10%. Organically adjusted EPS of $1.41 was up 9% year-over-year, driven by profit growth and margin expansion across all three segments, and free cash flow was strong at $2.2 billion. We also saw continued growth in our backlog, which ended the quarter at $206 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.25.\nThere were also some notable contract wins in the quarter, including a 10-year MRO agreement to support Collins' significant content on Air Canada's 787 fleet of up to 70 aircraft, including avionics, air management, and electric power systems. Collins also received a multibillion-dollar award for the US Air Force's Next Generation Survivable Airborne Operations Center, and Raytheon received a $639 million award for SPY-6 radar production for the US Navy. As you saw in early July, Germany placed an additional order for Patriot Systems. This is on top of the $1.2 billion order they placed for multiple systems in Q1 of the year. We also saw some positive GTF announcements at the Farnborough Airshow earlier this week with over 700 GTF engines ordered, including options and commitments.\nThese include Cebu Pacific selecting the GTF to power the carrier's order for up to 152 additional single aisle aircraft, and Avolon selecting the GTF engine for up to 160 aircraft. So another quarter of robust orders with significant wins already secured early here in Q3, and more expected as the year progresses. We also continue to make progress on our critical initiatives, specifically regarding the GTF Fleet Management Plan. We remain on track with our financial and operational outlook consistent with our prior comments. As of the end of Q2, we have inspected over 6,000 powder metal parts that are in the field across all programs, and the associated fallout rate remains below the 1% we had assumed, and the findings are consistent with the assumptions that underpin our fleet management plan at our MRO facilities.\nThroughput of engines continues to improve, and overall capacity is expanding with the recent addition of two new MRO shops into the network. PW1100 MRO output increased 10% versus Q1. We expect this ramp to continue in the second half of the year. As it relates to the PW1100 fleet, AOGs have leveled out over the past few months and remain in line with our expectations. We've also now reached support agreements with 20 of our customers covering roughly 65% of the impacted fleet, and the terms are in line with our assumptions beyond our operational performance. Let me also comment on the legal and contract charges we outlined in our press release this morning, and then Neil will provide in more detail in a bit. We're nearing completion of agreements with the Department of Justice, SEC, and Department of State to resolve several legal matters.\nThese matters primarily arose out of Legacy Raytheon Company and Rockwell Collins prior to the merger and acquisition of these companies. We've already taken robust corrective actions to address the legacy gaps that led to these issues, including implementing enhanced compliance and training measures. We also took a charge related to the anticipated termination of a Raytheon fixed-price development contract that was entered into before the merger. As we've been discussing the last few quarters, we've been battling through some challenges in a handful of fixed-price development programs, including this one. But this specific contract is unique in terms of its scope, deliverables, and associated risk profile, which led us to pursue termination. So we're pleased to be putting these matters behind us and as I highlighted earlier, our operational performance was very strong in the quarter.\nGiven this performance and the continuing strength of our end markets, we are raising our outlook for adjusted sales and EPS. We've also revised our cash outlook for the year as a result of matters I just discussed. Lastly, as you saw in May, we raised our dividend 7% and remain on track to return $36 to 37 billion of capital to share owners from the merger through the end of next year. Okay with that, let's move to slide four and I'll spend a few minutes on our strategic priorities that will enable us to drive best-in-class performance across RTX including meeting customer demand, continued sales growth, margin expansion across our segments, and strong cash flow generation. Given our growing installed base and the unprecedented demand for our products, our first priority is executing on our commitments powered by our core operating system.\nOur focus is on driving incremental operational improvements to ramp output and deliver on this demand. Today we have over 4,000 core projects being worked across the company. For example, at Collins, our Avionics business improved first pass yield by 2x in its fire detection product line by reconfiguring the production cell layout, creating digital tools, and upgrading equipment. At Raytheon, the team conducted a core Leadership Week to identify initiatives to more than double weekly output on a key component of our AIM-9X effector. As a result, the team achieved a 90% increase in output in the quarter and is on track to hit their full year target by the end of Q3. We also continue to add capacity to meet the demands of the industrial ramp up. During the quarter, we announced a $200 million investment in our carbon brake facility in Spokane, Washington.\nOnce complete, it will add 70,000sq ft of manufacturing footprint to meet rapidly growing demand for our Collins Brake solutions. On the defense side, we're investing in test equipment and tooling to more than double production capacity by year-end than our Coyote program, which is a low-cost kinetic effector for the counter-unmanned aircraft systems that directly address today's drone threats. In addition to creating new capacity, we continue to modernize our existing footprint as part of our Industry 4.0 initiatives across RTX. We have now connected 26 factories with our proprietary digital analytics technology, providing us with real-time data to boost equipment efficiency, improve quality, and yield higher output. This represents a 30% increase in connected sites since the start of the year, and we remain on track to connect 40 factories by the end of the year.\nThese incremental efficiency, capacity, and technology improvements are critical to meeting the needs of our customers as we operate in the strongest demand environment in our history. Let me move now to our second priority, innovating for future growth. We are executing on our cross-company technology roadmap to develop differentiated solutions in areas such as sustainability, advanced propulsion, next-generation sensing, Connected Battlespace, and Hypersonics. This year alone we will spend over $7.5 billion on company- and customer-funded research and development to mature and introduce new capabilities to our customers and fill our product pipeline. For example, we are working on a number of hybrid-electric demonstrator programs to deliver advanced propulsion technologies and enable greater fuel efficiency across all future aircraft segments.\nRecently, our Collins, Pratt & Whitney, and Technology Research Center teams completed a significant milestone in the development of our hybrid-electric demonstrator, validating the integrated system functionality of the engine, electric motor, batteries, and high-voltage electric power distribution. In the quarter, we delivered the first TPY-2 radar that incorporates our proprietary Gallium Nitride technology. This technology is a game-changer for our sensing capability, providing expanded surveillance range and supporting additional missions in the space domain, and hypersonic defense. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation and AI. This year, we are adding an additional 30+ use cases that generate incremental productivity and cost savings across RTX using advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning. In total, we have over 200 AI use cases currently deployed across various internal functions.\nOur AI investments are also enabling new and improved capabilities in our products such as predicting equipment failures and aiding human operators in executing complex tasks. These types of investments in innovation will allow us to continue to develop next-generation products and solutions well into the future. Our third priority is to fully leverage our breadth and scale across RTX to drive value for our stakeholders. Specifically, this includes creating a more efficient and competitive cost structure and managing our common supply chain. For example, over 35% of our product procurement spend is with common suppliers that support all three of our businesses, and we're using a unified RTX approach to our contracts and sourcing strategy. It also includes harmonizing our product lifecycle management processes and developing integrated solutions for strategic campaigns and pursuits such as NGAD, FLRAA, and next-generation commercial platforms.\nAnd of course we'll also continue to review our portfolio and prune where needed as well as target bolt-on M&A to support our RTX technology roadmap and grow our core franchises. And underlying all three of these priorities is our unwavering commitment to safety, corporate quality, and compliance in everything that we do. It's what we and our customers expect and a commitment we will never compromise on. Putting it all together, I'm extremely excited and confident about the future of RTX. With that, before I turn over to Neil, I want to acknowledge a leadership update we announced last week. As you saw, Steve Timm has decided to retire for 28 years with the company.\nSteve was a great partner and teammate, and I want to thank him for his leadership at Collins, and we're very fortunate to have a strong bench and are very excited that Troy Brunk is taking over as the new President of Collins. Troy has served as the president of three of the six Collins business units, is uniquely qualified for the role. Okay, let me turn over to Neil to take you through the second quarter results in more detail. Neil,\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nthanks Chris.\nI'm on slide 5. As Chris said, operationally we had a strong quarter and continue to make progress on key financial metrics. Across RTX, RTX's adjusted sales of $19.8 billion were up 8% and on an organic basis were up 10% by channel. Commercial OE was up 19%. As we continue to support aircraft demand, commercial aftermarket was up 14%. As domestic, international, and long-haul travel continues to grow and excluding the Raytheon cybersecurity divestiture, defense sales were up 7%. As we execute on our backlog.\nSegment operating profit of $2.4 billion was up 19% with growth at all three businesses contributing to consolidated segment operating margin expansion of 100 basis points. Adjusted Earnings per share of $1.41 was up 9% from the prior year, driven by segment operating profit growth as well as a lower share count which was partially offset by expected headwinds from higher interest and tax expense and lower pension income. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $0.08 and included $0.29 of acquisition accounting adjustments and $0.03 of restructuring and other significant nonrecurring items. In addition, as it relates to the items Chris mentioned, GAAP EPS also includes a $0.68 charge related to the expected resolution of several legacy legal matters and a $0.33 charge related to a fixed-price development contract at Raytheon.\nWith respect to the legal matters, we are working to finalize deferred prosecution agreements and a civil settlement with the DOJ and an administrative order with the SEC. These agreements will cover the previously disclosed investigations of defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts which were entered into between 2011 and 2013, and in 2017.\nThey will also cover the previously disclosed investigations of improper payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture Thales Raytheon Systems in connection with some Middle East contracts dating back to 2012.\nAs a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $633 million in the quarter, which brings our total reserves associated with these matters to $959 million. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $285 million, which related to voluntarily disclosed export controls compliance matters primarily identified during the integration of Rockwell Collins and Raytheon Company into RTX, including matters which are expected to be addressed in a consent agreement with the Department of State. As part of the resolution of each of these three matters, we will be required to retain independent compliance monitors over the three-year term of the agreements. In total, we expect to pay about $1 billion related to these matters this year and have incorporated that into our updated free cash flow outlook for the year. I'll take you through the other moving pieces of our outlook on the next slide.\nWhile the financial impact of these items is above what we had previously reserved, we believe the provisions we have taken put these issues behind us financially, and we will continue to cooperate with the government and external monitors as we move forward as it relates to the fixed-price development contract. As you know, we've been discussing the challenges we've been working through on this front for some time. In conjunction with that effort and an anticipated termination on one of our Raytheon programs with a foreign customer, we've recorded a pre-tax charge of $575 million in the quarter. Again, we've incorporated the expected cash outflows into our revised free cash flow outlook for this year. For the quarter, cash flow was robust with $2.2 billion of free cash flow that was driven by strong collections across the portfolio and some lower tax payments.\nWe also continued our deleveraging in the second quarter and paid down another $750 million of debt, bringing our total debt repayment since the accelerated share repurchase was initiated last October to $2.7 billion.\nWe returned $867 million of capital to share owners, primarily through dividends during the quarter.\nOn the portfolio front, we're also pleased that Italy has approved the sale of Collins' actuation business, and we continue to actively support the remaining efforts to complete the transaction. And as you may have also seen, we have entered into an agreement to sell Collins' hoist and winch business for over $500 million, another great example of the portfolio pruning we are doing to focus on our core franchises. Okay, turning to page six, let me share a few details on our updated outlook for the year. As you've seen, the first half performance across all three of our businesses has been strong, driven by end market demand and continued execution. There are of course a few areas we continue to monitor, including pockets of supply chain challenges, inflation, and the ongoing OE production rate uncertainty.\nBut given the results to date, we are increasing our full-year adjusted sales outlook to between $78.75 and 79.5 billion, up from our prior range of $78 to $79 billion. And we now expect 8% to 9% organic sales growth for the year, up from our prior range of 7% to 8%. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS outlook by $0.10 on the low end and $0.05 on the high end, putting the new range at $5.35 to $5.45, up from $5.25 to $5.40. The improvement is driven primarily by lower interest and corporate expenses, higher pension income, and a lower full-year effective tax rate. We have included the corresponding updated outlook for these metrics in the appendix of our webcast slides on Free Cash Flow. As I mentioned earlier, we've incorporated our expected cash outflows associated with the legal and contract matters into our outlook.\nPartially offsetting these impacts is some improvement in current year tax payments of roughly $500 million. All in, we have updated our free cash flow outlook to be approximately $4.7 billion compared to our previous expectation of approximately $5.7 billion. With that, let me turn it over to Nathan to talk you through our segment results and outlooks.\n\nNathan Ware\n\nVP of Investor Relations, RTX\n\nThanks Neil. Starting with Collins on slide 7, sales were $7 billion in the quarter, up 10% on both an adjusted and organic basis driven by strength in commercial aftermarket, commercial OE, and defense by channel. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 12%, driven by a 16% increase in parts and repair, a 15% increase in provisioning, and a 9% decrease in mods and upgrades, with mods and upgrades coming off a difficult prior year compare that benefited from the 5G mandate. Commercial OE sales for the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year driven by growth in narrowbody, widebody, and regional platforms, and defense sales were up 7% primarily due to higher volume. Adjusted operating profit of $1.15 billion was up $230 million or 25% from the prior year driven primarily by drop through on higher commercial aftermarket volume as well as higher defense and commercial OE volume.\nLooking ahead on a full year basis, we now expect Collins sales to grow high single digits on both an adjusted and organic basis, up from the prior range of mid to high single digits driven by continued strength in commercial air traffic and defense volume, and we continue to expect operating profit growth between $650 and 725 million versus 2023.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on slide 8, sales of$6.8 billion were up 19% on both an adjusted and organic basis, with sales growth across all three channels. Commercial large sales were up 33% in the quarter on higher engine deliveries and favorable mix in the large commercial engine business. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 15% in the quarter, driven by higher volume and favorable mix in both the large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses, and in the military engine business, sales were up 16%, primarily driven by higher sustainment volume across the F135 and F117 platforms. Adjusted operating profit of$537 million was up $101 million versus the prior year.\nDrop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable mix, as well as favorable large commercial OE mix, was partially offset by headwinds from large commercial OE engine deliveries and the absence of a $60 million favorable prior-year contract matter. Drop-through from higher military volume and favorable mix was more than offset by higher production costs and higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Turning to Pratt's full-year outlook, we now expect sales to grow mid-teens on an adjusted inorganic basis, up from our prior range of low double digits, driven by stronger military volume and higher commercial OE, and we continue to see adjusted operating profit growth between $400 and $475 million versus 2023. Now turning to Raytheon on Slide 9, adjusted sales of $6.6 billion in the quarter were down 2% as a result of the cybersecurity divestiture completed in the first quarter.\nOn an organic basis, sales were up 4% primarily driven by higher volume on land and air defense systems including Patriot, counter-UAS programs, and Stinger. Adjusted operating profit of $709 million was up $47 million versus the prior year driven primarily by drop-through on higher volume, favorable mix, and improved net productivity partially offset by the impact of the cybersecurity divestiture, and Raytheon had $5 billion of bookings in the quarter resulting in a backlog of $51 billion on a rolling 12-month basis. Raytheon's book-to-bill is 1.13. In addition to the SPY-6 award that Chris mentioned earlier, Raytheon also had $928 million of classified awards and a $393 million award from NASA to design, produce, and deliver four units that will provide advanced Earth observation. Looking ahead, we now expect Raytheon sales to grow by mid-single digits.\nOrganically up from the prior range of low to mid single digits, driven by improved material flow. As a result, we now expect Raytheon's operating profit to grow between $125 and 200 million versus 2023, up from the prior range of between $100 and 200 million. And this includes the impact from the cybersecurity divestiture. With that, I'll turn it back over to Chris to wrap things up.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nOkay, thanks Nathan. I'm on Slide 10. As you've heard today, our second quarter operating results were very strong, and we're confident in our updated outlook for the full year. But if you step back and just think of beyond 2024 and look at the long term for RTX, we've got the best positioned franchise programs, the right content on the right platforms across commercial aerospace and defense. Our large and growing installed base will support significant commercial aftermarket growth for decades to come. And our industry leading defense capabilities address the threats playing out across the global landscape. All right, with that, let's open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time and to allow for broader participation, you are asked to limit yourself to one question. To ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone.\nThe first question comes from the line of Peter Arment. Peter Arment, your line is open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nHey, thanks.\nGood morning, Chris. Neil, Nathan.\nGood morning. Hey, Chris. Nice results.\nJust, I guess, maybe just on the GTF fleet management plan. Sounds like, you know, everything's going according to plan and remains on track.\nMaybe if you just peel back.\nDig in a little bit. I know you talked about some pacing items in the past about getting, you know, full life discs into the MRO shops and just kind of material availability. It sounds like the MRO capacity is going as planned, but maybe any kind of metrics or any color, you know, what you're seeing and any opportunities actually where any of these metrics might, you know, still be able to come in to the left, you know, before 2026.\nThanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, okay, Peter, thanks for the question. Let me take you through where things stand. As you noted, our key assumptions around AOGs, wing box turnaround time, shop visit, mix between heavy and light, and customer compensation all remain consistent. As I noted up front, our assumptions on the inspection fallout rates and the findings are all consistent or even better than we planned. So, good stability around the key assumptions. As you know, MRO output is the key enabler, and we're focused on improving the material flow, better processes in the shops. We've added some capacity on this front. Again, we saw some good signs of progress here in the first half of the year. I mean, output was up 10% from Q1 to Q2, and first half output on the 1100 is up over 30% versus the first half in 2023.\nTo continue to drive some output there, which is helpful. The key enabler, of course, on the MRO output is material. You had mentioned that up front we're continuing to see some progress on structural castings. Structural castings are up about 5% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. So good progress there. And then on forgings, the powder metal parts.\nWe continue to drive output there as well. Isothermal forgings were up almost 100% year-over-year. We continue to add additional capacity for inspection and machining. For example, we've nearly doubled our sonic inspection capacity for the year. So, again, driving on all the key enablers, Peter, to try to get this fleet in as healthy a shape as we possibly can. Also, just note, sort of unrelated to the fleet management plans, continue to drive OE output as well. OE deliveries were up sequentially 30% in the first half on a year-over-year basis, despite sort of grinding through some of the supply chain disruptions. We're also pleased with the additions to the GTF backlog that were announced at Farnborough recently.\nSo, again, focusing on what we can control on the fleet management plan and continuing to drive both supply chain and new orders into the backlog.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate all the details.\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Robert Stallard, your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much.\nGood morning.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning, Rob.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nRob, Chris, following on the GTF theme, I was wondering if you could comment on what the situation is with Airbus. Their recent forecast cut, because they've clearly not been getting as many new engines as they anticipated. So those engines instead go into the spare engine pool. Thank you.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYep, thanks, Rob.\nSo, again, you heard me say just a minute ago to Peter that ROE deliveries are up sequentially and up first half of the year, 30% on a.\nyear-over-year basis.\nWe're not necessarily where we need to be with Airbus, but again, we're seeing strong growth sequentially, and year-over-year, and our outlook reflects our assessment of kind of where Airbus needs support from us, and we're aligned on what they need. You alluded to the fact that we're balancing both OE and spare engines in material, and that's true. We need to do that for the support of the fleet. But again, I continue to be encouraged by what we continue to drive in terms of production and getting Airbus what they need. I think in the back half, we're going to continue to balance the OE, spare engine, and MRO needs, but I think we'll be in a position to get Airbus what they need.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Well, the line is open.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, Chris or Neil, I'm not sure which, on the defense side on Raytheon, could you maybe dig a little bit into what are the problem programs still remaining?\nMaybe a percentage of revenue, if that's what you want to handle it, or.\nBacklog and then specifically to this decision.\nTo sort of proactively, you know, cut losses and terminate the contract. Not an easy decision.\nAre there other contracts where you could extinguish similarly or would that cause customer distress? And lastly, was there a cash impact too? Thanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Myles. I'll start and then Neil can certainly chime in. Certainly not an easy decision, but we've been alluding to the fact that we've had a significant classified program out there that was, we would say, not in our wheelhouse, meaning the work that we had taken on and this contract was pre-formation of RTX was not within our core competency. We struggled with that and we struggled to get to the right technical solutions and ultimately came to a point where we just didn't think it was productive anymore to continue to go down this path and ultimately decided it was in the best interest of us and the customer to just kind of do a reset here and allow us to go focus our resources on some of the other programs that we've got.\nYou had mentioned a handful of other, I'll call them, classified development, fixed price development programs that we've been talking about. I will say those are much different in terms of risk profile than the one we took action on here. Those have some important milestones here in 2024 and in 2025, but we feel like we've got a much better handle on those than the one we're talking about here and feel like we understand the risks much better there and what needs to be done to get them.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nTo close and just to add, Myles, in terms of the cash flow impact. So, you know, as I sit here today, there's really just a few changes that we've made to our 2024 outlook. The first is about $1 billion related to the legal matters, placeholder about $0.5 billion related to the contract matter that Chris just was talking about, and offsetting that is about $0.5 billion of improvement that we've seen operationally in our tax payments due to some planning that we've done. So net net that's $1 billion. And I would expect that that mostly sits in Q4 of this year. It'll depend on when we get the final resolutions with the government agencies, but that's trending towards certainly late September or early in Q4.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thanks for the color.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYep.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the lineup, Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning guys, and thank you.\nSo, Neil, maybe another one for you. Just, you know, you're going to do about $7.2 billion of net income this year on an adjusted basis and generate $4.7 billion of cash. Some of that is one-time items with the DOJ, the powder metal, and tax. So how do we think about that gap closing on net income through cash flow, and then just on the DOJ? Can you elaborate a little bit more how we think about that, the outcomes of it, and the cash impact outside of 2024?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSure.\nLet me start with free cash flow. You just heard me talk about sort of the changes that we rolled into our outlook for the year. As I think about the absolute value of the $4.7 billion, remember that includes a couple of nonrecurring items that are pretty substantial. If you adjust for those things, you kind of get to a $7 to 7.5 billion, maybe even higher level of free cash flow that is operational. So I think as we look forward, Sheila, and we get the powder metal payments behind us this year and next year, just a little color. So far, we're a little less than $200 million into our $1.3 billion of powder metal outflows this year. We expect that to obviously ramp up.\nYou heard us talk about doubling the number of customers that we've got agreements with, and about 2/3 of the fleet under agreement. So I would expect Q3 and Q4 kind of be split pretty evenly with respect to the rest of the payments this year. But if you look at the underlying operations, you can see that there's real strong, organic, sustainable cash flow. And I think that's what will be, you know, looking to see sustain itself over time. Now in particular, there's some working capital improvement. I've talked about like $1.1 billion of improvement year-over-year and arriving at our $4.7 billion. Obviously inventory was a use of cash.\nIn the first half.\nWe expect that to turn around in the second half, which is typical for our business. We've got a little bit of headwind from the OE production rates that we've contemplated. But we're seeing stronger collections on the customer side, so that balances for the rest of this year. So that's how I would characterize the free cash flow situation today as it relates to the DOJ and the outcomes. I think we feel very certain about the amount of cash impact that's going to happen this year. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've reached agreements in principle. There's some work to do to get that finalized with the various government agencies. That could take a few months, but when it happens, that'll get filed and be available publicly and then shortly thereafter we'll be required to make the payments associated with that.\nThere's very little that lingers beyond that. I'd say it's in the $50 million a year kind of range following 2024, so it's manageable. Those costs will include some residual payments on the Global Trade-related Consent Agreement as well as some internal costs that we'll obviously invest in to continue to improve our processes as we support the monitor activities. So, you know, I would leave it at that for now with those items.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nCool.\nThank you.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question coming from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Line is open.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning, Doug.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nDoug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nWhat you've talked about and what we've heard as well is that your shop on the GTF, that a lot of the shop visit times you've brought that down significantly, the time in the shop, which is great. And so presumably this is with improved parts availability that's allowed you to do that. And I know in Q1 you did divert resources away from V2500 work in order to better enable you to provide GTF parts. So two things on this: first, where do you stand now on V2500 MRO? Is that kind of back to normal? And then second, even though those shop visit times seem to have come down significantly, everything we've seen is that induction wait times are still quite long, and perhaps if you could address those two issues, it would be really helpful.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nDoug, let me start on the V2500, then I'll hand it over to Chris to talk a little bit about the GTF induction times and turnaround times on the V2500 on a first half basis. We're at about 369 inductions to date. So we had talked about 800 on a full year basis. And we expect that. We still expect that to continue. I guess the good news there is that, you know, with that acceleration, not only are we seeing an increase in the number of shop visits in the second half of the year, we're also seeing more work scope. So these are heavier overhauls, and all of that will contribute to the second half growth that we'll expect to see coming from Pratt & Whitney, particularly in the aftermarket.\nSo the second half story for Pratt's operating outlook is really focused around what we call the mature commercial engines, the V2500 being the biggest part of that. So that's where we sit today on that front. Chris, maybe a couple comments on GTF.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, yeah. And before I do that, Doug, I'll just say on the V, I mean, obviously, our customers are relying heavily on that, given the other stress in the fleet. So we're heavily focused on making sure that, you know, V inductions, turnaround times, and whatnot, that the support is there for the customer base. On the GTF MRO, you're right. In the shop, when we've got material flowing, when we've got material in the right positions in Gate 2 and Gate 3, we are seeing significant reduction in shop turnaround time, both our shops and our partners, which is really encouraging. The induction times are really a function of what we would call the parking lot. There are a lot of engines that came off wing, obviously.\nWhen the ad hit, and people did some of that proactively. So we are still working through a large parking lot of engines that need to get inducted into the shop. But again, we're encouraged by what we're seeing when the material is there, which is why we're so heavily focused on making sure the supply chain is healthy. You heard me talk about structural castings, isothermal forgings. These are the things that are going to be the biggest unlock for us as we take the AOG numbers down and support our customers.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the line, Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSamantha Stiroh\n\nEquity Research Associate, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning. This is Samantha Stiroh on for Ron Epstein. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Collins, particularly interiors, kind of what they're doing and what your expectations are there? Thank you.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Samantha. How you doing? Let me start there. I mean, we're seeing significant improvement in the interiors business. And frankly, the second half story for Collins is going to rely substantially on the aftermarket uptick there in mods and upgrades. And you know, the one thing I would say about the Collins portfolio of businesses is we've seen really strong performance across all the segments, the SBU segments there, and many of them are at or above. And frankly, above where we were in 2019. Interiors is the one place where we're still lagging. So we're encouraged by the orders we are seeing there. And we do expect that to translate to substantial growth in the second half of this year. That's going to be driving a substantial part of Collins aftermarket year-over-year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Seth, your line is open.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, thanks very much and good morning. Morning, Chris and Neil, I wonder if you could address the free cash flow target for next year. Kind of talk about whether you feel like that still stands, areas of risk, areas of opportunity, and kind of your level of confidence.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks for the question.\nRight now, Seth, we don't see a reason to change the outlook. The fundamental business drivers remains strong on both the commercial and defense sides. Our end markets have proven pretty resilient and demand remains strong. As we said up front, I think with everybody else, there are several items that we're tracking that have 2025 implications. Think, oh, low rates got to continue to see the strength, you know, in the aftermarket.\nThat's a big part of the.\nThe cash flow in 2025 and, of course, the supply chain. I mean, you just heard me talk about the sequential improvements and the stability we're seeing. But that's got to continue to ramp. But again, still feel like the 2025 cash goal here is achievable based on everything we see today, both within our four walls and the macro environment.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question coming from the lineup, Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag, your line is open.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, Chris, Neil, and Nathan, maybe back with Pratt. You know, you guys have highlighted that isothermal forgings are getting better. You're seeing doubled capacity increases in sonic inspections, which are all good, but you know, structural castings, you know, continue to be an issue. Can you provide more color on why structural casting continues to linger? And then also, I mean, look, this historically has been one of the bottlenecks for previous aerospace ramp ups. So I guess, you know, how is your approach different this time around to mitigate risk? And any color you could provide of the underlying tightness would be helpful.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nSure.\nThanks, Kristine. And you're right. You know, structural castings has been a habitual sort of constrained, you know, value stream even since the beginning of the ramp up, you know, back in the 16, 17 time frame. While we've seen, you know, some improvement here, I mentioned up 5% sequentially, it needs to be higher than that in order to continue to meet the demands of both, you know, OE to the airframers, spare engines, and MRO. So again, while we're seeing sort of positive incremental improvement in, it needs to continue to grow. And the reason it's constrained is because there are, you know, very few people that do this and a lot of us in the industry rely on the same players. And so we're all ramping up around the same time.\nTo your point about what we're doing, you know, differently, I would say we're really working hard on making sure that our demand signal is crystal clear, that people know what we need, both from an OE, but also an MRO perspective, and then getting on LTAs as quickly as we can so that we can make sure that, again, supply chain knows what we need when we need it and that they can go make the necessary investments to deliver.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nOne thing I would add there too is that we've forward deployed a lot of our own people to these suppliers to help sort through the assessments that are required around the inspection criteria. As you know, these are parts that are built to extremely tight tolerances. It's important to have our engineering teams working collaboratively with the supply base to make sure that we can clear those items as they come through the production process. That's been something that I think we've put a lot of effort into over the last couple of years, frankly, but we've ramped that up recently.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Cai von Rumohr, your line is to.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks so much. So, morning.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nOperations look good at Pratt and Collins in the quarter. Sales beat, margins beat, and you've increased sales for the year, but you basically didn't touch profit guides for Pratt or Collins. Is that conservative or are you assuming? I mean, it looks like in Collins the margins are the same or basically a little bit lighter in the second half than the second quarter. Give us some color on that if you could.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nHi Cai, thanks for the comments.\nOverall, you know, we're pleased with the first half results as you kind of outlined there. We've updated our full year guidelines to reflect that strong top line growth when we think about the segments and what's going on there. There are some headwinds. We've got some higher product costs primarily in the defense pieces of Pratt and Collins. We've got a little bit of under absorption with some of the lower OE rates, and we've seen some higher end; now we have offset some of those headwinds with some below the line items such as corporate spending reductions and tightening. So there are a few moving pieces here. But we've got good momentum as we enter the second half of the year, and we're confident in the updated outlook.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris. Let me add a little bit, Kai, in terms of the top line, maybe some perspective on the moving pieces. You saw that we took up our sales $750 million at the low end, $500 million at the high end. So think about the midpoint, obviously. $625 million, if you break that down, I would put $500 million of that is within the Pratt & Whitney business. It's really two pieces of that. About $400 million of that, 80% is in the military business. We saw really strong material inputs, particularly supporting the F135 and F117 aftermarket. We dropped that through and the rest is slightly higher. Oh, you saw the numbers we had in the Q1 and Q2. And so we're seeing good mix and we're letting that flow through to the full year as well.\nAs Chris mentioned, the profit side of Pratt, we're seeing higher production costs again, particularly in the military side of the business as we burned down the F135 contract and a little bit of higher R&D spending supporting the continued certification of the GTF Advantage and obviously the powder metal related things at Collins. You know, we also took that guide up a little bit. You know, see high single digit, you know, think 7% to 8% higher end of the range that we were at before. That's about $100 million of sales. And as I think about that, you know, it's a couple hundred million, maybe a three points lower on the commercial OE side. We've taken, you know, our rates down on the Boeing side in particular.\nBut offsetting that or more than offsetting that is, you know, the aftermarket and the military side of Collins as well. So about a one-point increase on the commercial aftermarket, two points on defense, you know, just to kind of round it out at Raytheon, you know, we now see, you know, solid flat, if you will, organically up mid-single digits. It's about $50 million. There's slightly higher eliminations at the corporate level, you know, we're going to kind of hold as a placeholder what we saw in Q2 for the rest of the year, a lot more intercompany activity between Collins and Pratt, and Collins and Raytheon there. So again, you know, we're early.\nWe're encouraged by the first half results.\nOn the profit side, but certainly on the top end, we're seeing a trend towards the top end of our prior ranges. Taking them up slightly here. And of course, if there's more, you'll see that in the results. Want to kind of see another quarter play out.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nTerrific. Thank you very much.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question, coming from the lineup, Jason Gursky from Citi. Jason Gursky, your line is open.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGreat.\nThank you.\nAnd good morning, everybody. And Nathan, welcome to the call. Hey, Chris, I know I recognize that you're executing on the existing engine platforms, but I'm wondering if you wouldn't spend a few minutes talking about the future. News flow coming out of Farnborough suggests, you know, maybe Rolls-Royce is going to get back into the narrow body market. GE Aerospace made some comments this week on its earnings call that, you know, customer interest in the RISE program continues to grow. And then I think somebody at Pratt & Whitney, at Farnborough, suggested that your next generation GTF might be 25% more fuel efficient. Not clear to me whether that was relative to the existing GTF or it was a comment about the overall existing fleet.\nI'm wondering if you can just.\nKind of paint a picture for us on what the next generation of engines is going to look like from your perspective, whether customers are kind of starting to have more conversations with you all about that, and what the potential timing of a new engine on the narrowbody side might be?\nThanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX",
    "content2": "Yeah, thank you, Jason. And as you might imagine, having been at Farnborough this week, there was a lot of conversation around the future of narrowbody, on sustainability, and on when those platforms, you know, will be launched and get into service. I will just kind of maybe break this into sort of near medium and then longer term near medium. Our focus, and Neil sort of alluded to this, is on the GTF Advantage. Right now we're about 90%+ of the way through that testing, got some good results out of our environmental and durability. And so we're continuing down that certification path. As you know, another 1% of fuel burn, 4% thrust, but a more durable and reliable, you know, engineering.\nSo that's the near term, as we think about sort of the medium, longer term. I will tell you we're evaluating and investing in a number of key enabling technologies for insertion into future GTF configurations. Think composite fan blades, advanced materials like CMCs, planetary gear system. And then you just referenced hybrid electric. Some of those numbers that were coming out of Farnborough are what I would call hybrid electric or electric applications. And you think about that for the narrow body. I view that as more of an assist, if you will, around sort of corner points of the flight envelope, lower platform, smaller platforms, the hybrid electrical do more work. And we continue to invest there and have made some really strong strides in some of our demonstrator programs. So again, we've said this before, the GTF architecture continues to have runway.\nSo these are all the enabling technologies that we continue to invest in that we think we're going to be able to insert in that for the next generation single aisle. I'll also make the point that many of us in the industry are focused on fuel efficiency, and rightly so. I will tell you that we're also really focused on durability and reliability. As we continue to go push efficiency gains in the engine, there's always going to be trade-offs, and we've got to make sure that those trades make sense, which is why we continue to invest in things like advanced coatings and other advanced manufacturing techniques that can help with the durability of the engines. If you talk to operators today, the number one thing that they want in addition to sustainability and fuel efficiency is time on wing.\nWe've got to make sure that as we're driving efficiency and rightly so, that we're also focused on the durability of the engines in the time on wing. That's frankly how; that's what the customers need, and that's what we need for our business model.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Matt Akers. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the question. I want to see if you could touch on divestitures a little bit. You've been pretty active there. Could you talk about just kind of what inning we're in there, what's left to divest? And specifically, are you able to give the revenue and EBIT contribution from the Hoist and Winch deal?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Matt, this is Neil. You know, we're really happy obviously with some of the transactions that we've announced recently and Hoist and Winch in particular, not going to be able to give you the numbers today. But once that transaction is closed, we'll get that out there in the right forum, but, you know, got good value there. We expect to close that in the Q4 as it relates to the actuation business at Collins. You know, we were pleased to see the Italian, you know, approval in the last quarter. You know, we're continuing to support Safran in the efforts that are required to close that transaction. Again, you know, nothing that we see we can't get through here, but it's going to take a little bit of time. Some regulatory hurdles still remain there. But you know, there's other things we're looking at.\nWe're always looking at the portfolio, you know, as Chris and I have talked about, you know, you know, we're targeting bolt-on type M&A. That fits into our technology roadmaps where it's appropriate. We want to be opportunistic there, but we also want to be thoughtful and careful. Then we're always looking at the portfolio from a pruning perspective. Nothing to announce today, but I can tell you that, you know, we're going through a rigorous process as we always do every year. There'll probably be a handful of others that we come up with. We've talked about some of them in the past, but again, nothing to say today.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, maybe just to add to that, Matt, we do have a robust and rigorous process to take a hard look at the portfolio every year. And while there are businesses that might be solid performers, we want to make sure that they fit into the criteria long term within RTX, namely technology differentiation and strong aftermarket tails. Right. So continuing to look at the portfolio through that prism, I'll also remind you that we've set up an RTX Ventures. We've been making investments in early stage companies, keeping our eye on some of those trends, both commercial and defense. And so those may yield some opportunities as well for bolt ons that fit into again, our criteria.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, David Strauss from Barclays. David Strauss.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks.\nGood morning everyone.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOn to Neil.\nYour comments on Collins and the Boeing OE rate you said took them down. I didn't know if that meant you?\nActually, have reduced the rate at.\nWhether you're building on the MAX and 787 or you're just going up more slowly. Maybe if you could clarify that, and you know, if possible, talk about where you are exactly on the MAX and 787.\nThanks.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSure.\nDavid. You know, listen, I'm not going to get into specific rates per se, but I'll tell you that obviously we started the year with a more aggressive outlook in terms of what that rate ramp would look like. What I would tell you is that we're in the low 30s in the first half of the year, and we do expect the rate to ramp up as the year goes on. So it's not a flat rate assumption, but I'd say it's a calculated increase. You'll be able to hear from Boeing next week, I think. I'm sure they'll have something to say about their rates. I'd say today we're aligned with the air framers, but we're monitoring it just like everybody else on the Airbus front. Chris talked about it already, same thing. We're aligned there with the Airbus team on output.\nThere is always a desire to increase those rates, but we're doing the best we can to balance between the airline customers and the OEMs here. But I'd say from an outlook perspective, we're reasonably well calibrated, barring some change that we're not aware of right now.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nWelcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Robert, your line is open.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nThank you. This is Scott Mikus for Rob Spingarn. Neil or Chris, in the past you've mentioned that you don't exactly like the business model where the engine OEMs go through a heavy development cycle, lose cash on the OE sales, and have to recoup your investment in the aftermarket. So I'm just wondering, with the general misalignment of profit drivers between the airframers and the engine OEMs that can create tension when allocating scarce resources on a future clean sheet aircraft program, is there going to be a broader industry discussion to better align those profit drivers between the airframers and engine OEMs?\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks for the question, Scott, and it's a good question. Yes. The short answer is yes, there's going to need to be a discussion around aligning our business model. I believe that's not only in the interest of, I'll speak, you know, from the engine side from the Pratt team, but also from the air framer team. When you're, you've got different incentives in terms of, you know, how you, how you make your money. It does just drive a tension, and ultimately sometimes the customer is the one that's sort of caught, you know, in between there. So again, I think the more that we can align our business models, the better will be, you know, for the OEMs and for the customer base. You're right, the opportunity to do that is going to be on the next platform.\nWe're already obviously entrenched in the current platforms, but I think we're both seeing this at times misalignment play out. I think with the new platforms it gives us a chance, the clean sheet of paper to sketch out how do we get better aligned and better serve our customers.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nThanks. I'll stick with one.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup. Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. No, I am on a cell phone.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nHey Noah.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nHey, Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nWith regard to the GTF powder metal process, is it possible to put numbers?\nAround.\nYou know, of the number of engines that will need to come off wing, how many, what percentage, even if a range, have come off wings, and of that, how many have actually fully gone through the full fix process versus are waiting in line to do so?\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks, Noah. So let me just step back and give you sort of the powder metal sort of ramp up and insertion background here. So as we've talked about before, since late last year, everything coming off the line going to the OEMs had the full life powder metal parts. Now all spare engines have those as well. MRO was always a, I'll call it a phased ramp up. And so we'll start to see this ramp up here in the second half of the year, and it's going to continue to accelerate into 2025 and into 2026. Again, we've put a lot of emphasis on isothermal forging production. As I said up front, we put a lot of demand into the system as you might imagine, given what's happened with the fleet, and we've seen some solid progress. We need to continue to see some more ramp up.\nAs we said before, when a shop, excuse me, when an engine comes into the shop for a visit, we do an evaluation based on the work scope it needs, where it operates, when it was naturally going to see another shop visit, to determine whether or not insertion of those parts makes sense. Again, we're trying to get the longest time on wing that we can and make sure that we allocate these resources appropriately. Those are all the things that go into the decision as to which engines get the full life parts, in which we can do an inspection and do all the other things in the engine because it was already slated to come back in advance of.\nThe time limits that we've established. So there's a lot of moving pieces here, but suffice it to say, it's going to be a continued ramp back half of this year, 2025 and 2026 on powder metal production and insertion in MRO.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, as you're going through incremental customer negotiations, are you finding yourself able to change assumptions either are better or worse based on what you've experienced thus far, or is it more kind of the assumptions remain similar because the output has been in line?\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThe assumptions remain similar, Noah. But I'll tell you, each customer negotiation is different based upon where they operate and how they operate. And so the agreements are tailored, you know, to those. I would say airline specific, you know, you know, metrics and criteria, but we're using the same, I'll call it key assumptions that we outlined up front across the board.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And final question coming from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Scott, your line is open.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nHey, Bethcott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, Chris.\nAre you seeing progress with the FAA in terms of getting some of these wide body first class seats certified? And then I'm sorry if I missed it, but are you seeing momentum on ramping up output on the 787 heat exchanger?\nThanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Scott. So, yes, on the seating, you know, question, we continue to work our way through the certification there. These are actually a lot more complex than I think people understand, and the certification requirements, you know, are relatively high bar. But we think we have our arms around what we need to do there to get these certified and ultimately, you know, into the hands of the airframers and the airlines on the, on the heat exchanger. I'll just remind everyone that that was a part that we had to move as a result of the conflict in Russia, Ukraine, you know, out of Russia, and then, you know, set up another source, you know, here and set up a separate supply chain.\nThat has taken some time, but we're starting to ramp up there to the rates that we need to support what we think Boeing's demand is.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the RTX team.\n\nNathan Ware\n\nVP of Investor Relations, RTX\n\nAll right, thanks, Livia.\nThat concludes today's call. As always, I and the investor relations team will be available for follow-up questions. Really appreciate everyone joining today, and have a good day.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nGood day, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThis now concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.\nGood day and welcome to the RTX Q2 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Livia, and I'll be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. On the call today are Chris Calio, President and Chief Executive Officer, Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer, and Nathan Weyer, Vice President of Investigations.

Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding acquisition, accounting adjustments, and net non-recurring and/or significant items, often referred to by management as other significant items. The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nRTX SEC filings, including its forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. To ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You may ask any further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Calio.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. As you saw from our press release this morning, RTX delivered strong operational and financial performance in the second quarter as we continue to execute on our customer commitments and strategic priorities. Let me start the highlights on slide 3. We saw another quarter of excellent top line growth with adjusted sales of $19.8 billion, which were up 10%. Organically adjusted EPS of $1.41 was up 9% year-over-year, driven by profit growth and margin expansion across all three segments, and free cash flow was strong at $2.2 billion. We also saw continued growth in our backlog, which ended the quarter at $206 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.25.\nThere were also some notable contract wins in the quarter, including a 10-year MRO agreement to support Collins Aerospace's significant content on Air Canada's 787 fleet of up to 70 aircraft, including avionics, air management, and electric power systems. Collins Aerospace also received a multibillion-dollar award for the U.S. Air Force's Next Generation Survivable Airborne Operations Center, and Raytheon received a $639 million award for SPY-6 radar production for the U.S. Navy. As you saw in early July, Germany placed an additional order for Patriot Systems. This is on top of the $1.2 billion order they placed for multiple systems in Q1 of the year. We also saw some positive GTF announcements at the Farnborough Airshow earlier this week with over 700 GTF engines ordered, including options and commitments.\nThese include Cebu Pacific selecting the GTF to power the carrier's order for up to 152 additional single aisle aircraft and Avolon selecting the GTF engine for up to 160 aircraft. So another quarter of robust orders with significant wins already secured early here in Q3 and more expected as the year progresses. We also continue to make progress on our critical initiatives specifically regarding the GTF Fleet Management Plan. We remain on track with our financial and operational outlook consistent with our prior comments. As of the end of Q2, we have inspected over 6,000 powder metal parts that are in the field across all programs and the associated fallout rate remains below the 1% we had assumed and the findings are consistent with the assumptions that underpin our Fleet management plan.\nAt our MRO facilities, throughput of engines continues to improve, and overall capacity is expanding with the recent addition of two new MRO shops into the network. PW1100 MRO output increased 10% versus the first quarter. We expect this ramp to continue in the second half of the year. As it relates to the PW1100 fleet, AOGs have leveled out over the past few months and remain in line with our expectations. We've also now reached support agreements with 20 of our customers covering roughly 65% of the impacted fleet, and the terms are in line with our assumptions beyond our operational performance. Let me also comment on the legal and contract charges we outlined in our press release this morning, and then Neil will provide more detail in a bit.\nWe're nearing completion of agreements with the Department of Justice, SEC, and Department of State to resolve several legal matters. These matters primarily arose out of Legacy Raytheon Company and Rockwell Collins prior to the merger and acquisition of these companies. We've already taken robust corrective actions to address the legacy gaps that led to these issues, including implementing enhanced compliance and training measures. We also took a charge related to the anticipated termination of a Raytheon fixed-price development contract that was entered into before the merger. As we've been discussing the last few quarters, we've been battling through some challenges in a handful of fixed-price development programs, including this one, but this specific contract is unique in terms of its scope, deliverables, and associated risk profile, which led us to pursue termination. So we're pleased to be putting these matters behind us.\nAs I highlighted earlier, our operational.\nPerformance was very strong in the quarter. Given this performance and the continuing strength of our end markets, we are raising our outlook for adjusted sales and EPS. We've also revised our cash outlook for the year as a result of matters I just discussed. Lastly, as you saw in May, we raised our dividend 7% and remain on track to return 36 to 37 billion of capital to share owners from the merger through the end of next year. Okay with that, let's move to slide four and I'll spend a few minutes on our strategic priorities that will enable us to drive best in class performance across RTX including meeting customer demand, continued sales growth, margin expansion across our segments, and strong cash flow generation.\nGiven our growing installed base and the unprecedented demand for our products, our first priority is executing on our commitments powered by our CORE Operating System. Our focus is on driving incremental operational improvements to ramp output and deliver on this demand. Today we have over 4,000 CORE projects being worked across the company. For example, at Collins, our Avionics business improved first pass yield by 2x in its fire detection product line by reconfiguring the production cell layout, creating digital tools, and upgrading equipment. And at Raytheon, the team conducted a CORE Leadership week to identify initiatives to more than double weekly output on a key component of our AIM-9X effector. As a result, the team achieved a 90% increase in output in the quarter and is on track to hit their full year target by the end of Q3.\nWe also continue to add capacity to meet the demands of the industrial ramp up. During the quarter, we announced a $200 million investment in our carbon brake facility in Spokane, Washington. Once complete, it will add 70,000 sq ft of manufacturing footprint to meet rapidly growing demand for our Collins Brake solutions. On the defense side, we're investing in test equipment and tooling to more than double production capacity by year-end. On our Coyote program, it is a low-cost kinetic effector for the counter-unmanned aircraft systems that directly address today's drone threats. In addition to creating new capacity, we continue to modernize our existing footprint as part of our Industry 4.0 initiatives across RTX. We have now connected 26 factories with our proprietary digital analytics technology, providing us with real-time data to boost equipment efficiency, improve quality, and yield higher output.\nThis represents a 30% increase in connected sites since the start of the year, and we remain on track to connect 40 factories by the end of the year. These incremental efficiency, capacity, and technology improvements are critical to meeting the needs of our customers as we operate in the strongest demand environment in our history. Let me move now to our second priority, innovating for future growth. We are executing on our cross-company technology roadmap to develop differentiated solutions in areas such as sustainability, advanced propulsion, next generation sensing, connected battle, space, and hypersonics. This year alone we will spend over $7.5 billion on company- and customer-funded research and development to mature and introduce new capabilities to our customers.\nIn our product pipeline. For example, we are working on a number of hybrid-electric demonstrator programs to deliver advanced propulsion technologies and enable greater fuel efficiency across all future aircraft segments. Recently, our Collins, Pratt & Whitney Technology Research Center teams completed a significant milestone in the development of our hybrid-electric demonstrator, validating the integrated system functionality of the engine, electric motor, batteries, and high-voltage electric power distribution. In the quarter, we delivered the first TPY-2 radar that incorporates our proprietary Gallium Nitride technology. This technology is a game-changer for our sensing capability, providing expanded surveillance range and supporting additional missions in the space domain and hypersonics defense. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation and AI. This year we are adding an additional 30+ use cases that generate incremental productivity and cost savings across RTX using advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning.\nIn total, we have over 200 AI use cases currently deployed across various internal functions. Our AI investments are also enabling new and improved capabilities in our products such as predicting equipment failures and aiding human operators in executing complex tasks. These types of investments in innovation will allow us to continue to develop next-gen products and solutions well into the future. Our third priority is to fully leverage our breadth and scale across RTX to drive value for our stakeholders. Specifically, this includes creating a more efficient and competitive cost structure and managing our common supply chain. For example, over 35% of our product procurement spend is with common suppliers that support all three of our businesses, and we're using a unified RTX approach to our contracts and sourcing strategy.\nIt also includes harmonizing our product lifecycle and management processes and developing integrated solutions for strategic campaigns and pursuits such as NGAD, FLRAA, and next generation commercial platforms. Of course, we'll also continue to review our portfolio and prune where needed as well as target bolt-on M&A to support our RTX technology roadmap and grow our core franchises. Underlying all three of these priorities is our unwavering commitment to safety, quality, and compliance in everything that we do. It's what we and our customers expect and a commitment we will never compromise on. Putting it all together, I'm extremely excited and confident about the future of RTX. With that, before I turn over to Neil, I want to acknowledge a leadership update we announced last week. As you saw, Steve Timm has decided to retire after 28 years with the company.\nSteve was a great partner and teammate, and I want to thank him for his leadership at Collins, and we're very fortunate to have a strong bench and are very excited that Troy Brunk is taking over as the new President of Collins. Troy has served as the president of three of the six Collins business units, is uniquely qualified for the role. Okay, let me turn over to Neil to take you through the second quarter results in more detail. Neil.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks Chris. I'm on slide 5. As Chris said, operationally we had a strong quarter and continue to make progress on key financial metrics across RTX. RTX's adjusted sales of $19.8 billion were up 8% and on an organic basis were up 10% by channel. Commercial OE was up 19% as we continue to support aircraft demand, commercial aftermarket was up 14% as domestic, international, and long haul travel continues to grow, and excluding the Raytheon cybersecurity divestiture defense sales were up 7%. As we execute on our backlog.\nSegment operating profit of $2.4 billion was up 19% with growth at all three businesses contributing to consolidated segment operating margin expansion of 100 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 was up 9% from the prior year, driven by segment operating profit growth as well as a lower share count which was partially offset by expected headwinds from higher interest and tax expense, and lower pension income. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $0.08 and included $0.29 of acquisition accounting adjustments and $0.03 of restructuring and other significant nonrecurring items. In addition, as it relates to the items Chris mentioned, GAAP EPS also includes a $0.68 charge related to the expected resolution of several legacy legal matters, and a $0.33 charge related to a fixed-price development contract at Raytheon.\nWith respect to the legal matters, we are working to finalize deferred prosecution agreements and a civil settlement with the DOJ, and an administrative order with the SEC. These agreements will cover the previously disclosed investigations of defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts which were entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017.\nThey will also cover the previously disclosed investigations of improper payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture Thales Raytheon Systems in connection with some Middle East contracts dating back to 2012.\nAs a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $633 million in the quarter, which brings our total reserves associated with these matters to $959 million. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $285 million related to voluntarily disclosed export controls compliance matters primarily identified during the integration of Rockwell Collins and Raytheon Company into RTX, including matters which are expected to be addressed in a consent agreement with the Department of State. As part of the resolution of each of these three matters, we will be required to retain independent compliance monitors over the three-year term of the agreements. In total, we expect to pay about $1 billion related to these matters this year and have incorporated that into our updated free cash flow outlook for the year. I'll take you through the other moving pieces of our outlook on the next slide.\nWhile the financial impact of these items is above what we had previously reserved, we believe the provisions we have taken put these issues behind us financially and we will continue to cooperate with the government and external monitors as we move forward as it relates to the fixed-price development contract. As you know, we've been discussing the challenges we've been working through on this front for some time. In conjunction with that effort and an anticipated termination on one of our Raytheon programs with a foreign customer, we've recorded a pre-tax charge of $575 million in the quarter. Again, we've incorporated the expected cash outflows into our revised free cash flow outlook for this year, but for the quarter cash flow was robust with $2.2 billion of free cash flow that was driven by strong collections across the portfolio and some lower tax payments.\nWe also continued our deleveraging in Q2 and paid down another $750 million of debt, bringing our total debt repayment since the accelerated share repurchase was initiated last October to $2.7 billion.\nWe returned $867 million of capital to share owners, primarily through dividends during the quarter.\nOn the portfolio front, we're also pleased that Italy has approved the sale of the Collins actuation business, and we continue to actively support the remaining efforts to complete the transaction. As you may have also seen, we have entered into an agreement to sell the Collins hoist and winch business for over $500 million, another great example of the portfolio pruning we are doing to focus on our core franchises. Okay, turning to page six, let me share a few details on our updated outlook for the year. As you've seen, the first half performance across all three of our businesses has been strong, driven by end market demand and continued execution. There are of course a few areas we continue to monitor, including pockets of supply chain challenges, inflation, and the ongoing OE production rate uncertainty.\nBut given the results to date, we are increasing our full-year adjusted sales outlook to between $78.75 and 79.5 billion, up from our prior range of $78 to 79 billion. We now expect 8 to 9% organic sales growth for the year, up from our prior range of 7 to 8%. We're also increasing our adjusted EPS outlook by $0.10 on the low end and $0.05 on the high end, putting the new range at $5.35 to 5.45, up from $5.25 to 5.40. The improvement is driven primarily by lower interest and corporate expenses, higher pension income, and a lower full-year effective tax rate. We have included the corresponding updated outlook for these metrics in the appendix of our webcast slides on free cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, we've incorporated our expected cash outflows associated with the legal and contract matters into our outlook.\nPartially offsetting these impacts is some improvement in current year tax payments of roughly $500 million. All in, we have updated our free cash flow outlook to be approximately $4.7 billion compared to our previous expectation of approximately $5.6 billion. With that, let me turn it over to Nathan to talk you through our segment results and outlooks.\n\nNathan Ware\n\nVP of Investor Relations, RTX\n\nThanks Neil. Starting with Collins on slide 7, sales were $7 billion in the quarter, up 10% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven by strength in commercial aftermarket, commercial OE, and defense by channel. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 12%, driven by a 16% increase in parts and repair, a 15% increase in provisioning, and a 9% decrease in mods and upgrades, with mods and upgrades coming off a difficult prior year compare that benefited from the 5G mandate. Commercial sales for the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year, driven by growth in narrowbody, widebody, and regional platforms, and defense sales were up 7% primarily due to higher volume. Adjusted operating profit of $1.15 billion was up $230 million or 25% from the prior year, driven primarily by drop through on higher commercial aftermarket volume as well as higher defense and commercial OE volume.\nLooking ahead on a full year basis, we now expect Collins sales to grow high single digits on both an adjusted and organic basis, up from the prior range of mid to high single digits driven by continued strength in commercial air traffic and defense volume. We continue to expect operating profit growth between $650 and 725 million versus 2023.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on slide 8, sales of$6.8 billion were up 19% on both an adjusted and organic basis, with sales growth across all three channels. Commercial OEM sales were up 33% in the quarter. Higher engine deliveries and favorable mix in the large commercial engine business, commercial aftermarket sales were up 15% in the quarter, driven by higher volume and favorable mix in both the large commercial engine and PW Canada businesses, and in the military engine business, sales were up 16%, primarily driven by higher sustainment volume across the F135 and F117 platforms. Adjusted operating profit of$537 million was up $101 million versus the prior year.\nDrop through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable mix, as well as favorable large commercial OE mix, was partially offset by headwinds from large commercial OE engine deliveries and the absence of a $60 million favorable prior year contract matter. Drop through from higher military volume and favorable mix was more than offset by higher production costs and higher R and D and SGA expenses. Turning to Pratt's full year outlook, we now expect sales to grow mid teens on an adjusted inorganic basis, up from our prior range of low double digits driven by stronger military volume and higher commercial OE. We continue to see adjusted operating profit growth between $400 and $475 million versus 2023. Now turning to Raytheon on Slide 9, adjusted sales of $6.6 billion in the quarter were down 2% as a result of the cybersecurity divestiture completed in the first quarter.\nOn an organic basis, sales were up 4% primarily driven by higher volume on land and air defense systems including Patriot, counter-UAS programs, and Stinger. Adjusted operating profit of $709 million was up $47 million versus the prior year driven primarily by flow-through on higher volume, favorable mix, and improved net productivity partially offset by the impact of the cybersecurity divestiture, and Raytheon had $5 billion of bookings in the quarter resulting in a backlog of $51 billion on a rolling 12-month basis. Raytheon's book-to-bill is 1.13. In addition to the SPY-6 award that Chris mentioned earlier, Raytheon also had $928 million appointments, classified awards, and a $393 million award from NASA to design, produce, and deliver four units that will provide advanced Earth observation.\nLooking ahead, we now expect Raytheon sales to grow by mid single digits organically, up from the prior range of low to mid single digits, driven by improved material flow. As a result, we now expect Raytheon's operating profit to grow between $125 and 200 million versus 2023, up from the prior range of between $100 and 200 million. This includes the impact from the cybersecurity divestiture. With that, I'll turn it back over to Chris to wrap things up.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nOkay, thanks, Nathan. I'm on Slide 10. As you've heard today, our second quarter operating results were very strong, and we're confident in our updated outlook for the full year. But if you step back and just think of beyond 2024 and look at the long term for RTX, we've got the best positioned franchise programs, the right content on the right platforms across commercial aerospace and defense. Our large and growing installed base will support significant commercial aftermarket growth for decades to come. And our industry leading defense capabilities address the threats playing out across the global landscape. All right, with that, let's open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time and to allow for broader participation, you are asked to limit yourself to one question. To ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone.\nThe first question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Peter Arment, your line is open.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nHey, thanks.\nGood morning, Chris, Neil, Nathan.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nHey, Chris. Nice results.\nJust, I guess maybe just on the GTF fleet management plan. Sounds like, you know, everything's going according to plan and remains on track.\nBut maybe if you just peel back.\nDig in a little bit. I know you talked about some pacing items in the past about getting, you know, full life discs into the MRO shops and just kind of material availability. It sounds like the MRO capacity is going as planned. But maybe any kind of metrics or any color, you know, what you're seeing and any opportunities actually where any of these metrics might, you know, still be able to come in on the left, you know, before 2026.\nThanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, okay, Peter, thanks for the question. Let me take you through where things stand. As you noted, our key assumptions around AOGs, lingering turnaround time, shop visit, mix between heavy and light, and customer compensation all remain consistent. And as I noted up front, our assumptions on the inspection, fallout rates, and the findings are all consistent or even better than we planned. So good stability around the key assumptions. As you know, MRO output is the key enabler, and we're focused on improving the material flow, better processes in the shops, and we've added some capacity on this front. And again, we saw some good signs of progress here in the first half of the year. I mean, output was up 10% from Q1 to Q2, and H1 output on the 1100 is up over 30% versus H1 2023.\nWe continue to drive some output there, which is helpful. The key enabler, of course, on the MRO output is material. You had mentioned that up front, we're continuing to see some progress on structural castings. Structural castings are up about 5% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. So good progress there. And then on forgings, the powdered metal parts.\nWe continue to drive output there as well. Isothermal forgings were up almost 100% year-over-year. We continue to add additional capacity for inspection and machining. For example, we've nearly doubled our sonic inspection capacity for the year. So again, driving on all the key enablers, Peter, to try to get this fleet in as healthy a shape as we possibly can. Also, just note, sort of unrelated to the fleet. Management plans continue to drive OE output as well. OE deliveries were up sequentially up 30% in the first half on a year-over-year basis, despite sort of grinding through some of the supply chain portabilities. We're also pleased with the additions to the GTF backlog that were announced at Farnborough recently.\nSo, again, focusing on what we can control on the fleet management plan and continuing to drive both supply chain and new orders into the backlog.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate all the details.\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Robert Stallard from Vertical Research Partners. Robert Stallard, your line is open.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning, Rob.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nHey, Rob.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nChris, following on the GTF theme, I was wondering if you could comment on what the situation is with Airbus and their recent forecast cut, because they've clearly not been getting as many new engines as they anticipated. So those engines instead go into the spare engine pool. Thank you.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYep. Thanks, Rob.\nSo again, you heard me say just a minute ago to Peter that ROE deliveries are up sequentially and up first half of the year 30% on a.\nYear-over-year basis.\nWe're not necessarily where we need to be with Airbus, but again, we're seeing strong growth sequentially and year-over-year. And our outlook reflects our assessment of where Airbus needs support from us, and we're aligned on what they need. You alluded to the fact that we're balancing both OE and spare engine and material, and that's true, and we need to do that for the support of the fleet. But again, I continue to be encouraged by what we continue to drive in terms of production and getting Airbus what they need. And I think in the back half, we're going to continue to balance the OE spare engine and MRO needs, but I think we'll be in a position to get Airbus what they need.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question coming from the lineup, Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Myles Walton, your line is open.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, Chris or Neil, I'm not sure which, on the defense side on Raytheon, could you maybe dig a little bit into what are the problem programs?\nStill remaining, maybe a percentage of revenue, if that's what you want to handle.\nIt or backlog, and then specifically to.\nThis decision to sort of proactively, you know, cut losses and terminate the contract. Not an easy decision.\nBut are there other contracts where you could extinguish similarly or would that cause customer distress? And lastly, was there a cash impact too?\nThanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Myles. I'll start and then Neil can certainly chime in. Certainly not an easy decision, but we've been alluding to the fact that we've had a significant classified program out there that was, we would say, not in our wheelhouse, meaning the work that we had taken on and this contract was pre formation of RTX was not within our core competency, and we struggled with that and we struggled to get to the right technical solutions and ultimately came to a point where we just didn't think it was productive anymore to continue to go down this path, and ultimately decided it was in the best interest of us and the customer to just kind of do a reset here and allow us to go focus our resources on some of the other programs that we've got.\nYou had mentioned the handful of other, I'll call them, classified development, fixed price development programs that we've been talking about. I will say those are much different in terms of risk profile than the one we took action on here. Those have some important milestones here in 2024 and in 2025, but we feel like we've got a much better handle on those than the one we're talking about here and feel like we understand the risks much better there and what needs to be done to get them to closure\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nand just to add.\nMyles, in terms of the cash flow impact. So, you know, as I sit here today, there's really just a few changes that we've made to our 2024 outlook. The first is about $1 billion related to the legal matters placeholder, about $0.5 billion related to the contract matter that Chris just was talking about, and offsetting that is about $0.5 billion of improvement that we've seen operationally in our, in our tax payments due to some planning that we've done. So net, net that's $1 billion, and I would expect that that mostly sits in the Q4 of this year. It'll depend on when we get the final resolutions with the government agencies. But that's trending towards, you know, certainly late September or early in the Q4.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thanks for the color.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question coming from the lineup, Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you.\nNeil.\nMaybe another one for you. Just, you know, you're going to do about $7.2 billion of net income this year on an adjusted basis and generate $4.7 billion of cash. Some of that is one-time items with the DOJ, the powder metal, and tax. So how do we think about that gap closing on net income and cash flow, and then just on the DOJ? Can you elaborate a little bit more how we think about that, the outcomes of it, and the cash impact outside of 2024?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSure.\nLet me start with free cash flow. You just heard me talk about sort of the changes that we rolled into our outlook for the year. As I think about the absolute value of the $4.7 billion, remember that includes a couple of nonrecurring items that are pretty substantial. And if you adjust for those things, you kind of get to a seven, seven and a half billion, maybe even higher level of free cash flow that is operational. So I think as we look forward, Sheila, and we get the powder metal payments behind us this year and next year, just a little color. So far we're a little less than $200 million into our $1.3 billion of powder metal outflows this year. We expect that to obviously ramp up.\nYou heard us talk about doubling the number of customers that we've got agreements with, and about 2/3 of the fleet under agreement. So I would expect third and.\nFourth quarter kind of be split pretty.\nEvenly with respect to the rest of the payments this year. But if you look at the underlying operations, you can see that there's real strong organic, sustainable cash flow. And I think that's what we'll be looking to see sustain itself over time. Now in particular, there's some working capital improvement. I've talked about like $1.1 billion of improvement year-over-year and arriving at our $4.7 billion. Obviously inventory was a use of cash.\nIn the first half.\nWe expect that to turn around in the second half, which is typical for our business. We've got a little bit of headwind from the OE production rates that we've contemplated in that, but we're seeing stronger collections on the customer side. So that balances for the rest of this year. So that's how I would characterize the free cash flow situation today as it relates to the DOJ and the outcomes. You know, I think we feel very certain about the amount of cash impact that's going to happen this year. As we talked about in our prepared remarks, you know, we've reached agreements in principle. There's some work to do to get that finalized with the various government agencies. That could take a few months. But when it, when it happens, that'll get filed and be available publicly.\nThen shortly thereafter, we'll be required to make the payments associated with that. There's very little that lingers beyond that. I'd say it's in the $50 million a year kind of range following 2024. It's manageable. Those costs will include some residual payments on the global trade-related consent agreement as well as some internal costs that we'll obviously invest in to continue to improve our processes as we support the monitor activities. So, you know, I would leave it at that for now with those items.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nCool.\nThank you.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThank you, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question coming from the lineup, Doug Harned from Bernstein. Doug Harned, your line is open.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you.\nGood morning.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Doug.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nDoug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYou know what you've talked about and what we've heard as well is that your shop on the GTF that a lot of the shop visit times, you brought that down significantly, the time in the shop, which is great. And so presumably this is with improved parts availability that's allowed you to do that. And I know in Q1 you did divert resources away from V2500 work in order to better enable you to provide GTF parts. And so two things on this. First, where do you stand now on V2500 MRO? Is that kind of back to normal? And then second, even though those shop visit times seem to have come down significantly, everything we've seen is that induction wait times are still quite long. And perhaps if you could address those two issues, it would be really helpful.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX",
    "content3": "Doug, let me start on the V2500, then I'll hand it over to Chris to talk a little bit about the GTF induction times and turnaround times on the V2500. On a first half basis, we're at about 369 inductions to date. We had talked about 800 on a full year basis. We expect that. We still expect that to continue. I guess the good news there is that with that acceleration, not only are we seeing an increase in the number of shop visits in the second half of the year, we're also seeing more work scope. These are heavier overhauls, and all of that will contribute to the second half growth that we'll expect to see coming from Pratt & Whitney, particularly in the aftermarket.\nSo the second half story for Pratt's operating outlook is really focused around what we call the mature commercial engines, the V2500 being the biggest part of that. So that's where we sit today on that front. Chris, maybe a couple comments on GTF.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, yeah. Before I do that, Doug, I'll just say on the V, I mean, obviously, our customers are relying heavily on that, given the other stress in the fleet. So we're heavily focused on making sure that, you know, V inductions turnaround times and whatnot, that the support is there for the customer base. On the GTF MRO, you're right. In the shop, when we've got material flowing, when we've got material in the right positions in Gate 2 and Gate 3, we are seeing significant reduction in shop turnaround time, both our shops and our partners, which is really encouraging. The induction times are really a function of what we would call the parking lot. So there are a lot of engines that came off wing, obviously.\nWhen the ad hit, and people did some of that proactively. So we are still working through a large parking lot of engines that need to get inducted into the shop. But again, we're encouraged by what we're seeing when the material is there, which is why we're so heavily focused on making sure the supply chain is healthy. You heard me talk about structural castings, isothermal forgings. These are the things that are going to be the biggest unlock for us as we take the AOG numbers down and support our customers.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question, coming from the lineup, Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Ron, your line is open.\n\nSamantha Stiroh\n\nEquity Research Associate, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning. This is Samantha Stiroh on for Ron Epstein. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Collins, particularly interiors, kind of what they're doing and what your expectations are there. Thank you.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Samantha. How are you doing? Let me start there. I mean, we're seeing, you know, significant improvement in the interiors business. And frankly, the second half story for Collins is going to rely substantially on the aftermarket uptick there in mods and upgrades. And you know, the one thing I would say about the Collins portfolio of businesses is we've seen really strong performance across all the segments. The SBU segments there, and many of them are at or above, and frankly, above where we were in 2019. Interiors is the one place where we're still lagging. So we're encouraged by the orders we are seeing there. And we do expect that to translate to substantial growth in the second half of this year. That's going to be driving a substantial part of Collins aftermarket year-over-year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Seth Seifman J.P. Morgan. Seth, your line is open.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, thanks very much and good morning.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning,\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nChris and Neil. I wonder if you could address the free cash flow target for next year. Kind of talk about whether you feel like that still stands. Areas of risk, areas of opportunity, and kind of your level of confidence.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. You know, right now, Seth, we don't see a reason to change the outlook. The fundamental business drivers remains strong on both the commercial and defense sides. Our end markets have proven pretty resilient and demand remains strong. As we said, we said up front, I think with everybody else, there are several items that we're tracking that have 2025 implications. Think, interest rates. We've got to continue to see the strength, you know, in the aftermarket. That's a big part of the cash walk in 2025 and of course, the supply chain. I mean, you just heard me talk about the sequential improvements and the stability we're seeing. But that's got to continue to ramp. But again, still feel like the 2025 cash goal here is achievable based on everything we see today, both within our four walls and the macro environment.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag, your line is open.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, Chris, Neil, and Nathan, maybe back with Pratt. You know, you guys have highlighted that isothermal forgings are getting better. You're seeing doubled capacity increases in sonic inspections, which are all good, but, you know, structural castings, you know, continue to be an issue. Can you provide more color on why structural casting continues to linger? And then also, I mean, look, this historically has been one of the bottlenecks for previous aerospace ramp ups. So I guess, you know, how is your approach different this time around to mitigate risk? And any color you could provide of the underlying tightness would be helpful.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nSure. Thanks, Kristine. You're right. You know, structural castings has been a habitual sort of constrained, you know, value stream even since the beginning of the ramp up, you know, back in the 2017 time frame. While we've seen, you know, some improvement here, I mentioned up 5% sequentially; it needs to be higher than that in order to continue to meet the demands of both, you know, OE to the airframers, spare engines, and MRO. So again, while we're seeing sort of positive incremental improvement, it needs to continue to grow. The reason it's constrained is because there are very few people that do this, and a lot of us in the industry rely on the same players. So we're all ramping up around the same time.\nTo your point about what we're doing differently, I would say we're really working hard on making sure that our demand signal is crystal clear that people know what we need, both from an OE, but also an MRO perspective, and then getting on LTA's as quickly as we can so that we can make sure that again, supply chain knows what we need when we need it and that they can go make the necessary investments to deliver.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nOne thing I would add there too is that we've forward deployed a lot of our own people to these suppliers to help sort through the assessments that are required around the inspection criteria. As you know, these are parts that are built to extremely tight tolerances. And it's important to have our engineering teams working collaboratively with the supply base to make sure that we can clear those items as they come through the production process. And that's been something that I think we've put a lot of effort into over the last couple of years, frankly, but we've ramped that up recently.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup. Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks so much.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nMorning.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nOperations look good at Pratt and Collins in the quarter. Sales beat, margins beat, and you've increased sales for the year, but you basically didn't touch profit guides for Pratt or Collins. Is that conservative or are you assuming? I mean, it looks like in Collins the margins are the same or basically a little bit lighter in the second half than the second quarter. Give us some color on that if you could.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nHi Cai, thanks for the comments.\nOverall, you know, we're pleased with the first half results as you kind of outlined there. We've updated our full year guide to reflect that strong top line growth. When we think about the segments and what's going on there, there are some headwinds. We've got some higher product costs primarily in the defense pieces of Pratt and Collins. We've got a little bit of under absorption with some of the lower OE rates, and we've seen some higher end. Now we have offset some of those headwinds with some below the line items such as corporate spending reductions and tightening. So there are a few moving pieces here. But we've got good momentum as we enter the second half of the year, and we're confident in the updated outlook.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris. Let me add a little bit, Kai, in terms of the top line, maybe some perspective on the moving pieces. You saw that we took up our sales $750 million at the low end, $500 million at the high end. So think about the midpoint, obviously. $625 million. If you break that down, I would put $500 million of that is within the Pratt & Whitney business. It's really two pieces of that. About $400 million of that, 80% is in the military business. We saw really strong material inputs, particularly supporting the F135 and F117 aftermarket. We dropped that through and the rest is slightly higher. Oh, you saw the numbers we had in Q1 and Q2. And so we're seeing good mix and we're letting that flow through to the full year as well.\nAs Chris mentioned, the profit side of Pratt, we're seeing higher production costs again, particularly in the military side of the business as we burn down the F135 contract and a little bit of higher R&D spending supporting the continued certification of the GTF Advantage and obviously the powder metal related things at Collins. You know, we also took that guide up a little bit. You know, see high single digit, you know, think 7% to 8% higher end of the range that we were at before. That's about $100 million of sales. And as I think about that, you know, it's a couple hundred million, maybe three points lower on the commercial OE side. We've taken, you know, our rates down on the Boeing side in particular.\nBut offsetting that, or more than offsetting that, is, you know, the aftermarket and the military side of Collins as well. So about a 1-point increase on the commercial aftermarket, 2 points on defense, you know, just to kind of round it out at Raytheon, you know, we now see, you know, solid flat, if you will, organically up mid-single digits. It's about $50 million. There's slightly higher eliminations at the corporate level. You know, we're going to kind of hold as a placeholder what we saw in the second quarter for the rest of the year, a lot more intercompany activity between Collins and Pratt and Collins and Raytheon there. So again, you know, we're early. We're encouraged by the first half results on the profit side, but certainly on the top end, we're seeing a trend towards the top end of our prior ranges.\nTaking them up slightly here. And of course, if there's more, you'll see that in the results. Want to kind of see another quarter play of help.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nTerrific. Thank you very much. You're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Jason Gursky from Citi. Jason Gursky, your line is open.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGreat.\nThank you.\nAnd good morning, everybody. And Nathan, welcome to the call. Hey, Chris, I know I recognize that you're, you know, executing on the existing engine platforms, but I'm wondering if you wouldn't spend a few minutes talking about the future. News flow coming out of Farnborough suggests maybe Rolls is going to get back into the narrow body market. GE made some comments this week on its earnings call that customer interest in the RISE continues to grow. And then I think somebody at Pratt at Farnborough suggested that your next generation GTF might be 25% more fuel efficient. Not clear to me whether that was relative to the existing GTF or it was a comment about the overall existing fleet.\nI'm wondering if you can just kind of paint a picture for us.\nOn what the next generation of engines is going to look like from your perspective, whether customers are kind of starting to have more conversations with you all about that, and what the potential timing of a new engine on the narrowbody side might be?\nThanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, thank you, Jason. As you might imagine having been at Farnborough this week, there was a lot of conversation around the future of narrowbody, on sustainability, and on when those platforms will be launched and get into service. I will just kind of maybe break this into sort of near, medium, and then longer term near medium. Our focus, and Neil sort of alluded to this, is on the GTF Advantage. Right now we're about 90+% of the way through that testing. Got some good results out of our environmental and durability. And so we're continuing down that certification path as you know, another 1% of fuel burn, 4% thrust, but a more durable and reliable, you know, engine. So that that's the near term as we think about sort of the medium, longer term.\nI will tell you we're evaluating and investing in a number of key enabling technologies for insertion into future GTF configurations. Think composite fan blades, advanced materials like CMCs, planetary gear system. And then you just referenced hybrid electric. Some of those numbers that were coming out of Farnborough are what I would call hybrid electric or electric applications. And you think about that for the narrow body. I view that as more of an assist, if you will, around sort of corner points of the flight envelope, lower platform, smaller platforms, the hybrid electrical do more work. And we continue to invest there and have made some really strong strides in some of our demonstrator programs. So again, we've said this before, the GTF architecture continues to have Runway.\nAnd so these are all the enabling technologies that we continue to invest in that we think we're going to be able to insert in that for the next generation single aisle. I'll also make the point that many of us in the industry are focused on fuel efficiency, and rightly so. I will tell you that we're also really focused on durability and reliability. As we continue to go pull push efficiency gains in the engine, there's always going to be trade-offs, and we've got to make sure that those trades make sense, which is why we continue to invest in things like advanced coatings and other advanced manufacturing techniques that can help with the durability of the engines. If you talk to operators today, the number one thing that they want in addition to, you know, sustainability and fuel efficiency, is time on wing.\nWe've got to make sure that as we're driving efficiency, and rightly so, that we're also focused on the durability of the engines in the time on wing. That's frankly how that's what the customers need and that's what we need for our business model.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Akers, Wells Fargo. Matt Akers, your line is open.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to see if you could touch on divestitures a little bit. You've been pretty active there. Could you talk about just kind of what inning we're in there, what's left to divest? And specifically, are you able to give the revenue and EBIT contribution from the Hoist and Winch deal?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Matt, this is Neil. You know, we're really happy obviously with some of the transactions that we've announced recently and Hoist and Winch in particular, not going to be able to give you the numbers today. But once that transaction is closed, we'll get that out there in the RTX forum. But you know, got good value there. We expect to close that in the fourth quarter as it relates to the actuation business at Collins. You know, we were pleased to see the Italian, you know, approval in the last quarter. You know, we're continuing to support Safran in the efforts that are required to close that transaction. Again, you know, nothing that we see we can't get through here, but it's going to take a little bit of time. Some regulatory hurdles still remain there. But you know, there's other things we're looking at.\nWe're always looking at the portfolio, you know, as Chris and I have talked about, you know, you know. We're targeting bolt-on type M&A that fits into our technology roadmaps where it's appropriate. We want to be opportunistic there, but we also want to be thoughtful and careful. Then we're always looking at the portfolio from a pruning perspective. Nothing to announce today, but I can tell you that, you know, we're going through a rigorous process as we always do every year. There'll probably be a handful of others that we come up with. We've talked about some of them in the past, but again, nothing to say today.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, maybe just to add to that, Matt, we do have a robust and rigorous process to take a hard look at the portfolio every year. And while there are businesses that might be solid performers, we want to make sure that they fit into the criteria long term within RTX, namely technology differentiation and strong aftermarket tails. Right. So continuing to look at the portfolio through that prism. I'll also remind you that we've set up an RTX Ventures. We've been making investments in early stage companies, keeping our eye on some of those trends, both commercial and defense. And so those may yield some opportunities as well for bolt-ons that fit into again, our criteria.\n\nMatt Akers\n\nResearch Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, David Strauss from Barclays. David Strauss is open.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning everyone.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nMorning, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOnto Neil.\nYour comments on Collins and the Boeing OE rate you said took them down. I didn't know if that meant you?\nActually have reduced the rate at which.\nYou're building on the MAX and 777 or you're just going up more slowly. Maybe if you could clarify that, and if possible, talk about where you are exactly on the MAX and 787.\nThanks.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSure.\nDavid, you know, listen, I'm not going to get into specific rates per se, but I'll tell you that obviously we started the year with a more aggressive outlook in terms of what that rate ramp would look like. What I would tell you is that we're in the low 30s in the first half of the year, and we do expect the rate to ramp up as the year goes on. So it's not a flat rate rate assumption, but I'd say it's a calculated increase. And, you know, you'll be able to hear from Boeing next week, I think. I'm sure they'll have something to say about their rates. I'd say today we're aligned with the airframers, but we're monitoring it just like everybody else on the Airbus front. Chris talked about it already, same thing. We're aligned there with the Airbus team on output.\nThere is always a desire to increase those rates, but we're doing the best we can to balance between the airline customers and the OEMs here. But I'd say from an outlook perspective, we're reasonably well calibrated, barring some change that we're not aware of right now.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the lineup, Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Robert, your line is open.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nThank you. This is Scott Mikus for Rob Spingarn. Neil or Chris, in the past you've mentioned that you don't exactly like the business model where the engine OEMs go through a heavy development cycle, lose cash on the OE sales, and have to recoup your investment in the aftermarket. So I'm just wondering, with the general misalignment of profit drivers between the airframers and the engine OEMs that can create tension when allocating scarce resources on a future clean sheet aircraft program, is there going to be a broader industry discussion to better align those profit drivers between the airframers and engine OEMs?\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks for the question, Scott, and it's a good question.\nYes.\nThe short answer is yes, there's going to need to be a discussion around aligning our business model. And I believe that's not only in the interest of. I'll speak from the engine side from the Pratt team, but also from the air framer team. When.\nYou've got different incentives in terms of how you make your money; it does just drive a tension. And ultimately sometimes the customer is the one that's sort of caught in between there. And so again, I think the more that we can align our business models, the better it will be for the OEMs and for the customer base. And you're right, the opportunity to do that is going to be on the next platform. We're already obviously entrenched in the current platforms, but I think we're both seeing this at times misalignment play out. And I think with the new platforms that gives us a chance with a clean sheet of paper to sketch out how do we get better aligned and better serve our customers.\n\nScott Mikus\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Melius Research\n\nThanks. I'll stick with one.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question coming from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs, Noah.\nyour line is open.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning guys.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nHey Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nWith regard to the GTF powder metal process, is it possible to put numbers?\nAround.\nYou know, of the number of engines that will need to come off wing, how many, what percentage, even if a range, have come off wing, and of that, how many have actually fully gone through the full fix process versus are waiting in line to do so?\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks, Noah.\nSo let me just step back and give you sort of the powder metal sort of ramp up and insertion, you know, background here. So as we've talked about before, since late last year, everything coming off the line going to the OEMs had the full life powder metal parts. Now all spare engines have those as well. MRO was always a, I'll call it a phased ramp up. And so we'll start to see this ramp up here in the second half of the year, and it's going to continue to accelerate into 2025 and into 2026. Again, we've put a lot of emphasis on isothermal forging production. As I said up front, we put a lot of demand into the system as you might imagine, given what's happened with the fleet, and we've seen some solid progress. We need to continue to see some more ramp up.\nAnd as we said before, when a shop, excuse me, when an engine comes into the shop for a visit, we do an evaluation based on the work scope it needs, where it operates, and when it was naturally going to see another shop visit to determine whether or not, you know, insertion of those parts makes sense. Again, we're trying to get the longest time on wing that we can and make sure that we allocate these, you know, these resources, you know, appropriately. And so those are all the things that go into decision as to which engines get the full life parts and which we can do an inspection and do all the other things in the engine because it was already slated to come back in advance of, you know, the time limits that we've established. So there's a lot of moving pieces here.\nBut suffice it to say, it's going to be a continued ramp back half of this year, 2025 and 2026, on powder metal production and insertion and MRO.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, as you're going through incremental customer negotiations, are you finding yourself able to change assumptions either are better or worse based on what you've experienced thus far, or is it more kind of the assumptions remain similar because the output has been in line?\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThe assumptions remain similar, Noah. But I'll tell you, each customer negotiation is different based upon where they operate and how they operate. So the agreements are tailored, you know, to those, I would say airline specific, you know, you know, metrics and criteria. But we're using the same, I'll call it key assumptions that we outlined up front across the board.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Final question coming from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Scott, your line is open.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nHey there Scott.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, Chris, are you seeing progress with.\nThe FAA in terms of getting some of these wide-body first-class seats certified? And then, I'm sorry if I missed it, but are you seeing momentum on ramping up output on the 787 heat exchanger?\nThanks.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Scott. So, yes, on the seating, you know, question, we continue to work our way through the certification there. These are actually a lot more complex than I think people understand, and the certification requirements, you know, are a relatively high bar. But we think we have our arms around what we need to do there to get these certified and ultimately, you know, into the hands of the airframers and the airlines. On the, on the heat exchanger, I'll just remind everyone that that was a part that we had to move as a result of the conflict in Russia, Ukraine, you know, out of Russia, and then, you know, set up another source here and set up a separate supply chain.\nThat has taken some time, but we're starting to ramp up there to the rates that we need to support what we think Boeing's demand is.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the RTX team.\n\nNathan Ware\n\nVP of Investor Relations, RTX\n\nAll right, thanks, Livia.\nThat concludes today's call. As always, I and the investor relations team will be available for follow up questions. Really appreciate everyone joining today and have a good day.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and CEO, RTX\n\nGood day, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThis now concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."

My name is Lateef, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Calio, President and Chief Operating Officer, Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer, and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from RTX's website at www.rtx.com. Please note, except where otherwise noted, the Company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding acquisition, accounting adjustments, and net non-recurring and/or significant items, often referred to by management as other significant items.\nThe company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. RTX SEC filings, including its Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. To ask a question you will need to press star 11 on your telephone. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits. With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks and good morning, everyone. As you all know, next week at our annual shareholders meeting, I'll be stepping down as CEO and turning the reins over to Chris Calio. For the past two years, Chris has had responsibility for leading our three business units, Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon. There's no better evidence of his success than our results this quarter, with strong sales and operating profit growth and a record backlog of over $200 billion. I'll be back at the conclusion of the call for some final comments, but let me turn it over to Chris right now to give you an overview of the company and our first quarter performance.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to acknowledge and express my appreciation for Greg's leadership. He has created significant value over the last decade as CEO and has shaped RTX into the best portfolio in A&D with our three industry-leading businesses, leaving a strong foundation for our continued success.\nBefore we discuss our first quarter.\nWant to spend a few moments on the strength of this foundation and how we plan to build upon it in 2024 and beyond. Now I know we've highlighted it before, but I think it's worth repeating. Collins is an industry leader, number one or number two on 70% of its product portfolio, and has an off-warranty installed base of $100 billion, which will create decades of aftermarket growth. At Pratt, the large commercial engine business has an installed base of 12,000 engines and a backlog of over 10,000 GTFs, which will also drive growth for decades to come. But Pratt is much more than the GTF. Pratt & Whitney Canada remains the premier small engine business with sole source positions on over 200 platforms and 63,000 engines in service, which also comes with long aftermarket tails.\nPratt's Military engine business is set to power the F-35 and B-21 bomber well into the future. At Raytheon, our defense franchises are essential to the US and our allies as they confront the threats of today and tomorrow with programs like the Patriot air defense system, GEM-T, NASAMS, SPY-6 radars, AMRAAM, Tomahawk, and the Standard Missile family. Future technologies like LTAMDS, hypersonics, and LRSO, the long range standoff cruise missile. As we move forward, our focus will continue to be transforming RTX from the best portfolio in A&D into the best company in A&D. This means being recognized by our customers as a trusted partner that executes on its commitments. It means leveraging our CORE Operating System to help drive operational excellence in terms of quality and cost. It means being the provider of differentiated technologies that create a competitive advantage.\nIt means converting all of these attributes into best-in-class financial performance and long-term shareholder value.\nAll right, with that, let me move to the quarter on slide two. We've gotten off to a strong start to the year with organic sales up 12%, segment operating profit up 10%, and free cash flow in line with our expectations. Commercial OE was up 33% across RTX driven by continued strong demand for new aircraft. The commercial aftermarket was up 11% as we continue to see strong growth in both domestic and international RPKs. So clearly the commercial aero demand is there. But as you all know, the industry is still working through supply chain constraints and other challenges which is leading to some OE production rate uncertainty and this will continue to be a watch item for us for the year.\nOn the defense side, we delivered 7% growth Year-over-Year and ended the quarter with the defense book-to-bill of 1.05 and a backlog of $77 billion. We're pleased the fiscal year 2024 spending bills have been enacted and provide $886 billion in defense spending, which is up 3%, but more importantly, the budget supports our key programs and technologies including next-generation propulsion, critical munitions, and upgrades to the F135, ensuring it remains the only engine powering every variant of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The budget also supports investment in key capabilities to address current and future threats, such as systems that counter unmanned aircraft and hypersonics where RTX provides leading technologies.\nAnd we are encouraged by the progress on the Ukraine Supplemental bill, which the DoD will use to further deepen critical US munitions stockpiles such as TOW, Javelin, and Excalibur, provide needed air defense capabilities to the region with NASAMS and Patriot. Internationally, we continue to see heightened demand from US allies in the quarter. Raytheon was awarded a $1.2 billion contract to supply Germany with additional Patriot and air and missile defense systems. Okay, let me move beyond the end market dynamics and talk about some of our critical initiatives, and I'll start with an update on the GTF Fleet Management Plan. We continue to stay on track here, and our financial and operational outlook remain consistent with our prior comments. As you may have seen, in March the GTF Airworthiness Directives were issued and are consistent with our service bulletins and service instructions.\nOn the technical side, the results from the ultrasonic angle scan inspections have all been in line with our initial expectations and assumptions with regard to new engine production. As we said in our last call, all GTF engines being delivered to our customers' final assembly lines have full life HPC and HPT disks, and on the MRO side we have started the process of incorporating full life disks into certain engine overhauls, and as we previously said, we expect to progressively ramp this effort throughout the year. In addition, the PW1100 engine shop visits completed in the quarter were in line with our plan and up 50% Year-over-Year with regard to overhaul turnaround time. Our average wing to wing turnaround time assumptions remain consistent with our prior guidance of roughly 250 to 300 days.\nWith the ad now issued, we are now essentially at our peak AOG level. We continue to expect an average of roughly 350 AOGs from 2024 through 2026. And lastly, we have reached support agreements with nine of our customers, and these are in line with our assumptions. With that, let's turn to slide three and I'll share a bit more on how we're leveraging our core operating system and digital transformation to drive quality, efficiency, and productivity.\nAs I said before, our CORE operating is all about driving continuous improvements that compound over time to create a significant impact on our business. Let me give you a few recent examples. Our nacelle business within Collins deployed CORE across seven factories that support the A320neo program, resulting in an 8% improvement in on-time delivery and a 17% improvement in quality. At Raytheon on the TP2 program, which is a radar designed to detect and intercept ballistic missiles, we leverage CORE practices to help double first pass yield on high-volume circuit cards, resulting in a 40% reduction in manufacturing hours per unit and improved on-time delivery. We also remain committed to enhancing our factories through digitization, automation, and connected equipment. Last year we connected 20 factories and have another 20 planned to be completed by the end of this year.\nOnce fully connected, these factories will achieve improved overall equipment efficiency, better quality, and ultimately higher output. Lastly, we will continue to invest both directly and indirectly through RTX Ventures and our cross company technology roadmaps to develop differentiated technologies to fill our product pipeline. These include areas such as advanced materials, electrification, power and thermal management, and microelectronics. This year we will invest about $3 billion in company funded R&D along with $5 billion in customer funded R&D to develop new technologies and products. We are also expanding our manufacturing capacity in key areas to meet customer demand, a key priority within our $2.5 billion of capital investment in 2024.\nOne of our most significant new products coming to the market is LTAMDS, which is the next generation advanced 360 degree air defense radar that provides significant performance improvement against a range of threats including UAS and hypersonics. This program recently completed another successful live fire event with representatives from seven countries in attendance, and we expect both the first domestic LRIP and international FMS contracts this year. Today we're announcing $115 million expansion of our Raytheon Redstone Missile Integration Facility in Huntsville, Alabama. When complete, the factory's capacity for integrating and delivering several of our critical munitions programs will increase by more than 50%.\nWith the best portfolio within A&D. CORE driving our continuous improvement in operational excellence and ongoing investments in next-generation technologies, I'm incredibly confident in RTX's future and our ability to transform into the best company in A&D. With that, let me turn it over to Neil to take you through our first quarter results. Neil,\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks, Chris. I'm on slide four. As Chris said, we got off to a really good start this year on a number of our key financial metrics across RTX, with Collins, Pratt, and Raytheon all making progress in line with our expectations.\nAdditionally, we completed the sale of Raytheon's cybersecurity business at the end of Q1 with gross proceeds of $1.3 billion. We've made progress on deleveraging the balance sheet, having paid down over $2 billion of debt since we initiated the ASR last year.\nRTX sales of $19.3 billion were up 12% organically versus prior year, and that is on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of last year. Demand strength was also reflected in our backlog, which is now $202 billion and up 12% Year-over-Year. Segment operating profit growth of 10% was partially offset by expected headwinds from lower pension income and higher interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the quarter included a current period foreign tax benefit. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 was up 10% Year-over-Year, and on a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $1.28 and included $0.29 of acquisition accounting adjustments, a $0.21 benefit related to tax audit settlements, an $0.18 net gain related to the cyber business sale, a $0.13 charge related to initiating alternative titanium sources, and $0.03 of restructuring and other nonrecurring items.\nFinally, free cash flow was an outflow of $125 million in Q1, in line with our expectations and a $1.3 billion Year-over-Year improvement. As planned, the timing of defense milestones and increase in shop visits, along with inventory build to support our growth, drove higher working capital this quarter. Okay, let me turn to our business units and some of the progress we made in the quarter. You heard Chris give a status update on the GTF fleet management plan. So let me touch on our top priorities at Raytheon and Collins. At Raytheon, the business continues to see incredible demand, and as we said on our last call, we're taking actions to advance our key franchises, improve our supply chain, and drive margin expansion.\nIn the quarter, Raytheon saw 50 basis points of sequential margin improvement and 20 basis points on a Year-over-Year basis. On the material front, we saw a double digit increase in material receipts in the first quarter versus prior year, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth, which of course is driving the top line but more importantly helping to alleviate bottlenecks in the manufacturing processes and burn down overdue sales. Moving over to Collins, our focus remains on driving incremental margins through continued commercial OE and aftermarket growth, and the benefit from ongoing structural cost reduction. In the quarter, Collins saw strong sales growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion on both a sequential and Year-over-Year basis, and we expect future volume increases to drive continued fixed cost absorption benefits across the business this year.\nOn the cost reduction front, we continue to make progress as well. For example, Collins is in the process of shifting 2.7 million manufacturing hours to best cost locations by the end of 2025. To date, over 2 million of those hours have already been moved, with 400,000 more planned for the rest of the year. And finally, we also achieved an incremental $105 million of RTX gross merger cost synergies in the quarter, and we're approaching the $2 billion target we updated last year. So good progress on our top priorities to start the year. With that, based on our first quarter results and strong backlog, we remain on track to deliver our full year outlook including full year sales of between $78 and 79 billion, which translates to between 7% and 8% organic revenue growth.\nIn addition, we continue to see adjusted earnings per share between $5.25 at $5.40 and free cash flow of approximately $5.7 billion. Now let me hand it over to Jennifer to take you through the segment results, Jennifer.\n\nJennifer Reed\n\nVP and Investor Relations, RTX\n\nThanks, Neil. Starting with Collins. On Slide 5, sales were $6.7 billion in the quarter, up 9% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven primarily by continued strength in commercial aftermarket and OE by channel. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 14%, driven by a 17% increase in parts and repair, a 16% increase in provisioning, and a 3% decrease in mods and upgrades. Commercial OE sales for the quarter were up 14% versus the prior year, driven by growth in widebody, narrowbody, and bizjet platforms, and defense sales were up 1% primarily due to higher volume. Adjusted operating profit of $1.05 billion was up $145 million, or 16%, from the prior year with drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by unfavorable OE mix, higher space program costs, and increased R&D expense.\nLooking ahead on a full year basis, we continue to expect Collins sales to grow mid to high single digits on both an adjusted and organic basis, with operating profit growth between $650 and 725 million versus 2023. Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on slide 6, sales of $6.5 billion were up 23% on both an adjusted and organic basis, with sales growth across all three channels. Commercial OE sales were up 64% in the quarter, and higher engine deliveries and favorable mix in the large commercial engine business. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume within large commercial engines primarily related to GTF overhaul activity as well as an increased volume. At Pratt & Whitney Canada, legacy large commercial engine aftermarket revenues were down slightly versus prior year as a result of increased allocation of material to support the GTF fleet.\nIn the military engine business, sales were up 21% primarily driven by higher sustainment volume across the F135, F117, and F100 platforms and higher development volume primarily driven by the F135 engine core upgrade program. Adjusted operating profit of $430 million was flat to prior year. The benefit of favorable commercial OE mix and drop through in higher commercial aftermarket volume was partially offset by headwinds from increased commercial OE deliveries, unfavorable commercial aftermarket mix, and the absence of a favorable $60 million prior year contract matter. Higher military volume and favorable mix was more than offset by higher R&D and SG&A expenses.\nTurning to Pratt's full year outlook, we continue to expect sales to grow low double digits on an adjusted and organic basis and adjusted operating profit to grow between $400 and 475 million versus 2023 as large commercial engine aftermarket continues to ramp and military volume grows. Now turning to Raytheon on slide 7, sales of $6.7 billion in the quarter were up 6% on both an adjusted and organic basis primarily driven by higher volume on land and air defense systems and advanced technology programs. The increase in land and air defense system programs reflect higher customer demand for the Patriot counter-UAS systems, and NASAMS. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter of $630 million was up $46 million versus the prior year driven primarily by higher volume and improved net productivity partially offset by unfavorable mix.\nAlso recall that Q1 2023 net productivity included the exercise of a significant unfavorable contract option that did not repeat in the first quarter of this year. Bookings and backlog remain very strong in the first quarter. Bookings of $8.1 billion resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.23, and the backlog of $53 billion. In addition to the German Patriot Award that Chris mentioned earlier, Raytheon also saw significant orders for the GEM-T NASAMS and classified work. Looking ahead, we continue to expect Raytheon sales to grow low- to mid-single digits organically with operating profit up between $100 and $200 million versus 2023. As a reminder, the profit outlook includes an $80 million Year-over-Year headwind from the sale of the cybersecurity business. With that, I'll turn it back to Chris to wrap things up.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nThanks, Jennifer. I'm on slide 8. With our portfolio strength and current demand, our overall backlog is at a record $202 billion. Our focus as a team remains on executing this backlog to meet our customer commitments and driving operational performance. Our top priorities for the year remain unchanged. First, at Pratt, it's about continuing to execute the GTF Fleet management plan. Second, at Raytheon, it's about delivering the backlog at improved margins. Third, at Collins, it's about generating strong incremental margins. As I discussed, our core operating system underpins our execution on these priorities and drives continuous improvement across RTX. At the same time, we're investing over $10 billion in research and development, modernization, and digital capabilities, continuing to evaluate our portfolio for incremental opportunities to further enhance our focus and prioritize future investments.\nAs we do this, we remain on track to return $36 to 37 billion of capital to shareholders from the date of the merger through next year. With that, let me turn it over to Neil.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks, Chris. Before we go into Q&A, I want to quickly update everyone on an investor relations team leadership transition. After three years leading the team, Jennifer Reed is moving on to her next opportunity. Jennifer took the helm in an unprecedented environment and worked tirelessly to ensure all of our stakeholders had timely and clear information during the critical post-merger years for RTX. I want to thank Jennifer for her leadership, and I also want to introduce Nathan Ware, who is coming over from our Collins business to lead investor relations. Some of you will remember Nathan as he was a member of the UTC IR team leading up to the merger. But since then, Nathan has held a couple of roles at Collins and most recently as CFO of the interiors business.\nJennifer and Nathan will work to ensure a smooth transition for all of us and all of you. With that, we are ready to open the line for our first question.\n\nOperator\n\nIn the interest of time and to allow for broader participation, you are asked to limit yourself to one question. To ask a question, you will need to press Star one one on your telephone.\nOur first question comes from the line of Miles Walton of Wolfe Research. Your question please, Miles,\n\nMiles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, Good morning and thanks for the help. Jennifer, over the years, can you talk?\nTo the Pratt Aftermarket first to start.\nAnd sort of, if there is risk to achieving the full year guidance given the harder comps that play out for the rest of the year, given the 9% in the first quarter and low double digits expected for the full year?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Miles. This is Neil. I'll start out. Chris can add anything here, but a couple of things on the Pratt aftermarket. I think 9% aftermarket growth in Q1 was largely as we expected. We took Q1 to make sure that we started off on a strong foot with respect to the GTF aftermarket overhauls. I'm sure Chris can provide a little more color there in doing so. You know, there was a little bit lighter material allocation to the V2500s. We're actually down a handful of shop visits Year-over-Year in Q1. A little bit around 175 or so. We still feel confident, though, that we'll hit 800 shop visit inductions on the V2500 for the full year.\nAnd so what we expect to play out over the remainder of the year is that we will see more and more of those shop visits come in. We'll also see the content on those shop visits increase. So we'll see better drop through on the legacy aftermarket. Back in January, we talked about the PW2000s and PW4000s. You know, there's some puts and takes there. They largely offset for the year. So it's really about, you know, seeing that legacy aftermarket continue to grow. So full year still expect, you know, low teens sort of growth in the aftermarket of Pratt, and we're confident that we'll see the material flowing to support that.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, I mean, I guess one thing I would add to Chris is to Neil's point, we know we needed to come out of the gate strong on GTF MRO given the situation in the fleet management plan. And so we were allocating material and resources with that in mind. And I think we saw the fruits of that here in Q1. But as Neil said, we continue to see the demand on what we call the mature fleets, the V and others. And that ramp up is calibrated in our number for the year. So still feel confident it's going to deliver the full year shop visits that we need.\n\nJennifer Reed\n\nVP and Investor Relations, RTX\n\nAll right, thanks.\nMakes sense.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Kristine.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nMorning.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nChris and Greg, you know, thank you for your leadership over the years. And Jennifer, wish you the best in your next endeavor. So maybe on GTF. Chris, thank you for providing more color in the GTF fleet management plan. And at this point, it seems like everything is progressing well. So as we look forward to understanding the risk retirement, are there other milestones you're monitoring to see if there could be potential risk reduction? Is there a number of specific completed AOGs or more customer agreements to be completed? Any sort of gauge to help us understand?\nRisk retirement would be helpful.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSure.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nThanks, Kristine. Good morning. So look, the GTF fleet management plan is a multi-year process and you know, we're going to continue to grind through that over the next three years or so. And we've laid out all of the key enablers. We listed them on the call today. We've done it, you know, historically, and that's going to be AOG levels, that's going to be turnaround times. And so again, we've given those sort of ranges on each of those key enablers and we're going to continue to do everything we can to stay within or move to the lower end of those ranges. And again, the single biggest enabler for us is MRO output. We had very good first quarter, but we've got a large growth plan here in 2024.\nAnd so for us, it's about material flow, including the new powdered metal parts that we're going to be putting into the engines. As we said during the last call and during our comments, we continue to add the full life HPC and HPT in MRO, and it's going to ramp throughout the year. So that'll be a key indicator for us. The more output we can get, obviously the more relief we can get the fleet, the less AOG days, and then the less penalties. It's really that simple. So for us, it's all about the MRO enablers, chief among them, continuing to ramp up the powdered metal core production and insertion.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYeah, sorry about that feedback there, Chris. So hopefully that all came through.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nVery helpful. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your question please, Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much and good morning. Maybe kind of a small picture question here, but it is one that we get a lot. When you think about the trajectory of aircraft on ground and it seems like we are right around the highest level we'll see here at, you know, in the 550ish level. When we think about where that goes from here, do we think of that more as a plateau for the remainder of the year for a couple of quarters or, you know, do we start to see some progress there? And you know, when you think about where turnaround times are kind of now and the improvement that you can make over the next few quarters, is there anything that you can kind of lay out for us to gauge that.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nHey, Seth, this is Chris.\nThanks for the question. Yeah, so look, we are, as we said in our comments, essentially at, you know, peak AOG. I mean, there'll be some perturbations a little bit above, a little bit below. But we, you know, see that as kind of the peak and we're going to start to gradually, you know, chip away and move that down. So again, as I said to Kristine's question, the number one enabler of that is our MRO output. And again, strong start to the quarter, but we've got a big plan for the year and we're focused on turnaround times and new material. At the end of the day, in terms of our MRO output, it's not so much about capacity. We've got enough shops, we've got enough labor. It's about material flow.\nThe faster that we can flow material, faster we can take turnaround times down, increase output, and then burn down the backlog of those engines waiting for induction.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein, Bank of America. Your question please, Ron.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Good morning. Ron, could you speak a little bit?\nTo the supplemental that got through the House and how that plays out for your defense business? What goodies are in there for you guys?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nHey, good morning, Ron.\nThis is Chris.\nSo as I'm sure you've seen, if you break down sort of the supplemental into its big buckets, about $60 billion for Ukraine, another $25 billion or so for Israel, and $10 billion for INDOPACOM. So when we look at our product portfolio against those big buckets, we look at Ukraine and say about 2/3 of that is addressable with RTX products. Think GEM-T, NASAMS, Patriot, AMRAAM, AIM-9X, Israel. We kind of handicapped that as about 30% addressable, you know, stockpile replenishment, Iron Dome, David's Sling procurement, and then INDOPACOM, again, roughly that 30% addressable with the RTX product suite, namely SM-6, Tomahawk, AIM-9X. So again, the services will have their specific lists of what they're looking for. But again, we think our product portfolio is pretty well positioned to address, you know, the needs in each of those theaters.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. And if I may, just a quick follow on. You had some challenges with the fixed. Priced development program within missiles. How's that going?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, so again, when you look at the productivity story at Raytheon, Ron, that's a big part of the continued, you know, margin expansion. And so in the quarter, we saw improvements in productivity, which is really helpful. Again, as you know, our productivity plan for the year is effectively, you know.\nNo productivity. But last year, of course, we had some headwinds in the productivity department. So again, overall, an improvement for the year. We've still got some classified programs, fixed-price, that we are continuing to work through. We said that's kind of a 12- to 18-month journey as we work through those. I would say on a number of them we've made some good progress towards, you know, milestones and others. We're going to continue to battle our way through, you know, during that period.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nChris, I'll just add with respect to the productivity, you know, in the first quarter we saw about a $58 million Year-over-Year, Q1 to Q1 improvement. Of course, we had the exercise of an option last year which accounts for maybe, you know, 55% of that improvement. But nonetheless, we're expecting $200 million Year-over-Year and continue to expect $200 million Year-over-Year. And so, you know, good progress in the first quarter. But there's still, you know, three quarters to go. But we are encouraged by the shift that we've seen here in the first quarter so far.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of TD Cowen. Your question please, Cai.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thanks so much. So you had a 23% gain at Pratt in Q1. If we're going to low double digits, call it 11-12%. You have to have a sharp deceleration as you go through the year. And yet you're still guiding to what?\nLow teens for the aftermarket, which would. Suggest either your total guide is low or we're going to see a flat to down year in commercial or military. We go through the year. Can you give us some color in. Terms of each of those three parts. Of Pratt's business and their quarterly sequence as we move through the year?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSure, Cai, let me start here. I mean, we had a really strong start to Pratt's first quarter. You know, most of that was on the back of commercial OE deliveries, up almost 40% in the first quarter on a units basis. So that obviously drove the top line and some good mix there too, between installs and spare engines. As we look to position the GTF fleet as best we can to start the year. I think some of that's going to moderate clearly as the rest of the year unfolds. So I think we had a good start out of the gate on installs on the aftermarket side. You know, you're right. We're going to see more of the mid single digit type of growth in the next three quarters. So again, that will be fueled by V2500s coming up a little bit.\nThe top line is going to be also bolstered by GTF aftermarket, which of course doesn't come with nearly as much profit, but will certainly help the fleets get healthier. Military also had a really strong Q1 start. The material coming in in Q1 was positioned to support the aftermarket, principally in the military business. We do see that slowing down a bit in the next part of the year. So those are the key ingredients. Not going to get into the specifics on a quarterly cadence here, but you know, we're just one quarter into the year, but do you know, good start to the year and we'll see. We're kind of holding on to our guidance at this point.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is open. Sheila.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning. Chris and Neil, thank you. And Jennifer, congratulations on your next move. Wishing you all the best, and thank you. I wanted to ask one on Collins, maybe Neil or Chris. Just the guidance for the year implies a step up 16.6% margins versus a 15.7% adjustment in the quarter, adjusted basis on the quarter. Can you maybe talk about what drives that margin expansion as we progress through the year at Collins? And if you could give us any more detail on the impairment of $175 million.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nAll right, let me start, Sheila. You know, as I think about first, let's start with Q1 for Collins. It was a really good quarter. We had about $145 million of profit growth on an adjusted basis. You know, we've talked about the Collins growth trajectory really being driven by the aftermarket. Now there's still a long ways to go. You know, we put out a range of $650 to 725 for the full year. So what we're going to see is increased, you know, drop through on the continued cost reduction essentially that Collins embarked upon, you know, several years ago. We're starting to see the cost associated with achieving that cost reduction ease as well as the benefit from the actions start to drop through in the form of stronger incrementals. So feel like the aftermarket trajectory supports that at this juncture.\nYou know, that I think is going to really continue to be the key driver for the Collins profit growth for the rest of the year. If I just comment for a minute on the $175 million, you know, as we said in our remarks, that charge related to some procurement of titanium, which I know you all know is an important commodity for the aerospace industry, given a number of ongoing supply chain dynamics around aerospace grade titanium in particular, especially as it relates to the titanium that we use in our landing gear manufacturing at Collins. We've taken some steps to secure alternative sources for that supply, and it's taken us some time to do that, frankly. Specific to the charge, you know, we reached an agreement with two new suppliers during the quarter.\nIn connection with those agreements, as well as some sanctions imposed by Canada, which were announced in February. We took a charge to reflect two things. One was the higher purchase commitment cost that came about as a result of these two new agreements. And the second is the impairment of about $75 million of costs that have been previously capitalized on the balance sheet associated with a specific program that are no longer recoverable. So as we talked about since 2022, you know, we've been evaluating our global sourcing strategies to mitigate the potential impact of sanctions and other restrictions. Frankly, we've de-risked that in many areas. I think this is an important step in, you know, putting this issue behind us. So, you know, feel good about the agreements we have, but they're certainly at a higher cost.\nWe took a charge to deal with that.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat.\nThank you.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Bernstein.\nPlease go ahead. Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nYes, good morning. Thank you. Doug, are you on, on the defense side? So in Raytheon you made a leadership transition. Wes Kremer retired in Q1. Can you talk about how, if at all, you're thinking about the strategy differently? And I'd say in two areas. One, you mentioned a little bit about this before in terms of bringing margins up to your objectives in 2025, which presumably fixed price contracts play into that, but also the supply chain progress. And then second.\nBack in Paris, you talked about a need for a new strategy on the space side to really reinvigorate growth there. Can you comment on how you're thinking?\nAbout those now with the new leader. In place in Phil Jasper? Thanks.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYep, you bet. Doug, good morning.\nThis is Chris.\nSo let's start first on the first part of your question here on the supply chain and Raytheon margins and how we're thinking about that? If you just take a step back for a sec, Doug, it's a tremendous backlog at Raytheon. You saw the increase here in Q1. A big part of that obviously is the continued focus on execution, in particular the supply chain. We've had four consecutive quarters of material receipt growth at Raytheon. So feeling like the focus on the supply chain and the health of supply chain is starting to pay dividends and we're seeing that flow through again with some of the margin increases here in Q1. And so again, Phil and team are incredibly focused on execution, head down and execution on this backlog at the margins that we need.\nAnd again, big part of that is supply chain, and we're adding production capacity as well to meet the demands of this ramp you heard us announce today. You know, Huntsville last quarter we talked about the expansion in Camden, Arkansas. So again, putting in the production capacity that we need and driving material. So that's where the focus is on space. We did talk about, you know, a bit of a, bit of a pivot, Doug, from you know, a space prime, if you will, to being more of a component supplier to the space primes. And I think when you look at our strengths in that portfolio, I think that pivot is the right one. We've got historical strength in some of the exquisite space areas. We've got some other strengths in some of the key components that go into the prime satellites and buses.\nBut again, I think that's where we're going to be shifting away from perhaps being a space prime to being more of a component supplier.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Your line is open, David.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\nBest of luck, Greg. Enjoyed working with you. Same thing. Jennifer.\nChris, on the GTF plan, I think, you know, it's calling for, you know, this replacement on 3,000 or so engines. Can you just tell us at this point how many have actually seen full replacement actually having been done at this point? That's my first question. Then the second question. You reached an agreement with Spirit Airlines.\nIn the quarter that was made public, is that amount kind of on a per AOG basis representative of your other customer agreements? Because that would seem to imply a higher compensation number than you baked into your forecast. Thanks\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYep. So on the first question, David.\nYeah, the disc replacement. So, again, we're early stages. I told you this was going to. Be a three-year process.\nAgain, the priority was making sure everything we delivered to our customers. Final assembly lines had the full life powdered metal parts, and that's what's happening today. It was going to be a ramp throughout the year. In 2025 on insertion of those full life parts, you know, into MRO. So I would say today it's early days, and so there haven't been a ton that have received all of those things. But as we said before, we're working hard to optimize the work scopes there. Depending on where the engine is operating, what configuration it has, was it going to come in for another visit within this time frame anyway, depending on where it operated. So again the focus is on output, and part of that is optimizing the work scope. But again, early days.\nAs for the customer compensation, we've got about nine agreements under our belt, which represents about 1/3 of the fleet. I think we're close on a number of other significant ones, and the compensation on all those remains within the guidance that we provided on this.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Rob.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Rob.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nGreg, all the best for the future. And Jennifer, thanks for all your help. It's been interesting times, obviously.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nObviously.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nQuestion.\nA question for Chris, probably at Collins. There's clearly some things going on with the 737 MAX at the moment. I was wondering, you know, what sort of implications there could potentially be for the Collins business, and what do you see as the risk of potential destocking as this year progresses?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah. Hey, hey, Rob. Yeah. As you, as you pointed out, you know, significant content at Collins on 737 and 787. So across the main growth platforms there at Boeing, I would say that, I mean, we kind of mentioned this up front. We've got some, I guess, some uncertainty around rates today. We think that we've calibrated a lot of that in. But again, I know the Boeing company will provide their guidance tomorrow. So we won't get out ahead of them. We're just kind of focused on working with them, supporting them through the dynamics in play, and preparing to take whatever actions we think necessary depending on the guidance that they provide. But I'll just say that the team has worked very hard to go drive the material in that we need to support their rates, and we've got the capacity to do so.\n\nRob Stallard\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research\n\nOkay, thanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\nTwo follow-ups on topics already asked about. But on the powdered metal process, can you quantify even if roughly how many engines that are off wing are actually in an MRO facility now versus waiting in line to get into one? And then, Neil, on the defense margins, the guidance implies that each quarter, the rest of the year looks roughly similar to the first quarter. You have the framework next year for a decent amount of expansion. I would have thought you would have sort of ramped through this year into that 2025 expansion. You know, how do we kind of flip in 2025, or do I just have the numbers off there?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nNo, let me start with defense, and I'll hand it off to Chris to hit your first question. But, you know, listen, I think we had a number of headwinds last year. I think you're all well aware of that. And so as we put together our outlook for this year, we essentially assumed no productivity for the year. Now, as Chris said and I talked about earlier, that's a significant step up from what we experienced last year. And largely last year was driven by a handful of fixed price development programs. But we're not out of the woods there. So what I would say is, you know, we took an approach that, you know, is not assuming a huge uptick. Remember, this is a business that, you know, several years ago was kicking off three, four, and $500 million of positive productivity.\nThere is still positive productivity in the Raytheon business each quarter, but it's been overwhelmed by the negatives. So at this point, I think we're really pleased to see a quarter like this to start the year. There's work to do, obviously, to get multiple quarters together that look like this one going forward. That's what we're focused on. We're really focused on improving the health of the supply chain and moving the material through that, you know, you could see has come in. Now we got to get it through the entire manufacturing process to meet these important needs of our customers. That's where really where our focus is. I do think it will step up in 2025. One encouraging thing is we had significant orders during the quarter, and the margins in that new backlog are very healthy.\nThe mix of those new orders, about 60% foreign sales. So it's a good start, but one quarter at a time, Chris? Maybe a couple. Yeah, sure.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nSo I'm not going to get into the specific numbers on where things stand in terms of those engines waiting to be inducted. But again, when you look at the turnaround times, the extended turnaround times that we've talked about, you know, engines coming off today are going to have to wait a bit before they actually do get inducted and enter into gate one in the MRO process, suffice it to say, and we kind of alluded to this up front. Big step up this year in GTF, you know, shop visits. And that's why we've played a little bit of the allocation game, you know, end of last year, early this year, to get off to a strong start there. But again, we've got a big ramp on GTF MRO throughout the year in order to support this fleet.\nAgain, we think we've got the capacity to do it, the labor to do it. The partners in our MRO shops who are incredibly adept at this. It's about material flow.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nNeil.\nThe fixed price development programs that have been a challenge in Raytheon Defense, when do those end? When do those move out of development?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYeah. So here's a couple ways to look at it. About 1% of our existing Raytheon backlog today constitutes those programs. I'd say it's about 12 to 18 months.\nThere's a few of them.\nSo we still have a little ways to go. We are making progress, you know, critical milestones on each program. In Q1, you know, we had, you know, net unfavorable productivity of about $28 million. Nearly all of that was associated with these, these programs. So there's still some headwinds that we're encountering as we get additional technical learning and going through testing. But that's the time frame and that's the magnitude I would put on it.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thanks for taking my questions, and Greg and Jennifer, thanks for all the help over the years.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks, Noah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird.\nPeter, please go ahead.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nYes, thanks.Good morning, everyone.\nAnd Greg and Jennifer enjoyed it over the years. Chris, on Raytheon, you know, Europe continues to be a really strong region for bookings. Maybe you could talk about the outlook there and, you know, how should we think about.\nI guess Neil just touched upon it. You know, the FMS mix kind of ramping and, you know, going to benefit margins. Is this? Should we expect the FMS mix to kind of be a multi-year process as it plays out, where that shows up favorably on margins. But also, just maybe just talk about. The outlook on bookings.\nThanks.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, I think that's right, Peter. I think it is a multi-year process. To your point, you know, if you just think about what's going on out there today, the integrated air and missile defense, the demand there is exceptionally strong. Obviously, you know, Patriot, NASAMS, and of course, GEM-T and the like, you saw a huge order from NATO at the end of last year for us, and the demand continues to be really strong. To your point, when we look at our margins throughout the year, our margin progression story at Raytheon, we're expecting a tailwind from mix as we increase the international backlog. About 60% of Raytheon's Q1 bookings were international. And so that's provided us a nice tailwind, and we expect that to continue.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate the caller.\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Matt.\n\nMatthew Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, good morning, everybody. Good luck. Greg and Jennifer, a couple questions. One, what's the current wing to wing turnaround time for GTF full stop visit? Is it close to that 250, 300 days or is it shorter? And it sort of builds as the pipeline of planes waiting gets bigger, that I think you might have said, Pratt, aftermarket, mid single digits the rest of the quarter. Did I mishear that? Is that actually mid teens?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX",
    "content2": "Yeah. Let me start with the math of.\nThe win going, you know, turnaround time. Yeah, it's in that range, you know, that we've provided in that 250 to 300. Again, a lot of that will continue to be dependent on the mix of work scopes. We're still believing that it's going to be more of a 90% heavy, 10% lighter shop visit. And with that we'll stay within that range. If we can find a way to come up with medium work scopes and other things that can alleviate the need for new, we'll call it non powdered metal material repair development and the like. Perhaps we'll be closer to the lower end of that range, but we're in there today given the shop visit mix that we see and the material flow that we see.\n\nMatthew Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt, great.\n\nMatthew Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nI'll just take, I guess, the aftermarket. Yep.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSorry I didn't put my mic on. Just a couple clarifications. So when I said mid single digits, I was referring to the military growth. We had really strong growth obviously in the first quarter on the aftermarket. Think about that as you know, low to mid teens for the rest of the year.\n\nMatthew Akers\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup. Please go ahead, Jason.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nYeah, good morning, everyone. Jennifer, Greg, best of luck with your new roles and ventures. Nathan, welcome back.\nChris, just a quick question for you. On Raytheon in the defense side of the business. Solid book-to-bill here in the first quarter. I'm wondering if you can talk.About the pipeline that you see here for the next 12 to 24 months.\nWhat you think the book-to-bill? Book-to-bill is going to look like over that time period. Do we have a prolonged period here of book-to-bill. Above the forecast or so. Yeah, forecast growth here for multiple years. Thanks.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah. Hey, Jason, look, I think given the threat environment we described and we kind of laid out in the question on the supplemental, we're going to continue to see strong top line growth at Raytheon and strength in bookings. And again, if you just kind of go region by region, it's replenishment in the US, it's the integrated air and missile defense in Europe, it's naval munitions in Asia. So again, feel like the strength of demand is going to continue to be there. And then the other thing I'll say, Jason, is we're also thinking through some of the advanced capabilities that we're trying to bring to market as well.\nLTAMDS, which I mentioned up front, the 360-degree radar, the refresh on AMRAAM SPY-6 radar, which has gone through its initial sea trials, counter UAS capabilities with our Coyote system, and then things like high-power microwave as you look to sort of the drone swarm threat that continues to build. So again, strong demand for the existing pipeline of products. We continue to invest in that, you know, that next generation product which we think, you know, meets the emerging threats.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nAnd as I say, to be clear, you think that that leads to though. A book-to-bill above one here for this year and maybe going into 2025.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nI was just going to comment on the book-to-bill. I mean, certainly, you know, really strong first quarter with top line sales projected to where we see them. You know, it's obviously going to change the math a little bit on the book-to-bill calculation, but we still expect a book-to-bill over 1.1 for this year, and I think it's going to be strong next year. But obviously as sales go up too.\nThat'll level off a little bit.\nBut the backlog is going to continue to grow. To put a finer point on some of the awards for this year, we see AMRAAM. We've talked about LTAMDS both with the US Army and Poland, certainly Patriot, SPY-6, and SM-3. So, you know, a good list of potential things. The large international ones can be lumpy. You know, they can come in this.\nYear, they could fall into next year. But you know, we see a lot of demand signals that are really strong there.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for cutting you out before you could get to it, Neil. Appreciate it.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nNo problem. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question, our final question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons of UBS. Your question please, Gavin.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks. Good morning. Morning, Gavin.\nFirst, I was wondering if you guys could just give an update on what ratio of GTF customer compensation agreements have actually been completed. Then second, if you could just give a little more detail on the OE rate uncertainty you talked about. I know we're waiting for Boeing tomorrow, but if you're actually already seeing lower pull on any of those programs and if that's considered in Collins guidance. Thank you.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYep. Yeah, sure. Gavin, this is Chris.\nSo again, on the GTF customer piece we've set up front, we got about nine done. We're in the final throes of a few more. And those nine that we've got under our belt represent about 1/3 of the GTF fleet total.\nAnd then on the rates again, you know, Boeing will provide the guidance tomorrow. I just think we're very much embedded with them. 737, 787. What do we need to do to support a ramp on 787 and then what do we need to do to help them go wherever they need to on 737? And so we're not, we won't get out ahead of them, but just know that we're working a number of scenarios and we'll take whatever action is necessary based upon what they need.\n\nGavin Parsons\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Greg Hayes for closing remarks.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nOkay, thank you, Lateef. I'll keep these comments brief, but as I step back from the day-to-day responsibility as CEO of RTX, I want to take this opportunity to thank our team for their trust and support over this past decade. Any success we have had is the result of the hard work and dedication of the entire team, the senior leadership team, but also the whole 185,000 people that make RTX the great company that it is. I also want to thank our investors. You know, it's been an interesting decade or so in the role and thank you for your patience as we've transitioned and transformed what was United Technologies, a multi-industry company, into RTX, which is, I believe, the best positioned A&D company in the world today.\nWe've got great products, great portfolio of people and technologies, and a great backlog that I think is going to serve us well into the future. There is, of course, always more to do. We can talk a lot about that. I think Chris is absolutely on the right track that is focusing on execution, focusing on technology, and making sure we have the best team possible. I can't think of a better leader than Chris to lead RTX for the next decade or so. You should all know that Chris has.\nThe full support of the board but.\nNot just the board, the entire senior leadership team, and the entire organization. I look forward to working with Chris in the near term and watching from the sidelines beyond that as he is successful. I also want to thank Jennifer. Jennifer and I have worked together for a decade, from Sikorsky's disposition to the integration of Raytheon and UTC, and lately, for the last three years, as head of investor relations, she's been a great resource for the company and a great friend. So, Jennifer, thank you. With that, I think that's all. Thanks for listening today. Jennifer, Nathan, and team will be available all day to answer whatever questions you have. But thanks for listening and take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThis now concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nSa.",

We've got a lot to cover today, but let me start with the news we shared last month, which I'm sure you all saw. Effective on 2 May, the date of our annual shareholders' meeting, Chris Calio will become the new CEO of RTX. Chris's appointment is the result of a very deliberate and thoughtful succession planning process conducted by our board of directors over the past three years. While I'm going to remain in my role as executive chairman, Chris will be taking the reins of the company. As you all know, I've worked with Chris for many years, and I can't think of a better person to take on this role. Chris has a deep understanding of our industry, our customers' needs, and our operation, and most importantly, he's an outstanding leader.\nI'd like to say that I'm honored to have led this organization for almost the last 10 years, but most importantly, I'd like to thank each and every employee who has supported our mission over the last decade. We would not have been able to accomplish all we did if not for you. Going forward, I have the utmost confidence in Chris's ability to lead this great company and continue to drive performance and value creation for all of our stakeholders for years to come. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to take you through an update on our end markets and the year. Chris?\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nWell, good morning, everyone, and thank you, Greg. I'd like to start by thanking all RTX employees for their contributions last year, and I want to share how humbled I am that our board has given me the opportunity to lead this world-class team. As we move forward, our focus will continue to be on delivering our record backlog, accelerating innovation, and driving operational performance across the portfolio to meet our customer and shareholder expectations. I'd also like to acknowledge a couple of other leadership changes we've recently announced. First, I'd like to thank Wes Kremer for his significant contributions to the company as he transitions into retirement. Over the course of his 20-year career here, Wes has led the development of some of Raytheon's most successful programs, including LTAMDS, Standard Missile-3, and a range of strategic missile defense systems that defend the homeland and our allies.\nWes has also played a critical role in restructuring the Raytheon business unit to better align with the needs of our customers. With Wes's retirement, Phil Jasper has been appointed as president of the Raytheon business. Phil brings with him over 30 years of experience in aerospace and defense, and most recently led the Collins Mission Systems business, where he played a critical role in integrating RTX's connected battle solutions this past year. Phil's deep knowledge of our military customers and their priorities, and his experience leading many business transformation initiatives throughout his career, positions him well to lead Raytheon. Now, before I cover the highlights of the year, let me get into an update on our end markets. First and foremost, demand for our products and services in both commercial aerospace and defense has never been stronger.\nAir travel has returned to, and in some cases surpassed, pre-pandemic levels, and the global threat environment is driving unprecedented demand, especially in air defense systems. Starting with commercial aero: we saw solid air traffic growth this past year, with global revenue passenger miles back to 2019 levels, and domestic air travel now 5% above 2019 levels as we exited the year. The strong recovery has helped drive significant aftermarket demand for both wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, with growth expected to continue into 2024. On the defense side, increases in global spending have led to a defense backlog which is now at $78 billion, up $9 billion from a year ago. Just this past quarter, we received a GEM-T order worth $2.8 billion from NATO, which is the largest GEM-T contract recorded in Raytheon history.\nDomestically, we're pleased that a bipartisan funding agreement has been reached supporting increased defense spending, and expect Congress will complete their work on the full-year 2024 appropriations bill in the next several weeks. With that, let me turn to slide 2 and provide an update on 2023, and I'll start with some of the highlights. We delivered $74.3 billion in adjusted sales for the full year, up 11% organically, and adjusted EPS of $5.06 was up 6% year over year, both of which were ahead of our outlook. And more importantly, we ended the year with $5.5 billion in free cash flow, which also exceeded our commitment. On a full-year basis, commercial aftermarket was up 23%, commercial OE was up 20%, and defense was up 4%.\nOn the capital allocation front, we returned over $16 billion of capital to shareholders for the year, including $12.9 billion of share repurchases supported by our $10 billion ASR and $3.2 billion in dividends. We're beginning the process of deleveraging this year to ensure we maintain a strong balance sheet, which will be in part supported by the closure of our previously announced divestitures. At the same time, we remain focused on ensuring the business continues to be positioned to achieve sustained growth. In 2023, we spent almost $10 billion in CapEx and company and customer-funded R&D, while capturing $95 billion in new bookings, resulting in company-wide backlog growth of 12% and a book-to-bill of 1.28, ending the year with a record RTX backlog of $196 billion.\nSo while there's a lot of positive momentum in our markets and across the business, we have two matters we've been heavily focused on: Pratt's powdered metal situation and Raytheon's margins. So let me hit these two head-on, and I'll start with powdered metal. Our top priority continues to be executing on our fleet management plans, and both the financial and operational outlook remain consistent with our call last October. While we are still in the early stages, let me provide a few more details on the progress we've made to date. As you saw, Pratt has issued the necessary service bulletins and service instructions to operators, which are entirely consistent with our underlying financial and operational assumptions that we previously communicated. The FAA is in the process of drafting the corresponding airworthiness directives, which we expect to be issued within the next month or so.\nJust as a reminder, it is common practice for a fleet management plan to be communicated through multiple service bulletins and airworthiness directives to address different engine models, compliance times, or components and sections of the engine. We continue to conduct ultrasonic angle scan inspections on powdered metal parts, and our findings remain consistent with our prior analysis and assumptions. Let me now turn to our industrial plans. You'll recall our focus is on ramping production of HPT and HPC disks to support both OE and MRO deliveries. We've made solid progress here as well. We continue to secure the necessary machining and inspection capacity for increased disk production. Today, all OE GTF engines being delivered to our customers' final assembly lines contain disks produced from powdered metal manufactured after Q3 2021 and have full certified lives.\nOn the GTF-MRO front, we have begun installing full-life disks during certain shop visits, and the number of engines receiving full-life disks and MRO will increase throughout the year as we continue to ramp up production of these parts. Our estimated wing-to-wing turnaround time remains consistent with our prior guidance. Pratt grew GTF-MRO output by almost 30% year over year in 2023, while also making investments in additional shops, test cell capacity, and repair capability to support even more growth in 2024. With respect to the number of AOGs, we continue to expect roughly 350 on average that we previously guided. However, we will likely see a lower peak level than previously anticipated due to the timing of the AD issuance and proactive fleet management by our customers. Additionally, our conversations with customers continue to progress.\nTo date, we have finalized several customer support agreements, and these have been in line with the assumptions we outlined last year. Lastly, just a comment on the remaining Pratt & Whitney fleets. Both the financial and operational outlook remain consistent with what we discussed on our prior call, and we continue to execute on those plans. I'll now shift to Raytheon's performance. We continue to experience profitability challenges driven by productivity headwinds within the business, primarily attributable to legacy fixed-price development programs that we have previously discussed, as well as continued supply chain and operational headwinds. Let me start by providing some color around our productivity issues, and it's important to note that we are, in fact, achieving productivity in several parts of Raytheon's business, in particular on certain legacy product families where we've received successive awards that are creating scale in our factories and in our supply chain.\nFor example, we increased GEM-T output by 50% year over year by using our core system to refine work instructions, increase test equipment uptime, and reduce product cycle time, all without additional capital or manpower. We also recognize productivity gains when we successfully retire technical and schedule risks on our contracts, which is more frequent in our programs in the production phase. However, those gains have been overcome by unfavorable productivity in other areas. In 2023, about 70% of this headwind came from challenges on fixed-price development programs, and the remaining 30% was driven by unfavorable material costs as well as supplier delinquencies, which have had the effect of extending the period of performance in several cases. So what are we doing about it? Our plan to stabilize the current performance and deliver profitable growth consists of a few elements.\nOne, we expect improvement in our fixed-price development programs as we satisfy certain technical and programmatic milestones. We will also be more selective and disciplined about the work we pursue moving forward. Two, we are making modifications in our approach to winning new work. We continue to ensure that our new contracts and additional contractual lots have better protection from supplier inflation. This will take some time to play through, but we expect this will help us improve our margin profile. Three, we continue to drive improved supply chain performance and material flow. Overall, our material receipts were up 8% in 2023, and we need to continue on that trajectory here in 2024. Four, we continue to take indirect cost actions that will help us avoid some of the headwinds we experienced in 2022 and 2023.\nFor instance, we optimized Raytheon's realigned business structure by further consolidating and streamlining several of our sub-business units earlier this month. This will reduce indirect costs and overhead and better position the business for profitable growth. And lastly, there will be some tailwind that comes from a mixed shift in our business as development programs and technical refreshes move into production, and the mix of our sales shifts more towards FMS and DCS. So there's obviously a lot of work to do, but this business has a strong foundation, and it starts with its product portfolio. As I said earlier, the demand for Raytheon's products is incredibly strong, and I'm confident that Phil and the team are focused on addressing these challenges and delivering this record backlog at the margins that we need. With that, let me turn it over to Neil to take you through our fourth quarter results.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nChief Financial Officer, RTX\n\nThanks, Chris. Turning to slide 3, we finished the year strong and ahead of our expectations with solid growth in organic sales across all three segments, even as the year-over-year comparisons became more difficult. Overall segment operating profit for the year was up 18% versus 2022. We also ended the year with strong free cash flow, as you heard from Chris. For the fourth quarter, we had adjusted sales of $19.8 billion, up 10% organically versus the prior year. This was primarily driven by growth in commercial aerospace as well as growth across defense in all three segments. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.29 was a bit better than our expectations and up 2% as profit from higher commercial aftermarket at Pratt & Collins and drop-through on higher defense volume was partially offset by the expected headwinds from higher interest, taxes, and lower pension income.\nKeep in mind, we dealt with about $2.3 billion of inflationary headwinds in 2023, of which about a quarter of that was in the fourth quarter, which we largely overcame through pricing and cost reduction actions. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.05 per share and included $0.29 of acquisition accounting adjustments, a $0.06 benefit related to a customer settlement, and $0.01 of net charges associated with restructuring and other non-recurring items. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.9 billion in the quarter, bringing our total free cash flow for the year to $5.5 billion, which is about $700 million ahead of our prior outlook as powdered metal-related impacts have shifted and year-end collections were stronger than expected.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to take you through the segment results, and I'll come back and share our thoughts on 2024 and 2025.\n\nJennifer Reed –\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, RTX\n\nThanks, Neil. Starting with Collins on slide 4, sales were $7 billion in the quarter, up 12% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven primarily by continued strength in commercial OE and aftermarket growth. By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 23%, driven by a 27% increase in provisioning, a 26% increase in parts and repair, and an increase of 7% in mods and upgrades in the quarter. Commercial OE sales for the quarter were up 17% versus the prior year, driven by continued growth in both narrow-body and wide-body platforms. Military sales were up 1%, primarily due to higher deliveries.\nAdjusted operating profit of $104 billion was up $190 million, or 22% from the prior year, with drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower commercial OE, as drop-through on OE volume was more than offset by higher production costs. In addition, higher R&D expense was offset by lower SG&A. Shifting to Pratt & Whitney on slide 5, sales of $6.4 billion were up 14%, both on an adjusted and organic basis, with sales growth across all three channels. Commercial OE sales were up 20% in the quarter, driven by higher engine deliveries and favorable mix in large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 18% in the quarter, driven by higher volume in both large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses.\nIn the military business, sales were up 4%, primarily driven by higher sustainment volume, which was partially offset by lower material inputs on production programs. Adjusted operating profit of $405 million was up $84 million from the prior year, primarily driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable commercial OE mix. This was partially offset by higher commercial OE volume, higher production costs, an unfavorable military contract adjustment, and the absence of a benefit from a prior year customer contract adjustment. And finally, higher R&D expense was offset by lower SG&A. Now turning to Raytheon on slide 6, sales of $6.9 billion in the quarter were up 3% on an adjusted basis and 4% organically, primarily driven by higher volume on advanced technology and air power programs.\nAdjusted operating profit for the quarter of $618 million was up $48 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher volume and lower operating expenses, partially offset by unfavorable net program efficiencies. Bookings and backlog continued to be very strong as we finished the year. In the fourth quarter, $9.1 billion of bookings resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.33 and an end-of-the-year backlog of $52 billion. For the full year, Raytheon's book-to-bill was 1.22. With that, I'll turn it back to Neil to provide some color on 2024. Thank you, Jennifer. Let's turn to slide 7. Before I get into the specifics on our 2024 financial outlook, just a couple of comments on the environment as we look ahead. Let me start with the positives. As Chris said, global RPMs are back to 2019 levels.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nChief Financial Officer, RTX\n\nHowever, they have not fully recovered with respect to long-haul international travel, particularly wide-body, but that is expected to continue to be a tailwind for us going forward. On the narrow-body side, demand for new aircraft remains strong, which continues to support both OE and aftermarket growth. Specific to the commercial OE side, with increasing commercial production rates, we expect commercial OE revenue will be up between about 10% and 15% in 2024. With respect to commercial aftermarket, we currently expect sales to be up over 10% in 2024, and that's on top of the 23% growth we saw in 2023. Turning to defense, global defense spending remains elevated, which will continue to support our backlog ahead as our key programs remain well-funded. Cross RTX, we remain laser-focused on driving operational excellence to deliver cost reduction and further margin expansion.\nIn 2023, we achieved $295 million of incremental RTX merger cost synergies, keeping us on track to achieve our $2 billion in gross cost synergy goal by the end of 2025. On the challenges side, there are certain pockets where inflation remains elevated, and we will see the lingering effect of the past couple of years' inflation as we deliver on our backlog. In 2024, we expect to see about $1.7 billion of material and labor inflation, which we expect to be more than offset by higher pricing, the benefits from our digital transformation projects, and other aggressive cost reduction initiatives across the company. And as Chris said before, we continue to focus on executing on our GTF fleet management plans and are working relentlessly to mitigate further disruption to our customers. And of course, we're continuing to support the health of the supply chain.\nWhile we are seeing continued improvements, there are areas that remain challenged where we are dedicating resources, including suppliers who provide structural castings and rocket motors, two critical areas that continue to pace our recovery. And as I mentioned back in October, we continue to see headwinds due to the actions we have taken to preserve the improved funded status of our pension plans, as well as the recognition of historical asset experience. And finally, we're keeping an eye on the US and global tax environment, congressional action on the fiscal year 2024 budget, and of course, the broader geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. So with that backdrop, let me tell you how this translates to our financial outlook for the year on slide 8.\nAt the RTX level, we expect another year of solid growth in adjusted sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share, along with continued strength in free cash flow. Before I get into the details, let me share with you a couple of key assumptions embedded in our outlook as it relates to the two dispositions we announced last year. First, with respect to the Raytheon cybersecurity business, we have assumed that this transaction will close here in the first quarter. Therefore, on a reported basis, we will see about a $1.3 billion year-over-year reduction in reported sales and about an $80 million year-over-year headwind to operating profit. The Collins 2024 outlook still includes the actuation business as we continue to work on the business disposition.\nSo with that, starting with sales, at the RTX level, we expect full year 2024 sales of between $78 and $79 billion, which translates to organic growth of between 7% and 8% year-over-year. From an earnings perspective, we expect adjusted EPS of between $5.25 and $5.40, and that's up 4% to 7% year-over-year. We expect to generate free cash flow of about $5.7 billion for the year. Despite only being up $200 million year-over-year, there is strong operational improvement. So let me take you through the moving pieces. First, we are expecting strong segment profit growth and working capital improvement to drive $2.3 billion of improvement year-over-year. Embedded in that is about a $100 million headwind on higher CapEx in 2024 as we continue to invest in capacity expansion, digital transformation, and operational modernization.\nPayments related to powder metal impacts are expected to be a headwind of about $1.3 billion. We'll also see a net headwind of about $500 million, primarily from higher interest expense, principally from the debt we issued to fund the ASR. And finally, a headwind of about $300 million from lower pension cash recovery. Now let me turn to our EPS walk. Starting at the segment level, operating profit growth of about 16% is expected to result in approximately $0.72 of EPS growth at the midpoint of our outlook range. With respect to pension, while markets have improved since our call in October, there will still be a headwind of about $0.36 year-over-year. And as I just mentioned, given the increased debt outstanding, interest expense will be a $0.30 headwind. A lower average outstanding share count resulting from our recent ASR will provide a tailwind of about $0.37.\nFinally, our tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 19.5% versus the 18.5% in 2023. This, combined with higher corporate investments in digital transformation, will result in a $0.16 headwind year-over-year. All of this brings us to our outlook range of $5.25 to $5.40 per share. Okay, with that, let's go to slide 9 to get into our outlook by segment, where we expect continued organic sales and earnings growth across all three businesses. Starting with Collins, we expect full year sales to be up mid to high single digits on both an adjusted and organic basis, primarily driven by both wide-body and narrow-body commercial OE production ramps and continued commercial aftermarket. Military sales at Collins are expected to be up low to mid single digits for the year.\nWith respect to Collins' adjusted operating profit, we expect it to grow between $650 and $725 million versus last year. This is primarily driven by drop-through on higher volume across all three channels, as well as higher pricing and the benefit from continued cost reduction initiatives. Turning to Pratt & Whitney, we expect full year sales to be up low double digits on an adjusted and organic basis versus prior year, driven by higher OE deliveries in both Pratt's large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses, as well as continued growth in shop visits across legacy large commercial engines, GTF, and Pratt Canada. Military sales at Pratt are expected to be up mid single digits, driven by higher F-135 sustainment volume as heavy overhauls continue to ramp.\nAs a result, we expect Pratt's adjusted operating profit to grow between $400 and $475 million versus last year, primarily on commercial aftermarket drop-through and military growth, which will be partially offset by higher large commercial OE deliveries. At Raytheon, on our organic basis, we expect sales to grow low to mid single digits versus 2023 as we deliver our backlog and continue to see supply chain improvement. Adjusted operating profit at Raytheon is expected to be up between $100 and $200 million versus prior year, driven by drop-through on higher volume and improvement in productivity, which will be partially offset by mixed headwinds. Keep in mind, we'll see about $80 million of year-over-year headwind from the divestiture of the cybersecurity business this year.\nTo wrap up our outlook, at the RTX level, higher intercompany activity will increase sales eliminations by about 10% year-over-year, and we've included an outlook for some of the below-the-line items and pension in the webcast appendices. Finally, let me make a few comments on our 2025 financial commitments. As you know, there have been some significant changes in the macro environment since we first established these long-term targets, impacts ranging from Russian sanctions, elevated inflation, issues with labor availability, and of course, the associated disruptions throughout the supply chain. We've continued to take incremental actions to further reduce costs, realign our business units, increasing pricing, and investing in productivity improvements to combat these headwinds. Other factors underlying our long-term assumptions, however, have been also positive, such as the pace of the commercial air recovery and demand for our defense products and services.\nAll that said, despite those puts and takes, we continue to expect Collins and Pratt to be within the sales and operating profit 2020 to 2025 growth targets we discussed last year at our investor day. However, because of the recent performance at Raytheon, we are recalibrating our outlook for this segment. When taking into account divestitures, we now expect the 2020 to 2025 annual growth rate for adjusted sales to be between 3% and 3.5%. That's down slightly from our previous expectation of 3.5% to 4.5% for the same period, and driven largely by the initiatives we talked about upfront that will take some time to convert over the next couple of years. As you know, demand remains strong, and our robust backlog will continue to support significant top-line growth going forward.\nSimilarly, with respect to Raytheon's adjusted operating profit growth, given the continued productivity challenges we described, we now see Raytheon's 2020 to 2025 annual growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%, which is down from our prior outlook of between 5.5% to 7.5%. As a result of this segment change, we now see the RTX-level adjusted sales annual growth rate from 2020 through 2025 to be between 5.5% and 6% on an organic basis. That's down slightly from our prior outlook of between 6% and 7%. And taking into account the adjustment to Raytheon's operating profit outlook, we now see overall RTX adjusted margin expansion to be between 500 and 550 basis points between 2020 and 2025, and that's down from our prior outlook of between 550 and 650 basis points.\nHowever, importantly, there is no change to our RTX 2025 free cash flow target of $7.5 billion, as we remain confident in the significant cash-generating capability of our businesses, and we are continuing to drive structural cost reduction and working capital improvements as we invest in the business and deliver on our commitment to return $36 to $37 billion of capital to share owners with the date of the merger through 2025. So with that, I'll hand it back to Greg to wrap things up. Okay, thanks, Neil. I'm on slide 10. Let me just wrap this up. I know we've covered a lot of ground today, but I know there's some key takeaways that everybody should focus on here. Obviously, 2023 was a challenging year. The earnings performance of our Raytheon business obviously was disappointing, as was the Pratt powdered metal issue.\n\nChristopher Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX",
    "content2": "But importantly, demand remains strong across both of our commercial and defense markets. 11% organic growth in 2023 is just the beginning. With the strength of our $196 billion backlog, we're confident that we'll continue to see strong organic sales and earnings growth, along with accelerated free cash flow generation over the coming years. I believe we have the best-positioned A&D portfolio, industry-leading franchises, and robust demand for our products and technologies. This positions us well for the future. Secondly, we're intensely focused on execution to support our customers and to drive operational performance improvement. We're clearly going to face challenges this year with the continued ramp of the supply chain and the impact of higher costs. But everyone at RTX is working tirelessly to overcome these obstacles and ensure that we deliver on our commitments.\nLastly, we're staying disciplined and managing the business to continue investing in differentiated technologies and innovation, strengthening our balance sheet, all while continuing to return significant capital to our share owners. I want to close again by thanking all of the RTX employees who have been working diligently every single day over the last year to deliver on our mission to create a safer, more connected world. With that, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. In the interest of time and to allow for broader participation, you're asked to limit yourself to one question. To ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone. The first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead, Robert. Thanks so much. Good morning. Good morning, Rob. Chris, inevitably, your first question on the GTF situation.\nIt does sound like some things have moved since your update in October. I think you mentioned that the scheduling of the AOGs looks like it's going to be a slightly different profile, and also there could be a related cash impact to that. So I was wondering if you could give us some more color on that development. Yeah, you bet, Rob. And good morning. So we did say here this morning that we do expect the peak to continue to be here in Q1 in terms of AOGs and then trend downward thereafter. Again, we think that peak is going to come down a bit since our initial assessment because, really, two reasons. One, the timing of the AD has shifted a bit to the right.\nAnd then two, customers took some proactive fleet planning and decided to, in some cases, accelerate some of their removals as they were doing their fleet planning for the year. They were pairing engines and doing all those things to make them more efficient. So again, peak here in Q1, trend downward after that, and then it'll be more of a steady state, as we talked about in our October and September guides on the matter. You mentioned a little bit on cash being pushed out. Again, Rob, that was the dynamic time as we're going through and having discussions with our customers on special support. We've made some progress on special support. I think we've talked about that upfront. We've signed several agreements with our customers, some important customers who have large fleets.\nBut the timing of that cash just simply moved out from H2 2023 into 2024. Same total aggregate amount, the $6 to $7, just the timing moved a little bit to the right for the reasons I talked about. Thanks, Chris. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai von Roemer of TD Cowen. Your question, please, Kai. Yes, thanks so much. So your cash flow hit from the powdered metal issue is, excuse me, $300 million higher in 2024 than you said. Can you tell us how big was the impact in 2023, and are we still going to be at $3 billion, and therefore there's a plus of a $300 million pickup in 2025? Thanks. Hey, Kai, good morning. It's Neil. Yeah, I'll take that one.\nSo as Chris was just talking about, when we closed out 2023 for a variety of reasons, the cash flows shifted to the right. So the impact in 2023 for powdered metal-related disbursements was essentially zero. So we moved about half of that into 2024. That's the $1.3 billion that you're seeing. Still holding $1.5 billion in our 2025 outlook, and then we see the rest spilling into early 2026. And so we'll continue to work, obviously, the agreements with our customers, and that will drive the ultimate timing of the payments, but you can see our assumptions that we've laid out there. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your question, please, Sheila. Good morning, everyone.\nI can't help but compare and contrast given GE just reported this morning, and they're talking about margins being flattish in aerospace based on OE mix and LEAP services mix. So just looking at Pratt, can you talk about the dynamics there given GTF volumes are growing, early GTF shop visits climb higher? So what drives margins 100 basis points higher? What's embedded into the guide? Neil, you gave great color on the revenue assumptions. Can you give some assumptions on maybe the aftermarket specifics on the margins as well as the military overall sales increasing? Is that beneficial? Sure. Thanks, Sheila. Let me share a couple of other details that we didn't get into in the prepared remarks. So we did talk about the overall sales of Pratt being up in the low double-digit range, $400 to 475 million of operating profit.\nThe aftermarket sales are going to be up sort of low teens. So the drop-through on the aftermarket is going to be the principal driver of the year-over-year profit increase. And we've talked a lot about expanding the margins on both our legacy and GTF aftermarket as we increase the volumes there. And so some of that will start to show up in 2024, and that's a driver of drop-through. On the OE side, we think the sales are going to be up in the mid-teens range. The good news there, as we look at engine productions, which think about that as up about 20%, we'll see about a headwind of maybe $125 million associated with that higher volume. So we're getting much better absorption as the volumes return back to levels that we had seen pre-pandemic and that we've been capacitized to.\nSo I think that's another place that we're going to get some margin expansion. And then, again, I'm not sure we got into this, but military will be up in the mid-single-digit range. I'd say, again, we had 5% growth on the top line there. And of course, that comes with good drop-through too as we get into 2024. So that's the Pratt story as we look into 2024, just a little more color there. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Miles Walton of Wolfe Research. Your question, please, Miles. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering maybe, Neil, if you can comment on the offset to the lower implied earnings drop-through from the 2025 guidance. What was the offset to allow you to maintain the cash flow there?\nAnd maybe, Chris, what by the end of, say, 2024, would you have achieved in terms of incorporation of fully life parts into the fleet? Just as a metric, maybe we can sort of monitor by. Thanks. Thanks, Miles. Good morning. Let me start. Let me maybe start to frame the answer to that question with a little bit of an updated walk between 2023 and 2025 on free cash flow to get to the $7.5 billion. And then I'll talk about what obviously offset the reduction in the profit as part of that. So as we look from 2023 of $5.5 billion, that $2 billion increase is going to come principally from what I would call operational growth, about $4.8 billion, $2.9 billion of which is going to come from the pre-tax segment operating profit.\nYou pointed out that that will be lower than our prior guide, and that's around the midpoint. The remaining growth is going to come from working capital improvement, about $2.2 billion, about half of which we will deal with here in 2024 as we look to hold our inventory flat. So our 2023 headwind operationally was about $600 million, rather. So we're looking year over year to improve that. And then we'll have about a half of the, I'm sorry, $400 million of CapEx between 2023 and 2025. So that'll be a headwind. And then I just talked about the $1.5 billion powdered metal impact and about a $1 billion headwind that's split pretty evenly between, sorry, pretty evenly between interest and improvement in taxes. And then finally, a few hundred million dollars of pension headwind. All of that should get you to $7.5 billion.\nSo what's changed as we look out to 2025? There's been really three things that are different. The first is we've got about $1 billion net of tax lower operating profit baked into this long-term guide. But that's been offset by about $700 million of improvement in taxes, most notably on the back of improvements in our R&D position, as well as a couple hundred million dollars based on the assumptions we see today with respect to our pension outlays, and then a little bit of additional working capital. So those are the key drivers. Hey, Miles, I'll talk to you now about the full life incorporations. As we said upfront, and I think we had made this commitment early on in September, October timeframe, full life powdered metal parts in OE, so at our customer's final assembly lines starting this year. So that's a good thing.\nKeep in mind the OE engines have the latest build standard. And so when you add in the full life parts to those, you get the maximum time on wing for the customers. And also keep in mind that means that the full life parts will go into our spare engines, which are going out to lift the fleet again, maximizing the time on wing. On the MRO side, what we said was we were going to start the incorporation in Q2 of this year. We actually started that a little bit earlier. We've found opportunities to put full life parts into MRO, where we think it makes the most sense from a time on wing perspective. As we said early on in the year, we're not going to get all of our shop visits with full life parts.\nWe're going to ramp throughout the year where we don't incorporate the full life parts into MRO. We're going to continue to obviously inspect those parts with the angle scan inspection that we develop, and they will be put back into service until the next inspection interval. Keep in mind, one of the things that we've been doing is just looking at the build standard and the interval for each of these engines that are coming in. There are opportunities to sort of match up just based on the condition of the engine, where it is, and where it flies in terms of the environment. A part that's been inspected that's not at full life, match it up with an engine that's going to be coming in for another reason around that same time. So you're not actually driving an incremental visit.\nSo again, that's sort of the algorithm that we're kind of going through each and every day with the Pratt team to sort of maximize our allocation of the full life parts. But the MRO will be a ramp throughout the year. I think ultimately we'll get to roughly the same place that we had assumed we would had we started in Q2, but it'll be a ramp throughout the year. And all of that's been factored into our outlook. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead, Peter. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Chris, on Raytheon, you talked about some of the headwinds. Could you maybe give us a little more color on just where we are in terms of the profile of the fixed price development programs and whether we're peaking now?\nAnd then, kind of related to all this, just when should we start to see more of that mix shift from more of the FMS that you kind of talked about, where we could see some better pricing flowing through? Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Peter. So, again, as we talked about, the productivity issues at Raytheon, about 70%, as we said upfront, were in the fixed-price development programs. And I'll characterize some of these, Peter, as in some cases, these are contracts that we took on that maybe weren't in our core capability suite, and we signed up for requirements and other specifications that were really, really difficult. And so it's taken us some time to continue to work through those. In some cases, what we're doing, Peter, is we're taking subject matter experts from across the company and just adding resources to these programs.\nIt adds a little bit of expense, obviously, but I think in the long term, it gets the capability of the customer faster and ultimately is better financially for us and for the customer. And then in some cases, on these fixed price development programs, we're having discussions with customers about either restructuring the specifications or altering the requirements in a way that still gets capability that's needed and that's helpful, but that we can get to them, frankly, in a shorter period of time and with a better financial profile. Those conversations continue to go. I'll tell you that we've got a handful here that we're still going to be powering through in 2024 and see that horizon getting better in the next 12 to 18 months on these as we go through certain milestones, Peter, and satisfy some contractual requirements.\nWe then get into a different phase of the agreement and feel better about our ability to go and execute. Chris, maybe I would add just a couple of the financial points around our assumptions financially going into 2024. As you think about the $100 to 200 million profit increase, the first thing I would say is in 2023, we had about a $240 million headwind associated with these negative productivity. As you said, two-thirds, 70% associated with these fixed price development programs, principally a couple of them. As we look to 2024, our assumption is that our absolute value of productivity is zero. So we'll see about a $200 million improvement year over year. We'll see about $100 million at the midpoint from volume and a little bit of headwind as these lower margins roll through the backlog in 2024.\nThat's what we've contemplated both in the 2024 and the 2025 outlook. All of that gets you down to our guide, of course, that $80 million headwind I talked about. As you kind of look into 2025, our productivity assumption is about a $100 million step up. So again, this business at one time generated three, four, 500 million dollars a year in productivity, but we need some time for that to play through to see those kinds of margins. But 2025 would not mark the peak of where we see Raytheon's margin potential. Appreciate it. Thanks, Chris. Neil. You're welcome. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Noah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, Noah.\nNeil, just want to make sure I have the, I guess, the starting point and the implied margin correct in this new 500 to 550, 20 to 25, given restatements and the like. So I'm looking at 2020 segment operating margin all in of 8.2, implying that the 25 is 13.2 to 13.7. So is that correct? And then can you just talk a little more about getting there from this 2024 guidance? It would seem to either require a pretty nice step up in the Raytheon defense margin, or an acceleration in the incrementals at Pratt and Collins, or all of the above. Thanks, Noah. So as you kind of look at the multi-year outlook here, what we've done at the top end is we've tightened up the range a little bit for the RTX sales and margin.\nWe still see Collins and Pratt being within the ranges we talked about. Frankly, the drivers are all the same that we talked about six months ago and the last quarter as well. The aftermarket is going to fuel that. We're going to get better absorption, and we'll see the benefits of lower spending on investments we've been making to drive cost reduction and the benefit of that cost reduction. So if you put all that, that's going to put Pratt and Collins in that range, probably closer towards the middle of the high end of that range. And then we just talked about the Raytheon pieces altogether.\nSo I think at the midpoint, when you take into account the dispositions that we've either completed or have announced, you'll see that our margin assumption at the RTX level is about the same as where we were projecting before these tweaks for the Raytheon recalibration. Okay. And just to make sure I have what you said to Miles correct, in the $5.7 billion of free cash this year and the $7.5 billion next year, each of those assumes about $1 billion of positive change in working capital each year. Is that right? That's correct. And as you think about from 2023 to 2024, inventory is going to essentially stay flat. Our plan is to stay flat. That will be about 80% of what generates that year-over-year working capital benefit in 2024. And then as you look to 2025, we'll see continued improvement in inventory as well as the benefit of customer advances.\nSo we've realized a lot of customer advances over the last couple of years. They will burn down. And then as we see these international orders come back in, you'll see that pick up in the year '25. Okay. Thanks very much. You're welcome. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead, Doug. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning, Doug. It sounded from what you said, Chris, that you made some good progress on the AOG profile here for the GTF. But when you look at your customer base, you may have some who find that a high number of AOGs could put their financial performance at risk. And whether or not those issues are caused by Pratt, you could easily be targeted for responsibility. You already had the earlier Go First lawsuit.\nSo how do you think about the risk for you with airlines that could be in a stressed financial position and maybe more difficult, perhaps, than how you might normally compensate a customer? Yeah. No, thanks, Doug. I mean, first of all, I'll tell you that we are engaging with our customers each and every day to try to figure out how best to support them, whether that's through inductions, whether that's through special support, whether that's through spare engine allocation, whatever it may be. And you're right, Doug. There are some customers out there, 10 to 12, I think, as we've talked about before. They're going to be more impacted than others. There are some that are all Pratt fleets, whether it be GTF and V2500.\nAnd so, again, working very hard with them to come up with a compensation structure relative to the powdered metal AOG situation, that's fair, and that can give them a little bit of lift. Obviously, it won't make up for all of the disruption that they're having in the fleet and all of the things they've got to do to accommodate for these removals. But again, doing the best we can to come up with a fair set of compensation structures to help out during these trying times. And then, of course, communicate with them consistently about what we're seeing in terms of the assumptions that we're talking about here, full life incorporation, MRO, MRO output, all the things that are going to drive better fleet support for them.\nSo obviously, don't want to be in a position where we're putting our customers in harm's way and where they're going to be very upset with us and want to take action. But I'll tell you, we've got a track record of coming to agreement with our customers on some of the more difficult problems we faced. And I'm confident we're going to be able to do it again. And if I can, are you seeing any improvement in the time, the induction time to get these engines in the shop as part of this AOG profile? Right now, Doug, the wing-to-wing turnaround time remains consistent with what we had talked about previously. I will tell you, and we kind of alluded to this earlier, we are continuing to aggressively pursue with our aftermarket partners.\nAgain, we've got some Tier 1 aftermarket providers as part of the GTF aftermarket network trying to come up with what I would call light or medium-type work scopes that can take the in-shop time down further. Again, trying to maximize for time on wing, just depends on the operator, depends on the condition of the engine. But we're aggressively pursuing a number of work scopes that can take the in-shop time down. In addition, I think you've heard us talk about this before, we've industrialized a significant number of repairs on the GTF. I want to say about 1,300 in 2023. We've got another significant step up here in 2024. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Your question, please, David. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning.\nWanted to ask, what exactly is the bottleneck, Chris, to be able to ramp up production of full life discs, given that I think the powdered metal switch occurred a while ago? I guess I'm just kind of confused there why it's not easier to ramp up the production of these full life discs. And then could you touch on what you're expecting for large commercial engine deliveries in 2024 and your confidence in being able to meet Airbus's requirements? Thanks. Sure. So as we've talked about, David, the powdered metal value stream, we're asking both our own shops and our supply chain to step up significantly here so that we can incorporate an MRO, as we talked about earlier, and in OEs. So much more than that value stream clearly had anticipated mid-year last year.\nAgain, we feel like we've got pretty adequate forging capacity within our own four walls and with the supply chain. But again, we've got to continue to ramp up inspection capacity. We've got to ramp up machining capacity, all critical parts of that value stream. And I'll tell you, as you ramp up, and we saw this in 2019 as we were ramping and we're ramping up again here, as you take these parts to a volume that our supply chain wasn't necessarily anticipating and that we weren't necessarily anticipating, you've got to continue to double down on the fundamentals, the quality, the yield, the tooling, and the maintenance, all the things that are instrumental in enabling that volume jump. So again, I would say we've made solid progress thus far, and we're generally tracking to where we thought we would be.\nBut again, we've got to continue to step up throughout the year, especially as we want to increase the number of full life parts we put into MRO. To your question about Airbus, I think, and Neil said it before, up about 20% year over year here in 2024. And again, we have discussions with Airbus all the time. They understand the fleet condition. They understand where we're ramping on powdered metal parts and the like. And so we feel good about our ability to meet the commitment we made to them here in 2024. Thanks very much. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead, Ronald. Hey. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Ron. Just to change the subject a little bit, everybody seems to be talking about the powdered metal thing.\nIn Collins, I mean, Collins' outlook looks really good. Can you give some color around how much of that is being driven by wide body, and interiors, and if you're starting to really see a pickup there? Because the one thing that we're all kind of waiting for is the pickup in the wide body market. That interiors business is generally a good leading indicator of what's going on. Let me start, Ron, and maybe Chris can add something. Let me give you a couple of details first. On the aftermarket side at Collins, we expect that to be up high single digits to low double digits, I'd say 10% or more. On the OE side, mid to high single digits. We're going to see, as everyone knows, about 40% incrementals there. Yes, wide body is going to be a big driver.\nSo as we've seen a lot of narrow body, I'll call it catch-up and growth over the last couple of years, we do expect that to shift to the wide body. Now, keep in mind, on the wide body OE side for Collins, the margins are a bit thinner there, but it does set us up for good longer-term projections, especially as you get into 2025 and 2026 and beyond as that comes off warranty and converts to aftermarket. Around the interiors business, I think Steve Timm had said this back in June, that business is growing, but it's nowhere near levels of 2019. And so we don't see that coming back until about 2026. So the good news is there's a lot of runway there. And we are seeing a lot of activity there. So I think that will be a growth driver.\nBut clearly, we're starting to see a bit more of a shift from narrow body into wide body as we go into the next couple of years. Yeah. Maybe the only thing I would add to that, Ron, is that Steve and team are very focused on transformation within interiors. I think there's some opportunity to consolidate sites, to continue to remove ERP systems. As you know, there's been an integration that's been going on in that interiors business in particular. So I think a lot of good work on continuing to transform the cost footprint in the interiors business. So when that volume continues to come back, it'll be at the types of margins that you would expect. Got it. Got it. And have you guys seen any airlines, any customers yet requesting retrofits and upgrades to interiors on their existing wide body fleets?\nRon, that's actually an ongoing process. We're in the process of working with a number of airlines as they are going through their retrofit. And keep in mind, that is a three to five-year process to upgrade these things. So we are still finishing out things that we had signed up for back in 2018, 2019. But again, as Neil said, the business is coming back. But given the long-cycle nature of these upgrades, you're not going to see a heck of a lot of that in 2024, more in 2025, and certainly more in 2026. Got it. Cool. All right. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your question, please, Seth. Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.\nMaybe just following up on Collins and kind of the growth outlook for this year, when we think about how much OE production rates are rising, we think about the strength in the aftermarket, kind of what's the potential for upside on the top line there. And I guess how much is a drag on the military business? It's a pretty significant chunk of the portfolio. And given the growth rate in the second half and what you're forecasting overall for 2024, it seems like maybe this isn't a business that's really a military business that's going to participate in the budget growth and outlay growth that we're seeing now. Good morning, Seth. Let me start. I wouldn't characterize the defense business within Collins as a drag.\nI think the defense business in 2023 was flat at the top line, and it experienced a lot of the same issues we've been talking about on the Raytheon side in terms of the impacts of inflation, the delays in the supply chain. But as we look to 2024, we're going to see, I'd say, healthy growth there, low to mid-single digits as we catch up and the supply chain catches up and we burn down the overdue there. And I think we're really well positioned on a lot of strategic platforms. Remember, we moved businesses from the Raytheon segment into the Collins mission systems business to create more synergistic opportunity there. And I think that's really taking hold, and there's a lot of good proposal activity there. So I think it's a great fit, and it's in the right place in Collins.\nMore broadly, I think, just talking about the aftermarket potential at Collins, very strong. But we just put up some significant numbers there with aftermarket up 26% and provisioning up 42% on a full year. So clearly, there's been a surge in aftermarket over the last year. So we're dealing with some very difficult compares. And on the OE side, we'll start to see that growth moderate. But again, still on the back of some really strong 17% growth in 2023. So I think Collins is well positioned, and I think the defense business is a good fit, and it's in the right place there for it right now. Again, Seth, and I'll just add, much like the interiors, I think Steve and team have a plan to continue to drive structural cost reduction within Collins to help margin expansion.\nWe've talked about moving engineering presence to best low-cost locations by 2025 by a significant number, same with manufacturing hours. So a lot of center of excellence activity going on within Collins that will continue to help with their cost footprint and support the margin expansion. Great. Thanks very much. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, everyone, for calling in and listening today. As always, Jennifer and her investor relations team will be available all day to answer whatever further questions you might have. So with that, thank you, and have a wonderful day. Take care. This now concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nOn the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Calio, President and Chief Operating Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nThis call is being webcast live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from RTX's website at www.rtx.com.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments and net nonrecurring and/or significant items, often referred to by management as other significant items.\nThe company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. RTX's SEC filings, including its forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, United Technologies Corp.\n\nAll right. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, I want to spend just a minute acknowledging the tragic situation playing out in Israel today. It has been devastating to see what has unfolded there over the last couple of weeks, and our thoughts and prayers are with the people impacted, including the thousands of RTX employees that call Israel home.\nWith that said, let me turn to an update on our end markets. On the commercial aero side, air travel demand remains strong. We're seeing solid air traffic growth, with global revenue passenger miles essentially back to 2019 levels and domestic air travel well above 2019 levels. We also expect strong demand for holiday and business travel for the remainder of the year, supporting continued aftermarket strength for both wide-body and narrow-body aircraft.\nOn the defense side, the elevated threat environment is continuing to drive increased defense spending globally. Just one example in the quarter, the United States approved moving forward with the sale of F-35 aircraft to South Korea. That's estimated to be worth about $5 billion and will support further growth with this customer for F-35 content for years to come.\nAdditionally, the U.S. State Department approved a significant sale to Spain for the Patriot air and missile defense systems earlier this month, and that's expected to include approximately $1 billion of Raytheon content. And as Russia's invasion of Ukraine unfortunately continues, we are seeing significant demand from the U.S. and our allies for advanced air defense systems and munitions.\nDuring this past quarter, this included additional orders for NASAMS; Excalibur, which are precision-guided artillery shells; Stinger, anti-aircraft munitions; and TOW, antitank-guided missiles.\nDomestically, despite what we've seen over the last few weeks in D.C., we remain confident that there is bipartisan support for increased defense spending, and RTX continues to be well positioned across all three of our businesses.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney. Let me give you an update on the powder metal manufacturing quality matter. Our efforts to date have been heavily focused on ensuring the safety of our engines. As you saw in the press release this morning, we have finalized the charge recorded here in the quarter, which is in line with what we had previously disclosed.\nSo just a few thoughts on the powder metal issue. Through the early stages of removals and inspections of the PW1100 engine, which powers the A320neo aircraft, our outlook, both financially and operationally, remains consistent with our expectations.\nWe've also made significant progress on the safety assessments for the other Pratt & Whitney-powered fleets. That includes the PW1500, which powers the A220; the PW1900, which powers the Embraer E2; and the V2500, which powers the legacy A320.\nWith the analysis substantially complete, we do not expect any significant incremental financial impact as a result of those fleet management plans. The focus of both Pratt & Whitney and the entire RTX organization is on maintaining the trust of our customers and our partners, and we are relentlessly working to improve on the plans we have in place today.\nAs I've said to many of you over the last few months, we remain confident in the future of RTX because the demand for our products is robust, our end markets remain resilient across both commercial aerospace and defense, and our team is laser-focused on driving performance excellence to meet our customer needs.\nOur backlog is now a record $190 billion, with a pipeline of both existing franchises and new technology developments. As we always have, we continue to actively manage our portfolio. As you saw this morning, we reached an agreement to sell Raytheon's cyber services business and a cash sale for approximately $1.3 billion, which combined with the recently announced sale of Collins' actuation business, this will generate approximately $3 billion of gross proceeds in 2024.\nSo with that, let's turn to Slide 2. As we also announced this morning, our Board has approved a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, which we will be initiating tomorrow. Simply put, we see a significant discount between the intrinsic value of RTX and our current stock price.\nThe long-term outlook of the GTF remains strong and Pratt's franchises extend well beyond the GTF. The V2500 has about 6,000 engines still flying and is in the sweet spot of its aftermarket cycle. Pratt Canada continues to be the world's premier small engine manufacturer, with an installed base of more than 60,000 engines. And the military business of Pratt is the sole provider of engines on fifth generation fighters.\nCollins has a great portfolio, with 70% of their product lines serving as #1 or 2 in their segments and strong margin expansion opportunities. And lastly, our newly combined Raytheon segment has an incredible number of well-established franchises, along with a growing portfolio of next-generation technologies. This includes LTAMDS, which is the next-generation Patriot defense system, and the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, or HACM.\nGiven the fundamental strength of the company and growth opportunities ahead, our Board recently approved an $11 billion authority to repurchase RTX shares. This includes $10 billion through an ASR program to help capture some of that value more immediately. The new authorization replaces the company's previous program, which was approved in December of 2022.\nThis ASR, of course, is on top of the $2.6 billion we've already repurchased year-to-date. Altogether, this will increase our capital return commitment to shareowners to $36 billion to $37 billion through 2025 from the time of the merger. That's up from our previous range of $33 billion to $35 billion. As I said, this ASR program will commence almost immediately and will be funded through a combination of short- and long-term debt.\nAnd importantly, we'll begin the process of deleveraging in 2024 in part supported by the proceeds from the recently announced dispositions that I just mentioned. So despite near-term headwinds, the future of RTX remains bright, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term shareowner value.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Chris to provide additional color on the Pratt matters and to cover the Q3 highlights.\n\nChristopher T. Calio\n\nPresident, Pratt & Whitney Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 3. As Greg said, the powder metal situation is our top priority. The bottom line is that our outlook for managing both the fleet impact and the financial impact remains intact since our last call, and our team continues to execute on our fleet management and recovery plans.\nLet me provide a few more details, and I'll start with the GTF. With respect to the PW1100, there is no change to the plan we outlined in our September call. The fleet management plan and financial estimates remain consistent with what we said 6 weeks ago, and our focus is on executing all elements of the fleet management plan, in particular, industrial output and material flow, MRO output and customer support.\nThe first tranche of the engine removals has occurred, and several of these engines were eligible for a project visit work scope. And the turnaround times for these visits averaged roughly 35 days. While project visits will be a smaller portion of the overall shop visits, the turnaround time is encouraging, and our teams are continuing to identify further process improvements. And from a process perspective, additional bulletins will be released in the next few weeks that outline the life limits and repetitive inspection requirements that we detailed on our prior call.\nAnd just by way of background, it is common practice for a fleet management plan to be communicated through multiple service bulletins and airworthiness directives to address different engine models, compliance times or components and sections of the engine.\nNow let me share some details on our other GTF programs. For the PW1500 and the 1900, we will institute a fleet management plan that will largely fit inside the shop visit plans that are already in place for these fleets. We believe the financial impact won't be significant and is contemplated in our current contract estimates and the financial outlook for Pratt.\nAs part of this plan, we will place a shorter life limit on certain early configuration parts and an inspection requirement at about 5,000 cycles for current configuration parts. There will be some incremental AOGs in the first half of 2024, but we believe these will be largely mitigated by the end of the year.\nRegulators and air framers are aligned with this recommendation. We expect the service bulletin implementing these actions will be released beginning in November, followed by airworthiness directives.\nLet me now turn to the V2500. And as a reminder, we've had a fleet management and inspection plan in place since 2021. We're going to augment this plan by accelerating certain inspections, but expect this, too, will have very little impact operationally or financially. It will result in a total of roughly 100 or less incremental removals stretched out over the next 4 years. The majority of these visits having a project visit work scope.\nAgain, very manageable given the size of the V2500 fleet, the number of spare engines available and engines in the market with available green time. All of this is contemplated in our current contract estimates and perhaps, financial outlook. This action will be communicated through a service bulletin to be released in the November time frame.\nAnd lastly, turning to the F135. The joint program office is reviewing our fleet management plan recommendation, which we believe will have limited, if any, operational impact on the customer. We continue to evaluate the balance of the Pratt fleet containing powder metal and expect any fleet management plan updates, if needed, to have limited impact.\nWith our fleet management plan largely set, let me turn to the operational initiatives we are focused on to support our customers, increasing capacity and reducing turn times in our MRO shops and ramping up the production of new full-life powder metal parts.\nFirst, with respect to MRO, we're accelerating previously planned investments in the GTF network to increase capacity and bring more shops online to support our customers. Just last month, Pratt announced they're adding capacity at their Singapore Engine Center, which will be perhaps a third facility expansion this year. And earlier this month, MRO shops operated by China Airlines and Korea Air inducted their first GTF engines. By the end of the year, Iberia maintenance will also be joining the GTF aftermarket network.\nOnce complete, this network will have 16 sites globally, having brought online six partner shops this year, but plans for an additional three shops to come online by 2025, bringing the total to 19. This will enable the network to be able to conduct more than 2,000 annual shop visits in 2025 to support the global GTF fleet, a roughly fivefold increase from 2019.\nWe're also leveraging our extensive knowledge and talent across RTX to drive process enhancements to help us improve turn times in our MRO shops compared to our baseline plan. This includes a cross-functional team focused on part availability, repair development and industrialization and process improvements on the shop floor.\nSecond, and as we said in September, our objective is to replace as many HPT and HPC disks as possible, with full-life disks when engines come in for a shop visit in order to maximize their time on wing when they leave the shop.\nAs we've said before, we previously made the necessary powder metal production and forging capacity investments and now are increasing our machining and inspection capacity. Our baseline plan today forecast Q2 2024 to get to run rate capacity for disk production, we are working to accelerate this time line, which will allow us to replace an even larger portion of the fleet with full-life parts.\nSo to wrap up on powder metal. Our fleet management plan on the most impacted fleets are largely complete. The financial impact has been reassessed and remains consistent with what we said on our September 11 call on the subject, and we are fully focused on executing these plans.\nI'll shift now to the third quarter highlights, which Neil will provide some additional color on in a few minutes. On an adjusted basis, organic sales grew 12%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and segment operating profit grew 15%. Adjusted EPS was in line with our expectations at $1.25, and we had strong free cash flow of $2.8 billion in the quarter.\nSales growth was again led by the continued commercial air traffic recovery, with strong commercial OE growth of 26% and 25% commercial aftermarket growth, while defense sales were up 2% year-over-year. In the quarter, we captured $22 billion in new bookings and had a book-to-bill of 1.19 across RTX, bringing our backlog to a record $190 billion.\nFinally, Q3 was the first quarter we officially began operating in our realigned three business unit structure. We are continuing to develop initiatives to leverage our scale and breadth to better enable customer alignment and best-in-class cost structure.\nWith respect to our 2023 outlook, with 1 quarter to go, we are raising both our reported and adjusted sales outlook for the year. On a reported basis, we expect sales to be approximately $68.5 billion. And on an adjusted basis, we expect sales to be approximately $74 billion, up about 10% organically versus the prior year. We're also tightening our EPS range and have incorporated a few cents of tax headwind from some recent IRS guidance around R&D capitalization, which Neil will discuss further.\nAs a result, we announced see adjusted EPS between $4.98 and $5.02 for the year. Additionally, we expect free cash flow for the year to improve by approximately $500 million, driven primarily by the IRS guidance I just mentioned, just favorable from a cash perspective, and we are, therefore, increasing our free cash flow outlook to approximately $4.8 billion.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Neil to take you through the additional details on the quarter.\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nChief Financial Officer & Vice President, The Pratt & Whitney Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. I'm on Slide 4. As you saw, we finalized our estimate for the PW1100 powder metal matter here in the third quarter and have recorded a $5.4 billion sales charge, our share of which resulted in a $2.9 billion operating profit impact. This is in line with what we communicated in September and resulted in reported sales of $13.5 billion in the third quarter.\nAs Chris said, we had adjusted sales of $19 billion for the quarter, up 12% organically versus the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by strong demand across our commercial OE and aftermarket businesses as OEMs continue to ramp production and airline supported the busy summer travel season. We also saw positive growth in defense as we continue to execute on our growing backlog.\nOn a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $0.68 and included $1.53 charge from the Pratt matter as well as $0.40 from acquisition accounting adjustments, restructuring and other nonrecurring and nonoperational items. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 was up 3% year-over-year, with higher segment operating profit, partially offset by lower pension income, a higher effective tax rate and higher interest expense.\nAs Chris alluded to, the IRS recently provided guidance on R&D capitalization with respect to customer-funded R&D for certain cost plus contracts. This means a portion of our previously capitalized R&D costs for tax purposes will now be currently deductible. While this will result in a slightly higher effective tax rate going forward, it will reduce our cash tax payments. In the quarter, this resulted in about a $0.02 headwind to adjusted earnings per share. For the full year, we expect this to be about $0.03 of headwind. Finally, as we had anticipated, we had strong free cash flow generation in the quarter of $2.8 billion, which included a benefit of approximately $500 million from the IRS' R&D capitalization guidance I just discussed.\nNow with that, let's turn to Slide 5 to get into the Q3 segment results. So before I begin, just a reminder, we are now reporting as three business units: Collins, Pratt and Raytheon.\nStarting with Collins. Adjusted sales were $6.7 billion in the quarter, up 17% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven primarily by continued strength in commercial OE and aftermarket growth. By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 30%, driven by a 35% increase in both provisioning as well as parts and repair, while modifications and upgrades were up 9% in the quarter.\nSequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%. Commercial OE sales were up 27% versus the prior year, driven by growth in both narrow-body and wide-body platforms. And military sales were down 1%, primarily due to the timing of deliveries.\nAdjusted operating profit of $1.04 billion was up $287 million or 38% on the prior year, with drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and OE volume, partially offset by higher production costs, unfavorable military mix and higher SG&A expenses. For the full year, given the continued strength in commercial OE and aftermarket, we now expect Collins sales range to be up low to mid-teens, an increase from the previous range of up low double digits to low teens. With respect to operating profit, we are maintaining adjusted operating profit in our prior range of up $825 million to $875 million versus the prior year.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 6. As it relates to the powder metal matter, for the PW1100, in September, we communicated that we expected the gross financial impact to be in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion, with an expected Q3 pretax operating profit impact of approximately $3 billion. As I just mentioned, in the third quarter, we recorded a $5.4 billion sales charge, resulting in a $2.9 billion pretax operating profit impact, representing our net program share in line with where we expected. Recall, I mentioned that certain elements of the gross $6 billion to $7 billion cost will be booked upfront, and the remainder will be booked over the remaining life of the contracts.\nSo looking at Pratt's quarterly results on an adjusted basis, sales of $6.3 billion were up 18% and 17% on an organic basis, with sales growth across all three channels. Commercial OE sales were up 25% in the quarter, driven by higher engine deliveries and favorable mix in the large commercial engine business.\nCommercial aftermarket sales were up 21% in the quarter, driven by both higher volume and content as well as favorable mix in both the large commercial engine and Pratt & Whitney Canada businesses. And in the military business, sales were up 7%, driven by higher F135 development and sustainment volume. Adjusted operating profit of $413 million was up $95 million from the prior year, with drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, partially offset by higher commercial OE volume, higher production costs, unfavorable military mix as well as higher R&D expenses.\nLooking ahead, due to higher commercial OE and military volume, we now expect Pratt's adjusted sales to be towards the higher end of our prior range or up mid-teens versus prior year. Given the higher military sales as well as better mix across OE and aftermarket, we're also increasing Pratt's adjusted operating profit from our prior range of up $200 million to $275 million to a new range of up $350 million to $400 million versus the prior year.\nTurning now to Raytheon on Slide 7. Sales of $6.5 billion in the quarter were up 3% on an adjusted and organic basis, primarily driven by higher volume able power programs, including AIM-9X, and Advanced Technology classified programs. Adjusted operating profit of $570 million was down $124 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher volume on lower-margin programs and lower net program efficiencies and including additional headwind on certain fixed price development programs.\nIn addition, as expected, there was an unfavorable impact of about $20 million from a significant contract option exercised in the quarter. Raytheon had $7.4 billion of bookings in the quarter, including $1.9 billion in classified awards, a $412 million award for the next-generation short-range Interceptor program, and a $383 million award for HAWK and Patriot sustainment. This resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.16 and backlog of $50 billion. Year-to-date, Raytheon has a book-to-bill of 1.17.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect sales to be up low to mid-single digits. With respect to operating profit, while the supply chain continues to improve, as evidenced by the increase in material receipts we have seen in the last 3 quarters, Raytheon continues to have productivity and mix challenges. This stemmed from a combination of the fixed price development programs we have previously discussed as well as higher production costs. As a result, we're reducing Raytheon's adjusted operating profit from the prior range of up $125 million to $175 million to a new range of up $25 million to $75 million versus the prior year.\nBefore I hand it back to Greg, just a couple of comments on the environment for 2024. Overall, we anticipate another year of solid growth in organic sales, segment operating profit, margin and free cash flow. However, the level of free cash flow growth will be tempered by the step-up in cash impacts associated with the powder metal matter as well as some headwind from cash taxes related to R&D\nWhile commercial air travel demand has been incredibly strong from passengers and airlines, we see growth beginning to normalize as we head into 2024, with RPKs back at 2019 levels and the year-over-year compare is becoming more difficult. However, overall, we expect continued growth in OE and aftermarket, including the ongoing recovery of the widebody.\nOn the defense side, we continue to expect strong international and domestic demand, which has already driven a 2023 year-to-date book-to-bill of 1.22 and a record defense backlog that will continue to convert to solid growth over the next several years. While inflation has begun to moderate, there are still pockets that remain persistently high within our manufacturing base. We expect this to continue into the next year. We'll continue working all the mitigation actions we've had in place in the past 2 years and we'll implement additional strategic initiatives to offset the pressure we expect to see in 2024.\nFinally, as you know, we have seen a lot of volatility in the financial markets and interest rates. We expect this to drive further pension headwind next year that could be about $0.45 on a year-over-year basis given current market conditions and the actions we are taking to preserve the improved funded status of the pension plan.\nSo obviously, a lot of moving pieces here, but we are focused on driving execution and aggressive cost reduction and remain optimistic as we look ahead towards 2024 and 2025.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Greg to wrap things up.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, United Technologies Corp.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Neil. Let's just take a step back, if we can, for a minute. I know there's a lot of information we've given you today. But really, I think there are three key takeaways from our discussion.\nFirst of all, I believe we have our arms around the operational and financial impacts of the powder metal issue. Our focus at Pratt & Whitney and across RTX is now executing on those plans that Chris laid out.\nSecondly, Strong demand continues in our end markets. That's evidenced by the 12% organic revenue growth we saw this quarter and the $190 billion backlog we ended the quarter with.\nFinally, we see tremendous value in RTX today, and we're going to utilize our strong balance sheet to take advantage of this through a $10 billion ASR.\nWith that, let me stop and open it up for questions.",

To ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits. With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone. It was another strong quarter for RTX with continued strength across all of our end markets. On the commercial aerospace side, industry-wide, we saw 1,200 new orders announced around the Paris Air Show. This is the largest number of orders in the history of the Air Show, as airlines look to secure production slots well into the next decade.\nGlobal commercial air traffic remains on track with our projections, with a very robust summer travel season driven by incredibly strong consumer demand. This dynamic is supporting strength in the aftermarket and growth across the globe, with revenue passenger kilometers now tracking at about 95% of 2019 levels. Long-haul international, which has lagged in the recovery, is showing strong growth with passenger flight hours up 18 points year-over-year, a good indicator of increasing demand for widebody travel.\nTurning to defense, we're pleased that the House Defense Appropriations bill fully funds many of our programs, including importantly the F135 engine core upgrade, which is the only engine funded for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Additionally, the bill also recommends the full budget request for other key RTX programs such as LTAMDS, LRSO, hypersonics, and Standard Missile-3.\nInternationally, we saw the State Department approve a large sale of advanced air defense systems for Poland as it bolsters its security amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This would expand our existing partnership with Poland and make Poland the first international customer for our LTAMDS system, representing a key transition for this next-generation Raytheon franchise.\nBefore we get into details of the quarter, as you saw in our press release this morning, we are working through an issue resulting from a rare condition in powdered metal that will require Pratt & Whitney to remove some engines from service for inspection earlier than expected. I want to make just a couple of comments here at the outset. First of all, it's important to know that we understand the issue and we have begun to address it through an inspection protocol that we already have in place. That said, clearly this will have an impact on Pratt & Whitney and our customers. Chris and Neil provide additional color later in the call on how we're going to address the issue as well as the operational and financial impacts. As you'd expect, we'll dedicate all the necessary resources to manage this.\nNow let's turn to Slide 2 to go through some key highlights from the quarter.\nQ2 was another strong quarter of strong demand in both the commercial and defense segments of our business. With $25 billion of new orders, this brings our total backlog to a record $185 billion. On the commercial side, Collins continues to convert its industry-leading portfolio and the solid order strength. As I mentioned industry wide, there were about 1,200 new aircraft orders announced in Paris. The aggregate amount of Collins and Pratt & Whitney content on those aircraft will be about $20 billion for the life of the programs. On the defense side across the RTX businesses, we captured $13 billion in new bookings in the quarter driving a strong book-to-bill of 1.22, and this takes our defense backlog to $73 billion.\nContributing to the backlog in second quarter were a number of significant awards including $2 billion at Pratt & Whitney for Lot 17 of the F135 engines and $1.5 billion for F117 sustainment. The Raytheon segment was awarded its largest ever AMRAAM contract for $1.2 billion from the US Air Force and international partners, including Ukraine. The AMRAAMs will work in concert with their existing NASAMS batteries to help protect the Ukrainian people.\nEarlier this month we executed the business realignment. We are now officially operating as three business units. Our team has done a tremendous job in a relatively short period of time shifting roughly $3 billion of sales and thousands of employees across our portfolio to better meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nOf course, our transformation isn't done. We will continue to develop initiatives to better leverage our scale and breadth and to enable operational excellence, and a best-in-class cost structure.\nFinally, as many of you saw last week, we agreed to divest Collins' actuation business to Safran. We expect this deal to close in second half 2024, with proceeds from the transaction that will be about $1.8 billion.\nWith respect to our full year outlook, we're going to raise the top line to reflect the strength we're seeing in our end markets. The new range will be $73 to $74 billion, and we're also going to bring up the bottom end of our Adjusted EPS range by $0.05 to $4.95 to $5.05. However, we are going to reduce our 2023 cash flow expectations by $500 million to $4.3 billion. This is primarily to reflect the developments at Pratt & Whitney that I discussed earlier. So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through our financial results in more detail.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks, Greg. Let's look at Q2 results on slide 3. As Greg noted, we had another solid quarter with sales of $18.3 billion, up a strong 13% organically versus the prior year with growth across all four of our segments. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.29 was up 11% year-over-year with strong adjusted segment operating profit growth of 26%, partially offset by lower pension income and a higher effective tax rate on a GAAP basis. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.90 per share and included $0.26 of acquisition accounting adjustments, an $0.08 charge related to an airline customer insolvency, and $0.05 of restructuring and segment and portfolio transformation costs.\nFree cash flow of $193 million was generally in line with what we discussed when we were together in Paris last month. And finally on the capital allocation front, we repurchased $596 million in shares, putting us at about $1.2 billion year to date, on track for $3 billion in share repurchases for the full year. So let's turn to Slide 4 to get into the Q2 segment results.\nBeginning with RMD sales were $4 billion in the quarter, up 12% on an adjusted basis and 13% organically, primarily driven by higher volume from air power, advanced technology, land warfare, and air defense programs. Adjusted operating profit of $427 million was up $79 million versus the prior year, driven by favorable net program efficiencies and drop through on higher volume partially offset by unfavorable mix resulting from early-stage production programs. RMD had $3.6 billion of bookings in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92 and a backlog of $35 billion. In addition to the AMRAAM award that Greg mentioned earlier, RMD also received a $265 million award for Javelin and a $251 million award for AIM-9X missiles. Year to date RMD has a book-to-bill of 1.17.\nShifting to RIS on Slide 5, sales of $3.7 billion were up 2% versus the prior year on an adjusted and organic basis. This was driven by higher revenue from Sensing and Effectors as well as cyber and services programs, which was partially offset by lower sales from command, control, and communications programs. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $297 million was down $18 million versus prior year primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher operating expenses, which more than offset improved productivity and drop through on higher volume. However, as I mentioned in June, we still saw unfavorable productivity in the quarter due to a handful of fixed price development programs in the quarter. RIS had $3.1 billion of bookings resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.96 and a backlog of $17 billion.\nBookings in Q2 at RIS included about $1.1 billion in classified awards and $322 million for federal and civil cyber defense services. On a year to date basis RIS has a book-to-bill of 1.15.\nTurning to Collins on slide 6, sales were $5.9 billion in the quarter, up 17% on an adjusted and organic basis driven primarily by strong demand across commercial aerospace end markets, which resulted in higher flight hours and higher OE production rates. By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 29% driven by a 68% increase in provisioning and a 28% increase in parts and repair, while modifications and upgrades were up 9% organically in the quarter. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 7% on the commercial OE side. Commercial OE sales were up 14% versus the prior year, which included growth in widebody, narrow body, and business jets, and military sales were up 5% due to higher development volume.\nAdjusted operating profit of $837 million was up $220 million or 36% from the prior year with drop through on higher sales volume and favorable mix, which more than offset higher production costs as well as higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Turning to Pratt & Whitney on slide 7, sales of $5.7 billion were up 15% on an adjusted and organic basis with sales growth across the commercial segments partially offset by lower military volume. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 26% in the quarter due to higher shop visit volume and content in both large commercial engine and Pratt & Whitney Canada businesses. Commercial OE sales were up 22% in the quarter on higher engine deliveries and favorable mix, and in the military business sales were down 3%.\nThe decline in sales was driven by the timing of the F135 production contract award in the prior year, which was partially offset by higher F135 sustainment volume. This year, adjusted operating profit of $436 million was up $133 million from prior year with drop through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, and favorable large commercial OE mix partially offset by higher production costs, and higher R&D expenses. Note that both this quarter and the prior year quarter had a similar sized contract benefit of roughly $60 million. With that, before we get into the updated outlook for 2023, let me turn it over to Chris to give some additional color on the Pratt & Whitney fleet.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nOkay, thanks Neil. Let me share with you what I can at this point about the Pratt & Whitney matter. As you heard from Greg, Pratt & Whitney previously determined that a rare condition in powdered metal used to manufacture certain engine parts.\nMay reduce the life of those parts.\nNow, it's important to note up front that the current production of powdered metal parts is not impacted, and Pratt & Whitney will continue to deliver both new engines and new spare parts across all product lines. I'll come back to that in a minute. As a result of this rare condition powdered metal, Pratt & Whitney instituted enhanced inspections to be performed at scheduled shop visits. However, based on very recent learnings from these inspections, Pratt & Whitney has now determined that the timing of these shop visits needs to be accelerated. While powdered metal parts have been widely used throughout Pratt & Whitney's product lines for decades, Pratt & Whitney has bounded the potentially impacted material. It is concluded that this condition was present in rare instances in powdered metal produced from approximately Q4 2015 into Q3 2021.\nThe PW1100 engine fleet which powers the A320neo will experience the most significant impact due to production volumes during this period. Based on the current assessment, Pratt & Whitney anticipates by mid-September that approximately 200 PW1100 engines will be removed for enhanced inspection. Beyond the initial 200 engines, Pratt & Whitney also anticipates that approximately 1,000 additional PW1100 engines will need to be removed from the operating fleet for this inspection within the next nine to 12 months, though the exact number of engines and the timing of those removals is not yet finalized. Now, it's important to note that some of the engines that must be removed for inspection in 2023 and 2024 are already forecasted for a regular shop visit during this time period, and so the incremental impact of the fleet is still under evaluation.\nCapability to perform the accelerated inspections, which are focused on the high-pressure turbine discs, is already in place, and Pratt & Whitney is developing plans to optimize shop visit capacity within its network to complete these inspections as quickly and efficiently as possible. As I said earlier, current production of powdered metal parts is not impacted, and Pratt & Whitney will continue to deliver both new engines and new spare parts across all product lines. This is a result of the combination of extensive improvements that were made to our powder processing to remove possible contamination sources and the deployment of enhanced inspections for improved detection. Pratt & Whitney is also analyzing any potential impact to other parts of its fleet, but the current expectation is that they will be less impacted based upon existing inspections, utilization profiles, and maintenance intervals. Let me take a moment to explain the timing of these developments.\nWe proactively monitor the performance of our engines throughout their life cycle. It's foundational to how we maintain and manage the safe operation of our fleet. We do this in a number of ways: analyzing large amounts of data generated during operation, inspecting parts and MRO, destructively testing certain parts to analyze their material properties.\nCharacterizing what we observe.\nWe use learnings from this proactive monitoring to inform our predictive models that we can address any issues before they appear in our fleet. In this case, as Pratt & Whitney analyzed some recent inspection findings, it determined the need for an accelerated inspection plan, even though the fallout rate from these inspections is expected to be very low. The next step is for Pratt & Whitney to publish a service bulletin describing the inspections, and the FAA will likely follow up with an airworthiness directive. Financial impact associated with these removals is still being analyzed and will depend on a number of factors, including the result of the inspections, the amount of work needed to be done in our network shops, and of course, the impact on our customers. This is obviously a difficult situation for our customers, especially given the strong demand for travel.\nWe're truly sorry for the impact of this disruption, and we will do all we can to support our customers. Safety always has been and always will be our number one priority, and we will never compromise on ensuring the safe operation of our fleet. We will of course continue to keep you apprised as our analysis progresses on both the operational and financial impacts of.\nThese accelerated shop visits. With that, let me turn it over to Neil to talk about how this impacts our 2023 outlook.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks Chris. Let's start with the segment outlook. As Chris mentioned, there continue to be a number of evolving assumptions around the financials of Pratt & Whitney. Let me try to put some additional color around that starting with the top line. Commercial aftermarket demand remains strong, and we are continuing to ramp production. Because of this, we are confident in our prior sales range of up low to mid teens. On the profit side, given the strong first half results and continued top line growth, we still expect between $200 and $275 million of operating profit growth for the year. Within that outlook for Pratt & Whitney, here's what we are assuming as it relates to the increased engine removals and inspections. Given Pratt & Whitney's results to date and aftermarket strength, the impact for the first 200 engines is contemplated within the range we just provided.\nKeep in mind, given the percentage of completion accounting for the aftermarket contracts and the relatively early life of the programs, the P&L impact will be less significant today. However, for the reasons Chris described, the impact of any further engine removals from service for inspection is not currently assumed in our outlook. So moving to Collins, given the strong results in the first half and the continued strength we are seeing in commercial aftermarket, we are increasing the full year sales range from up low double digits to a new range of up low double digits to low teens. And as a result of this increased demand and continued execution, we now expect Collins adjusted operating profit to be up between $825 and $875 million compared to the prior range of $750 to $825 million.\nTurning to the new Raytheon segment, given the strength of the backlog and the accelerating top line, we expect sales for the combined segment to grow low to mid single digits versus 2022. While we have begun to see increased material flow and improved efficiencies, we had lower productivity than we expected in the first half of the year, including costs associated with fixed price development programs, and, similar to Q1, we anticipate another contract option exercise that will lead to a headwind in third quarter. With all that said, we're expecting continued volume growth, and second half productivity improvements, and altogether we see adjusted operating profit up between $125 and $175 million versus prior year. So now let me summarize all this at the RTX level.\nAs Greg mentioned, we're increasing our full year RTX sales outlook to $73 to $74 billion, which translates to organic growth of between 9% and 10%. This is up from our prior outlook of $72 to $73 billion. With respect to earnings, we are tightening our adjusted earnings per share range by $0.05 on the bottom end and now expect Adjusted EPS of between $4.95 and $5.05 given the first half results and some improvement in below the line items. We provided an update on those below the line items in the appendices.\nTurning to free cash flow, the impact of the Pratt & Whitney matter will be more meaningful on cash flow as we begin to ramp up inspections and MRO activity this year. As a result, we now see free cash flow of approximately $4.3 billion for the year, about $500 million below our prior outlook. Finally, we'll transition to the new segment reporting here in third quarter. We provided the recast 2022 and 2023 quarterly financials in the appendices. So with that, let me turn it over to Greg for some closing remarks.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nOkay, thanks Neil. So just some closing thoughts before we get to the Q&A. We obviously had a very strong second quarter with $25 billion in new orders, which brings our backlog to a record $185 billion. Sales were also very strong with 13% organic revenue growth. This strength in sales and orders reflects the strength in both our commercial aero and defense markets. RPMs are on track to return to pre-COVID levels as we exit 2023. Military spending globally continues to increase in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, and the emerging threats in the Indo-PACOM theater. Based on the continued strength in our markets, we are well positioned to deliver on our commitments for 2023 and beyond. With that, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIn the interest of time and to allow for broader participation, you are asked to limit yourself to one question. To ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nRob.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nLet's start with the GTF, shall we? By my count, this is the third. Issue you're dealing with at the moment. You have that quality escape noted at Paris. The ongoing time on wing issues in these challenging environments.\nNow the metal problem. Is there a root problem or cause that's linking these issues? And are you concerned about the potential impact on Pratt & Whitney's reputation for reliability? Thank you.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Rob. This is Chris. I'll start.\nObviously, this is a disappointing development and will impact our customers. Let me just sort of take a step back and kind of walk you through sort of the processes that are in place across Pratt & Whitney. It's got a strong process of fleet surveillance evaluation and taking corrective action that is used to support the safety of the fleet. In this particular case, you know, the process worked. But I will tell you that again, we continue to monitor the situation with the fleet. We continue to find learnings in the fleet and then we take those actions and update our models and correct them. But if you step back, this is not a GTF, you know, design issue. This is a manufacturing process issue in our powdered metal.\nWe very quickly went and enhanced those processes to make sure this doesn't happen again and put in place the enhanced inspection techniques to make sure that we can continue to find this and address them, you know, promptly. So we're taking prompt action right now. We've got to now work through how we define the work scope and the turnaround time that's required, and, of course, do all the impact to the fleet that's.\nThat's going to be required.\nAgain, we talked about in the comments up front. GTF is going to have a lot of shop visits here in the back half of 2023 and into 2024. We need to figure out how many of those are incremental and what the true impact of the fleet is. But that's ongoing. But again, we're going to continue to invest in the GTF and the durability improvements that Shane talked about at Investor Day in June. And of course, the GTF Advantage, we will work through this difficult time, but again, we continue to believe in the GTF, its architecture, and its future.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay, thanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, Neil. I'm trying to understand that the scaling of the $500 million lower free cash flow to the total population of engines. That you're going to be removing and inspecting. I think you said that the 200, the first 200, are encompassed in the guidance, but it wasn't clear if that was just the segment profit guidance we were talking about. And also, obviously, this is lingering into 2024 to get that whole 1,200 population.\nShould we think about a similar? Size cash impact in 2024?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGot it.\nLet me start with what I can tell you now, first, you know, let me remind you, it's very early in this process. We have begun to investigate what the costs, the work scope, and the timing might be, but there'll be some learnings over the next 30 to 60 days. And we'll certainly come back and talk to you a little bit about that. You know, think about the guidance. The comment I made with respect to the Pratt & Whitney guidance. You know, again, we had a first half that was very strong at Pratt & Whitney. I think we're well on track for the year, all else equal. But a couple of dynamics that you know, will likely keep the P&L impact.\nAssociated with the 200 accelerated inspections manageable for the year. First, we've talked about 85% of this fleet is under a long term contract, and we're less than 5% complete on those programs on average. And so as Chris just mentioned, we don't know exactly how many, but some of those 200 are already scheduled for a visit this year. So when we think about those two things, that sort of helps us bound what the impact could be for this year with respect to that population.\nGiven the thousand and the fact that a number of those are also already scheduled for a shop visit. You know, we still need some more time to go think through that as it relates to the cash flow. Similar, you know, you know, train of thought there. We really do need a little bit more time to go through this. But you know, we put a risk into our outlook because we know that we'll have some calls on cash over the rest of the year. I would say there's two things that are impacting the cash flow. The first is what I'd call the direct impact. The second is what I'd call the indirect.\nOn the indirect, the direct side, it's really going to be things like accelerated capital, some inventory to get ready for these inspections, expenses associated with the work that we'll start to perform during the, you know, last quarter of the year, and then obviously customer disruption. So more to go there indirectly. You know, there's other work that this may disrupt in our, in our business. And so we're contemplating some of that as we look at this year. I think it's a bit too early to kind of extrapolate that out to 2024 and 2025. Certainly we'll come back over the next couple of months and provide a better update.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nCan you clarify if the powdered metal supplier is internal to you?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nIt is. Myles, it's Greg. Yes. So we actually manufacture the powder at our facility in New York. That powder is then processed down at our Columbus, Georgia forge into a number of different parts. The parts we're talking about here are turbine discs, but they are all internally manufactured with a proprietary powder.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question. Comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning. Question for you, Greg.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nRight.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Bank of America\n\nAnd then kind of getting back to Rob's question. When you look at the litany of issues that have happened here with this engine, everything, you know, from hot section issues, manufacturing issues.\nDo you have a cultural issue in your engineering workforce? Are people not talking to each other? And, I mean, it also begs the question, how could you guys possibly not know about this at Paris when you did this major investor event? So can you just give us all some insight into how people are communicating and what's going on in your engineering workforce?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah.\nYou know, Ron, we should differentiate between the durability issues that Shane talked about, and I call this the manufacturing quality issue. Let's just take a step back, right? This is an issue that we first uncovered back in 2020 when we had an incident with a V2500 turbine disk. As a result of that investigation, we determined at that point that we had some contamination in this powdered metal that we make. It occurred very, very rarely, but it did happen, and it actually resulted in the turbine disk failure on an airline. As a result of that, we went through and did two things. First of all, we went out and inspected the V2500 fleet. But we also went back, and we took a look at the powdered metal process to determine how this contamination happened.\nThrough a lot of work, through a lot of discovery, we figured out what the contaminants were. And by the end of 2021, about a year after that, we were able to manufacture powder that was, I would say, contaminant free to the best of our ability. At the same time, we knew that this contamination had occurred between late 2015 and late 2020, early 2021. So we knew we had a suspect population in the fleet, and we went out, and so we started inspecting. We inspected the turbine disks as they were manufactured. We inspected turbine disks as they came back in, not just for the V, but for the whole GTF fleet.\nIn fact, the entire fleet of Pratt & Whitney products that were manufactured during this time frame, you know, those inspections, and there were over 3,000 of those inspections, yielded a very, very small fallout rate, less than 1%. So, as Chris said, all of this data goes into our lifing model for the turbine disk. And based upon everything that we knew until very recently, we believe that the life of the turbine disk was such that we would see these disks in the shop and be able to inspect them before we ever had an issue. Now, as we again looked at the data again over the last couple of Safety Risk Assessment, our Safety Board, went through their process of updating the data based on all the recent findings. And they said, you know what, we're not absolutely positive that the lifing model is accurate.\nAnd so we want to take a look at these disks on a much accelerated basis. I would tell you that is exactly the way the process is supposed to work. And so we're going to pull back 200 disks or 200 engines and look at the disks here in the next 90 days or so. And the next year, based upon those findings from the first 200, we think there's probably another 1,000 out there. So 1,200 out of a little over 3,000 engines out there have to be inspected. But this is not a manufacturing issue. I'm sorry, it's not a design issue. In fact, the engineers have been working on this issue hand in glove with the Safety Board and everybody else in manufacturing for the last three years. So I don't believe that we have an engineering issue.\nObviously, this was a quality escape back from sometime between 2015 and 2020. We are doing, I think, exactly the right thing, which is to bring these engines back, inspect them, and ensure the safety of the fleet going forward. I think, again, it's obviously this engine, Ron, as you know, has been a challenge since we launched it back in 2015. You guys can remember talking about bowed rotors and all the other issues that we had. But if you think about this engine operating at the temperatures that we do, it has been a continuous discovery. This is not one of them. This is simply a quality issue from a manufacturing problem. I would say, look, we're on top of it. We've got this. It's going to be expensive.\nWe're going to make the airlines whole as a result of the disruption we're going to cause them. And I think, you know, we're going to work ourselves through. It's not an existential threat to RTX. It's not even an existential threat to Pratt & Whitney. It is a problem, and we have them every day, and we'll solve it.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Bank of America\n\nAll right, got it.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks, Ron.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Greg, thanks.\nThanks for that color there. I appreciate that. On the powdered metal, just specifically did. You, when did you make the change? Was it kind of when, back in 2020 or 2021? Just so we can have better clarity. On the engines that are being delivered?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah. So it was mid to late 2021 where we changed all the processes in terms of the screening of the powdered metal to identify the contaminant, to eliminate the contaminant. You know, let's be clear. I mean, this is a, these contaminants are microscopic. And unfortunately, the original process, as we scaled up production for GTF.\nIt got away from us a little bit, and we fixed it. But I would tell you everything that we have shipped, or almost everything we have shipped, I should say, in the last three years, we believe is going to be just fine. That's why we're confident we can continue to support Airbus, continue to support customers with new deliveries as well as with spares this year and next.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks, Greg.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks, Peter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question. Comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you very much.\nJust on Free Cash Flow, can we walk through the bridge? $1.2 billion of Free Cash Flow usage in the first half, $4.3 billion expectation for the year. How do you think about the biggest drivers on a segment-level basis and working capital? What are your expectations for factoring for the year, whether it's a benefit or headwind? And do we think about $500 million of Pratt & Whitney impact for 200 engines? Is that the rate we should assume going forward in future years, or is that something you guys are working through?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks, Sheila. This is Neil, and good morning. I will take that one. First of all, on the $0.5 billion, I wouldn't extrapolate that. You know, we need some more time, as I said earlier in the call, so let's just kind of focus on 2023. As I look at the walk from the first half to the second half, I'll also say that, you know, we ended the quarter with positive cash flow pretty much as expected. So the back half of the year is as we expected it to be. Obviously, there's some work to do there to generate the cash. But consistent with the profile we had last year, the major pieces really are. I'd put it in four major buckets. Obviously, we have the rest of the year segment operating profit. It's a little less than $4 billion or so.\nFeel pretty good about that. Consistent with the guides that we just provided and updated, we've got capital, second half capital, which is going to be a headwind of about $1.4 billion. And then we've got a working capital item that we have to kind of burn down. It's about $3.5 billion. About $2 billion of that is inventory, I'd say, split pretty evenly between Pratt & Whitney and Collins, and then $1 billion of the net contract asset liabilities, which is principally in the Raytheon segment. And that lines up to milestone payments we expect to receive in the back half of the year, as well as some international advances similar to what we had last year that would occur late in the fourth quarter. The rest of the puts and takes are really the things we've talked about: pension, taxes, interest, and other.\nThe net of that is about $0.5 billion of an outflow in the second half. So again, same profile we were staring at 35, 45 days ago. You know, we've layered in the Pratt & Whitney impact. You know, I think that mostly will impact working capital. It may have some CapEx as well.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Kristine.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYou know, for the Pratt & Whitney issue, it seems like the free cash flow impact in 2024, 2025 is still a little bit unclear. How should we think about how this affects your 2025 free cash flow outlook of $9 billion? Is that still the number you're reiterating or should we think about potential downside risks?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nHey, good morning, Kristine. I'll take that to start. I mean, clearly, all things equal, the issue we just talked about is going to put some pressure on Pratt & Whitney margins. It would put pressure on cash. I think it's too early to put a number on that. We're going to need some time to go through and understand what's the work scope, how does that intersect with already planned work scope, and the profile of those shop visits? And of course, you know, we're always focused on trying to drive more out of our businesses, and we would do the same here. So I think I'll leave it at that. We will come back to you over the next couple of months with more detail. Greg?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, just maybe the way to think about this is so we're going to pull 200 engines back this year. A bunch of those are going to come back anyways, and then next year it's another 1,000 and a bunch of those are already planned. Having said that, though, we know right now we've got 13 MRO facilities we're going to have to go up. Our plan was to go to 19. We're going to have to accelerate some of the tooling that's contemplated in this CAP. We're going to have to dedicate some spares to a rotable pool of engines to support some customers. Those things again will be behind us, I would say probably by the middle of next year.\nIn terms of the cash outflows associated with that, the big question in everybody's mind will be what are we going to have to do in terms of compensation to the airlines. We have contracts, special support agreements that are out there. So we'll work through that, but it's going to take time. I guess the main point though is by the end of next year, this inspection program will be almost all complete, and the 2025 Outlook really shouldn't be impacted other than, as Neil said, potential margin impact as some of these costs roll through the GTF support contracts. But again, it's, you know, we've got two years to work through that, and we will figure that out. But in terms of the cash, really probably not a big difference as you get out to 2025.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks very much, and good morning. Wanted to ask a question about the Raytheon business. It looks like, and I want to make sure I've got the right recast numbers here, but it looks like first half to second half kind of only kind of a modest, you know, sales. Increase expected, but fairly healthy profit increase.\nTo get to the 150 of profit growth at midpoint. So I guess if you could talk a little bit about what gives you confidence in that, especially in light of the option exercise you mentioned. Then also I thought there was. Pretty good top line momentum at RMD. In the quarter and, you know, the degree to which you do or don't expect that to continue in the second half.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nHey Seth. This is Chris. When you look at RMD, we'll break it down into the pieces of the new Raytheon segment. When you look at RMD, we start to see some positive momentum in particular around material growth, right about 14% year.-over-year material growth.\nThe kit fill rates that we've talked about for some time, that were hovering in those mid- to low 50s, we're up into the mid-70s. So we're starting to see material flow, which is a big part of the continued productivity story at RMD. At RIS, I would say again, less material intensive but very good material flow in kit fill rates. The issue that we're continuing to grapple with there are the fixed price development contracts that we've got. We've mentioned before, we've got a handful of fixed price development contracts that are technologically very complex that we continue to work our way through. We believe we'll make significant progress on those here in 2023 and into early 2024. But overall, again seeing, seeing positive momentum on the productivity front at Raytheon.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks, Chris. Let me add a couple of comments here too regarding productivity. You know, I think the first half of the year was encouraging in some regards. We turned the corner a bit, I think on a year-over-year basis for the first half of the new combined business. We're essentially flat year-over-year. We are expecting about $100 million of productivity step up in the second half of the year. Think about that as, I'm sorry, on a full year basis. So about $75 million or so in the second half of the year, and the material receipts is what makes us have the confidence around that path to the second half of the year.\nThe other encouraging point, I would say, is particularly at the missile business. We saw the sales tick up on that material receipt, and the mix of that material had a good drop through on it. So we're starting to see the transition of the mix of production from development. We talked about 2023 being the low point. So that's how we've calibrated this into this revised outlook. You know, we've also taken into account the first half performance as we've readjusted this realignment in the second half of the year.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nMorning, Ken.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, maybe, maybe Chris or Neil, if.\nYou can dig a little bit further into what you bucketed as the other disruptions as we think about, you know, maybe an incremental diversion of engines into the spare pool and how we think about stresses on the capacity of the network as you deal with not only the 200 this year, but the 1,000 next year. Within that other bucket, where do you see sort of the primary risks or maybe the greatest unknowns as you think about the potential eventual impact on cash?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, yeah, Ken, thanks. This is Chris.\nI'll start it. You know, as we kind of noted up front, there are a number of variables that are going into the fleet impact both this year and next work scope, making sure we define that the work scope for these inspections, the turnaround time, trying to get the turnaround time and do this work as quickly and efficiently as possible, making it into a project visit to the extent that we can, and then optimizing the network capacity.\nYou just heard Greg say we've got.\nto 13 shops across our network today. We're adding more shops, but how do we go and optimize that network? Because obviously we've got WIP today. As you know, as we're trying to increase output on the GTF MRO, we've got to make sure that we're inducting the right engines at the right time and making sure that we can do this, I'll call it new work, new inspection work, separate and apart to the extent that we can from the ongoing MRO work.\nAll of that, I'll call it. Optimization formula.\nis still being developed, and we're going to need a little bit more time on that. In terms of the other disruptions, Greg mentioned some of them. But again, we're going to be looking at our network where all of our work is done to try to minimize any disruption on other program, more mature programs perhaps, that are going through the MRO cycle. Again, how do we make sure that those continue to flow uninterrupted while we do this work? Those are the types of things we're continuing to work through.\n\nKen Herbert\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning, everybody.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Jason.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning. You talked a little bit about the.\nCold capacity and MRO. Can you talk a little bit about the capacity for the part itself, the internal, you know, manufacturing capability that you have there, and whether this is another potential constraint for you all on the GTF?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, yeah, thanks, Jason. This is Chris.\nYou know, Greg mentioned up front that we've had this enhanced inspection technique in place for some time and been doing these inspections on the V2500 in particular. We've had, I think, Greg, you said almost 3,000 of those inspections. I will tell you that the fallout rate from that on this part has been very, very low. So at this particular time, Jason, we don't believe that the HPT will be the limiting factor, if you will, in terms of the turnaround time and our ability to work through this as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nIf you were to go in. Do one of these inspections today, do you have a sense of, are we talking about weeks or days or months to do this inspection?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, so we're talking HPT disks, Jason. And so, you know, that particular module, you can't necessarily do that. You know, on wing, you've got to take the engine off wing, you've got to, you know, disassemble the engine to get to that, you know, particular area. Unfortunately, based on the geometry and location of the part, you do have to, you know, remove the part to do this, enhance inspection capability, reassemble, and then get it back out to the fleet. So I think I mentioned before, we're trying to turn this into, as best we can, what we would call a project visit. Not a full interval shop visit, but that work is still underway, obviously, making sure the wing to wing turnaround time is as short as possible. And doing what we need to do is an important element of understanding the fleet impact.\nWhat we need to do from a network perspective.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nIs there any silver lining to this at all in the sense that you mentioned optimization on how you're going to deal with these visits and these inspections? Is there an opportunity here to get through some of this durability swap outs that you need to do anyway so that you can kind of kill two birds with one stone, so to speak, as you do these inspections?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah. So when you think about that 2024 shop visit population, we're going to again take a look at the utilization on those, the cycle time on those engines, and in working with our customers, make a decision, a mutual decision, on is this the right candidate for a project visit or should that work scope increase to take on additional work which will benefit the time on wing and the interval of that engine moving forward several years?\nThat is a decision, that is a conversation that we will have once we better understand again how many of these visits are truly incremental in 2024, and then the related fleet impacts, as you know, Jason. That is a part of the equation.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nAnd then lastly, do you think you're going to learn enough by the time we have the October earnings call to provide us a little bit more clarity on things? Or do you think this is going to be a discovery process that takes us out, you know, a number of months into the end of the year?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nYou know, Jason, we're discovering something new every day here. So I think all I would tell you is that over the next, I would say six weeks, as we finalize the inspection protocols, as we finalize the turn times and work with our customers, keep in mind, we're trying to get the first 200 engines back by the middle of September.\nSo I think by the middle of September, we'll have a much better feel for what is involved here and we'll have an opportunity to update everybody around that time. I think by the time we get to October, obviously we'll know even more as we go through some of the initial inspections. So this is a learning process. We understand what it takes to inspect. We understand what it takes in terms of the inductions and the processes. And unless there is some surprise, I think we can have this pretty well bounded in terms of what the cost impact is, in terms of what the cash flow impact is. And so by the time we get to third quarter call, obviously we'll have a hell of a lot more knowledge than we do sitting here today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of TD Cowen.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thank you so much for taking the call. So by my calculations, you delivered something like 1,600 GTFs by the middle of 2021. So how do we get to 1,200 engines? I mean, are we sure that's the number? Could it be a larger number? And is this just related to the PW1000 or does it also include impact of these?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX",
    "content2": "Yeah, so let me start maybe with the second part first. Cai, our current assessment is that we don't expect the same type of impact on the V2500. It has had an enhanced inspection fleet plan and management plan in place for some time. And as I noted, and as Greg noted, we've completed a significant number of those inspections thus far and feel comfortable that this can be managed at this point within the existing shop visit forecast. Greg noted, we're still going through that analysis. It'll take us, you know, into August to finalize that, but that's our current expectation. Same on the other, you know, NEO applications. There are different characteristics and attributes on those engines, whether it be stress on the part, whether it be thrust that we believe differentiates it from the 1100 and such.\nOur current assessment is those can be managed within the existing shop visit forecast that we have for 2024 in terms of the population. Guy, you heard Greg talk about when we bounded the material, the potentially contaminated material, we put in place the enhanced.\nProcesses for powdered metal at that time and also put in the enhanced inspection techniques that we've talked about. Many of the engines that have come off, all the engines that have come off since that time have gone through this inspection and have been a part of what we would call this better powder processing, you know, regime. So ultimately we will inspect parts when they come in for their normal shop visit down, you know, on down the line. Kai, as you know, these engines will come back in for shop visits and we will inspect this and among other things during that time. What we're talking about right now are those that we need to accelerate the shop visit for; again, that's based on all the variables that we talked about.\nSo we feel confident that as part of the Safety Management Board that Pratt & Whitney has, that we've got the right population and the right plan in place.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. Just one quick follow on. You know, we've hit on all the negatives, but you just got this announcement of this $2.9 billion potential AMRAAM order from Germany. Can you give us some color on your munitions outlook? I mean, in the out years, is that substantially better?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, Cai, it's nice to talk about something other than GTF, but, yeah, look, this AMRAAM order is an order that will be for both Germany, really, for all of the NATO countries, will also benefit Ukraine. And I would tell you that is on top of what we expect to see is a relatively large order for GEM-T missiles associated with the Patriot air defense system. We, you know, we have orders there from Saudi Arabia. We have orders coming from NATO. I think in the back half of the year, you're going to see significant, we're planning significant order intake on both AMRAAM and GEM-T, as well as, of course, Excalibur. We got, as Neil mentioned, we got the Javelin order, we had the Stinger order already. Those, those orders will continue to grow.\nI'll tell you right now, we still have only seen $2 billion of orders associated specifically with Ukraine replenishment. We think there's probably another $2.5 billion coming in the next 12 months associated with just the Ukraine replenishment on top of the GEM-Ts. And the GEM-Ts, again, they'll go to Germany, they'll go to Poland. They'll go to all 18 of those countries that are currently operating Patriots. So I think that's a, a very positive sign and that's why we're so bullish on the defense outlook for the next couple of years.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research for Aerospace and Defense, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning.\nSorry, back to the GTF.\nSorry. I just wanted to ask you about how.\nClosely coordinated you are at this point with the regulatory bodies with regard to this? Have they kind of signed off on your plan, or is there any risk here of potentially the population or the timeline of these inspections getting accelerated?\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah. Thanks, David. This is Chris.\nI would say all of this has been very closely coordinated with the FAA. I think you heard me up front talk about that. This will come in the form of a service bulletin that Pratt & Whitney will publish and then likely an AD that the FAA will distribute. But our safety management process, whether it be through events that happen in the field, things that we find through our, you know, continuous surveillance process, or, you know, recommendations and assessment like this, are always very closely coordinated with the FAA and then of course, with the other, you know, international regulatory bodies as well. FAA, of course.\nIs where we start. But we, of course, continue to coordinate with the FAA and those other international bodies, but bottom line, very closely coordinated with them.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research for Aerospace and Defense, Barclays\n\nOkay, and a quick follow-up. You keep mentioning fallout rate, low fallout rate. I assume that is where you actually have to replace the high-pressure turbine disk. What exactly have you assumed in terms of a fallout rate?\nAnd I guess given it sounds like the inspection here is pretty involved, how much more involved would it be and costly to be to actually replace a high-pressure turbine blades versus just the inspection or dis. Sorry.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, so you're absolutely right. That's what fallout rate means. Those that we inspect and decide need to be removed and replaced. Again, our experience has been that's been very, very low. If, of course, we had.\nTo replace the turbine disc, then we'd factor that into the turnaround time. And that will of course potentially add some time to the process. But as of now, again, David, our assumption, and we're continuing to work through that and through the month of August here, but our assumption based on everything that we've seen thus far, is that the fallout rate will be very low. And that's what's embedded in our assumptions today.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nAnd David, keep in mind, in order to do the inspection, as Chris said, we literally have to pull the high-pressure turbine disk off of the engine and put it through this inspection protocol. Now, whether we put that disk back on or a brand new one, it's not a significant impact. And again, with a very, very low expected fallout ratio, of all the things I worry about, that would be low on the list. We have plenty of capacity for turbine disk out of Columbus, especially given what we expect to be a very small number of replacements.\nSo. That is, I would say, the most manageable portion of this.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research for Aerospace and Defense, Barclays\n\nGot it. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGood morning, Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOn the powdered metal, are you able to bound at this point whether you expect the free cash impact next year to be larger or smaller than this year? And then, also following up on the Raytheon defense margins, can you, can you just spend another minute on the fixed-price development programs you're citing? Which ones are they, when do they move out of the development phase, and how do they play into the multi-year margin expansion you're expecting?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nSure, yeah. First of all, on the free cash flow. Again, no, I hate to keep saying this, but we really need a little bit more time to put a finer point on our estimates. We will come back to you on that part as it relates to 2024 and beyond. But I think we've talked at length about what the considerations are there and how we'll be thinking about that and that there is a possibility that, you know, some of these shop visits are already planned and there'll be, you know, effects, you know, that counterbalance some of this in the out year. So more to come on that front on the defense margins. You'll recall back in Paris, I talked about $40 to $50 million of headwinds we expected from the RIS business.\nThat happened just as we expected as we closed out the quarter. It's literally a few contracts, you know. I'd say most of them are classified. So hard to get into the names, the duration, you know. I'd say the most, you know, the period of time that we're looking at probably 18 to 24 months before those programs are fully behind us. We're in the test phase. We're obviously learning through that phase. But I think we have a little bit longer to go here. I think we've got it calibrated in the second half of our year outlook. But you know, all the right resources are on it. And like I said, absent that, you know, we are seeing productivity turn in the rest of the business. So it really is a focused set of programs that we're dealing with.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nWelcome.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nOkay, thanks everybody for listening in. I just, you know, just to put all this in perspective, I think you need to keep in mind we have very strong franchises between Collins, Raytheon, and Pratt & Whitney and the $185 billion of backlog. I know this GTF issue, this quality issue is a bit of a surprise. We have been working it for the last, I would say 10 days or so. We will know a lot more in the next six weeks, and as the information becomes available, we will of course be sharing it with investors. But again, keep in mind, this is a small piece of what is a great franchise across RTX. Having said that, Jennifer and her team are obviously going to be available the next couple of days to answer any follow up questions that you have.\nThank you all for listening and take care. Bye bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThis now concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.\nGood day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the RTX second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. My name is Lateef, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Calio, President and Chief Operating Officer, Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer, and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from RTX website at www.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations excluding acquisition, accounting adjustments, and net non-recurring and/or significant items, often referred to by management as other significant items. The Company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations, and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. RTX SEC filings, including its forms 8K, 10Q, and 10K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself your first round to one question per caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. To ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone.\nYou may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits. With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone. It was another strong quarter for RTX with continued strength across all of our end markets. On the commercial aerospace side industry-wide, we saw 1,200 new orders announced around the Paris Air Show. This is the largest number of orders in the history of the Air Show, as airlines look to secure production slots well into the next decade.\nGlobal commercial air traffic remains on track with our projections, with a very robust summer travel season driven by incredibly strong consumer demand. This dynamic is supporting strength in the aftermarket and growth across the globe, with Revenue Passenger Kilometers now tracking at about 95% of 2019 levels, and long-haul international, which has lagged in the recovery, is showing strong growth with passenger flight hours up 18 points year-over-year, a good indicator of increasing demand for widebody travel.\nTurning to Defense, we're pleased that the House Defense appropriation bill fully funds many of our programs, including importantly the F135 engine core upgrade, which is the only engine funded for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Additionally, the bill also recommends the full budget request for other key RTX programs such as LTAMDS, LRSO hypersonics, and Standard Missile-3.\nInternationally, we saw the State Department approve a large sale of advanced air defense systems for Poland as it bolsters its security amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This would expand our existing partnership with Poland and make Poland the first international customer for our LTAMDS system, representing a key transition for this next-generation Raytheon franchise.\nBefore we get into details of the quarter, as you saw in our press release this morning, we are working through an issue resulting from a rare condition in Powdered Metal that will require Pratt & Whitney to remove some engines from service for inspection earlier than expected. I want to make just a couple of comments here at the outset. First of all, it's important to know that we understand the issue and we have begun to address it through an inspection protocol that we already have in place. That said, clearly this will have an impact on Pratt & Whitney and our customers. Chris and Neil provide additional color later in the call on how we're going to address the issue as well as the operational and financial impacts. As you'd expect, we'll dedicate all the necessary resources to manage this.\nNow let's turn to Slide 2 to go through some key highlights from the quarter.\nQ2 was another strong quarter of strong demand in both the commercial and defense segments of our business. With $25 billion of new orders, this brings our total backlog to a record $185 billion. On the commercial side, Collins continues to convert its industry-leading portfolio into solid order strength. As I mentioned industry-wide, there were about 1,200 new aircraft orders announced in Paris. The aggregate amount of Collins and Pratt & Whitney content on those aircraft will be about $20 billion for the life of the programs. On the defense side across the RTX businesses, we captured $13 billion in new bookings in the quarter, driving a strong book-to-bill of 1.2, and this takes our defense backlog to $73 billion.\nContributing to the backlog in Q2 were a number of significant awards including $2 billion at Pratt & Whitney for Lot 17 of the F135 engines and $1.5 billion for F117 sustainment. The Raytheon segment was awarded its largest ever AMRAAM contract for $1.2 billion from the US Air Force and international partners, including Ukraine. The AMRAAMs will work in concert with their existing NASAMS batteries to help protect the Ukrainian people.\nEarlier this month we executed the business realignment. We are now officially operating as three business units. Our team has done a tremendous job in a relatively short period of time shifting roughly $3 billion of sales and thousands of employees across our portfolio to better meet the evolving needs of our customers. Of course, our transformation isn't done. We will continue to develop initiatives to better leverage our scale and breadth and to enable operational excellence and a best in class cost structure.\nFinally, as many of you saw last week, we agreed to divest Collins' actuation business to Safran. We expect this deal to close in H2 2024, with proceeds from the transaction will be about $1.8 billion.\nWith respect to our full year outlook, we're going to raise the top line to reflect the strength we're seeing in our end markets. The new range will be $73 to 74 billion, and we're also going to bring up the bottom end of our Adjusted EPS range by $0.05 to $4.95 to $5.05. However, we are going to reduce our 2023 cash flow expectations by $500 million to $4.3 billion. This is primarily to reflect the developments at Pratt & Whitney that I discussed earlier. So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through our financial results in more detail.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nNeil, thanks, Greg. Let's look at Q2 results on slide 3. As Greg noted, we had another solid quarter with sales of $18.3 billion, up a strong 13% organically versus the prior year with growth across all four of our segments. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.29 was up 11% year-over-year with strong adjusted segment operating profit growth of 26%, partially offset by lower pension income and a higher effective tax rate. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.90 per share and included $0.26 of acquisition accounting adjustments, an $0.08 charge related to an airline customer insolvency, and $0.05 of restructuring and segment and portfolio transformation costs.\nFree cash flow of $193 million was generally in line with what we discussed when we were together in Paris last month. Finally on the capital allocation front, we repurchased $596 million in shares, putting us at about $1.2 billion year to date on track for $3 billion in share repurchases for the full year. Let's turn to Slide 4 to get into the Q2 segment. Results.\nBeginning with RMD, sales were $4 billion in the quarter, up 12% on an adjusted basis and 13% organically, primarily driven by higher volume from air power, advanced technology, and land warfare and air defense programs. Adjusted operating profit of $427 million was up $79 million versus the prior year driven by favorable net program efficiencies and drop through on higher volume partially offset by unfavorable mix resulting from early stage production programs. RMD had $3.6 billion of bookings in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92 and a backlog of $35 billion. In addition to the AMRAAM award that Greg mentioned earlier, RMD also received a $265 million award for Javelin and a $251 million award for AIM-9X missiles. Year to date RMD has a book-to-bill of 1.17.\nShifting to Raytheon on Slide 5, sales of $3.7 billion were up 2% versus the prior year on an adjusted and organic basis. This was driven by higher revenue from sensing and effects and as well as cyber and services programs, which was partially offset by lower sales from command, control, and communications programs. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $297 million was down $18 million versus prior year primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher operating expenses, which more than offset improved productivity and drop through on higher volume. However, as I mentioned in June, we still saw unfavorable productivity in the quarter due to a handful of fixed-price development programs in the quarter. Raytheon had $3.1 billion of bookings, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.96 and a backlog of $17 billion.\nBookings in Q2 at Raytheon's included about $1.1 billion in classified awards and $322 million for federal and civil cyber defense services. On a year-to-date basis, Raytheon has a Book-to-Bill of 1.15.\nTurning to Collins on slide 6, sales were $5.9 billion in the quarter, up 17% on an adjusted and organic basis driven primarily by strong demand across commercial aerospace end markets, which resulted in higher flight hours and higher OE production rates by channel. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 29% driven by a 68% increase in provisioning and a 28% increase in parts and repair, while modifications and upgrades were up 9% organically in the quarter. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 7% on the commercial OE side. Commercial OE sales were up 14% versus the prior year, which included growth in widebody, narrow body, and business jets. Military sales were up 5% due to higher development volume.\nAdjusted operating profit of $837 million was up 220 million or 36% from the prior year, with drop through on higher sales volume and favorable mix, which more than offset higher production costs, as well as higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Turning to Pratt & Whitney on slide 7, sales of $5.7 billion were up 15% on an adjusted and organic basis, with sales growth across the commercial segments partially offset by lower military volume. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 26% in the quarter due to higher shop visit volume and content in both large commercial engine and Pratt & Whitney Canada businesses. Commercial OE sales were up 22% in the quarter on higher engine deliveries and favorable mix, and in the military business sales were down 3%.\nThe decline in sales was driven by the timing of the F135 production contract award in the prior year, which was partially offset by higher F135 sustainment volume. This year, adjusted operating profit of $436 million was up $133 million from prior year, with drop through on higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable large commercial OE mix partially offset by higher production costs and higher R&D expenses. Note that both this quarter and the prior year quarter had a similar sized contract benefit of roughly $60 million. With that, before we get into the updated outlook for 2023, let me turn it over to Chris to give some additional color on the Pratt & Whitney fleet.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nOkay, thanks Neil. Let me share with you what I can at this point about the Pratt & Whitney matter. As you heard from Greg, Pratt & Whitney previously. Determined that a rare condition in powdered metal used to manufacture certain engine parts.May reduce the life of those parts.\nNow, it's important to note up front that the current production of powdered metal parts is not impacted, and Pratt & Whitney will continue to deliver both new engines and new spare parts across all product lines. I'll come back to that in a minute. As a result of this rare condition powdered metal, Pratt & Whitney instituted enhanced inspections to be performed at scheduled shop visits. However, based on very recent learnings from these inspections, Pratt & Whitney has now determined that the timing of these shop visits needs to be accelerated. While powdered metal parts have been widely used throughout Pratt & Whitney's product lines for decades, Pratt & Whitney has bounded the potentially impacted material. It is concluded that this condition was present in rare instances in powdered metal produced from approximately Q4 2015 into Q3 2021.\nThe PW1100 engine fleet which powers the A320neo will experience the most significant impact due to production volumes during this period. Based on the current assessment Pratt & Whitney anticipates by mid-September that approximately 200 PW1100 engines will be removed for enhanced inspection beyond the initial 200 engines. Pratt & Whitney also anticipates that approximately 1,000 additional PW1100 engines will need to be removed from the operating fleet for this inspection within the next nine to 12 months for the exact number of engines, and the timing of those removals is not yet finalized. Now, it's important to note that some of the engines that must be removed for inspection in 2023 and 2024 are already forecasted for a regular shop visit during this time period, and so the incremental impact of the fleet is still under evaluation.\nCapability to perform the accelerated inspections, which are focused on the high-pressure turbine discs, is already in place, and Pratt & Whitney is developing plans to optimize shop visit capacity within its network to complete these inspections as quickly and efficiently as possible. As I said earlier, current production of powdered metal parts is not impacted, and Pratt & Whitney will continue to deliver both new engines and new spare parts across all product lines. This is a result of the combination of extensive improvements that were made to our powder processing to remove possible contamination sources and the deployment of enhanced inspections for improved detection. Pratt & Whitney is also analyzing any potential impact to other parts of its fleet, but the current expectation is that they will be less impacted based upon existing inspections, utilization profiles, and maintenance intervals.\nLet me take a moment to explain the timing of these developments. We proactively monitor the performance of our.Engines throughout their life cycle.\nIt's foundational to how we maintain and manage the safe operation of our fleet. We do this in a number of ways, analyzing large amounts of data generated during operation, inspecting parts and MRO, destructively testing certain parts to analyze their material properties, and characterizing what we observe. We use learnings from this proactive monitoring to inform our predictive models so we can address any issues before they appear on our fleet. In this case, as Pratt & Whitney analyzed some recent inspection findings, it determined the need for an accelerated inspection plan, even though the fallout rate from these inspections is expected to be very low.\nThe next step is for Pratt & Whitney to.\nPublish a Service Bulletin describing the inspections, and the FAA will likely follow up with an Airworthiness Directive. The financial impact associated with these removals is still being analyzed and will depend on a number of factors, including the result of the inspections, the amount of work needed to be done in our network shops, and of course, the impact on our customers. This is obviously a difficult situation for our customers, especially given the strong demand for travel. We're truly sorry for the impact of this disruption, and we will do all we can to support our customers. Safety always has been and always will be our number one priority, and we will never compromise on ensuring the safe operation of our fleet. We will of course continue to keep you apprised as our analysis progresses on both the operational and financial impacts of.hese accelerated shop visits.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Neil to talk about how this impacts our 2023 outlook.\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nThanks Chris. Let's start with the segment outlook. As Chris mentioned, there continue to be a number of evolving assumptions around the financials of Pratt & Whitney. Let me try to put some additional color around that. Starting with the top line, commercial aftermarket demand remains strong, and we are continuing to ramp production. Because of this, we are confident in our prior sales range of low- to mid-teens. On the profit side, given the strong first half results and continued top line growth, we still expect between $200 and 275 million of operating profit growth for the year. Within that outlook for Pratt & Whitney, here's what we are assuming as it relates to the increased engine removals and inspections. Given Pratt & Whitney's results to date and aftermarket strength, the impact for the first 200 engines is contemplated within the range we just provided.\nKeep in mind, given the percentage of completion accounting for the aftermarket contracts and the relatively early life of the programs, the P&L impact will be less significant today. However, for the reasons Chris described, the impact of any further engine removals from service for inspection is not currently assumed in our outlook. So, moving to Collins, given the strong results in the first half and the continued strength we are seeing in commercial aftermarket, we are increasing the full year sales range from up low double digits to a new range of up low double digits to low teens. As a result of this increased demand and continued execution, we now expect Collins adjusted operating profit to be up between $825 and 875 million compared to the prior range of $750 to 825 million.\nTurning to the new Raytheon segment, given the strength of the backlog and the accelerating top line, we expect sales for the combined segment to grow low to mid single digits versus 2022. While we have begun to see increased material flow and improved efficiencies, we had lower productivity than we expected in H1, including costs associated with fixed price development programs. Similar to Q1, we anticipate another contract option exercise that will lead to a headwind in Q3. With all that said, we're expecting continued volume growth and H2 productivity improvements. Altogether we see adjusted operating profit up between $125 and 175 million versus prior year. Now let me summarize all this at the RTX level.\nAs Greg mentioned, we're increasing our full-year RTX sales outlook to $73 to 74 billion, which translates to organic growth of between 9% and 10%. This is up from our prior outlook of $72 to 73 billion. With respect to earnings, we are tightening our adjusted earnings per share range by $0.05 on the bottom end and now expect Adjusted EPS of between $4.95 and $5.05 given the first half results and some improvement in below the line items. We provided an update on those below the line items in the appendices. Turning to free cash flow, the impact of the Pratt & Whitney matter will be more meaningful on cash flow as we begin to ramp up inspections and MRO activity this year. As a result, we now see free cash flow of approximately $4.3 billion for the year, about $500 million below our prior outlook.\nAnd finally, we'll transition to the new segment reporting here in the third quarter. We provided the recast 2022 and 2023 quarterly financials in the appendices. So with that, let me turn it over to Greg for some closing remarks.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nOkay, thanks Neil. So just some closing thoughts before we get to the Q&A. We obviously had a very strong Q2 with $25 billion in new orders, which brings our backlog to a record $185 billion. Sales were also very strong with 13% organic revenue growth. This strength in sales and orders reflects the strength in both our commercial aero and defense markets. RPMs are on track to return to pre-COVID levels as we exit 2023. Military spending globally continues to increase in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine and the emerging threats in the Indo-PACOM theater. Based on the continued strength in our markets, we are well positioned to deliver on our commitments for 2023 and beyond. With that, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nIn the interest of time and to allow for broader participation, you are asked to limit yourself to one question. To ask a question, you will need to press Star one one on your telephone.\nOur first question. Comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThanks so much. Good morning.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nRob.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nLet's start with the GTF, shall we?By my count, this is the third issue you're dealing with at the moment. You have that quality escape noted at Paris.\nThe ongoing time on wing issues in these challenging environments. And now the metal problem. Is there a root problem or cause that's linking these issues? And are you concerned about the potential impact on Pratt & Whitney's reputation for reliability? Thank you.\n\nChris Calio\n\nPresident and COO, RTX\n\nYeah, thanks, Rob. This is Chris. I'll start.\nObviously, this is a disappointing development and will impact our customers. Let me just sort of take a step back and kind of walk you through sort of the processes that are in place across Pratt & Whitney. It's got a strong process of fleet surveillance, evaluation, and taking corrective action that is used to support the safety of the fleet. In this particular case, you know, the process worked. But I will tell you that again, we continue to monitor the situation with the fleet. We continue to find learnings in the fleet and then we take those actions and update our models and correct them. But if you step back, this is not a GTF, you know, design issue. This is a manufacturing process issue. In our powdered metal.\nWe very quickly went and enhanced those processes to make sure this doesn't happen again and put in place the enhanced inspection techniques to make sure that we can continue to find this and address them, you know, promptly. So we're taking prompt action right now. We've got to now work through how we define the work scope and the turnaround time that's required and, of course, do all the impact to the fleet.\nThat's going to be required.\nAgain, we talked about in the comments up front. GTF is going to have a lot of shop visits here in the back half of 2023 and into 2024. We need to figure out how many of those are incremental and what the true impact of the fleet is. But that's ongoing. But again, we're going to continue to invest in the GTF and the durability improvements that Shane talked about at Investor Day in June. And of course, the GTF Advantage, we will work through this difficult time, but again, we continue to believe in the GTF, its architecture, and its future.\n\nRobert Stallard\n\nPartner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay, thanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, Neil. I'm trying to understand the scaling of the $500 million lower free cash flow to the total population of engines that you're going to be removing and inspecting. I think you said that the 200, the first 200, are encompassed in the guidance, but it wasn't clear if that.\nWas just the segment profit guidance we were talking about. Also, obviously, this is lingering into. 2024 to get that whole 1,200 population.So, should we think about a similar size cash impact in 2024?\n\nNeil Mitchill\n\nCFO, RTX\n\nGot it. Let me start with what I can tell you now first, you know. Let me remind you it's very early in this process. We have begun to investigate what the costs and the work scope and the timing might be. But there'll be some learnings over the next 30 to 60 days, and we'll certainly come back and talk to you a little bit about that. You know, to think about the guidance, the comment I made with respect to the Pratt & Whitney guidance. You know, again, we had a first half that was very strong at Pratt & Whitney. I think we're well on track for the year, all else equal, but a couple of dynamics that will likely keep the P&L impact.\nAssociated with the 200 accelerated inspections manageable for the year. First, we've talked about 85% of this fleet is under a long-term contract and we're less than 5% complete on those programs on average. And so as Chris just mentioned, we don't know exactly how many, but some of those 200 are already scheduled for a visit this year. So when we think about those two things, that sort of helps us bound what the impact would be for this year with respect to that population.\nGiven the thousand and the fact that a number of those are also already scheduled for a shop visit. We still need some more time to go think through that as it relates to the cash flow. Similar train of thought there. We really do need a little bit more time to go through this, but we put a risk into our outlook because we know that we'll have some calls on cash over the rest of the year. I would say there's two things that are impacting the cash flow. The first is what I'd call the direct impact, and the second is what I'd call the indirect.\nOn the direct side, it's really going to be things like accelerated capital, some inventory to get ready for these inspections, expenses associated with the work that we'll start to perform during the, you know, last quarter of the year, and then obviously customer disruption. So more to go there indirectly. You know, there's other work that this may disrupt in our, in our business. And so we're contemplating some of that as we look at this year. I think it's a bit too early to kind of extrapolate that out to 2024 and 2025. Certainly we'll come back over the next couple of months and provide a better update.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nCan you clarify if the powder metal? Supplier is internal to you?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nIt is. Myles is Greg. Yes.\nSo we actually manufacture the powder at our facility in New York. That powder is then processed down at our Columbus, Georgia forge into a number of different parts. The parts we're talking about here are turbine discs, but they are all internally manufactured with a proprietary powder.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question. Comes from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning. Question for you, Greg.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nRight.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Bank of America\n\nAnd then, kind of getting back to Rob's question. When you look at the litany of issues that have happened here with this engine, everything, you know, from hot section issues, manufacturing issues.\nDo you have a cultural issue in your engineering workforce? Are people not talking to each other? And, I mean, it also begs the question, how could you guys possibly not know about this at Paris when you did this major investor event? So can you just give us all some insight into how people are communicating and what's going on in your engineering workforce?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah. You know, Ron, we should differentiate between the durability issues that Shane talked about, and I call this the manufacturing quality issue. Let's just take a step back, right? This is. This is an issue that we first uncovered back in 2020 when we had an incident with the V2500 turbine disk. As a result of that investigation, we determined at that point that we had some contamination in this powdered metal that we make.\nIt occurred very, very rarely, but it did happen, and it actually resulted in the turbine disk failure on an airline. As a result of that, we went through and did two things. First of all, we went out and inspected the V2500 fleet. But we also went back, and we took a look at the powdered metal process to determine how this contamination happened. Through a lot of work, through a lot of discovery, we figured out what the contaminants were. And by the end of 2021, about a year after that, we were able to manufacture powder that was, I would say, contaminant free to the best of our ability. At the same time, we knew that this contamination had occurred between late 2015 and late 2020, early 2021.\nSo we knew we had a suspect population in the fleet, and we went out and so we started inspecting. We inspected the turbine disks as they were manufactured. We inspected turbine disks as they came back in, not just for the V, but for the whole GTF fleet. In fact, the entire fleet of Pratt products that were manufactured during this time frame, you know, that those inspections, and there were over 3,000 of those inspections, yielded a very, very small fallout rate, less than 1%. So, as Chris said, all of this data goes into our lifing model for the turbine disk. Based upon everything that we knew until very recently, we believe that the life of the turbine disk was such that we would see these disks in the shop and be able to inspect them before we ever had an issue.\nNow, as we again looked at the data again over the last couple of Safety Risk Assessment, our Safety Board went through their process of updating the data based on all the recent findings. They said, you know what? We're not absolutely positive that the lifing model is accurate. So we're going to take. We want to take a look at these disks at a much accelerated basis. I would tell you that is exactly the way the process is supposed to work. So we're going to pull back 200 disks or 200 engines and look at the disks here in the next 90 days or so and the next year. Based upon those findings from the first 200, we think there's probably another thousand out there. So 1,200 out of a little over 3,000 engines out there have to be inspected.\nBut this is not a manufacturer. I'm sorry, it's not a design issue. In fact, the engineers have been working on this issue hand in glove with the Safety Board and everybody else in manufacturing for the last three years. So I don't believe that we have an engineering issue. Obviously, this was a quality escape back from sometime between 2015 and 2020. We are doing, I think, exactly the right thing, which is to bring these engines back, inspect them, and ensure the safety of the fleet going forward. I think, again, it's obviously this engine, Ron, as you know, has been a challenge since we launched it back in 2015. You guys can remember talking about bowed rotors and all the other issues that we had.\nBut if you think about this engine operating at the temperatures that we do, it has been a continuous discovery. This is not one of them. This is simply a quality issue from a manufacturing problem. So I would say, look, we're on top of it. We've got this. It's going to be expensive. We're going to make the airlines whole as a result of the disruption we're going to cause them. And I think, you know, we're going to work ourselves through it. It's not an existential threat to RTX. It's not even an existential threat to Pratt & Whitney. It is a problem, and we have them every day, and we'll solve it.\n\nRonald Epstein\n\nManaging Director of Aerospace and Defense, Bank of America\n\nAll right, got it.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks, Ron.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning.\nHey, Greg, thanks. Thanks for that color there. I appreciate that. On the powdered metal, just specifically, did. You, when did you make the change? Was it kind of when, back in.2020 or 2021, just so we can have better clarity on the engines that are being delivered?\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nYeah, so it was mid to late 2021 where we changed all the processes in terms of the screening of the powdered metal to identify the contaminant, to eliminate the contaminant. You know, let's be clear. I mean, these contaminants are microscopic. Unfortunately, the original process, as we scaled up production for GTF.\nIt got away from us a little bit and we fixed it. But I would tell you everything that we have shipped, or almost everything we had shipped, I should say, in the last three years, we believe is going to be just fine. That's why we're confident we can continue to support Airbus, continue to support customers with new deliveries as well as with spares this year and next.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks, Grace.\n\nGreg Hayes\n\nChairman and CEO, RTX\n\nThanks, Peter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question. Comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you very much.\nJust on free cash flow, can we walk through the bridge? $1.2 billion of free cash flow usage in H1. $4.3 billion expectation for the year. How do you think about the biggest drivers on a segment level basis and working capital? What are your expectations for factoring for the year, whether it's a benefit or a headwind, and do we think about $500 million of Pratt & Whitney impact?",

My name is Latif, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nOn the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Calio, President and Chief Operating Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nThis call is being webcast live on the Internet, and there is a presentation available for download from Raytheon Technologies' website at www.rtx.com.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments and net nonrecurring and/or significant items, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nRaytheon Technologies SEC filings, including its forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, United Technologies Corp.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Latif, and good morning, everyone. I trust everyone has had a chance to see the press release. It was clearly a good start to the year for RTX, and demand remains strong for both our commercial aerospace and our defense businesses. And I think, importantly, we're seeing some stabilization in the supply chain.\nBefore we get to the highlights for the quarter, let me just spend a couple of minutes on the macro environment. Starting on the commercial side. Domestic revenue passenger miles are now back to pre-pandemic levels, 2019 levels, as we exit March. This was led by a very strong rebound in China following their zero COVID policy reversal.\nOn the international front, we have seen continued improvement in RPMs, reaching nearly 80% of 2019 levels. With strong consumer demand and record advanced bookings, we expect total global air traffic to fully recover to 2019 levels as we exit the year.\nOn the defense side, we're very encouraged by the President's most recent fiscal year '24 budget request of $886 billion. That's up about 3%. And that's on top of last year's nearly 10% top line budget increase. The proposed budget includes broad-based support for many of our key programs, technologies and capabilities, including a request to fund multiyear munitions purchases or AMRAAM. It also prioritizes HACM, that's the hypersonic attack cruise missile, as the future long-range hypersonic missile. And perhaps most importantly for us, the budget reflects the DoD's decision to move forward with the engine core upgrade for the F135 engine, which we believe is a win for both the war fighter and the taxpayer. This program will solidify Pratt & Whitney's position on the F-35 and will provide additional thrust, range and efficiency necessary to support the needs of the war fighter well into the next decade.\nLooking internationally, we're also seeing strong demand for defense capabilities as our allies prioritize additional defense spending. Poland recently announced plans to spend 4% of their GDP on defense this year. That's the highest level across all of the NATO countries. And we continue to support Ukraine's ongoing needs, including the Pentagon's accelerated deployment of the Patriot Missile Defense System, adding another RTX capability to the Ukraine mission.\nClearly, the demand environment remains strong across our end markets. And with that as a backdrop, let's turn to Slide 2 for the Q1 highlights. Importantly, we exited the quarter with a record backlog of $180 billion. This included over $20 billion of new awards from some of our key franchises in the quarter.\nAs an example, RMD received a $1.2 billion award for Patriot for Switzerland. That marks the 18th Patriot partner nation. RIS was awarded $1.9 billion in classified awards. We also delivered solid financial performance with strong year-over-year organic sales growth of 10% and adjusted EPS of $1.22.\nRegarding free cash flow, we started the year slowly due to some timings of higher working capital, which Neil will talk to you about in a bit. Importantly, though, we remain confident in our full year outlook of about $4.8 billion of free cash flow. As expected, sales growth was led by commercial aerospace, with aftermarket up close to 20% and OEM shipments up close to 17% year-over-year.\nAdditionally, in the quarter, we achieved an incremental $50 million of gross merger cost synergies, and we are quickly approaching the $1.5 billion target, with more opportunities still ahead. On the capital allocation front, we repurchased more than $560 million of our shares in the quarter. And we remain on track for $3 billion of share repurchases for 2023. And as you saw yesterday, we increased our dividend over 7% from $0.55 to $0.59 a share, in line with our commitment to return at least $20 billion to shareowners in the 4 years following the merger.\nWe've done all this while continuing to invest in R&D, additional capacity, automation and the digitization of our production facilities in order to support our growing backlog. As you can see, we're extremely well positioned for growth this year and well into the future. Every day, we are furthering our integration to unlock the scale and breadth of RTX, all while driving additional technology synergies and a focus on operational performance.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Mr. Calio to talk about the progress we're making in regards to our business realignment. And I'll be back at the end for a wrap-up and Q&A. Chris?\n\nChristopher T. Calio\n\nPresident, Pratt & Whitney Company, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. I'm on Slide 3. As you know, we announced back in January, our plan to realign our portfolio into three business units: Collins Aerospace, Raytheon and Pratt & Whitney. And as we said, this realignment has three primary objectives. The first is to better align our market-leading franchises with our customers' priorities, ensuring more effective coordination and collaboration across our businesses. The second is to enhance our performance and capture additional synergies from both a product and technology standpoint. And third, to better leverage our resources to optimize our investments and cost structure.\nSo let me update you on where we are in the process. After continued internal analysis and customer engagement, we determined the major content shifts within our portfolio necessary to achieve these objectives. First, the multi-domain command and control solutions of RIS and RMD will transition to the Mission Systems strategic business unit within Collins to create a more focused business to support connected battle space opportunities.\nAdditionally, RIS' air traffic management business will be integrated into Collins' Connected Aviation Solutions strategic business unit, further consolidating what we call the connected ecosystem of flight data and management into one business.\nThese two moves will put Collins at the center of our company-wide collaboration efforts. They will now be responsible for more than half of our revenue synergy projects. In parallel, we will move Collins' intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business to the new Raytheon business unit, combining complementary sensing and imaging technologies to improve our offerings for multiple customer applications.\nAnd lastly, the new Raytheon business will merge the remaining RIS and RMD businesses into strategic business units aligned around specific customers, such as the Air Force, Army, Navy, Space and Missile Defense. When this is complete, the top customer of each of these strategic business units will account for 70% or more of that business unit sales.\nIn addition, we'll establish a strategic business unit that will operate like a merchant supplier within the Raytheon business unit. We'll centralize components and subsystems that are sold internally as well as to a broad array of government, commercial and other prime customers, enabling us to sell more effectively into these channels.\nAs part of this realignment, we're pleased to announce that the new Raytheon business unit will be led by Wes Kremer, currently the President of RMD. Wes has over 20 years of experience across multiple businesses and product lines within Raytheon and is uniquely qualified to lead this business.\nWe are now in the middle of the implementation phase, including our analysis and validation of targeted gross cost savings. We provide more details on the new design and the implementation status, including those savings at our investor meeting at the Paris Air Show. So overall, good progress thus far as we remain focused on our goal to operate under the new structure beginning in July.\nWith that, let's move to Slide 4, and I'll provide an update on the current environment. In general, not a lot has changed since we spoke back in January, and demand remained strong across our end markets. On events side, as Greg mentioned upfront, some of the awards we received in the quarter and our record backlog.\nOn the commercial side, we saw strong aftermarket growth in the quarter as airlines were preparing to support the busy summer travel season. With air traffic increasing and retirements remaining very low, we continue to see strength in parts, repair, provisioning and maintenance across our end markets. Given this demand, our focus remains on ensuring we have the capacity, supply chain performance and operational excellence necessary to meet our commitments to customers.\nSo let me start and provide some color on capacity. In RMD, we continue to invest in new test equipment, tooling and automation at our Tucson, Andover and Huntsville facilities to support the ramp-up on key programs such as AMRAAM, StormBreaker, SM-3, SM-6 and Patriot GEM-T.\nAt Pratt, Ashville, North Carolina turbine airfoil site, we now have 63% of machining production assets on site and are progressing towards first article inspection by the end of May on our way to improving productivity and cost in support of the high-volume GTF and F135 programs. While in Tucson, we recently completed a classified space conversion, bringing our total number of classified seats added over the past 2 years to almost 1,000, with the expectation of an additional 900 more by the end of '23. This will create the classified lab capacity for R&D to execute on recent development wins such as HACM, HALO and NGI.\nFurthermore, we are expanding our MRO network. This past quarter, two new facilities joined the GTF aftermarket network, a second MRO shop in Japan and a 155,000 square foot shop at Delta Airlines TechOps in Atlanta. We, of course, also remain very focused on the health of the supply chain, which continues to be a challenge from a performance and cost perspective.\nStarting with performance. While we have experienced stabilization in certain areas, such as electronics, we continue to experience challenges in castings, forgings, raw materials and machining. And you've heard us talk before about our in-person support embedded our supplier sites, and that continues to increase.\nToday, we are present in more than 400 suppliers, with a focus on high-impact locations. And specific to defense, we have significantly increased on-site support in the last quarter, allowing us to help clear bottlenecks, better execute engineering and quality initiatives and provide improved overall visibility. And at RMD, this helped yield a 5% improvement in material receipts year-over-year, enabling increased flow through our factories.\nAdditionally, we held an RTX supplier conference just a few weeks ago, where we engaged with about 70 key suppliers to review detailed action plans to ensure future capacity and to reduce current overdue positions. On the cost side, the overall inflation picture remains persistently high, and we are attacking those inflationary pressures from several angles.\nWe have almost 2,000 cost reduction projects ongoing related to our supply chain, both product and non-product, including negotiating better contractual terms, transitioning work to lower cost sources and part redesigns to reduce cost. We're also going deeper into our supply chain to better understand their usage of constrained raw materials, such as aluminum, titanium and nickel, so we can get a complete picture of our embedded spend and to leverage total raw material purchases, drive improved cost positions and secure supply throughout our value stream.\nAnd lastly, we continue to leverage our core operating system to execute on our cost reduction initiatives as well as footprint modernization. As we previously talked about, we have thousands of ongoing projects, many of which are at the manufacturing line or cell level to take costs out of our operations. These range from things like redesigning material, machining flow to reduce labor hours and cycle time, implementing closed door machining to enable the completion of a part in one continuous process without any operator intervention. But these are relatively small initiatives with short paybacks. They are part of a continuous commitment to improvement and efficiency.\nSo before I turn it over to Neil to recap the financials, I do want to provide a brief update on the GTF program. As you know, since the GTF program went into service in 2015, we have continued to introduce upgrades and improvements to increase reliability and durability.\nWith respect to reliability, we have met the target level for dispatch reliability. This is now at mature engine levels. With respect to durability, we have improved time on wing since program inception. Again, time on wing, meaning how long engines can be operated before needing to be removed for maintenance. But we are not yet at the level we and our customers expect. This has put stress on the operations of the fleet. We continue to develop upgrades from the current GTF configuration to improve durability. We are also expanding our MRO capacity and working to reduce shop visit turnaround times to improve service availability. It will take some time to realize these benefits, but we are continuing to invest in time on wing improvements as we were able to do over the course of the V2500 program.\nAnd of course, in parallel, we continue to execute on our GTF Advantage development program, our next-generation GTF configuration, that will incorporate all of our experiences and technical learnings since entering the service.\nOkay. With that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk through our financial results.\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nChief Financial Officer & Vice President, The Pratt & Whitney Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. I'm on Slide 5. As Greg noted, sales of $17.2 billion were up a strong 10% organically versus the prior year. This growth was driven by both commercial aerospace and defense despite some of the environmental challenges we continue to face. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 was up 6% year-over-year, with strong segment operating profit growth of 15%, partially offset by the expected lower pension income and a higher effective tax rate.\nOn a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.97 per share and included $0.25 of acquisition accounting adjustments, restructuring and nonrecurring items. And finally, free cash flow was an outflow of $1.4 billion in the first quarter, which is historically our lightest quarter of the year due to the timing of incentive compensation payments and seasonality in our defense businesses.\nIn addition to these typical dynamics, the timing of sales and cash collections as well as supply chain and capacity constraints drove higher working capital in the first quarter of this year. We expect to generate positive free cash flow beginning in the second quarter as commercial deliveries accelerate and performance as well as other funding milestones are achieved.\nAnd importantly, as Greg said, we remain confident in delivering about $4.8 billion in free cash flow for the full year. So with that, let's turn to Slide 6 and get into the segment results.\nBeginning with Collins. Sales were $5.6 billion in the quarter, up 16% on an adjusted basis and up 17% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the continued recovery in commercial aerospace end markets, resulting in higher flight hours and higher OE production rates.\nBy channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 24% on an adjusted basis and 26% organically, driven by a 43% increase in provisioning and a 29% increase in parts and repair, while modifications and upgrades were up 1% organically in the quarter. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8%. Commercial OE sales were up 12% versus the prior year, driven by production ramps in narrow-body, business jets and widebody. And military sales were up 9% due to both higher material receipts and manufacturing throughput. Adjusted operating profit of $800 million was up $216 million from the prior year, with drop-through on higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by higher production costs and higher SG&A expense. Looking ahead, on a full year basis, we continue to expect Collins' sales to grow low double digits and operating profit of between $750 million and $825 million increase versus 2022.\nTurning to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 7. Sales of $5.2 billion were up 15% on an adjusted basis and 16% on an organic basis, with sales growing across all segments. Commercial OE sales were up 27% in the quarter on higher engine deliveries within both Pratt's large commercial engine and Canada businesses.\nCommercial aftermarket sales were up 14% in the quarter, primarily driven by increased volume and favorable mix. And in the military business, sales were up 13%, driven by the F135 production contract award in the second quarter of last year and higher F135 sustainment volume. Adjusted operating profit of $434 million was up $126 million from the prior year, driven primarily by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket, favorable contract matter and higher military sales, which was partially offset by conversion on higher commercial OE volume.\nTurning to Pratt's full year outlook. We continue to expect sales to grow low to mid-teens and operating profit growth of $200 million to $275 million versus 2022.\nShifting to RI&S on Slide 8. Sales of $3.6 billion were in line with our expectations and flat versus prior year, both on an adjusted and organic basis. This was driven by lower command, control and communications programs, which was mostly offset by higher revenue from cyber and services programs.\nAdjusted operating profit in the quarter of $330 million was down $48 million versus prior year, driven primarily by lower net program efficiencies spread across several programs. RIS began the year with strong orders in the quarter of $4.3 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.34 and a backlog of over $17 billion. This brings RIS' rolling 4-quarter book-to-bill to 1.09.\nIn addition to the significant bookings Greg mentioned earlier, RIS also received a $650 million award for the next-generation jammer and a $275 million Space Development Agency award for missile tracking satellite constellation.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect RI&S' full year sales to be flat with operating profit growth of $75 million to $125 million versus 2022.\nTurning now to Slide 9. RMD sales were $3.7 billion, up 4% on an adjusted basis and up 5% organically, primarily driven by higher sales in the advanced technology and air power programs. Adjusted operating profit of $335 million was down $52 million versus the prior year, driven by the lower -- by lower net program efficiencies and higher development program mix, partially offset by higher volume.\nLower net program efficiencies included the unfavorable impact of a significant option exercise in the quarter, which had about a 100 basis point impact on the margin. Like RI&S, RMD's bookings were also very strong to start the year with $5.2 billion of bookings in the quarter, including an over $600 million SPY-6 award. This resulted in a record backlog of $35 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.43 in both the quarter as well as on a rolling 4-quarter basis.\nAnd for the full year, we continue to expect R&D sales to grow low to mid-single digits with operating profit growth between $175 million and $225 million versus 2022.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Greg to wrap things up.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, United Technologies Corp.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Neil. I'm on Slide 10 here. Just a couple of thoughts before we open it up for Q&A.\nI think first and foremost, given the strength of our backlog and the continued end market demand, we, as a team, remain extremely confident we can deliver our '23 guidance and our 2025 commitments. Our success, of course, begins with ensuring that we're meeting our customers' most critical needs. We're keeping a watchful eye on external factors. And I would tell you that Chris and the entire senior leadership team remained laser-focused on mitigating supply chain constraints and driving productivity and efficiency improvements across all of the businesses.\nMore importantly, we're continuing to invest in innovative solutions and differentiated technology that will continue to drive long-term growth. Last thought is earlier this month we marked the third anniversary of the merger. We've been able to accomplish a lot so far even with this challenging environment, and we know there's a lot more progress we can make with the ongoing business realignment, which will set up RTX for success for decades to come.\nWe look forward to sharing more of this information on our transformational efforts and our long-range outlook during our Investor Day at the Paris Air Show on June 19.\nWith that, let me open up the call for Q&A.

As you know, Chris has been our Chief Operating Officer for the last year, has been responsible for our business units as well as our operations, engineering and digital functions. Effective March 1, Chris has been elected to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of RTX. Chris has been instrumental over this past year in driving our focus on operational excellence and delivering for our customers in a very challenging environment. So welcome, Chris.\nOkay. Let's go to the webcast slide for Slide 2. We'll talk about some of the highlights for 2022. I don't have to tell anybody that '22 was an incredibly dynamic year. And I'm pleased to say that we were able to achieve, despite facing a number of significant challenges, including transitioning out of Russia, managing record levels of inflation as well as supply chain and labor constraints.\nWith all that as a backdrop, we still delivered $67.1 billion in sales for the full year, which was up 6% organically and adjusted EPS of $4.78, which was up 12% year-over-year. We also returned almost $6 billion of capital to shareowners, which included $2.8 billion of share repurchases. And more importantly, even with the $1.6 billion headwind from the R&D tax legislation, we generated $4.9 billion in free cash flow, which exceeded our expectations. At the same time, we continue to position the business for sustained profitable growth.\nIn 2022, we captured $86 billion in new bookings, resulting in backlog growth of 12%, a book-to-bill of 1.28 and a near record backlog at the end of the year of $175 billion. Additionally, we were granted over 2,600 patents last year. This places us in the top 10 of companies in the United States for the second consecutive year. While we invested $9 billion in R&D and CapEx, this allowed us to bring new technologies to our market and drive further automation and digitization through each phase of our product lifestyle from design, through development, through manufacturing and product sustainment.\nOur investment in recent awards supports our mission to create a safer and more connected world, which was especially true in 2022. Our products and technologies have been instrumental in helping the people of Ukraine defend itself. From the Stinger, Javelin and Excalibur to NASAMS and now Patriot air and missile defense system, we remain in lockstep with the U.S. government to ensure we can continue to support our allies.\nOn the commercial side of the business, we saw continued advancements on our path towards leading the future of sustainable aviation with the start of development flight testing of the GTF Advantage engine, which, as you know, further enhances the GTF's position as the leader in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions.\nImportantly, we also completed the first engine test run for our regional hybrid electric flight demonstrator. This system integrates a 1-megawatt electric motor, which was developed by Collins with a highly efficient Pratt & Whitney fuel burning engine, specifically adapted for hybrid electric operations. This new engine will reduce fuel burn and CO2 emissions by 30% compared to today's most advanced regional turboprop aircraft. These types of investments along with strong demand across both the commercial and defense end markets will position us for continued growth as we head into 2023. We're particularly proud that RTX outperformed among all companies in the Russell 1000 for local U.S. job creation in 2022. RTX leads the industry in employee giving and volunteering, which is a testament to the impact our workforce has in the communities where we work and where we live.\nBefore I turn it over to Chris, I just want to spend a minute to talk about the status of our integration and the next steps as we evolve as a pure-play aerospace and defense company. As you know, in 2020, we brought together 2 great companies, UTC Aerospace business and Raytheon. With combined strength, scale and capabilities that makes us uniquely equipped to innovate and deliver game-changing technologies and solutions for our customers. As we approach the third anniversary of this merger, we've accomplished many of our objectives, including exceeding our original synergy commitment, and we see even more opportunities ahead.\nSo today, we're starting the next step in our integration and evolution. Our plan is to streamline our structure to a customer-centric organization with 3 focus segments: Collins Aerospace, Raytheon and Pratt & Whitney. This will better align us with our customers' needs and allow us to better collaborate on next-generation technology. There's still a lot of work to be done to make this happen, but let me turn it over to Chris to give you some of the additional details of this transformation and some additional business updates. Chris?\n\nChristopher T. Calio\n\nCOO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, Greg. It's great to join today's call, and I'm looking forward to engaging more with everybody.\nStarting here on Slide 3. Over the past year, I've been focused with our team on driving operational performance and program execution as well as identifying ways to improve our cost position and to ensure alignment between our investments and our strategic priorities.\nAs Greg noted, our merger integration is nearly complete, having realized gross cost synergies of $1.4 billion. And so we are now in the process of realigning RTX into 3 business units. Let me give you some additional color around our thinking on this. At its core, this move is about enabling us to better coordinate with our customers, aligning with their needs and collaborating more effectively across our businesses, all of which is feedback we've received from our customers. All of this will ultimately enhance performance, make us even more competitive and allow us to capture additional revenue synergies in areas such as connected battle space. For example, just this past year, we were awarded a phase of the JADC2 effort known as Titan, where RIS and Collins are working together to deliver this cutting-edge solution to ensure our joint forces have one common operating picture of the battle space.\nAdditionally, this realignment will allow us to better leverage our scale so we can optimize our footprint, improve resource allocation, and reduce costs for both RTX and our customers. Now we don't have a number for you today in terms of cost savings as we are in the early stages of that analysis. But we do believe there are additional material opportunities to be realized. Connection with this reorganization, Roy Azevedo, President of our RIS business, informed us of his plan to retire. Roy will, however, stay on as an adviser over the next several months to help us with this important transformation. Sean Mural, currently the CFO of RIS has been acting President of RIS, effective February 1.\nWhile organizational changes like this are never easy, we have demonstrated our ability to successfully execute on these types of initiatives in the past. And many members of the team involved in this process have experience from our recent portfolio and merger transformations. The exact timing of this change isn't final yet, the current plans to make effective during the second half of the year. Until then, we'll manage the business under our current structure. We'll provide updates on our progress over the coming months.\nBefore I turn it over to Neil to discuss our results for the quarter and the outlook for the year, I want to turn to Slide 4 to share some of our critical assumptions for 2023 and the areas where we're focused to ensure we execute on our commitments. As Greg mentioned earlier, customer demand for our products and services continues to grow. In Commercial Aerospace, we expect global air traffic to fully recover to 2019 levels as we exit 2023 with continued strength in the U.S. and Europe. This is pretty consistent from what we're all hearing from the airlines. And like everyone else, we're keeping a close eye on China, which historically has represented about 14% of global air traffic. Our working assumption today is that China's lifting of COVID restrictions continues to be manageable and its traffic levels will remain robust. We also assume traffic in other parts of the world remain resilient. We are, therefore, expecting commercial aftermarket revenue growth across our aerospace businesses to approach 20% in 2023.\nCommercial production rates are also quickly accelerating and we expect commercial aircraft volumes will be up around 20% year-over-year.\nOn the defense side, our backlog is expected to continue to grow given the heightened and increasingly complex threat environment. In the U.S., we continue to see strong bipartisan support as evidenced by the adoption of the defense authorization bill and the Omnibus Appropriations bill with a budget of $858 billion, which is up about 10% from 2022.\nIn overseas, the EU is targeting a € 70 billion Euro increase in defense spending over the next 3 years and Japan will increase their defense budget by 26% this year. Given our current backlog and this continued strength in demand, we remain extremely focused on execution, and I see 4 key actions that will position us to be successful on this front. One, we continue to grow production capacity to deliver on this backlog as we move through 2023 and '24. For example, we've made investments in key strategic locations like Asheville, North Carolina, for Turbine Airfoils, the Kinney, Texas for RF and EO/IR products in Bangalore, India to expand the Collins India manufacturing strategy. Second, we, of course, need a skilled workforce to execute our development and production programs. Labor availability remains a constraint. We've made some progress across RTX in Q4 through reduced attrition and other strategic retention and recruiting initiatives.\nThird, we need to continue restoring health within our supply chain. We've actively maintained a physical presence at close to 400 supplier sites. We continue to qualify additional suppliers on key programs. We secured sources of supply for critical commodities. While we are broadly beginning to see our supply chain improve, it is not yet at the levels we need, we are assuming a recovery as we move into the back half of the year.\nAnd lastly, we are taking a number of actions to deal with the elevated levels of inflation that everyone is experiencing. For perspective, we are expecting roughly $2 billion of labor and material inflation in 2023. And we are targeting to more than offset this headwind through higher pricing and aggressive cost reduction actions across all RTX. Some of these actions are in the category of blocking and tackling, such as continual process improvement and some are more strategic in nature, such as driving productivity through increasing the amount of connected equipment and automated factory hours. No doubt, we've got a lot of work in front of us, but I think we all believe we've got the right actions identified, and more importantly, the right team in place to do it.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Neil to look at our financial results and outlook for '23.\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Chris. Let's turn to Slide 5. I'm pleased to see how we finished the year where we continue to see solid growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash flow in the quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $18.1 billion grew 7% organically versus the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by our commercial aerospace businesses as the continued recovery in commercial air traffic more than offset the supply chain and labor challenges we saw during the year. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.27 was in line with our expectations and up 18%, led by the commercial aftermarket at Pratt & Collins which more than offset the impact of lower productivity in our defense businesses.\nOn a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.96 per share and included $0.31 of acquisition accounting adjustments, restructuring and nonrecurring items. It's worth noting that both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share had a tax benefit of about $0.06 associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations, which were completed during the quarter. And finally, we had free cash flow of $3.8 billion in the quarter, bringing our total cash generation for the year to $4.9 billion which exceeded our commitment as a result of stronger collections, particularly in international areas across the portfolio.\nWith that, let's turn to Slide 6, and I'll get into the segment results. Starting with Collins. Collins sales were $5.7 billion in the quarter, up 15% on an adjusted basis and up 16% organically, driven primarily by the continued recovery in commercial aerospace end markets.\nBy channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 21%, driven by a 32% increase in provisioning and a 25% increase in parts and repair, while modifications and upgrades were up 5% organically in the quarter. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%.\nCommercial OE sales were up 20% versus prior year, driven principally by the continued strength in the narrow-body. Military sales were up 5%, driven primarily by improved material receipts, higher volume and new program awards. Adjusted operating profit of $743 million was up $274 million from the prior year as drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket volume and lower R&D expense was more than offset by higher SG&A expense.\nSo shifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 7. Sales of $5.7 billion were up 10% on an adjusted basis and up 11% on an organic basis with commercial OE sales growth in large commercial engines in Pratt Canada as well as higher commercial aftermarket volume. Commercial OE sales were up 37%, driven by favorable volume and mix within Pratt's large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses.\nCommercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter with growth in both legacy large commercial and Pratt Canada shop visits. In the military business, sales were down 2%, driven by lower military legacy program aftermarket sales. Adjusted operating profit of $321 million was up $159 million from the prior year, driven primarily by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket, which included a favorable contract adjustment. It was partially offset by higher SG&A and R&D.\nTurning now to RIS on Slide 8. Sales of $3.5 billion were down 8% versus prior year on an adjusted basis, driven by the divestiture of the global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021. On an organic basis, sales were down 5% versus prior year, driven by command control and communications, cyber training and services and sensing and effects.\nAdjusted operating profit in the quarter of $278 million was down $122 million versus prior year. Excluding the impact of divestitures, operating profit was down $96 million driven primarily by unfavorable mix, lower net program efficiencies and lower volume. RIS had $2.9 billion of bookings in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92 and a backlog of $16 billion and on a full year basis, RIS's book-to-bill was 0.96.\nTurning now to Slide 9. RMD sales were $4.1 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis and up 7% organically, primarily driven by higher volume and naval power programs including SPY-6 production, higher volume and strategic missile defense, including next-generation interceptor development and higher volume and advanced technology programs.\nAdjusted operating profit of $418 million was $68 million lower than the prior year, driven by unfavorable program mix and lower net program efficiencies partially offset by drop-through on higher volume. RMD's bookings in the quarter were $6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.48. And for the full year, RMD's book-to-bill was 1.37, resulting in a record backlog of $34 billion.\nSo with that, let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss the financial outlook for the year. At the RTX level, we expect full year 2023 sales of between $72 billion and $73 billion, which represents organic growth of 7% to 9% year-over-year. From an earnings perspective, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $4.90 to $5.05, up 3% to 6% year-over-year. And we expect to generate free cash flow of about $4.8 billion.\nI should note, we are not assuming the legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes will be repealed in our outlook. And as a result, in 2023, we'll have a cash payment of about $1.4 billion related to the current law. While there are more details on the cash flow walk in the appendix, let me share a few of the moving pieces.\nFirst, we are expecting segment operating profit growth. Offsetting that will be increases in working capital, capital expenditures as well as a lower pension cost recovery. Additionally, we're expecting to buy back approximately $3 billion of RTX shares in 2023, of course, subject to market conditions.\nNow getting into the details around the earnings per share walk. Starting at the segment level. We expect strong operating profit growth of about 20%, which results in about $0.77 of earnings per share growth at the midpoint of our outlook range. And as Chris noted earlier, this overcomes about $2 billion of material and labor inflation. And with respect to pension, although markets have improved since we spoke in October, pension will still be a substantial year-over-year headwind based on actual 2022 asset returns and where discount rates ended the year, that headwind will be about $0.22. Our tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 18% versus the 14.4% we saw in 2022, which will result in a $0.22 headwind. This change is primarily driven by benefits recorded in 2022 that likely won't repeat in 2023.\nAnd to wrap things up, we see about $0.14 of net headwind year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest and corporate expenses, and all of this brings us to our outlook range of the $4.90 to $5.05 per share.\nSo with that, let's go to Slide 11 for a little more detail on the segment outlooks. At Collins, we expect full year sales to be up low double digits, primarily driven by continuation of the commercial aero recovery. Military sales at Collins are expected to be up mid-single digits for the year as well. We expect Collins adjusted operating profit to grow between $750 million and $825 million versus last year, and this is primarily driven by drop-through on commercial aftermarket, higher OE production ramp and increased defense volumes.\nAt Pratt & Whitney, we expect full year sales to be up low to mid-teens versus prior year, principally driven by higher OE deliveries in both Pratt's large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses as well as continued growth in legacy large commercial engines, GTF aftermarket and Pratt Canada shop visits.\nMilitary sales at Pratt are expected to be flat, driven by higher F135 sustainment volume, which will offset lower F135 material inputs. We expect Pratt's adjusted operating profit to grow between $200 million and $275 million versus last year, primarily on higher aftermarket volume, which is partially offset by a higher large commercial OE delivery impact.\nTurning to RIS. We expect full year sales to be flat versus the prior year and adjusted operating profit to be up between $75 million and $125 million, driven by improved net program efficiencies. And at RMD, we expect sales to grow low to mid-single digits versus 2022 as the effects of the supply chain constraints ease in the back half of the year and for adjusted operating profit to be up between $175 million and $225 million versus prior year, driven by improved net program efficiencies, which will be partially offset by continued mix headwinds. And finally, higher intercompany activity will increase sales eliminations by about 10% year-over-year. And it's also worth noting, we've included an outlook for some of the below-the-line items and pension in the webcast appendix.\nSo with that, let me hand it back to Greg to wrap things up.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nPresident, CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nOkay, Neil, thanks very much. So we're going to close out on Slide 12 and take a quick look at our priorities. Obviously, there's no surprises here. As we head into 2023, I would tell you the future remains bright for RTX, especially with a $175 billion backlog and strong demand in all of our end markets. We also know the challenges that we saw in 2022 will continue, and we'll keep working to mitigate the big 3 that we continue to focus on: supply chain, labor and inflation. And although we're monitoring the macro environment, we remain optimistic on the economic outlook as the demand drivers for our businesses remain incredibly strong.\nAs Chris mentioned, we're actively preparing for the demand ahead by expanding capacity, investing in digital solutions, and leveraging automation to unlock efficiencies across our value streams. We have the right team in place, and we're making the right investments. And we're also taking proactive actions to mitigate the risks we see today and to ensure success not just in 2023 but beyond.\nThe streamlining lining of our businesses is just the next step in our journey on leveraging the unique scale and capabilities of RTX to deliver value for our customers and our shareowners. Right now, it's all about program execution and managing costs. We have the backlog. We have the demand, and we have the technology and our balance between defense and commercial aero will help us navigate into the future.\nWe will, of course, continue to stay disciplined in capital allocation, and we're going to generate strong free cash flow this year and beyond, all of which enables us to return significant value to our share owners. Most importantly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 2025 targets. We're going to provide an update at our upcoming Investor Day, which will be on June 19 at the Paris Air Show.\nBefore I close, I really want to say a special thank you to Roy Azevedo for his many contributions to Raytheon over these past 34 years. Roy has been a key member of our senior leadership team at RTX for the past 3 years, and we wish him nothing but health and success as he moves into the next phase of his career.\nSo with that, let's close out the -- this portion and open it up for questions.

My name is Livia, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nOn the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the Internet, and there's presentation available for download from Raytheon Technologies' website at www.rtx.com.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments and net nonrecurring and/or significant items often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Raytheon Technologies' SEC filings, including its Form 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nPresident, CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Livia, and good morning, everybody. As you can see in the press release this morning, RTX had another solid quarter of growth led by commercial aerospace and extremely strong demand for our products, with over $22 billion of awards in the quarter. I think it's important to note our balanced aerospace and defense portfolio, along with operational resiliency, remain the key differentiators, which enable us to deliver on our commitments despite some near-term macro challenges and uncertainties. I'm not sure what that noise is.\nI think it's also important to note, we've overcome some significant headwinds in 2022, from transitioning out of Russia to record inflation and a strained supply chain. I think it's important. Those are short-term issues. And while we continue the day-to-day work to mitigate those challenges, we also continue to grow our $168 billion backlogs and invest in the future through over $9 billion of R&D, capital expenditures and customer-funded research and development. Those investments, coupled with strong demand for our systems across each of our businesses, positions us for significant growth runway as the near-term headwinds recede.\nBefore we get to the results, let me just spend a few minutes discussing the trends we're seeing in some of our end markets. On the defense side, no surprises. The elevated threat environment has significantly influenced how the U.S. and our allies are thinking about their defense capabilities and readiness.\nAnd as a result, this has driven global defense budgets substantially higher, a trend we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. Just as an example, in Europe, Switzerland recently signed a $6.25 billion contract to buy 36 F-35 jets, modernizing their fleet and driving demand, of course, for our F135 engine through the end of the decade.\nWe're also seeing significant global demand for advanced air defense systems, especially in Eastern Europe, as the Russians and Ukraine conflict, unfortunately, continues. This includes 2 of our NASAMS system, which is the short surface-to-air missile system that will help protect the people of Ukraine. And we expect more orders beyond those 2 to follow shortly.\nThe heightened threat environment continues to drive strong orders. During the quarter, we saw strong domestic and international demand for our products with a number of significant defense awards, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.22 and a backlog that's up about $2 billion sequentially.\nOf particular note, our Missiles & Defense business was awarded $1 billion to develop the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, or HACM, for the U.S. Air Force. It's a first-of-its-kind missile that leverages air breathing scramjet propulsion technology and that can travel at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 or greater.\nAdditionally, RMD completed the systems requirement review for the hypersonic glide phase interceptor program prototype. This is designed to protect the United States from increasing hypersonic missile threats. Both of these accomplishments demonstrate that Raytheon Technologies is a leader in the race to develop and deploy operational hypersonic and, importantly, counter-hypersonic systems, a key strategic priority for the Department of Defense.\nRMD also was awarded about $1 billion from the U.S. Air Force, Navy and international customers for advanced AMRAAM, which is the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. These missiles have been upgraded with the most sophisticated technology needed to maintain the edge over adversaries of the U.S. and our international allies.\nAt RIS, we saw an additional $1.6 billion in classified awards in the quarter. The team was also awarded $215 million from the FAA to upgrade their Wide Area Augmentation System to enhance safer air travel in support of the national aerospace system.\nAt Pratt & Whitney, the team recently delivered the 1,000th F135 engine and was awarded over $800 million through the quarter -- in the quarter to continue supporting the F135, which is the safest, most capable and best value military jet engine in operation. And we're working on the F135 engine core upgrade, known as the Enhanced Engine Package or EEP. This will allow the F135 to provide even more thrust, range and electrification to the aircraft. The EEP offers the most cost-effective and lowest-risk solution to enable the F-35's Block 4 upgrade.\nAt Collins, we received a $583 million IDIQ award for the MAPS Gen II program, which maintains the integrity of positioning and timing in a GPS contested or denied environment. And it's an important award to ensure mission success within a more connected battle space.\nAs you can see, the defense pipeline remains robust, and we expect continued order strength in the future as we continue to win key awards to successfully demonstrate our technology leadership and innovation capabilities.\nMoving to the commercial side. Air traffic remains strong as third quarter global revenue passenger miles reached 75% of 2019 levels. In the U.S., travelers through TSA checkpoints reached 91% of 2019 levels, with Labor Day domestic traffic exceeding 2019.\nAnd we continue to see steady improvement in long-haul international traffic with wide-body hours flown up nearly 40% year-over-year. The strong demand -- the strong commercial aerospace recovery was driving demand for our commercial products and services, and we continue to innovate to deliver value for our customers.\nFor example, just a few weeks ago, Pratt began development flight testing of the GTF Advantage engine on the A320neo aircraft in Toulouse, France. The GTF Advantage reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by a total of 17% compared to the prior generation engines, extending the engine's lead as the most efficient power plant for the A320 family.\nAlso during the quarter, Pratt completed the first flight test of the GTF-powered A321XLR, or Xtra Long Range, 2 significant milestones for the GTF family of engines. So even with some near-term challenges, we continue to invest in innovation for continued growth in air travel and to meet the strong defense demand.\nOkay. With that as a background, let's turn to Slide 2, some highlights in the quarter. In the quarter, we delivered another strong organic sales growth of 6%. Adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectations at $1.21, and free cash flow is also ahead of our expectations despite a $1.5 billion additional tax payment we made related to the R&D amortization.\nSales growth was again led by strong commercial aftermarket sales that were up 24% over the prior year. However, we continue to see challenges related to supply chain and labor availability in each of our businesses.\nOn the capital allocation front, we repurchased over $600 million of shares in the quarter, putting us at $2.4 billion year-to-date. And we remain on track to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for the year. Through the end of the third quarter, we have returned over $12 billion of capital to share owners since the merger, and we're well on our way with our commitment to return at least $20 billion in the first 4 years following the merger.\nBefore I hand it over to Neil, notwithstanding the strength in demand that we're seeing across our businesses, the industry-wide challenges we're facing remain the same. You've heard me talk about them before: supply chain, labor and inflation. But we continue to focus on what we can control by proactively managing the businesses through these dynamic times.\nLet me give you some examples of what we're doing. On the microelectronics front, we're working closely with our distributors and the OEMs to bring more capacity online. We also have a direct engagement, which has led to higher deliveries and an acceleration of expected recoveries for certain wafers and chips.\nAt RMD, we're working hand in hand with our rocket motor supplier holding daily senior management meetings to track work in progress and solve technical problems real time. We're also leveraging RTX's contract labor agreements to help source labor in our supply base.\nTo mitigate the impacts of inflation, we take multiple -- we've been taking multiple actions. For example, we're leveraging our raw material contracts from the business from RTX to get best prices for our suppliers as well. And while supply chain disruptions are frustrating, we are seeing some stabilization, and we're encouraged by the demand signals across the business. That said, these headwinds continue to pressure the business.\nSo as we finish out the year, just a couple of thoughts. We're going to have to adjust our full year sales outlook slightly to a new range of $67 billion to $67.3 billion. We're going to bring up the bottom of our adjusted EPS range by a dime, to $4.70 to $4.80. And we continue to see free cash flow of about $4 billion for the year.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Neil and Jennifer to take you through the details. Neil?\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Greg. Before I get into the full year, let's look at our Q3 results on Slide 3. Sales of $17 billion grew 6% organically versus the prior year, with organic growth at Collins, Pratt and RIS more than offsetting the decline in RMD. The ongoing recovery of commercial air travel and a strong summer travel season drove our aerospace performance while we continue to see challenges in the supply chain, as Greg mentioned.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.21 was down 4% year-over-year but ahead of our expectations on better commercial aero. Segment operating profit growth of 12% was more than offset by the absence of a prior year tax benefit and lower pension income.\nGAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.94 per share and included $0.27 of acquisition accounting adjustments and restructuring. And free cash flow of $263 million was also ahead of our expectations and included the impact of the $1.5 billion cash payment that Greg just mentioned.\nOn the cost reduction front, we achieved an incremental $105 million of gross merger cost synergies in the quarter, bringing our merger-to-date total to $1.3 billion of our $1.5 billion commitment in the 4 years following the merger.\nBefore I hand it over to Jennifer, a few comments on our full year outlook. The commercial air recovery remains robust, and we continue to expect that global RPMs will recover to about 90% of 2019 levels as we exit this year.\nDomestic and short-haul international travel also remain strong, and we continue to see a steady recovery in long-haul international travel. However, as Greg discussed, while we're seeing some stabilization in certain areas of the supply chain and labor market, these constraints continue to put pressure on our businesses.\nAs a result, we're reducing our full year RTX sales outlook to a new range of $67 billion to $67.3 billion, which translates to between 5% and 6% organic sales growth. This is down from our prior range of $67.75 billion to $68.75 billion. However, despite the lower sales outlook, we're raising the bottom end of our adjusted EPS range by $0.10 to $4.70 to $4.80 per share from our prior range of $4.60 to $4.80.\nContinued aftermarket strength, favorable OE mix and cost containment actions across RTX are partially offsetting lower sales and lower productivity in our defense businesses. You'll also recall that we previously assumed the legislation requiring capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes would be repealed or deferred this year. Since that hasn't happened, we've realized an EPS benefit of about $0.11 year-to-date and estimate that the full year impact is about $0.15 per share.\nAnd on the cash front, we continue to expect free cash flow of about $4 billion for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we're expecting lower tax payments in several large international receipts. And finally, we provided an updated outlook for the segments and some below-the-line items in the webcast appendix.\nSo with that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to take you through the third quarter segment results and updated outlook. Jennifer?\n\nJennifer Reed\n\nVP of IR, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Neil. Starting with Collins Aerospace on Slide 4. Sales were $5.1 billion in the quarter, up 11% on an adjusted basis and up 13% organically, driven primarily by the continued recovery in commercial aerospace end markets.\nBy channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 25% driven by a 44% increase in provisioning and a 31% increase in parts and repair, while modification and upgrades were up 3% organically in the quarter. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 4%.\nCommercial OE sales were up 16% versus prior year, driven principally by the strength in narrowbody. Military sales were down 6%, driven primarily by lower material receipts and decreased volume.\nAdjusted operating profit of $630 million was up $150 million from the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and OE more than offset lower volume on military program as well as higher SG&A and R&D expense.\nLooking ahead, we continue to see Collins' full year sales up low double digits. And as a result of stronger commercial aftermarket, we're bringing up the low end of Collins' adjusted operating profit to a new range of up $750 million to $825 million from the prior range of up $700 million to $825 million versus last year.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 5. Sales of $5.4 billion were up 14% on an adjusted basis and up 15% organically, with sales growth in large commercial engines in Pratt Canada more than offsetting lower military sales.\nCommercial OE sales were up 26% driven by favorable mix within Pratt's large commercial engine and Pratt Canada's businesses, along with higher GTF and Pratt Canada volume. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 23% in the quarter with growth in both legacy large commercial engine and Pratt Canada shop visits.\nSequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 14%. In the military business, sales were down 2%, driven primarily by lower expected F135 production volume that was partially offset by higher F135 sustainment volume.\nThe adjusted operating profit of $318 million was up $129 million from the prior year. The drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and favorable military and commercial OE sales mix more than offset higher SG&A and R&D expense.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect Pratt sales to be up low teens. And we're increasing Pratt's adjusted operating profit to a new range of up $650 million to $700 million from our prior range of up $550 million to $650 million versus 2021, reflecting the strength of the aerospace recovery.\nTurning now to Slide 6. RIS sales of $3.6 billion were down 3% versus prior year on an adjusted basis driven by the divestiture of the Global Training and Services business. On an organic basis, sales were up 2% versus prior year due to higher classified sales in sensing and effects that were partially offset by lower expected sales in command, control and communications, including lower sales in tactical communications program.\nAdjusted operating profit in the quarter of $371 million was down $20 million versus prior year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, operating profit was up $8 million, driven primarily by favorable net program efficiencies.\nRIS had $3.9 billion of bookings in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.18 and a backlog of $17 billion. For the full year, we continue to expect RIS' book-to-bill to be greater than 1.\nTurning to RIS full year outlook. A result of the ongoing material availability delays and the associated productivity impacts as well as anticipated cost reduction actions and award delays, we are reducing RIS sales to the low end of our prior outlook and now expect RIS sales to be down mid-single digit from our prior outlook of down mid-single digit to down low single digit on a reported basis versus prior year.\nOn an organic basis, we now expect RIS' sales to be down slightly versus our prior outlook of about flat. And as a result of lower sales outlook and program efficiencies, we are reducing RIS' adjusted operating profit to a new range of down $125 million to down $75 million from a prior range of down $50 million to flat versus prior year.\nTurning now to Slide 7. RMD sales was $3.7 billion, down 6% on an adjusted basis and down 5% organically, primarily driven by continuing delays in material availability and lower volume in Land Warfare and Air Defense and Naval Power programs. This was partially offset by higher volume on Strategic Missile Defense programs, including Next Generation Interceptor development.\nAdjusted operating profit of $116 million was $74 million lower than prior year driven by unfavorable program mix and lower volume, primarily in Land Warfare and Air Defense programs as well as lower net program efficiencies resulted from continued supply chain and labor constraints. RMD's bookings in the quarter were approximately $5.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5 and backlog of $32 billion.\nFor the full year, we now expect RMD's book-to-bill to be at or better than 1.2. As a result of ongoing material availability delays and the associated productivity impacts and cost reduction actions, we now expect RMD sales to be down low single digit versus our prior outlook of up slightly versus 2021. And as a result of the lower sales outlook and lower program efficiencies, we are reducing RMD's adjusted operating profit to a new range of down $300 million to down $250 million from the prior range of down $50 million to flat versus 2021.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Neil.\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer. A lot to cover there. I'm on Slide 8. While we aren't providing our '23 outlook today, let me tell you how I'm thinking about next year. Overall, we expect another year of organic sales and segment operating profit growth with solid free cash flow generation at RTX.\nOn the positive side, we expect that commercial air traffic will continue to recover and the global demand for our defense products and technologies will remain strong. We expect to exit next year at or above 2019 levels for global air traffic, and the significant defense orders we have won should begin to convert to sales.\nWe will continue to drive operational excellence, and we are focused on improving our cost competitiveness. We're using the core operating system to align goals and drive targeted improvements with technology.\nThe collaboration across RTX has already yielded 180 approved projects with a growing pipeline of over 350 future projects, which are focused on smart factories, automation and machine upgrades that will apply best practices to further reduce our structural costs. We will leverage our scale, these additional cost reduction opportunities and pricing to help address the inflation pressures that we expect to remain elevated well into next year.\nAnd while we are working many actions across our businesses every day to mitigate the impacts of supply chain constraints and labor availability, as I said, we do expect these pressures will continue to persist into next year as well. Additionally, as we sit here today, we see pressure from increasing interest rates and market volatility and anticipate a pension headwind next year that could be about $0.40 on a year-over-year basis due to current market conditions.\nThat said, it's important to note that our U.S. plans remain well funded and have even seen an improvement in their funded status year-to-date. And of course, everyone is watching the geopolitical landscape, energy supply in Europe, the continuing resolution and the global tax environment.\nSo with that, let me hand it back to Greg for some closing remarks.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nPresident, CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Neil. So there's a lot going on, a lot of moving pieces. And I think the key takeaways that I hope people get from this is most importantly, our backlog is up $12 billion since the beginning of the year. And we're investing $9 billion this year to support the growth that's going to come over these next couple of years.\nThe future remains absolutely bright for RTX. The 2025 commitments that we laid out a year ago in May remain in sight. And we're not going to back off from any of those, be it top line, bottom line or cash flow.\nSo Neil laid out 3 challenges that are out there, right, supply chain, right? It's a challenge. There's no doubt about it. We've got 13,000 suppliers. And of those 13,000, about 400 of them are a problem for us. But we've deployed teams to almost all of those suppliers to work with them on a daily basis, getting them raw material, giving them contract labor, giving them technical support, all of the things that you would expect us to be doing.\nOn labor availability, it's a challenge. Everybody sees it, especially in the supply chain. And I think what's interesting for -- at RTX is we have hired 27,000 people in 2022. That's about 3,000 a month since the beginning of the year. Our total headcount today is over 180,000.\nThe challenge though is we would need about 10,000 more people. So a lot of work yet to do on labor. It's out there. It's a great place to work. And people come to RTX because of the mission. And so we have a, I think, a very good pipeline. We'll continue to hire at this rate. And again, the challenge will be in the supply chain.\nOn inflation, we came into the year expecting about $1.5 billion of cost growth between compensation and what we saw in the supply chain and energy prices. That $1.5 billion has turned out to be closer to $2 billion, so about $500 million of additional headwind that we didn't expect as we came into the year.\nYou couple that with about $200 million of headwind from the cessation of activities in Russia back in February, and there's about $700 million of headwind that we came into the year that we had to overcome. The good news is we have found ways to save.\nWe have cut costs across the business. We've got about 500 cost reduction projects that we're currently working. And so despite that $700 million, we've been able to maintain guidance for the year just where we saw it back in January of this year.\nSo it's been a tough year. It's going to be a tough year going forward. We know that. We recognize it. But the fact is we have the tools and the people to make it all happen.\nSo I'll stop there, and we'll turn it back to the operator, and we'll take whatever questions you might have.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet, and there is a presentation available for download from Raytheon Technologies' website at www.rtx.com.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments and net nonrecurring and/or significant items often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Raytheon Technologies' SEC filings, including its forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. (Operator Instructions) With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Latif, and good morning, everyone. I hope everyone had a chance to see our press release this morning. From that press release, I think one of the key takeaways is we had a really strong quarter for commercial aerospace, and we continue to see very strong demand for our products and services, as evidenced by our defense book-to-bill in the quarter of 1.35, an incredible number.\nWe delivered these results in the midst of, I would say, a challenging period across our industry and most of industrial America. Inflation, supply chain and labor availability continue to be near-term constraints. We're working these things relentlessly by leveraging our scale and our portfolio to combat all of these different pressures.\nBefore we get into the results, let me just spend a few minutes on the macro environment. On the defense side, the evolving threat environment, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, continues to drive global defense budgets higher. Most of our NATO allies have reaffirmed their commitment to spending at least 2% of GDP on national defense with many countries announcing even higher spending targets over the last several months.\nFor example, Poland has requested accelerated delivery of Patriot missile systems batteries, and both Germany and Finland have selected the F-35. As you know, the Department of Defense released its fiscal year '23 budget request earlier this year with modernization spending growing over 4%,and with modernization accounts, specifically RDT&E, expected to grow by nearly 10%.\nWe're also encouraged by the mark-ups that we've seen in Congress. The House Armed Services Committee has proposed a $37 billion increase to the administration's request. That's a 9% increase over fiscal '22, excluding the supplementals. On the Senate side, the Senate Armed Services Committee went even higher proposing a $45 billion mark, resulting in a DoD budget increase of 10% over fiscal '22, bringing the fiscal year '23 budget to over $815 billion. It's a lot different than what we expected 2 years ago.\nWe're encouraged by the support of our programs with the authorizing committees recommending significant increases in spend over the President's budget request, including increases for Stingers, Javelins Next Generation Jammers, Tomahawk cruise missiles, just to name a few. And as I've said, our key programs in technologies and space, cyber, missiles, missile defense and non-kinetic effects are also well aligned with the U.S. and our allies defense priorities.\nWe ended the quarter with a defense backlog of $65 billion. That's up about $2 billion since the beginning of the year, and we expect it to grow even further in the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we also saw a number of significant awards, including $4 billion to deliver F135 engines for lots 15 and 16, which will power all variants of the F-35 fighter. The total contract value opportunity is about $8 billion for F135 engines across lots 15 through 17. In addition, we received a $408 million contract for sustainment of the F-35 fleet -- F135 fleet rather.\nThe F135 engine continues to be the most advanced and, I would say, the safest fighter engine ever produced and possesses unrivaled operational capability and mission effectiveness. As the global threats evolve, the F-135 could be upgraded to increase its thrust, range and power thermal management to support the needs of the war fighter well into the next decade.\nWe also received a $648 million award to deliver SM-3 missiles to the Missile Defense Agency, a $662 million awarded R&D to replenish 1,300 Stinger missiles as well as awards to replenish Javelin missiles. RIS also had a $1.2 billion bookings of classified programs.\nDuring the quarter, RMD was also down selected by the MDA to continue developing a first-of-its-kind counter hypersonic missile, the Glide Phase Interceptor. In a few weeks -- just a few weeks ago, RMD along with our industry partner, Northrop Grumman, successfully completed the second flight test of the scramjet-powered Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC for DARPA and the U.S. Air Force. The flight test applied the data and lessons learned from the first flight test last September to demonstrate how rapidly we've matured affordable scramjet technology.\nAt the same time, commercial air traffic demand continues to gain momentum with a strong start to the summer travel season. Globally, Q2 revenue passenger miles reached nearly 70% of the pre-pandemic levels. In the U.S., travelers through TSA checkpoints were up 30% year-over-year in the second quarter or nearly 90% of 2019 levels. And with travel restrictions easing around the world, we expect growing demand for international travel in the second half of the year with international revenue passenger miles growing from over 60% of 2019 levels at the end of Q2 to about 75% to 80% of 2019 levels by the end of the year.\nThat being said, we all know that global supply chain isn't where it needs to be, and we're aggressively managing these issues every day. Microelectronics, rocket motors, structural castings, all continue to pace manufacturing lines. Today, we have people embedded about 330 of our suppliers to help improve performance. And we're also qualifying second, in some cases, third sources for critical parts as necessary.\nInflation also continues to be at elevated levels, no surprise there. However, on the commercial side, we have long-term agreements in place that cover about 80% of our spend and cover multiple years which provides an inflation buffer at least in the near term. On the defense side, we can price inflation into annual production contracts and flow through our rate structure. Additionally, we're driving further automation, standardization and process improvement projects throughout the company to mitigate inflation headwinds.\nAnd lastly, and perhaps just most importantly, the availability of skilled labor is a real challenge across multiple industries right now. And we're seeing it both at our suppliers and within our own shops. It takes time to hire and train new employees. It doesn't just happen overnight, especially in certain areas such as much of our classified work.\nDespite these near-term challenges, what differentiates us is our balanced A&D portfolio and our world-class technologies that gives us the ability to deliver on our commitments. Okay. We'll just take a quick look at Q2. And I'm on Slide 2, for those of you following along. We delivered another solid quarter with sales growing 4% organically. Adjusted EPS was a little bit ahead of our expectations at $1.16, and that's up 13% versus the prior year, and free cash flow was essentially in line with our expectations. Growth in the quarter was led by strong commercial aftermarket sales that were up over 26% from the prior year. This strength was partially offset by continued supply chain and labor constraints that principally impacted the defense businesses as well as some delays in expected contract awards. Notwithstanding these challenges, we continue to see full year sales in the range of $67.75 billion to $68.75 billion. And adjusted EPS, we continue to see that in the $4.60 to $4.80 range. However, there are some changes within the segments as strength in the commercial aero will help to offset impacts in our defense businesses that Neil and Jennifer will discuss in just a little bit later in the call.\nAs far as our cash flow outlook, we continue to expect about $6 billion of free cash flow for the year. That's, of course, assuming that the R&D tax legislation is repealed. Finally, we repurchased over $1 billion of RTX shares in the quarter, putting us at about $1.8 billion year-to-date, and we remain on track to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for the year. Through the end of the second quarter, we've already returned nearly $11 billion of capital to shareowners since the merger in April of 2020, and we're more than halfway to our commitment to return at least $20 billion in the first 4 years following the merger.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Neil, and I'll be back at the end for a wrap-up and Q&A. Neil?\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Greg. Before I talk about the full year, let's look at the second quarter results on Slide 3. As Greg noted, sales of $16.3 billion, grew 4% on an organic basis versus the prior year. Our performance in the quarter was driven by the continued recovery of air travel due to the pent-up demand that was partially offset by continued supply chain constraints that, as Greg said, principally impacted our defense businesses. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.16 was up 13% year-over-year and was ahead of our expectations primarily driven by strength in commercial aftermarket at Collins and Pratt and some favorable corporate items, including lower tax expense, which more than offset the impact of lower defense volume and productivity.\nOn a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.88 per share and included $0.28 of acquisition accounting adjustments and net significant and/or nonrecurring items. And finally, free cash flow of $807 million was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter.\nSo let me give you some perspective on how we're thinking about the environment as we look ahead to the second half of the year. Let's turn to Slide 4. I'll start with some positives. The recovery in commercial air traffic remains as strong -- very strong as airlines entered the summer travel season with leisure travel bookings well above 2019 levels and the active fleet is at its highest level since the beginning of the pandemic. And as you saw, our commercial aftermarket sales continue to grow generally in line with our expectations for the quarter.\nGeographically, U.S. domestic demand has remained strong, while China domestic travel has lagged our expectations so far this year. That said, domestic air traffic in China began to rebound as lockdowns ease throughout the second quarter.\nOn the international front, short-haul international travel or intra-region travel has been quite strong, fueled by a stronger-than-expected European recovery so far this year. And long-haul international travel or trans-regional travel has shown slow but steady sequential growth. And while this is encouraging, we need to see this segment of the market accelerate in the second half of the year.\nOn the defense side, as Greg mentioned, we are optimistic about the fiscal '23 budget request and our continued alignment with the priorities of the United States and our allies. And on the cost reduction front, we remain laser-focused on driving operational excellence and our structural cost reduction projects to deliver further margin expansion. In the second quarter, we achieved about $80 million of incremental cost synergies, keeping us on track to achieve $335 million this year and well on our way to $1.5 billion of total gross cost synergies since the merger.\nAt the same time, we continue to monitor the broader geopolitical landscape as well as the U.S. and global tax environment.\nAnd finally, on the challenges side, we continue to see global supply chain and inflationary pressure as well as labor availability constraints. During the second quarter, we saw a slower-than-expected recovery in material receipts and the resulting impacts to our shop productivity along with increasing inflationary pressures in labor, freight and other indirect cost areas. And while we remain focused on aggressive mitigation actions, we don't expect these pressures to ease until next year.\nSo moving on to our outlook on Slide 5. We continue to expect our full year sales to be in the range of $67.75 billion to $68.75 billion. However, due to continued supply chain and labor constraints, we now expect lower sales and operating profit at both RIS and RMD for the full year. Those sales impacts are expected to be largely offset by the stronger commercial aerospace recovery we're seeing at Collins and Pratt.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we're holding our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share but expect to be more towards the midpoint of the range as we don't expect some of the headwinds to fully recover in the year. I should also point out that we continue to work mitigations to offset the impact of ceasing business activities with Russia and minimizing any impact to our customers. I'll provide more color on the moving pieces between the businesses in a moment.\nAnd on the cash front, we continue to expect free cash flow of about $6 billion for the year. It's important to mention that our cash flow outlook continues to assume that the legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes is deferred beyond 2022, which, as I've said before, the free cash flow impact of this legislation is approximately $2 billion for the year. If the legislation isn't deferred by September 15, we will have to make an incremental cash tax payment of about $1.5 billion here in the third quarter. However, this payment is a timing issue only as we will receive a refund in 2023 for the overpayment if the legislation is ultimately deferred by year-end as we continue to expect.\nSo with that, let's move to Slide 6 for some color on the segment outlooks. At Collins, we continue to expect full year sales to be up low double digits versus prior year, where we now see a little stronger commercial aftermarket recovery that's partially offset by supply chain-induced pressures on military sales. As a result of better sales mix and spending containment measures, we are increasing Collins adjusted operating profit from up $650 million to $800 million to a new range of up $700 million to $825 million versus last year.\nTurning to Pratt & Whitney. We're increasing Pratt & Whitney sales range from up high single to low double digits to a new range of up low teens versus prior year, and that's driven by stronger commercial aftermarket and better commercial OE mix.\nWith respect to operating profit at Pratt, we're increasing Pratt's adjusted operating profit from a range of up $500 million to $600 million to a new range of up $550 million to $650 million versus last year.\nTurning to RIS. Due to the pressures we've discussed along with delays in awards, we're reducing RIS' reported sales outlook from down slightly to a new range of down mid-single digit to down low-single digit versus prior year. And organically, we're reducing RIS' outlook from up low single digit and now see RIS' organic sales roughly flat versus prior year. And as a result of lower sales outlook and the impact of unfavorable development program adjustments, we're reducing RIS' full year adjusted operating profit from the prior range of flat to up $50 million to a new range of down $50 million to flat versus prior year.\nAnd finally, at RMD, also due to ongoing material availability delays and the associated productivity impact, along with the anticipated cost reduction, we are reducing RMD's full year sales outlook from the prior range of up low to mid-single digit to a new outlook of up slightly versus prior year. And as a result, we are reducing RMD's adjusted operating profit from a prior range of up $150 million to $200 million and now expect RMD's operating profit to be in the range of down $50 million to flat versus prior year.\nAnd we also expect some improvement in some corporate spending and a lower full year tax rate. We've included and updated outlook for some of those below-the-line items in the webcast appendix. So with that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to take you through the second quarter segment results.\n\nJennifer Reed\n\nVP of IR, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Neil. Starting with Collins Aerospace on Slide 7. Sales were $5 billion in the quarter, up 10% on an adjusted basis and up 11% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the continued recovery in commercial aerospace end markets. By channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 25% driven by a 33% increase in parts and repair, a 20% increase in provisioning and an 8% increase in modification and upgrades. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 3%. Commercial OE sales were up 14% versus prior year with strength in narrowbody offsetting expected headwinds from lower 787 deliveries.\nMilitary sales were down 6% driven primarily by lower material receipts on military programs and expected declines in F-35 volume. Adjusted operating profit of $617 million, was up $99 million from the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket more than offset higher SG&A expense, the absence of favorable contract settlements and lower military sales volume.\nLooking ahead, as Neil discussed, we continue to see Collins' full year sales up low double digits, and we now see adjusted operating profit up $700 million to $825 million versus last year.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 8. Sales of $5 billion were up 16% on an adjusted basis and up 17% on an organic basis with sales growing across all segments. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 26% in the quarter with growth in both legacy large commercial engine and Pratt Canada shop visits. Commercial OE sales were up 22% driven by higher GTF deliveries and favorable mix within Pratt's large commercial engine business.\nIn the military business, sales were up 5% driven primarily by the timing of F135 production contract award in Q2, and higher F135 aftermarket volume. Adjusted operating profit of $303 million was up $207 million from the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket, favorable commercial OE mix along with higher military volume were partially offset by higher SG&A and R&D. Looking ahead, we now expect Pratt sales to be up low teens and for adjusted operating profit to be up $550 million to $650 million versus 2021.\nTurning now to Slide 9. RIS sales of $3.6 billion were down 6% versus prior year on an adjusted basis, primarily driven by the divestiture of the Global Training and Services business. Sales were down 1% versus prior year on an organic basis due to lower expected sales in Command, Control and Communications as well as lower sales within Sensing and Effects that were partially offset by higher sales in classified cyber programs within Cyber Training and Services. The quarter was also impacted by the delay of certain contract awards.\nAdjusted operating profit in the quarter of $315 million was down $100 million versus prior year, primarily driven by lower net program efficiencies, including unfavorable development program adjustments, the impact of the divestiture and the absence of a land sale in the prior year.\nRIS had $3 billion of bookings in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92 and a backlog of $16 billion. It's worth noting that we continue to expect RIS' full year book-to-bill to be greater than 1.\nTurning to RIS' full year outlook. As Neil discussed, we now expect RIS sales to be down mid-single digits to down low single digits on a reported basis versus prior year and to be about flat on an organic basis. And we expect RIS' adjusted operating profit to be down $50 million to flat versus prior year.\nTurning now to Slide 10. RMD sales were $3.6 billion, down 11% on an adjusted basis and down 10% on an organic basis, primarily driven by continuing delays in material availability and expected declines in certain Land Warfare and Air Defense programs that were partially offset by higher volume on SPY-6 production and NextGeneration Interceptor development. Adjusted operating profit of $348 million was $184 million lower than prior year driven primarily by lower net program efficiencies resulting from continued supply chain constraints and unfavorable program mix and lower volume primarily in Land Warfare and Air Defense programs.\nRMD's bookings in the quarter were approximately $4.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.3 and a backlog of $30 billion. In addition to the awards that Greg discussed, RMD also booked $423 million on the SPY-6 Hardware Production and Sustainment program and $217 million for Tomahawk production for the U.S. Navy. For the full year, we now expect RMD's full year book-to-bill to be closer to 1.2. And looking ahead, we now expect RMD sales to be up slightly versus prior year and for adjusted operating profit to be down $50 million to flat versus prior year. With that, I'll turn it back to Greg to wrap things up.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nOkay. Thank you, Jennifer. I'm on Slide 11 now. We'll be just a second for Q&A. So despite some of the macro uncertainties for the remainder of the year, we're well equipped to mitigate the challenges that we talked about: supply chain, inflation and labor availability. We're going to do that through our focus on cost reduction, operational excellence, all in order to meet the commitments that we set out to investors earlier this year.\nAnd while we continue to make progress, let me just say that we're certainly not satisfied with the performance in our defense businesses this quarter. There is much to do. Bookings were outstanding; execution, not so much. At the same time, we continue to invest in technology and innovation for our customers as well as execute on our capital allocation strategy to drive significant long-term growth and shareowner value well into the future.\nWith our industry-leading franchises across A&D, we're prepared to capitalize on the commercial aerospace recovery and growing defense budgets. Balance continues to work. And I think most importantly, we remain confident in our ability to hit the 2025 targets that we set in May of last year at our investor meeting.\nThere's a lot to do. There's always more to do. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Latif?",

Welcome to the Raytheon Technologies First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ludi, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nOn the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations. This call is being carried live on the internet, and there is a presentation available for download from the Raytheon Technologies' website at www.rtx.com.\nPlease note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding acquisition, accounting adjustments and net nonrecurring and/or significant items, often referred to by management as other significant items. The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any forward-looking statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. RTC's SEC filings, including its Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\n(Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Ludi, and good morning, everybody. Before I get into the results, I just want to spend a minute to address the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I know it's first and center on everybody's mind. It's obviously been devastating to see these tragic events unfold, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Ukrainian people.\nWe, of course, have ceased all of our business activities with Russia in line with global sanctions, and we remain committed to supporting our allies and ensuring the safety of our people around the world. This event, more than any other, demonstrates our unique responsibility as a global company entrusted with supporting our customers as they navigate a difficult and complex geopolitical landscape, and we remain focused on honoring that mission.\nAlright. Let me turn to the first quarter. As you saw from the press release, we're off to a good start for the year. On the commercial aerospace side, we remain optimistic on the market recovery, despite a slower-than-expected start to the year due to the impact of Omicron and increased geopolitical tensions.\nThat said, air traffic is rebounding again in many markets around the world. In the U.S., passenger traffic through TSA checkpoints remained steady versus Q4 at about 1.8 million passengers per day in the quarter. But importantly, it averaged over 2 million passengers per day in March, a significant increase last year and a nearly -- that's nearly 90% of what we saw in 2019. So a recovery is in sight.\nOn the defense side, we're very pleased with the enacted '22 DoD budget, and we're encouraged by the President's most recent fiscal '23 budget request of $773 billion. The proposed budget includes broad-based support across our key programs and technology investments in cyber, space, missiles, missile defense systems and others. And we expect the enacted budget could be even higher to account for inflation and the many unfunded priorities identified by the services.\nLooking internationally, our allies are also increasingly prioritizing defense spending with a focus on defensive systems, which we are uniquely positioned to support. Resilient commercial air traffic, coupled with growing global defense budgets and our strong backlog, continue to support our long-term outlook for our businesses and gives us confidence in our ability to drive top-line growth and margin expansion over the next several years.\nAlright. Turning to Slide 2, some highlights for the quarter. As I said, it was a good start to the year, despite the impact of Omicron and continued supply chain constraints. Commercial aftermarket remained strong in the quarter, growing 38% from Q1 of last year. We delivered solid financial performance in the quarter, where we exceeded our expectations on both adjusted EPS and free cash flow.\nThat said, as a result of ceasing business activities in Russia, we are going to reduce our full year sales outlook by $750 million to a new range of $67.75 billion to $68.75 billion. However, we are going to hold our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 to $4.80, and we continue to expect free cash flow of about $6 billion for the year. Neil will give you a little more color on this in just a minute.\nOur defense backlog remained very strong at $62 billion exiting the quarter, and total company backlog was $154 billion. Notable defense awards in the quarter included about $1.2 billion of classified bookings at RMD, including a significant competitive award, as well as $650 million for the SPY-6 full-rate production contract, and RIS booked about $1.1 billion of classified awards.\nOn the capital allocation front, we repurchased $743 million of RTX shares during the quarter, and we remain on track to repurchase at least $2.5 billion of share for the year. Yesterday, of course, you saw we increased our quarterly dividend by nearly 8% from $0.51 per share to $0.55, continuing our long history of growing and paying a dividend.\nSince completing the merger, we have returned nearly $9 billion to RTX shareowners. And by the end of this year, by the end of '22, that will be in excess of $13 billion. And of course, we remain committed to returning at least $20 billion to shareowners in the first 4 years following the merger. That shouldn't be an issue at all.\nOn the program execution front, we recently delivered the first LTAMDS unit into the U.S. Army test program. It's an important milestone for what will be a franchise program for RMD. And finally, we launched RTX Ventures to accelerate our pipeline of innovative technologies to grow -- to drive future growth and seed an ecosystem of groundbreaking technology companies.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Neil, and I'll get back for the wrap-up and Q&A. Neil?\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nWell, thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 3. As Greg noted, we delivered adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Sales of $15.7 billion were in-line with our expectations and up 4% organically versus the prior year.\nOur performance in the quarter was primarily driven by the continued recovery of domestic and short-haul international air travel that was partially offset by continued supply chain constraints across our businesses. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 was up 28% year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by commercial aftermarket at Collins; $0.04 of commercial OE timing at Pratt; and other corporate items, including lower tax expense, which more than offset the supply chain constraints.\nOn a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $0.74 per share and included $0.41 of acquisition accounting adjustments and net significant and/or nonrecurring items, which included $0.14 of charges associated with the impact of global sanctions on Russia. And free cash flow of $37 million was better than our expectations of an outflow of $500 million, driven primarily by working capital, most notably the timing of collections during the quarter.\nAnd finally, let me give you an update on our synergy progress. During the quarter, we achieved incremental gross cost synergies of about $90 million, putting us on track to achieve $335 million of incremental cost synergies for the full year.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to take you through the segment results, and I'll come back and share our thoughts on the rest of 2022. Jennifer?\n\nJennifer Reed\n\nVP of IR, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Neil. Starting with Collins Aerospace on Slide 4. Sales were $4.8 billion in the quarter, up 10% on an adjusted basis and up 11% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the continued recovery in the commercial aerospace end markets.\nBy channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 39%, driven by a 73% increase in provisioning, a 43% increase in parts and repair and 11% increase in modifications and upgrades. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%.\nCommercial OE sales were up 12% with strength in narrowbody, offsetting expected headwinds from lower 787 deliveries. And military sales were down 12%, driven primarily by supply chain constraints and expected declines in F-35 volume.\nAdjusted operating profit of $584 million was up $252 million from the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and OE volume more than offset lower military sales volume and higher SG&A expense.\nLooking ahead, as a result of ceasing activities with Russia, we now expect Collins' full year sales to be about $375 million lower than our prior expectations, but still expect their sales to grow low double digits. However, as a result of better mix and spending containment, we are maintaining Collins' full year operating profit range of up $650 million to $800 million versus 2021.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 5. Sales of $4.5 billion were up 12% on an adjusted basis and up 13% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the continued recovery of the commercial aerospace industry.\nCommercial aftermarket sales were up 37% in the quarter, with legacy large commercial engine shop visit inductions up 9% and Pratt Canada shop visits up 22%. Commercial OE sales were up 12%, driven by favorable mix within Pratt's large commercial engine business as well as higher general aviation platforms at Pratt Canada.\nIn the Military business, sales were down 11%, driven by F135 production contract award timing and lower expected production volume that were partially offset by higher F135 aftermarket volume. Adjusted operating profit of $308 million was up $268 million from the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales volume, favorable large commercial OE mix and higher Pratt Canada OE volume were partially offset by higher SG&A and E&D as well as lower military sales volume.\nLooking ahead, as a result of ceasing activities with Russia, we also now expect Pratt's full year sales to be about $375 million lower than our prior expectations and now expect their sales to grow high single to low double digits. However, as a result of better mix and spending containment, we are maintaining Pratt's full year operating profit range of up $500 million to $600 million versus 2021.\nTurning now to Slide 6. RIS sales of $3.6 billion were down 5% versus prior year on an adjusted basis, primarily driven by the divestiture of the Global Training and Service business. Sales were in-line with prior year on an organic basis. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $378 million was down $10 million versus prior year, primarily driven by the impact of the divestiture that was partially offset by net productivity across various programs.\nRIS had $2.6 billion of bookings in the quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.8 and a backlog of $17 billion. In addition to significant bookings that Greg mentioned, RIS also booked $311 million for the Next-Generation OPIR GEO. It's worth noting that we continue to expect RIS full year book-to-bill to be greater than 1.\nTurning to RIS' full year outlook. We continue to expect RIS sales to be down slightly on a reported basis and to grow low single digit on an organic basis. We also continue to expect RIS operating profit to be flat to up $50 million versus 2021.\nTurning now to Slide 7. RMD sales were $3.5 billion, down 7% on both an adjusted and organic basis, primarily driven by the continuing supply chain constraints and decline in certain Land Warfare and Air Defense programs. Adjusted operating profit of $387 million was $109 million lower than prior year, driven primarily by lower net program efficiencies and unfavorable program mix.\nRMD's bookings in the quarter were approximately $4.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.18 and a backlog of $29 billion. In addition to the awards that Greg discussed, RMD also booked about $385 million for Excalibur Rapid Demo for the U.S. Army; about $220 million for AIM-9X Sidewinder for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and international customers; and about $220 million for Patriot engineering support services for the U.S. Army and international customers.\nIt's worth noting that we now expect RMD's full year book-to-bill to be at least 1.1. Looking ahead, we continue to expect RMD sales to grow low to mid-single digit and operating profit growth of $150 million to $200 million versus 2021.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Neil to provide some color on the rest of the year.\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer. I'm on Slide 8. Let me give you some perspective on how we're thinking about the environment as we look ahead. I'll start with some of the positives. Despite the impact of COVID variants early in the year, we continue to expect that the commercial aerospace recovery will remain resilient and will drive growth in commercial aftermarket and narrowbody OE deliveries this year.\nNotwithstanding the fact that global RPMs grew roughly 4 points less than we expected in the first quarter, commercial aftermarket grew in-line with our expectations as operators began preparing their fleets for the summer travel season. At the same time, we're closely monitoring China domestic and international traffic. And as I've said before, our outlook assumes a significant improvement in widebody traffic during the balance of the year. That said, we continue to expect commercial traffic to return to 2019 levels by the end of next year.\nOn the defense side, as Greg mentioned, we are optimistic about the President's fiscal '23 budget request, which included a 5% base budget increase in the modernization accounts, where our investments in technology and innovation are well aligned to the administration's priorities, and our major programs are well supported. And while it's too early to quantify today, all of our businesses are positioned to support the expected growth in U.S. and international defense spending.\nOn the cost reduction front, we remain laser-focused on driving operational excellence to deliver further margin expansion, including $1.5 billion of total gross cost synergies. On the challenges side, we continue to see global supply chain, inflation and labor availability pressures across our businesses.\nAnd while we saw increasing risk in these areas during the first quarter, we remain focused on mitigating actions and expect supply chain constraints will ease later in the year. And finally, we continue to monitor the broader geopolitical environment, including the impact of global sanctions as well as the U.S. and global tax environment.\nTurning now to our outlook on Slide 9. As Greg discussed, due to ceasing business activities with Russia, we are reducing our full year sales outlook by $750 million, which, as we said, is split evenly between Collins and Pratt. We now see full year sales between $67.75 billion and $68.75 billion for the full year. However, from an earnings perspective, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $4.60 and $4.80 due to improving sales mix and spending containment at both Collins and Pratt.\nAnd on the cash front, we continue to expect free cash flow of about $6 billion. It's important to remind everyone that our cash flow outlook continues to assume that the legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes is deferred beyond 2022, which, as I've said before, the free cash flow impact of this legislation is approximately $2 billion for the year.\nSo with that, let me hand it back to Greg to wrap things up.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Neil. Just a couple of thoughts here on -- to our '22 priorities, which remain essentially unchanged. Obviously, we remain focused on supporting our customers, our employees, suppliers and communities so that we can actually execute on our mission of defending democracy and connecting the world.\nAnd today's environment reinforces the need for us to invest in innovative technologies to remain competitive, to drive industry leadership and to deliver the right solutions for our customers. We'll do this while driving operational excellence and remaining disciplined with our capital, including meeting our capital return commitments. And of course, we're committed to doing all of this responsibly, as evidenced by the publication of our first RTX ESG report yesterday, which builds upon our long history of best practices in this area.\nAnd finally, earlier this month, we celebrated the 2-year anniversary of our merger. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished together so far, and I want to thank all of our employees for all of their efforts during this very difficult and challenging period.\nI'm confident in the investment thesis we laid out at the investor conference last May. Our franchises are strong. We operate in resilient markets, and we have great technology. And importantly, we have experienced leadership that is focused on operational excellence and delivering on our long-term commitments.\nWith that, let me open up the call for questions. Ludi?",

My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. On the call today are Greg Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Neil Mitchill, Chief Financial Officer; and Jennifer Reed, Vice President of Investor Relations.

(Operator Instructions) With that, I will turn the call over to Mr. Hayes.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everybody. Happy Tuesday. 2021 was an important year for Raytheon Technologies. As we laid out our strategy at the beginning of last year, and that strategy, of course, is to drive top line growth, margin expansion and robust free cash flows through 2025 and beyond, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our businesses and returning significant capital to shareowners. .\nOur continued focus on operational excellence and program execution, along with our industry-leading technologies, positions us well to continue to capitalize on the commercial aerospace recovery and to grow our defense franchises. As you saw from our press release this morning, we delivered another solid quarter with strong full year financial results with both top and bottom line growth and $5 billion of free cash flow. That's more than double of what we delivered in 2020 on a pro forma basis.\nOur performance in 2021 gives us confidence in the long-term fundamentals of our businesses and that we're able to -- and that we're on track to deliver to the 2025 targets that we outlined last May at our investor conference.\nBefore I turn to the highlights, let me first provide some comments on the current market environment. During the quarter, commercial air traffic remained resilient despite the Omicron variant with global available seat miles, ASMs, growing about 1% sequentially in Q4. That's reflecting a continued recovery in air traffic despite the typical seasonal trends. Here, in the U.S., passenger traffic through TSA checkpoints also remained steady at about 1.9 million passengers per day. That's up almost 125% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, a remarkable recovery.\nOn the defense side, we're pleased to see the President signed the Bipartisan Defense Authorization bill into law at $740 billion. That's about $25 billion higher than the original Presidential request. And given the global threat environment, we continue to see strong demand internationally for our products and services. Our focused aerospace and defense portfolio, along with our $156 billion backlog gives us confidence in our ability to grow the business in 2022 and beyond.\nOkay. Turning to Slide 2, some highlights from the fourth quarter. As I said, we delivered strong financial performance in '21. Organic sales grew 1%, which is in line with our expectations, while adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the year, both above our initial expectations. And importantly, we saw margin expansion in all four of our businesses, with strong commercial aftermarket.\nOur defense backlog remained robust at over $63 billion, where RIS and RMD both ended the year with book-to-bill slightly above 1.0. In addition to several large awards earlier in the year, we also had several notable awards during the fourth quarter, including over $1.3 billion in classified bookings, plus over $670 million for the electrooptical infrared awards at RIS as well as $730 million in standard missile 2 production awards at RMD.\nWe also remain focused on operational excellence and program execution to drive structural cost reduction and productivity in our operations. In 2021, we achieved about $760 million in incremental cost synergies from the RTX merger, bringing us over $1 billion since the completion of the merger in April of 2020. That meets our original merger cost synergy target 2 years ahead of schedule. And there's always, of course, more to come and more to do there.\nIt's also worth noting that the Rockwell or the Collins Aerospace team achieved over $600 million in total Rockwell Collins synergies since the acquisition in November of 2018. They're meeting their commitment a year ahead of schedule despite the significant downturn in our commercial aerospace business.\nWe also continue to fine-tune our portfolio during the year. As you know, we completed the acquisition of SEAKR Engineering and FlightAware, which will expand and enhance our capabilities in key growth areas. And we completed the divestitures of Forcepoint. And in December, we completed the sale of RIS' global training and services business.\nOn the capital allocation front, we returned $5.3 billion to shareowners in '21 for a total of $7.4 billion since we closed on the merger. Well on track to the $20 billion plus that we've committed to in the first 4 years after the merger. As you saw in December, our Board of Directors also authorized a $6 billion share repurchase program, positioning us to continue returning significant capital to shareowners, including at least $2.5 billion of repurchases that we expect to complete in 2022. In addition to our strong financial performance during the year, we also achieved several notable strategic and operational milestones that I'd like to highlight.\nLet me start with Collins Aerospace. The business completed more than 750 Lean events in 2021. By utilizing our best practices from our core operating system, the team was able to reduce labor content on the F-18 heat exchanger by over 30%, reducing costs and importantly, creating capacity to support increased demand.\nAt Pratt, the team introduced the GTF advantage engine, which reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by a total of 17% compared to the prior generation engines. It extends the GTS lead as the most efficient power plant for the A320neo family. The engine will also be compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuels, supporting the aviation industry's goal to significantly reduce emissions in the coming decades.\nAt both RIS and RMD, they achieved significant program milestones in the quarter ahead of schedule. Through strong program execution in RIS, the joint precision approach and landing system program completed delivery on the first LRIP units 60 days ahead of schedule. This achievement has given the Navy the confidence to certify JPL on the CVN carrier and two amphibious ship classes. RMD team also successfully completed the initial integration of the SPY-6 radar and the USS Jack Lucas in the quarter. This is the first time power simultaneously applied to the entire radar system, completing a critical milestone for integration of the ship, its combat system and the SPY-6 radar.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Neil, and I'll come back at the end for a wrap up in Q&A. Neil?\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nCFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 3. I'm pleased with how we finished the year as well as our performance in the quarter where we continue to see solid growth in organic sales, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow.\nSales of $17 billion were in line with our expectations and were up 4% organically versus prior year on an adjusted basis. Our performance was primarily driven by the continued recovery of domestic short-haul international air travel, partially offset by continued supply chain pressures and lower 787 OE volume. It's worth noting that the global training and services divestiture at RIS closed in early December, resulting in a sales headwind of about $100 million versus our prior outlook.\nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by commercial aftermarket strength at both Collins and Pratt as well as favorability in our effective tax rate. On a GAAP basis, EPS from continuing operations was $0.46 per share and included $0.62 of acquisition accounting adjustments and net significant and/or nonrecurring items.\nAnd finally, free cash flow of $2.2 billion was in line with our expectations and resulted in full year free cash flow of $5 billion, which was $500 million better than our expectations at the beginning of the year primarily driven by higher net income and lower CapEx.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Jennifer to take you through the segment results, and I'll come back and share our thoughts on 2022. Jennifer?\n\nJennifer Reed\n\nVP of IR, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThanks, Neil. Starting with Collins Aerospace on Slide 4. Sales were $4.9 billion in the quarter, up 13% on both an adjusted and organic basis, driven primarily by the continued recovery in commercial aerospace end markets.\nBy channel, commercial aftermarket sales were up 47%, driven by a 59% increase in parts and repair, a 52% increase in provisioning and a 17% increase in modification and upgrades. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 10%, driven by strength in parts and repair. Commercial OE sales were up 4% with strength in narrow-body, offsetting headwinds from lower 787 deliveries. And military sales were down 3% on another tough compare.\nRecall, Collins military sales were up 7% organically in the same period last year. The decline in the quarter was driven primarily by lower F-35 volume. Adjusted operating profit of $469 million was up $380 million from the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, more than offset higher E&D and SG&A expense.\nShifting to Pratt & Whitney on Slide 5. Sales of $5.1 billion were up 14% on an adjusted basis and up 15% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the continued recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. Commercial OE sales were up 32% by higher GTF deliveries within Pratt's large commercial engine business as well as general aviation and biz jet platforms at Pratt Canada. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 28% in the quarter with legacy large commercial engine shop visits up 30% and Pratt Canada shop visits up 37%. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were up 17%.\nIn the military business, sales were down 6% as expected on another difficult compare. Recall, Pratt's military sales were up 18% in the same period last year. The decrease in the quarter was driven by lower spare sales on legacy programs. Adjusted operating profit of $162 million was up $57 million from the prior year. Drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales volume more than offset lower military volume, higher SG&A, E&D and the impact of higher commercial OE volume.\nTurning now to Slide 6. RIS sales of $3.9 billion were down 2% versus prior year on an adjusted basis and down 1% on an organic basis, reflecting 4 fewer workdays in the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the prior year. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $400 million was up $30 million versus prior year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies. RIS had $3.4 billion of bookings in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.97 and a backlog of $18 billion. In addition to the significant bookings that Greg discussed, RIS also booked $227 million for the next generation Jammer mid-band program in the quarter. RIS book-to-bill for the year was 1.01.\nTurning now to Slide 7. RMD sales was $3.9 billion, down 10% on an adjusted basis and down 8% on an organic basis, primarily driven by 4 fewer workdays in the quarter as well as lower material receipts and expected declines in several international production contracts. Adjusted operating profit of $486 million was $93 million lower than the prior year, driven by lower net program efficiencies and lower sales volume. RMD's bookings in the quarter were approximately $3.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.83 and backlog of $29 billion. In addition to the SM2 bookings Greg mentioned, RMD also booked $269 million for Evolve Missile Block 2. RMD's book-to-bill for the year was 1.02.\nBefore moving on, I would also like to comment on the previously disclosed DOJ investigation into cost accounting matters at legacy Raytheon's Company's former Integrated Defense Systems business or IDS, which is now part of RMD. As you will see in our upcoming 10-K filing, we have made progress in our internal investigation into the matter. And we now have determined that there is a probable risk of liabilities for damages, interest and penalties.\nIn addition to the amount recorded in the first quarter of 2021 in connection with the finalization of purchase accounting, we recorded an incremental accrual in the amount of $147 million during the fourth quarter relating to the matter, bringing our total reserve to approximately $290 million. We still do not currently believe the resolution of this matter will result in a material adverse impact to our financial condition, and we will continue to cooperate with the government's investigation.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Neil to provide some color on the rest of the year.\n\nNeil G. Mitchill\n\nCFO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer. I'm on Slide 8. So before I get into the specifics of our '22 financial outlook, let me give you some perspective on how we are thinking about the environment as we look ahead. .\nSo let me start with the positives. Despite the impact of COVID variance, we expect the commercial aerospace recovery will continue into 2022 with continued growth in commercial aftermarket and narrow-body OE deliveries driven by further strength in domestic traffic and growth in international traffic.\nBy the end of the year, we are assuming global RPMs recover to about 90% of 2019 levels with domestic travel recovering to be approximately in line with the 2019 levels and international travel recovering to between 75% and 80% of 2019 levels. The reopening of international borders specifically in the Asia Pacific region and the related wide-body traffic will be a significant factor in the timing and extent of the related aftermarket recovery.\nUltimately, the timing and trajectory of the overall recovery this year isn't likely to be linear and it will depend on our customers' fleet decisions and buying behavior. Looking longer term, we continue to expect commercial traffic to return to 2019 levels by the end of next year.\nOn the defense side, we expect continued organic growth in 2022 as we deliver on our $63 billion backlog, continued bipartisan support for the fiscal '22 defense budget and international demand for our products and technologies.\nAnd across RTX, we remain laser focused on driving operational excellence to deliver cost reduction and further margin expansion, including $335 million of incremental RTX merger cost synergies during 2022. And this keeps us on track to achieve $1.5 billion in gross cost synergies by Q1 of 2024.\nOn the challenges side, we anticipate that global supply chain and inflation pressures will continue, and that 787 build rates will remain low. With respect to the supply chain, we anticipate that COVID-related labor disruptions will persist through the first half of the year, but will ease through the second half of the year. And as we've discussed, a significant portion of our material spend is under long-term agreements. That said, we are assuming a level of inflationary pressure across our businesses and our outlook that will be partially offset by productivity improvements. And of course, we're continuing to monitor the U.S. and global tax environment and the current and potentially protracted continuing resolution. So with that backdrop, let me tell you how this translates to our financial outlook for the year.\nLet's turn to Slide 9. At the RTX level, we expect full year 2022 sales of between $68.5 billion and $69.5 billion. This represents organic growth of between 7% and 9% year-over-year. Keep in mind, the sale of RIS' global training and services businesses puts about $1 billion of sales headwind year-over-year as well as the associated profit.\nFrom an earnings perspective, we expect adjusted EPS of $4.60 to $4.80, up 8% to 12% year-over-year. And we expect to generate free cash flow of about $6 billion. That's up about 20% versus [2021]. It's important to note that this free cash flow outlook assumes that the legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes is deferred beyond 2022, which as we've said before, the free cash flow impact of this legislation is approximately $2 billion. It's also worth noting that if the legislation is not deferred, you would see about a $0.10 EPS benefit as well from the impacts of the RMD capitalization that would have components of our U.S. taxable income. And as Greg mentioned, we expect to buy back at least $2.5 billion of RTX shares over the year, subject to market conditions.\nWith that, let's move to Slide 10 for the segment outlooks. At Collins, we expect full year sales to be up low double digits and adjusted operating profit to grow between $650 million and $800 million versus last year. This is primarily driven by higher narrow-body OE deliveries and growth across all three commercial aftermarket channels, supporting both narrow- and wide-body aircraft. And military sales at Collins are expected to be up low single digit for the year.\nTurning to Pratt & Whitney. We see full year sales growing low double digits versus prior year, principally driven by higher OE deliveries in both Pratt's large commercial engine and Pratt Canada businesses, as well as continued growth in legacy large commercial engine and Pratt Canada shop visits.\nMilitary sales at Pratt are expected to be down mid-single digit, driven by lower F135 production inputs partially offset by higher F135 sustainment volume. With respect to operating profit, we see Pratt's adjusted operating profit growing between $500 million and $600 million versus last year, primarily on higher aftermarket volume and partially offset by higher large commercial OE engine deliveries and lower military volumes.\nTurning to RIS. We expect full year sales to be down slightly versus prior year on a reported basis and to grow low single digit on an organic basis with strength coming from classified programs and production ramps in airborne ISR and EWS. And we expect year-over-year adjusted operating profit at RIS to be flat to up $50 million, driven by higher net program efficiencies and volume.\nAt RMD, we see sales growing low single to mid-single digit, driven by growth across multiple programs and for adjusted operating profit to be up in the range of $150 million to $200 million versus prior year, driven by improved program performance and the volume. It's worth mentioning that we expect both RIS and RMD to again have a book-to-bill greater than 1.0 for the year.\nAnd finally, we expect intercompany sales wins to grow in line with total company sales. I will note that we've included in our outlook some of the below-the-line items and pension in the webcast appendices.\nSo turning now to Slide 11 for our '22 adjusted EPS walk. Starting with the segments. We expect the segments to generate about $0.83 of EPS growth at the midpoint of our outlook range. From there, pension will be a headwind, primarily due to lower CAS recovery and higher discount rates. Our tax rate in '22 is expected to be between 18.5% and 19% versus the 15.5% in 2021, primarily due to onetime tax benefits associated with the prior year optimization of our legal entity and operating structure that we realized in the third quarter that will not repeat. This will result in a $0.19 headwind. We expect corporate expenses to be a $0.06 headwind year-over-year due to higher investment-related RTX synergy projects and digital transformation initiatives that are partially offset by lower LTAM spend. And finally, lower share count, interest and other items are expected to be a $0.07 tailwind. All of this brings us to our outlook range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share.\nNow turning to free cash flow on Slide 12. We expect strong operational growth, along with lower restructuring to contribute about $1.5 billion of free cash flow growth in 2022. These will be partially offset by expected pension headwinds and higher cash taxes to get to our free cash flow outlook of about $6 billion. Again, this outlook assumes the legislation requiring RMD capitalization for tax purposes is deferred.\nAnd lastly, before turning it back to Greg, a couple of comments on the first quarter. With respect to sales, we expect sales to be up mid-single digit organically versus prior year, driven by the continued commercial aerospace recovery and partially offset by lower defense sales driven by continuing supply chain pressures and the impact of Omicron. And again, just to remind you, the prior year included Q1 sales of about $200 million as well as the associated profit for the divested RIS services business.\nOn the adjusted EPS side, we see low double-digit to mid-teens growth in the quarter versus prior year. And for cash, we expect to see an outflow of about $500 million in the quarter due to typical seasonal factors in the timing of collections.\nSo with that, let me hand it back to Greg to wrap things up.\n\nGregory J. Hayes\n\nPresident, Chairman & CEO, Raytheon Technologies Corporation\n\nOkay. Thanks, Neil. We're on Slide 13. So a lot of moving pieces as always. But I would tell you, we actually exited 2021 with really good momentum across the businesses. And we expect to make further progress on our priorities here as we enter into 2022.\nFirst and foremost, let me repeat that we're focused on keeping our employees safe, keeping our commercial customers flying and protecting the war fighter while they defend our country and allies and of course, supporting our suppliers. We're also going to continue to invest in differentiated technology and innovation to maintain our industry-leading positions, which will drive growth over the long term, and of course, to capitalize on our growing end markets.\nAt the same time, our leadership team is making significant progress to reduce structural costs, drive operational efficiency through our core operating system and to deliver on our synergy commitments. Finally, we remain disciplined with capital allocation. We have a very strong balance sheet, along with our cash-generating capabilities supports investments in our businesses and our commitment to returning capital to shareowners, including at least $20 billion in the first 4 years following the merger, as I said earlier.\nI'm confident in our ability to deliver both top and bottom line growth and margin expansion across our businesses this year as we continue to leverage the growth opportunities that are in front of us.\nSo with that, let's turn it over to Lisa, and we'll take whatever questions you might have. Thank you.",

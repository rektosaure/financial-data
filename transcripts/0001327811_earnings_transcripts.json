At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the call. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to one. I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Workday\n\nThank you, Operator. Welcome to Workday's third quarter, fiscal 2026 earnings conference call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO, Zane Rowe, our CFO, and Gerrit Kazmaier, our President, Product and Technology. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nPlease refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2025 annual report on Form 10-K, for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, GAAP results.\nYou can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the investor relations page of our website. The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the investor relations link. Additionally, the prepared remarks of this call and our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our investor relations website following this call.\nOur fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 quiet period begins on 15 January 2026. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2025. With that, I will hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered solid Q3 results, with 15% subscription revenue growth and 28.5% non-GAAP operating margin. Our teams executed well, and our value proposition is clearly resonating with organizations around the world. I've been on the road a lot lately, meeting with our customers and prospects, and they're all saying the same thing. They see the potential of AI, but they're stuck with disconnected systems, bad data, and closed platforms. That is where Workday gives them the ultimate advantage.\nBy unifying HR and finance on one intelligent platform, we deliver business-ready AI that helps organizations adapt quickly, make better decisions, and deliver outcomes that truly matter. Now let's turn to our customer highlights for the quarter. In Q3, we continued to grow across industries, segments, and geographies. In HCM, we added new customers, including Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, Fuji Electric, and Magnum Ice Cream Company. Core financials also performed well, driving strong full-suite adoption.\nIn fact, half of all net new global deals in Q3 included both HR and finance, with key wins such as Ardent Health, Kelly Services, and Specialized. We also expanded with customers such as CommonSpirit Health, Levi Strauss, and Novartis. Consistent with recent quarters, our customers' headcount levels continue to grow modestly. Our momentum isn't just from large enterprises. Workday GO is helping us drive strong new customer growth and continued ACV momentum in the medium enterprise.\nJust last week, we announced a major expansion of Workday GO, including global payroll, an expanded partner network, and a new AI-powered deployment agent that can cut implementation time by up to 25%. Customers of all sizes and industries tell us that an investment in Workday is an investment in their AI strategy. More than 75% of our core customers are using Workday Illuminate AI, driving well over 1 billion AI actions on the Workday platform this year alone. Adoption keeps growing. More than three quarters of net new deals and 35% of customer expansions included one or more AI products.\nAmong the standouts, Evisort delivered another record quarter, and Extend Pro grew net new ACV by more than 50% year-over-year. Altogether, our AI products added more than one and a half points of ARR growth this quarter. That does not include Paradox, which we closed in Q3 and is already off to a strong start. With the rollout of flex credits early next year, we are making it even easier for our customers to adopt our AI and platform innovation. Our customer footprint spans every major industry. Tech and media and financial services, two of our billion-dollar industries, were standout performers in the quarter.\nIn Q3, healthcare became our sixth industry to exceed $1 billion in ARR, with strategic wins like Ardent Health, Ascendion, and Northeast Georgia Medical Center. One of my favorites this quarter was a major win back at a large US health insurer. They were a longtime Workday customer that moved to a competitor several years ago and quickly regretted it. Now they're back with Workday and choosing our full suite with a 10-year commitment. Our public sector momentum was also strong in Q3, and despite the weeks-long government shutdown, engagement across federal agencies remained high.\nThe Department of Energy's successful go-live in Q3 is a great example. They're the first cabinet-level agency to bring their core HR systems into our FedRAMP-authorized cloud. We're also nearing completion of the first phase of our work with the DIA. This opens up an important long-term opportunity, both with the agency and across the intelligence community and Department of War. In SLED, we welcome new customers, including the County of San Luis Obispo, the City of Concord, and Cleveland State University. We expanded with Cornell University, which added both core financials and students.\nWhile we had a number of successes across our Fed, SLED, and healthcare teams, we also saw some isolated impacts within institutions that rely heavily on federal grants, primarily in higher ed. However, when they are ready to move forward, our win rates are very strong, and we're excited by the long-term opportunity ahead. Across all of these industries, we're delivering innovation that's changing how work gets done, and the market is taking notice.\nGartner just named Workday a leader in three Magic Quadrants, including Cloud ERP for service-centric enterprises, Cloud HCM suites for 1,000+ employee enterprises, and the first-ever MQ for Cloud ERP finance, giving us the highest placement for both ability to execute and completeness of vision. If you joined us at Workday Rising, you saw how our organic innovation is only accelerating. We introduced new Illuminate agents that tackle some of the toughest challenges at work, from performance reviews and workforce planning to financial close.\nThese purpose-built agents are powered by our unmatched HR and financial data and context, which is what makes them highly accurate, actionable, and trusted. Now we have more than 150 customers, including Target, Accenture, and Netflix, using our agents and agent system of record in early access. At the same time, we're opening up our platform so customers and partners can create their own AI-powered apps and agents with Workday Build.\nWith Workday Data Cloud, along with our partners, including Databricks, Salesforce, Snowflake, and now Google Cloud, customers can unlock even more insight and value from their Workday data. We're also accelerating our innovation through strategic acquisitions. We just closed our acquisition of Sana, an AI-native platform with an incredible team. They're going to help us completely reimagine our user experience for the age of AI. Our vision is very simple and straightforward: make Workday the new front door to work by bringing together enterprise knowledge, AI agents, and all the HR and finance processes our customers run every day.\nThis will make it easier than ever to find answers, take action, and learn right in Workday. Customer feedback on this vision has been absolutely incredible. Sana Learn brings hyper-personalized skill development and AI-generated content creation to Workday Learning. I can't wait for our customers to get their hands on it. We're not stopping there. Last week, we announced the intent to acquire Pipedream, a low-code integration platform for AI agents with more than 3,000 pre-built connectors to the world's most widely used business applications like Asana, Jira, and Slack.\nWhen you combine that reach with Workday's trusted data, deep business context, and the capabilities from Sana and Flowise, our agents move from surfacing insights to truly getting work done. Hopefully, you're seeing a theme here. While other vendors confuse the market with thousands of overlapping, general-purpose agents, we're focused on what we do best, and that is building powerful agents for HR and finance that deliver real ROI and measurable business value. Turning to international, we delivered solid performance across EMEA, APAC, and Japan in Q3.\nWe just wrapped up our largest EMEA Rising yet. There we announced the new Workday EU Sovereign Cloud, which will let customers run our AI-powered HR and finance solutions entirely within the EU, keeping their data local, secure, and fully controlled. Also in Q3, we established a new AI Center of Excellence in Dublin, which is one of our major R&D hubs, and we announced a new office in Dubai. A few of the great wins we had across EMEA in Q3 included Bayer, ING Bank, and Tandem Bank. APAC also had a strong quarter with wins at Genesis Energy, DBS Bank, and MGM Grand Paradise.\nWe continued to build on our success in Japan with new and expanded relationships with Pioneer Corporation, Hoshino Resorts, and Eisai. Our partners continue to play a critical role in our success. Once again in Q3, more than 20% of our net new ACV was sourced from partners, a testament to the strength of our ecosystem. In Q3, we brought on new Workday Wellness partners, including Chime, Spring Health, and Strada, to expand the value we deliver to our joint customers. We also expanded our partnership with Microsoft to help joint customers securely manage their people and agents across both of our platforms.\nWe're living in a new era of work, powered by AI and built on trust, and Workday is made for this moment. The momentum in our business and the energy I'm seeing across our customer community gives me a ton of confidence in what's ahead. A huge thank you to our global workmates, our customers, and our partners for helping us deliver another solid quarter. As we head into Q4, we're focused on finishing strong and setting ourselves up for an even more impactful FY 2027. With that, I'll turn it over to Zane.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nThanks, Carl. Thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q3 results were driven by continued progress across several key growth initiatives as we accelerate innovation throughout the platform and bring exciting AI solutions to market. Turning to results, subscription revenue in the third quarter was $2.244 billion, up 15%. Professional services revenue was $188 million, resulting in total revenue of $2.432 billion, growth of 13%. US revenue in Q3 totaled $1.825 billion, up 12%. International revenue totaled $607 million, up 13%. 12-month subscription revenue backlog, or cRPO, was $8.21 billion at the end of Q3, increasing 17.6%.\nWe closed the Paradox acquisition in the quarter, which added over a point of cRPO growth and was not included in our backlog guidance. Excluding Paradox, cRPO came in slightly above the high end of our outlook. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $25.96 billion, up 17%, and gross revenue retention rates remained healthy at 97%. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $692 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5%. We remained focused on making targeted investments to support long-term growth.\nThis includes increasing our AI talent, both organically and inorganically, entering new markets such as the Middle East and India, and investing in the medium enterprise. While we make these investments, we're also continuing to drive efficiencies as we scale the business globally. Q3 operating Kash flow was $588 million, growth of 45%, in line with our expectations. As we discussed at our recent financial analyst day, we intend to accelerate the pace of our buyback. We made good progress in Q3, repurchasing $803 million of our shares during the quarter, and $1.4 billion year to date.\nWe plan to repurchase an additional $3.6 billion through the end of FY 2027, leading to $5 billion in total repurchases. As of 31 October, we had $4.4 billion remaining under our current authorization. We ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in Kash and marketable securities. Our headcount as of 31 October stood at 20,588 workmates around the globe, including roughly 600 workmates from the Paradox acquisition. Now turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect subscription revenue of $2.355 billion, growth of 15%, which includes revenue from the Sana acquisition, and the expected delivery on the first phase of the DIA contract.\nWe expect FY 2026 subscription revenue of $8.828 billion, growth of 14%. Our Q4 subscription revenue guidance is consistent with our view from last quarter, excluding the expected contribution from Sana. While we did see some impact in Fed and SLED tied to fiscal funding, this was offset by strong execution across the portfolio, including the Paradox acquisition. We expect cRPO to increase between 15% and 16 in Q4. This includes approximately a quarter of a point of expected growth from the Sana acquisition, or about $20 million, and over a point of impact from tenants, which we begin to lap in Q1.\nFor Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $168 million, and for the full year, we expect it to be $715 million. We're executing well against our efficiency goals and expect a non-GAAP operating margin of at least 28.5% for Q4, and approximately 29% for the full year. We're optimistic about the AI-driven growth investments we are making and have ample capacity to continue to invest while we drive further efficiencies, consistent with the framework from our financial analyst day.\nWe expect GAAP operating margins to be approximately 19 and 21 points lower than our Q4 and full-year FY 2026 non-GAAP operating margins, respectively. The FY 2026 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%. We're increasing our FY 2026 operating Kash flow outlook to $2.90 billion, and we continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, resulting in free Kash flow of $2.70 billion, growth of 23%. Looking beyond this year, as we shared at our recent financial analyst day, we are targeting a subscription revenue CAGR of 12% to 15 through FY 2028, along with continued margin expansion on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nFor FY 2027 specifically, we continue to expect subscription revenue growth of approximately 13%, also consistent with the view we shared in September at our analyst day. We are confident in this growth rate based on the momentum we see across the business, as reflected in our Q3 performance, as well as our Q4 cRPO guidance. We are optimistic about our growth initiatives, our recent acquisitions, and look forward to updating you with formal guidance for FY 2027 next quarter.\nWe currently expect our Q1 FY 2027 subscription revenue growth to be approximately 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality from Q4, as well as the expected revenue from DIA in Q4, which does not extend into Q1. We believe that the completion of this first phase sets us up for a larger opportunity with the DIA and the broader defense and intelligence communities. We remain on track and confident in our ability to achieve the financial framework we laid out at our analyst day back in September, including subscription revenue growth, non-GAAP margins, and stock-based compensation.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our workmates, customers, and partners around the globe that helped deliver this quarter's results. We enter Q4 well-positioned to close the year with strength and remain focused on our long-term opportunity of driving durable growth while expanding operating margins. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now begin conducting our question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Our first question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much. I'll add my congrats on a very nice performance. Carl, we're hearing some feedback that the venture-backed vibe-coding startups have started seeing a slowdown, or at least some of them have, or elevated churn. It's happening because companies are finding it's pretty difficult to operationalize them and put them into production use. I'm wondering if you're seeing any signs of some of that novelty wearing off for those third-party vibe-coding products. If so, do you see any accelerated adoption of Workday Extend, where presumably they'd have all the security and all the other infrastructure already in place?\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. Hi, Mark. Thanks for the question. Before I answer, I just wanted to say the following. Q3, Mark, was another solid quarter for Workday, reflecting the strength, and as I always like to say, the diversity and durability of our business. Our customers are seeing clear ROI from Workday, and they're engaging more than ever. We had more than $1 billion AI actions year to date, and it's only growing faster and faster. We feel really good about the momentum of the business as we head into Q4 and into FY 2027. I'm truly grateful for all the work both our partners and our workmates have done to get us to this point in the year.\nIt's been a really good year for us so far. Mark, I really appreciate your question. It's similar to what Kash asked last quarter when he talked about all of this potential disruption coming from these AI startups to more mature and larger SaaS companies like Workday. At the time, I said I thought it was a completely overblown narrative, and I thought it was flat-out wrong. Quite frankly, fast-forwarding 90 days, I think that's playing out exactly like we thought it would.\nWhen I spend time with CXOs around the world, at both customers and prospects, they talk about three things that's hindering or slowing down enterprise adoption of AI: data quality, data integrity, and security. By the way, none of these are an issue for Workday. As you know, we have one of the largest, cleanest, and most highly curated data sets for HR and finance in the industry, no questions asked.\nWe have the security, compliance, and controls in place because today we onboard a large portion of the world's workforce, and we can apply those same processes and procedures to your workforce of the future, both human and digital. When we spend time with our customers, while maybe they're enamored with these point solutions, they're ultimately coming back to the vendors they trust, who have been in their infrastructure for a long time, have that data set, and drive real business outcomes.\nThe narrative we've been hearing the last couple of quarters is changing, and it's coming back to those who are highly penetrated in the enterprise, already providing value, and are deeply trusted by our customers. I agree with what you're seeing. We're seeing it, we're hearing it, and it's reflected in customers continuing to bet on Workday for their future.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks very much, and congrats on the solid quarter. Carl, the other narrative that often comes up these days is clients see a big customer laying off people. I know you guys commented that your customers are growing headcount slowly right now. What are the mechanisms that you guys have if a customer were to have to lay off people to be able to keep growing ACV with them?\nObviously, cross-sell, upsell, are there discounts that go away? Can you explain that a little bit? I think people believe there's sort of a linear relationship between number of on a per-seat basis. I realize it's probably a little bit more complicated than that, especially at the high end of your business. Thanks.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nThanks, Kirk. I appreciate the question. Yeah, in my prepared marks, I once again want to articulate and share that on a net basis, the headcount of our customer base is up year-over-year. While there are some layoffs out there, we're still growing headcount across our customer base. What we're doing, you said it, we are selling back into our base. We're focused not on just seats, but actually revenue per seat. What we have now more than ever is a whole bunch of new solutions, both organically innovated solutions and solutions we got through acquisition, that we're selling back into our customer base.\nWhether it's Evisort, whether it's HiredScore, now it's Sana, now it's Paradox, now it's Flowise, we have so much more to sell back into our customer base. That drives strength for us and offsets any potential impact we might see from headcount reductions in our customers. Also, our customers do do true-ups with us both annually on their headcount. We do have floors and minimums that the customer can bring their headcount down, and that gives us some protection.\nOverall, we're still seeing growth in headcount year-over-year, and we're selling just a lot more back into our customer base because they're betting on our platform, and they're using us as a consolidation platform across all of their point solutions to drive a better total cost of ownership.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nHey, Kirk, I just add, if you look at the aggregate, it is a net positive, but it's not a significant amount of our growth. There are lots of elements, as Carl alluded to, that go into that growth number, and this is just one of them.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nSenior Managing Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on the solid quarter. I wanted to ask about some of the early success you guys are seeing with your AI solutions. Carl, I think on the call you said a point and a half of growth in ARR already coming from those AI solutions. Can you give us any rules of thumb that you're starting to see that could help us maybe model this out a little bit in terms of what type of uplift do you see on a typical deal or for a typical customer when they're buying the AI solutions? How broad is this?\nWhat percentage of your customer base has already bought into the solutions, and how far do we have to go? Just something to help us extrapolate that early success into what this might look like in a year from now or two years from now.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Keith. We gave some of these statistics at FAD just 90 days ago. That's why we called out again this quarter. Our AI solutions are adding a point and a half of growth to our ARR. We're also trying to give you some color specifically on the strength of our AI solutions. For example, 75% of our new sales included an AI solution. 35% of our sales back to our customer base includes AI.\nWe're seeing really good traction, and we're seeing really good early indications of demand from some of our acquired companies like Sana and Paradox. Overall, our AI momentum is as strong, if not stronger, than ever, and it's being reflected in how our customers are buying our product, both at time of new sales as well as our ability to sell back into our customer base.\nI couldn't be more excited about where we're at. Things like Evisort had a record quarter. We're seeing an acceleration in growth in Evisort. Extend Pro, we call that out, once again grew 50% year-over-year. When we sell back into our customers, for example, when we sell something like a HiredScore recruiting agent, it's a significant uptick over what we would sell our standard recruiting SKU for.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Any sense on how much of an uplift it is versus the standard?\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. For example, on HiredScore, for every dollar of recruiting we sell, we sell about $2.50 of HiredScore on top of it.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. That's super helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question, and congrats on the results as well. I guess just a two-parter for me. I guess first, I wanted to zoom in on some of the early feedback around Paradox and Sana, just what you're hearing from customers coming out of Rising and if that can help the Workday business model continue to evolve towards just some of the questions around AI and agentic capabilities that you're offering alongside the Flex Credit program.\nZane, maybe just coming out of Rising, an update on how you're thinking about the trade-offs between growth and margin given some of the recent additions in the product portfolio and some of that feedback there as well. Thank you.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to both Gerrit and Zane specifically to follow up on the questions. First, as you know, we've closed the Paradox acquisition in October. Within two weeks, we were already off and selling it. It had a small impact in the quarter, a few million dollars over a two-week period, just by our sales force going out and selling that into the market. I will tell you, coming out of Rising EMEA, the demand and excitement for Paradox in being a Workday product and selling it on our paper was very, very strong.\nOn Sana, similar feedback from our customers. They see this as an extremely powerful AI solution across multiple dimensions, starting with learning. We can now sell their AI learning platform back into and on top of our 4,000 customers that have Workday Learning today. Obviously, we're going to refresh our UI/UX leveraging the Sana platform going forward. The early indication specifically on these two recent acquired companies is as strong as anything we've seen when we acquire a company. Maybe, Gerrit, you can talk specifically about Sana because that one is off the charts right now from a demand and from an excitement from our customers.\n\nGerrit Kazmaier\n\nPresident of Product and Technology, Workday\n\nYeah. As Carl has said, we are seeing tremendous interest around the three main vectors of Sana. One is, as Carl has said, it's the leading AI learning platform. Very natural for us to bring this to our customers, of which we have a very scaled base of Workday Learning customers which are using Sana and are excited about Sana as a learning AI experience platform on top of that. Very natural, very immediate interest.\nSecondly, what Carl has mentioned, Sana is also now being developed into the leading UI experience for Workday. You can think about a complete conversational experience around the Workday platform. Workday being the innovation leader, and our customers are tremendously excited about the massive simplification that brings to them. If you imagine every employee having access to HR and finance AI at scale, what that means in cost reduction. On the other side, you can see what drives that interest.\nThirdly, Sana goes much more beyond that, and I would recommend you look at the big picture with also Pipedream adding 3,000 connectors to the Sana platform, which now allows our customers to take Sana knowledge management actions in Workday, and the actions that Pipedream adds to really drive enterprise-wide AI transformation with that model. We see very strong customer interest across all of those three vectors.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nHey, Michael, this is Zane. I'll just add, as you can hear between Carl and Gerrit, we're thrilled with the early success that we're seeing from both Paradox and Sana. As it relates to our financial framework, I'd say no change at all. We continue to invest in AI, both organically and inorganically, and are pleased with the investments we're making there, and at the same time, recognizing the efficiencies and scale that we're driving across the business. We're still driving that within the framework and very pleased with the progress we're making there.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Technology Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Just with Paradox, I know that SAP and other ERP and HCM bases are using that. Is your vision that you can sell this anywhere, that you're going to be agnostic to whatever platform is running the back? How are you thinking about that from a go-to-market?\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah, thanks, Brent. We are super excited about the go-to-market capabilities we have around Paradox. Number one, we can sell it back into our customers as an attachment to our already strong recruiting platform, including something like HiredScore. Now we have Paradox, so we have the industry-leading AI recruiting platform out there today.\nAt the same time, this is now a new product that is a land-only product for our sales force who can now go and sell Paradox not only on top of Workday or back into our install base, but also into our competitors' environment. In fact, a significant portion of their existing customers aren't Workday today. We're going to continue to leverage that go-to-market model. It gives us another land product without someone having to decide completely on Workday, HR, or finance. They can go just with Paradox. I've seen that come up multiple times just in the first 60 days of us having this great asset.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Technology Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Zane, real quick, just on cRPO, is there anything to consider in the guide that you're maybe highlighting as a headwind, tailwind, any change to how you're thinking about that in terms of how we should think about modeling it?\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nNo, I mean, I think it's fairly clean, Brent. Obviously, we feel good about what we saw in the third quarter. I mentioned that Paradox was over a point of that. We feel very confident. Obviously, as always, cRPO, the number of factors, both the net new business as well as renewal activity and just the volume that you get in any particular quarter. We think we've got great strength heading into the fourth quarter. We've got terrific coverage on our expected subscription growth heading into next year, which I alluded to as you think about even between the fourth quarter and the first quarter.\nNo, we feel good about the cRPO growth as well as the coverage. Net-net, we feel good even on a sequential basis. I did call out how much of that was Sana as well, which is a very small impact on revenue for the fourth quarter.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Technology Sector Leader, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOh, thank you. Hey, Zane, maybe we can just continue that conversation. If we try to take your Q4 cRPO, 15% to 16, and normalize it by deducting maybe some of the one-time stuff, just so I've got the thinking right, maybe a point year-over-year from the tenant contracts, maybe a point year-over-year from Paradox, and a quarter from Sana. So maybe two and a quarter points from more unusual stuff to back out to get to more normalized. Is that roughly the right math?\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nYeah, Karl. I mean, there are lots of things you can sort of move around within that cRPO growth. I mean, I think you've got it sort of generally in line. Again, there are other variables within the timing on renewal activity and things like that. One other callout I'll make if you're trying to understand sort of those components between the organic and the inorganic component in the fourth quarter is I'd say that both Sana and Paradox contribute roughly a point and a half to our Q4 subscription revenue growth.\nJust to help you contextualize that, I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, absent Sana, we believe our Q4 was consistent with our view just a quarter ago. We feel great about the activity there. That helps you understand sort of the components of Q4 and the cRPO growth heading into the quarter and into next year.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Zane, thanks. Maybe just in the spirit of a follow-up on Q4, this time on subrevs, it sounds like it's embedding a view of reaching those DIA go-live milestones. I'm assuming that given that there's just two months left in the fiscal year, you and Carl are feeling pretty good about that. Obviously, the shutdown, I suspect, didn't help. Can you just maybe express confidence level in hitting those DIA go-lives? Thank you.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nYeah, it's a great callout. We're highly confident. Just to give you a sense of size on that one, it's roughly $15 million in the fourth quarter. We feel great about the progress we've been making all year. We're tracking it very closely, and it's embedded in our forecast for the fourth quarter.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. Yeah, Karl. We're tracking really well towards the contract requirements that give us that $15 million in Q4. We're already talking to them about an expansion of taking that platform to the next level, which opens up a whole bunch of different opportunities across a broader Department of Defense or Department of War. We're really excited about the momentum we're seeing with the federal government in this DIA project, or the first phase of it is really opening us up to a great opportunity going forward. As I said, we're already negotiating a follow-on to take that platform to the next level with further security requirements they're asking us for.\n\nKarl Keirstead\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThat's great news. Thank you both.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nThanks, Karl.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOh, great. Thank you so much. It's clear from all the announcements and what we saw out of the conference that you're really going for with AI, the Sana acquisition, Paradox, more recently Pipedream, that partnership with Microsoft. I mean, how should we read that?\nShould we think of this as kind of a year where you're building the foundation for AI and agents and that 1.5% points of growth coming from AI goes materially higher perhaps in fiscal 2028, or is this more of a 2027 event just given where you are with all the great innovation that you're kind of bringing together and the time it might take for that to kind of sink into the sales cycle and pipelines? Thank you.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Brad. I'm going to turn it over to Gerrit to give some color, and then I'll talk about it in the context of growth.\n\nGerrit Kazmaier\n\nPresident of Product and Technology, Workday\n\nYeah. I think, first of all, for us, this is a continuation. As Carl has said, we have 1.4 billion AI actions already in production in the Workday platform today. We have been doing this at Workday extremely successfully. Now we are just taking the next steps in leading AI technology to help our customers become truly AI-driven enterprises. Specifically, the vectors of our innovation is with Paradox and in a bigger picture frontline, fully bringing AI automation to the entire hiring journey. If you put that together with our recruiting agent, Paradox as a candidate engagement agent in connection with each other, it basically builds the AI-driven talent suite.\nWhat they're doing with Sana is we are acquiring leading knowledge management and a leading agent orchestrator to be the AI experience layer across Workday. Very important when we think about AI adoption that our conviction is AI is going to be the new UI, and that all of the legacy vendors who are not having leading experiences are going to get relegated through that.\nThirdly, what you mentioned about Pipedream, right? Our ambition and our customers' requirements are actually taking us much broader than Workday is in finance and HR, and really looking for enterprise-wide orchestration. We think about it as an enterprise AI fabric that we are creating through Pipedream, with Sana as the experience layer on top, built on top of Workday's business process platform.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah, Brad, the only color I'd add there is clearly we're going all in on AI, and it's for the following reason. We're uniquely positioned versus everyone else out there today. We have the data, right? We have the context of the data, and we're built into business workflow. Our customers are saying time and time again, they no longer want to even evaluate point AI solutions. They want to do it on the back of a trusted platform. Therefore, we go and we get something like Paradox, we get Pipedream, we get Sana. Last year, Evisort. Before that, we get HiredScore. It's not just our customers who are saying they believe in our platform, it's partners.\nTo your point, we're partnering with Microsoft. As they start to build agents, they see the most secure, reliable, and trusted way to onboard their agents is through Workday and our agent system of record because no one has more experience in onboarding employees than Workday. Now we're taking that to the digital worker as well.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat to hear. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you so much, Brad. Following Brad. Congrats, guys, on a good quarter, and thanks for taking the question. My question is about Workday GO, where we continue to hear really good things, particularly in ME and emerging enterprise. It was interesting to see it soon to be more broadly available. Perhaps looking at AI from a different angle, is there anything different Workday needs to deliver from an AI product perspective for the down-market customer versus large enterprise? Thanks.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. Let me have Gerrit take that, and then I'll talk more about Workday GO and the big announcement we had at Rising EMEA last week.\n\nGerrit Kazmaier\n\nPresident of Product and Technology, Workday\n\nYeah. Specifically, the AI side, Brad, there are two things to consider, right? One is that also medium-sized companies want to benefit from the best AI. Of course, they're going to get the full power of Workday's AI agents also delivered in Workday GO. That's the first part, very important. Secondly, we are specifically innovating around Workday GO with specific AI models.\nThink about the whole configuration, administration, management of the system, setup complexity. We are working and announced a new deployment agent, which already is slashing deployment time and complexity down by a significant degree. It's a key investment theme for us. Just connecting it back to the broader partner network, specifically with Workday GO to new managed services like payroll.\nWe are working on payroll AI that is securely being connected into our ASOR with our partners that are providing these services to also drive payroll automation, payroll simplification, benefits management across the Workday GO global partner network. That is specifically being created all from that angle to make the mid-market customer run at the scale of Workday, but with unmatched simplicity.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. Brad, we announced Workday GO, as I call it, 2.0 last week at EMEA Rising. I will tell you, to Gerrit's point, the feedback was unbelievable. With three key components to it, we now offer global payroll if a customer wants it. By the way, if they do not want to use a managed global payroll service from Workday, they can bring their own payroll.\nWe have a partner network that's going to help us take Workday GO to the market around the world and resell it on our behalf. We have that AI deployment agent. Also included in Workday GO is a payroll agent to help people simplify how they're managing their payroll activity across the enterprise. Workday GO, I will tell you, is on fire. People are excited about it, and people are leaning into Workday down market as we aggressively go attack that market segment around the world.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nNo, we really hear it's working well. Thank you so much for taking the question.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nThank you, Brad.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a quick two-parter, Carl. First, for you, when you think about the commentary for next year, it's great to hear about the kind of reiterating the conference and the growth rate of 13%. Since Analyst Day, is there anything that maybe you've seen that gives you even more confidence when you're talking with customers around things like budgets or their demand environments as we head into 2026 or propensity to maybe allocate more from the AI budget specifically to Workday that you can kind of comment on that gives you that confidence?\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. Thanks, Alex, for the question. As Zane said in his prepared remarks, we feel really good about our midterm guide that we laid out for next year, and we think the approximate 13% guide on subscription revenue next year is solid. That being said, we feel really good about all the acquired companies and the momentum we're seeing early on with them, as well as the organic innovation that we have coming out of our super strong product and technology organization.\nWe haven't even talked about it, but we're also entering new markets like we've done the last couple of years in the federal market here in the US. We're taking that to the public sector around the world. We announced entrance into the Middle East. Next week, we have a strong team led by Rob, our president of customer operations, going and launching our efforts in India. We're really excited about all the growth vectors that we have going into next year, as well as all the momentum we have around our AI solutions, both organic solutions and these inorganic solutions that we're getting through M&A.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Maybe just, Zane, as a follow-up, if we think about next year's guide, that 13, and the acquisitions that you've made over the last couple of months, A, kind of how much do we think kind of comes from inorganic there? The pace of M&A, are we kind of through? Should we think about this pace continuing at current course and speed of these exciting technology tuck-ins? Or do you need to digest the ones that you've made here over the course of the next few months, quarters?\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nSure. Yeah. Look, I'll start with, as we think about the acquired revenue, I mean, first off, as you know and as you can see here, when we acquire companies, they quickly become part of the broader portfolio. If you look at the acquired revenue, I'd say it probably contributes approximately a point into next year. As you can tell, there's a lot more that we're doing around it, and the whole portfolio benefits. There's significant synergy if you want to think about it more broadly.\nOn the acquired revenue, I'd call it roughly a point heading into next year. We have a high bar on M&A. As we've talked about all along, I mean, we've kept consistent in thinking about the technology, the culture, the people, and how they integrate, either whether it's through adjacencies or tuck-ins or for different reasons. I'd say no change in how we think about that, and no change in how we incorporate that inorganic growth.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nCFO, Workday\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, perfect. Thanks for squeezing me in. International is a big general driver for you. You mentioned a little bit of that, but if I look at the growth rates, there's not that much difference between US and international. Can you talk a little bit of what you saw in the quarter? Maybe there was more on the pipeline build, etc. Thank you.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nYeah. Thanks, Raimo. I hope you're well. We were really pleased with our international performance. When I say international performance, it's across the three major regions that we describe as international: Europe, APAC, and Japan. All three of those markets had a really good quarter for us. We've historically been talking about our performance in Europe when we talked about our international results. This quarter, we're talking about it in the context of Europe, APAC, and Japan because all three delivered solid results in the quarter.\nI think that's driven by two things. Number one, on the product side, we continue to internationalize and localize our product to serve all of these markets. Number two, we're leveraging a strong network of partners out there around the world to enter these markets. The third is we continue to attract great talent to lead our Workday efforts around the world. The international market had great results, and we expect that momentum to continue as we see customers more and more lean into Workday for their platform of choice across HR and finance.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nGood. Perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nLast question, and it's my last Workday earnings call as well. Congrats on the Q3 results, Carl and Zane. It's clear that you guys are seeing quite a bit of AI momentum. I agree with you that AI disruption risk seems to be a little overstated. I think we can look at the numbers and say that AI, there's some tangible contribution. Your 12-month backlog growth rate, although it did include some acquisitions, did a little better. These acquisitions, the anniversary of, they are growing very nicely.\nThat should lead to an acceleration in the organic growth rate as well. That is, conceptually, if you put your thinking hat on—sorry, I'm down with the flu, a little discombinated—if you were to rebuild a company on an AI-native stack, an HCM company, an AI-native stack today, what would that functionality be able to do? That is, what would that stack be able to do that would be disruptive that you can do as a Workday customer with the tools that Workday is providing, be it organically or through these combinations of acquisitions? Thank you so much.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday",
    "content2": "Hi, Kash. Thanks for the question. Let me say thank you. Going all the way back to our founders, David and Neil, and all of our workmates over the last 20 years, we just want to thank you for your continued coverage of Workday. I know this is your last call with us. I just wanted to say thank you.\nNeil said hello, and he also wanted to send his regards as well, as do I and everyone else. You've been a great analyst for us, and we really appreciate your support over the years. We all hope you enjoy your next phase of life, which you're telling us is retirement. I hope that's the case, and you really do go out and spend some quality time with your amazing wife and family. With that, I'll hand it over to my friend Gerrit to talk about how he would build a new HCM or finance platform around AI going forward.\n\nGerrit Kazmaier\n\nPresident of Product and Technology, Workday\n\nYeah. Hey, Kash, thank you for ending on such a beautiful question. Let's just look at the core principles of building AI systems at scale, right? Let's just look at what it really is. The first thing that you need is a vast set of data which basically describes the domain, the domain of finance, the domain of HR. You need a vast set of data that basically codifies how the data is being used, right? That is ingredient number one.\nIf you look at AI at scale, it's about learning and using patterns. You need to have that global database. Secondly, you need to have strong semantics and clarity about what data represents. You need to have both a data model that defines what data element represents what entity in the business, what they relate on, and what are the rules for these business entities because data is not created equal, right? They have integrity, they have meaning, they have purpose. You need to have a business process system which now basically tells you how to activate this data in a way so it can drive towards a business outcome.\nEven more so, you need to have clarity on what that business outcome is. Those are the basics of building a successful AI solution. Now take a look at Workday. We are the only scale SaaS vendor born in the cloud with a consolidated data set. Our 75 million users that we have contribute to a uniform data model, which is completely clean. We have all of the process data in a formal business process description, codifying 70,000 core business process archetypes, which are instantiated across all of our customers and thousands of variations. We have ample data of usage and how these processes are being used in the business.\nMost importantly, the domain knowledge to specify what are the target outcomes to drive. If you were to build a system that is built for enterprise AI at scale, it would look like Workday. What we are doing right now specifically is that we are opening up our core and basically integrating reasoning models and AI systems to automate these processes. We layer Sana on top to lead the experience AI innovation on top of that. If you look at all of that in aggregate, it truly is the AI stack for the enterprise of the future.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAmazing. I wish you well in achieving all these aspirations and dreams in the future. Thank you so much. Bye now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes our question and answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. I'll now turn it over to Mr. Eschenbach for final comments.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nCEO, Workday\n\nThank you, operator. Thank you again for all of you who joined us today. Thank you for those who will continue to look into Workday, watch our results, and provide guidance and input to everyone out there in the market. For those celebrating, I want to wish all of you a happy Thanksgiving. I'll close by once again expressing my deep appreciation to all of our workmates, our customers, and partners for their continued commitment to Workday. We'll see you all next quarter, if not before. Again, for those celebrating, happy Thanksgiving.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation."

[Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal 2026 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO, and Gerrit Kazmaier, our President, Product and Technology. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nPlease refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2025 annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, a copy of the prepared remarks and our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Our third quarter fiscal 2026 quiet period begins on October 15, 2025. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2025.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today. Workday delivered another solid quarter with 14% subscription revenue growth in non-GAAP operating margin of 29%. We built great momentum in Q1, and we kept it going in Q2 with strong customer adoption across key verticals, geographies and segments.\nCustomer engagement with Workday has never been higher. Our customer experience center in Pleasanton is absolutely buzzing. In fact, I feel like I'm living there lately. To keep up with all the demand, we are opening new CXCs in both New York and London.\nCustomers are choosing Workday because we help them unlock value today, and we prepare them for whatever is next. Whether that's navigating AI transformation, streamlining operations, or creating more meaningful work for their people. That's where the Workday platform gives them the ultimate advantage. We help manage and optimize their most critical assets, their people and their money, on one platform with AI at the core. This unified approach reduces total cost of ownership and help them move faster with greater precision.\nAnd our AI value proposition is highly relevant in today's market. Workday Illuminate is fueled by the largest and cleanest finance and HR data set with more than 75 million users under contract and 1 trillion transactions process last year alone Workday has a deep understanding of how people work and how to make work better. This ability to deliver real differentiated value is what drove our customer momentum in Q2.\nNow let's talk about our customer high. In Q2, we formed new HCM relation Carrefour, Memorial Health, Smurfit-Westrock, and Banamex. We also had a specific expansions with Sanofi, Blue Origin and Google. Are proud to serve more than 65% of Fortune 500. So what's even more exciting is to see the traction we're seeing in the emerging and medium enterprise, driven by the launch of WorkdayGO in Q1.\nOur focus on financial continues to fuel demand for our full suite. This quarter, roughly 30% of our net new deals were full suite with that number rising to 50% or more in industries like SLED and Healthcare. Red coats, Michels, and U.S. physical therapy were just a few of our full suite wins in the quarter. Beyond the wins, we also celebrate go-lives Salesforce, a long-time HCM customer went live on Workday Financial Management and Accounting Center in the quarter. They're all in on Workday. By unifying their HR and financial data on our platform, they're getting entirely new insights about their business to support their innovation and growth. We also had full suite go-lives with Advocate Health, Honor Health and University of Melbourne.\nI mentioned earlier in the call that AI is front and center in nearly every customer conversation. More than 30% of our customer base deals and more than 75% of our net new deals included one or more of our AI products such as talent optimization recruiting agent, talent mobility agent, contract intelligence agent powered by Evisort and Extend Pro and net new ACV from our AI products once again more than doubled year-over-year. We had fantastic AI wins at Trinity Health, Chipotle and Cox Health, just to name a few.\nNow let's talk about industries. Financial Services had a standout quarter an expansion at Nationwide Insurance, which added core financials and wins with Guaranteed Rate, Handelsbakken and Miller Insurance Services.\nIn SLED, we had our first state go-live on financial management in Q2 with the State of Rhode Island. And we had a huge competitive win at the University of Virginia and UVA Health, an academic health system that includes a medical center, a school of medicine and a network of community hospitals throughout Virginia. We also continue to expand our work with the U.S. federal government, where our engagement across the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and civilian agencies has never been stronger.\nIn Q2, we launched Workday Government, a wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to serving the unique needs of the U.S. government. With this sector facing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernize its aging infrastructure our value proposition has never been more relevant. By combining our proven platform, AI leadership and deep commitment to public service, we're poised to deliver real impact for millions of government workers while also unlocking meaningful long-term growth for Workday. And with the government leading heavily into AI, we see tremendous opportunity ahead for many years to come.\nAnd finally, as we shared last quarter, our tech and media industry crossed $1 billion in ARR, and that team followed it up with another strong quarter here in Q2.\nTurning to innovation. Our road map is focused on delivering purpose-built AI solutions for HR and finance that drives tangible business value and real ROI, and more than 70% of our core customers are now leveraging Workday Illuminate. In May, we announced new agents that leverage our unmatched data set to help customers amplify talent reduce cost, accelerate decision-making and mitigate risk. And at Workday Rising in a few weeks, we will unveil exciting AI and platform innovations, partnerships and new ways to make it easier for customers to access and get value from our AI solutions.\nWhile we continue to invest heavily in organic innovation, we're also making strategic acquisitions, we're focused on finding purpose-built solutions and exceptional teams that complement our strategy, strengthen our leadership and allow us to deliver even greater value to our customers. And today, I'm thrilled to share the exciting news that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Paradox, a breakthrough Canada experience agent that uses conversational AI to completely reimagine the job application experience.\nParadox turns long complex hiring processes into fast natural language conversations, making it easier for people to find work and for companies to fill critical roles, especially in frontline industries like retail, health care, hospitality, transportation and manufacturing. With Workday Recruiting, hired score and now paradox, we will be able to deliver an incredibly powerful AI-powered talent acquisition suite, helping customers find, hire and onboard every type of worker for every type of work. Now let's turn to our platform.\nWill continuing to evolve Workday as not only the best application for people and money, but the best platform as well. and you can see that strategy play out in the incredible growth of Workday Extend. In Q2, new ACV from Extend Pro more than doubled year-over-year. driven by demand to build custom applications and experiences on top of Workday. Developers are embracing Workday's tools, including Extend and our AI APIs to expand the Workday footprint in new industries, markets and territories. In fact, we now have more than 100 marketplace apps live on Workday Marketplace, which has doubled since the start of FY '26.\nTo accelerate that innovation, we launched enhancements to Workday Developer CoPilot in Q2. This makes it even easier for developers to integrate AI capabilities into their apps and agents. We also launched our AI aging partner network and the AI aging gateway, making it simple for partners to connect their agents to the Workday agent system of record. We're thrilled to have AWS Google Cloud, PwC and Green among the first to sign on. We rolled out these innovations at DevCon, our annual developer conference. The excitement was incredible we saw a record turnout in our developer community has now doubled in size year-over-year.\nAnd we're not stopping there. You may have seen that we also recently acquired Flowise a leading low-code platform for building powerful agents. Boise will turbocharge our customers' ability to create and deploy new AI agents at scale. It is built on an open-source foundation and is already processing millions of chats and workflows. It's earned more than 42,000 GitHub stars and is gaining strong adoption across industries.\nAnd not only does Workday continue to invest in promising innovation, we also attract the best people in the industry. [ Peter Balis ], our new Chief Technology Officer, is now on board and already driving our AI and platform agenda. And we didn't stop there as we brought in several new technical leaders across our platform emerging and medium enterprise and security teams in Q2 as well.\nPartners are critical to our success, extending the power of our platform, fueling our pipeline and delivering new innovation to our customers. For the second quarter in a row, more than 20% of our net ACV signed in the quarter was sourced from partners. Strategic partnerships are helping us generate new revenue streams and enhance employee services. In the quarter, we expanded our partnership with DailyPay, giving employees easier access to earned wages before payday.\nAnother great example is our employment verification Connector for Equifax announced a few quarters ago. Workday Wellness continues to gain momentum, with [ Ben Pass ], Chime and New York Life joining in the financial benefits category and [ Voya ] joining in the health benefits category. In its first year, customer response has been incredible and has already been recognized as one of the top HR products of the year by HR Executive and HR Tech.\nSimilar to the partner ecosystem, our international business remains a major growth opportunity for Workday, and we delivered a solid Q2 across regions, notably EMEA and Germany and UKI were standouts in the region with wins and expansions at Haven Leisure Johnson Carmichael, Scotland and DQS Holdings to name a few.\nIn APAC, we had great wins with Qantas and Lumas Imaging. We also signed our first deal in Vietnam with Masan Group, a top conglomerate spanning retail, banking and infrastructure. And our investments in Japan over the last couple of years are really starting to pay off with continued momentum and expansions, including Tokyo Electron and Astemo in the quarter.\nAs we continue to expand our global footprint, India is a key part of our strategy. In Q2, we hired Sunil Jose as President of India, announced we will begin offering services to a local data center, and we're growing our team and our partner ecosystem in this critical market.\nWe're heading into the second half of the year with incredible momentum, driven by our AI innovation, our unified platform, our ecosystem and, of course, our workmates. We continue to be a magnet for exceptional talent, attracting world-class leaders to Workday across all functions. We're building for the long term while executing in the near term, and I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.\nWhen we put AI to work for people, not in place of them, we unlock potential we've only begun to imagine. That's the future we're creating with our customers, and I can't wait for you to see what we achieved together. I'm deeply grateful to our global workmates, our customers and our partners for making Q2 such a solid quarter. And I look forward to seeing many of you at Workday Rising in our Financial Analyst Day on September 16. We where we'll share more about how we're shaping an AI-powered human-centric and future-ready Workday.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Zane.\n\nZane C. Rowe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q2 results were supported by ongoing momentum across several of our growth areas, as companies around the globe turned to Workday to manage and empower their most mission-critical assets.\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in the second quarter was $2.169 billion, up 14% and Professional services revenue was $179 million, resulting in total revenue of $2.348 billion, growth of 13%. U.S. revenue in Q2 totaled $1.76 billion, up 13%. International revenue totaled $584 million, up 11%. This includes a 3-point impact year-over-year from an increased mix of international partner deployments.\n12-month subscription revenue backlog or CRPO, was $7.91 billion at the end of Q2, increasing 16.4%. The result was driven by elevated volume of renewal activity, including higher-than-expected early renewals, along with continued momentum in new ACV and strong partner growth. Approximately 1 point of CRPO growth came from tenants in line with our expectations. We anticipate this impact on growth will be just over 1 point for the remainder of the year. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $25.37 billion, up 18%, and gross revenue retention rates remained healthy at 97%.\nNon-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $680 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 29%. We continue to execute on delivering margin expansion while growing our top line.\nWe're focused on making targeted and impactful investments to support long-term growth, such as expanding our AI talent, both organically and inorganically, entering new markets such as India, and investing in certain industries, including our federal business. At the same time, we are driving efficiencies across people, processes and systems, all accelerated by AI.\nQ2 operating cash flow was $616 million, growth of 8%. We repurchased $299 million of our shares during the quarter and had $1.2 billion in remaining authorization as of July 31. We ended the quarter with $8.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our head count as of July 31 stood at approximately 19,500 workmates around the globe.\nNow turning to guidance. Following our first half momentum and incorporating the acquisition of Paradox, which we expect to close later in Q3 and we're increasing our FY '26 subscription revenue guidance to $8.815 billion, growth of 14%. We expect Q3 FY '26 subscription revenue to be approximately $2.235 billion, also a growth of 14%. We expect CRPO to increase between 15% and 16% in Q3. This does not include the impact of the Paradox acquisition. We continue to expect FY '26 professional services revenue of approximately $700 million. For Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $180 million.\nWe're increasing our FY '26 non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 29%, reflecting ongoing efficiencies we are driving across the business. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28%. We expect GAAP operating margins to be approximately 17 and 21 points lower than our Q3 and full year FY '26 non-GAAP operating margins, respectively. The FY '26 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%.\nWe're increasing our FY '26 operating cash flow outlook to $2.85 billion, driven by the timing of cash tax payments as well as our operating performance for the year. We now expect FY '26 capital expenditures of approximately $200 million, reflecting free cash flow of $2.65 billion, growth of 21%.\nWe look forward to hosting many of you at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on September 16, where we will share our framework for future growth and margin expansion. We are well positioned to capture our growing TAM and the emerging AI opportunity, and we're excited about the growth and value we expect to drive for our customers, partners and shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn it back over to Carl for some brief comments before opening up for Q&A.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining the call today. Before I jump in, I want to again thank our workmates customers and partners for helping us deliver a solid quarter in first half of FY '26. The momentum is real. It's powered by the strength of our platform, industry-leading HCM and financials, a growing ecosystem and AI that's built in, not bolted on. Customers are choosing Workday to simplify, consolidate and scale. As I've always said, our business is durable, it's diverse and it's building momentum as we head into the second half of the year.\nWith that, let's jump into live Q&A, and I'll turn it back over to the operator.",

[Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and David Somers, our Chief Product Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2024 annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation, from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, the transcript of this call and our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur first quarter fiscal 2026 quiet period begins on April 15, 2025. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2024.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today. Workday delivered another solid quarter in Q4, with 16% subscription revenue growth and 26% non-GAAP operating margin. These results are a testament to how businesses of all sizes, industries and geographies are increasingly turning to Workday as their trusted partner. And I'm incredibly proud of how our teams executed in Q4 to deliver a solid year.\nAs organizations look for ways to boost productivity and run more efficiently, our value proposition has never been stronger. Workday gives them the ultimate advantage, helping them manage what matters most, their people and their money. And with our unified platform, our customers can unlock value faster, reduce their total cost of ownership, and harness the power of AI across our best-in-class HR and finance solutions.\nOn the AI front, we just launched the agent system of record. A centralized system to manage all of an organization's AI agents from Workday and third parties alike. With this innovation, our customers will be able to manage their entire workforce, humans and digital, on our trusted platform. I'll talk more about this exciting announcement later in the call. But now let's turn to our customers and industry momentum in the quarter.\nDuring Q4, we welcomed incredible new customers, including Bayer, [ Henkel ], [ Iberostar ], the State of North Carolina and First Citizens Bank & Trust Company. We also expanded with industry leaders, including Cisco, [ Mondelez ], [ Sutter Health ] and Toyota. Workday now serves more than 11,000 customers across industries and geographies, including more than 60% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of the Global 2000, and that says a lot about the strategic nature of our platform.\nOur industry focus is a huge contributor to this growth and Q4 was no exception. In [ SLED ], the city of Minneapolis, St. Louis County and City University of New York all chose our full suite in Q4. We also signed our largest Workday Student deal ever with the Minnesota State colleges and universities. This is a massive project to improve the experience for 270,000 students, and 14,000 faculty. Workday Student is quickly gaining traction as the top choice for higher education institutions. We now have more than 135 customers, and we expect roughly half of them will be live by the spring.\nAfter rapid adoption here in the U.S., we're excited to expand Workday Student into Canada and the Australia, New Zealand markets this year. We also have a growing opportunity with the U.S. Federal government, thanks to the administration's strong focus on driving efficiencies and IT modernization. Our recent wins at the DOE and DIA have helped set a solid foundation in this sector, opening up a number of exciting Fed opportunities.\nFinancial services continues to be one of our largest industries. In Q4, we had significant expansions with [ Aon ] in [ Saudi May ] Bank, and we closed a large core [ FINS ] deal with a Fortune 500 organization. Health care also once again delivered, with notable full suite wins including North Mississippi Medical Center, [ Hackensack Meridian ] Health and [ UnityPoint ] Health. More than 30% of our net new wins in the quarter were full suite, and across our focused industries of [ SLED ] and health care, that number climbs to 50%. We had a record number of core FINS wins in both Q4 and the full fiscal year. We now have over 6,100 core HCM and financials customers, and more than 2,000 of them are leveraging our full suite.\nOur investments in financials, both in innovation and go-to-market, continued to pay off with strong growth in new ACV in Q4. In addition to a record number of core financials wins, we saw strong momentum for our financial planning, accounting center, student and procurement solutions. And we continue to see increasing demand for AI solutions. In fact, AI is front and center in every conversation I have with customers, prospects and partners. They want to move beyond incremental productivity gains. They're also looking for ROI that helps them drive growth back into their business.\nSimilar to Q3, we once again saw 30% of our customer expansions involve one or more AI SKUs, including [ Xtend ] Pro, Recruiting Agent [indiscernible] and our recently rolled out talent mobility agent. Xtend Pro, which enables our customers to build AI applications on top of our platform continues to be one of our fastest-growing SKUs. In Q4, new ACV more than doubled over Q3.\nDeveloper Copilot, which is part of Xtend Pro is delivering real results. We're hearing from customers that they're seeing productivity gains of over 50%. This is helping them build apps much faster.\nRecruiting Agent had an exceptional close to the year with wins at BP, [ Gen pac ] and many more. New ACV in Q4 nearly doubled from Q3, and this product continues to boost the average selling price of our core recruiting solution. In fact, in Q4, it was even higher than the 1.5x uplift we reported in Q3. A great example of customers willing to pay for high ROI solutions.\nOur approach to AI has always been customer-centric. While others rush to charge for early gen AI features, we integrated them into our core offering. Now that our AI has evolved, and delivering tangible ROI, we have new monetization opportunities that will fuel our long-term growth. And perhaps more importantly, we are further distancing ourselves from the competition.\nWith more than 1 trillion transactions processed on our platform in FY '25, our AI leverages the world's largest and cleanest HR and financial data set. And the combination of this data, with our ability to understand the context behind it, puts Workday in a unique position. Following the announcement of our new role-based agents at Rising, we launched 4 more agents for contracts, payroll, financial auditing and policy. These are not task-based agents like most of the market today. Our role-based agents contain a configurable set of skills that give them greater ability to support people in their roles. Each has multiple skills and can perform a large number of tasks. That's where true ROI is and where we see that customers are willing to pay.\nOver the past year, hundreds, and maybe thousands, of agents have been introduced into the market across a number of vendors. As more agents are deployed, organization's risk, fragmented operations, increased security risks and difficulty measuring the true value of their AI investments. At this point, there's no central place to manage agents and there is a real risk of [indiscernible] That's what the Workday Agent system of record aims to solve.\nIt will manage a business' entire fleet of AI agents alongside their human workforce, all on a trusted platform. And it won't just manage Workday agents, it will also manage customer bill agents and partner bill agents. Since the launch, we've had strong interest from our customers and technology partners, who'd like access to the Workday agent system of record to mitigate risk in the enterprise.\nPartners continue to play a strong role in Workday's growth, and they also extend the power of the Workday platform. In Q4, more than 15% of our net new ACV was sourced through partners, up from more than 10% last quarter and we're just getting started. Not only are we leaning into partners to drive increased pipeline for our core products, but we're also collaborating with them to create new lines of business through partner programs like Workday Wellness, where we signed 5 strategic partners in Q4. And we're innovating with them as well.\nOur Bill on Workday program continues to gain traction. Since its launch at the end of June, we have 72 partners building and selling applications on the Workday platform. Finally, in the quarter, we also signed our first strategic talent partnership with [ Randstad ], which brings together the power of Workday Recruiting Agent with the global candidate data pool of the largest talent company in the world to help our customers increase hiring efficiencies and drive better talent outcomes.\nTurning to international. We delivered solid performance across a number of our key geographies in Q4. We also hosted a record-breaking EMEA rising in December, with 5,000 attendees, which helped drive momentum in the quarter. Despite the continued macro headwinds in EMEA, our two largest markets, the U.K. and Germany, had their strongest quarter of the year. This shows what I've said many times. When customers are ready to make a spending decision, Workday is the choice.\nIn the [ DOC ] region, we formed some fantastic new relationships in our competitors' backyard. In Q4, with great German companies like Bayer and [ Henkel ] selecting Workday core HCM. In APAC, we had several important wins, including Binance, [ Nine Entertainment ] and [ Jingdong ]. And in Japan, we're continuing to build the foundation to grow in this important market with the opening of our Osaka office.\nI want to thank my workmates, our customers and our partners for helping us end FY '25 strong. I'd also like to recognize Doug Robinson for helping us close the quarter on a high note. Thank you, Doug, for your dedication to building this company.\nBefore we close, I'd like to share a couple of other leadership updates. After 10 incredible years, [ Cheyenne ] [indiscernible] has decided to retire from Workday. He has been a driving force for our innovation strategy, and we can't thank them enough for the impact he has had. With Cheyenne's retirement from Workday, we're excited to welcome Garrick [ Kasmyer ] as our new President of Product and Technology. Garrick joins us from Google, where he led data analytics and BI for Google Cloud. Prior today, he spent nearly 11 years with SAP, with his expertise in AI, data, ERP and enterprise business processes, [ Garrick ] is the ideal person to lead our product and technology strategy. Garrick will start on March 10, and Cheyenne will stay on as an adviser through the end of May to help with the transition.\nIt's been a year of change at Workday, and we'll continue to evolve in the coming years to go after the massive opportunity ahead of us. Our recent restructuring was a tough, but necessary, decision that will help us invest in the business to meet our customers' needs. We're entering FY '26, our 20th year in business, with an amazing team, renewed energy, in a clear view of how we can fulfill our founder's vision to revolutionize enterprise software, this time with AI.\nThank you again for joining us. And with that, I'll hand it over to Zane.\n\nZane C. Rowe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q4 results were driven by solid performance across key growth areas of the business, including continued momentum with full suite and our financial solutions, growing demand for our AI SKUs, and strong execution across key industries.\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in Q4 was $2.04 billion, up 16%, benefiting from favorable linearity of new ACV bookings within the quarter. Full year FY '25 subscription revenue was $7.718 billion, growth of 17%. Professional services revenue was $171 million in the quarter and $728 million for the full year. Total revenue in Q4 was $2.21 billion, growth of 15%, and for the full year was $8.45 billion, up 16%.\nU.S. revenue in Q4 totaled $1.66 billion, up 15%, and international revenue in the quarter was $556 million, growing 16%. For the full year, U.S. revenue was $6.33 billion, up 16%, and international revenue was $2.11 billion, up 17%.\n12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, was $7.63 billion at the end of Q4, growing 15%. Early renewal activity in the quarter was slightly higher than expected and contributed to the outperformance. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q4 was $25.06 billion, up 20%, and gross revenue retention rates remained strong at 98%.\nNon-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $584 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 26.4%. The year-over-year improvement benefited from a combination of revenue outperformance, ongoing cost discipline and improved efficiencies across the company. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $2.19 billion, reflecting a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.9%. GAAP operating income in the quarter was impacted by a $75 million charge primarily related to the previously announced restructuring.\nQ4 operating cash flow was $1.11 billion, resulting in full year operating cash flow of $2.46 billion, growth of 15%. We repurchased $99 million of our shares during the quarter and $700 million for the full year, helping drive annual dilution below 1% for the year. The timing and amount of our repurchase activity in the quarter was impacted by trading constraints. We had $802 million in remaining authorization as of year-end.\nWe ended the year with $8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our head count as of January 31 was approximately 20,400 workmates not reflecting the restructuring that took place in early February, which we expect will reduce our workforce by approximately 8%.\nNow turning to guidance. We're pleased with the execution we are driving across several of our key strategic areas. And given our solid performance in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect FY '26 subscription revenue of approximately $8.8 billion, growth of 14%. This outlook incorporates the impact of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which is a roughly $20 million incremental headwind since we provided guidance last quarter.\nWe anticipate Q1 FY '26 subscription revenue to be approximately $2.05 billion, growth of 13%, or 14% when normalizing for the effect of the leap period last Q1. We expect CRPO to increase between 14.5% and 15.5% in Q1. We expect subscription revenue to increase roughly 5.5% sequentially in Q2. We continue to expect a slightly faster pace of year-over-year subscription revenue growth in the second half of FY '26, relative to the first half. This is driven by continued momentum across our investment initiatives, in addition to revenue building from certain deals we closed in FY '25 and discussed on our last earnings call.\nWe anticipate FY '26 professional services revenue of approximately $700 million as we continue to leverage our partner ecosystem. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $165 million. We expect FY '26 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 28%. This outlook incorporates an accelerated pace of AI investment across our platform and targeted investments across key areas of the business. We will also continue to drive efficiencies and look for improvements in operating our business at scale. For Q1, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 28%.\nGAAP operating margin for the first quarter is impacted by the previously announced restructuring. We expect to incur an additional restructuring expense of approximately $180 million in the quarter which will be excluded from our non-GAAP results. We expect the GAAP operating margins to be approximately 30 and 21 percentage points lower than our Q1 and full year FY '26 non-GAAP operating margins respectively.\nThe FY '26 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 19%. We expect FY '26 operating cash flow of $2.75 billion, which includes roughly $180 million of cash outflows related to the restructuring, which we expect will be incurred in the first half of FY '26. We expect FY '26 capital expenditures of approximately $250 million, down slightly from FY '25.\nWe entered the new fiscal year with clear momentum and are focused on investing strategically to support our medium-term objectives of mid-teens subscription revenue growth, and 30% non-GAAP operating margin, while building the foundation to support enduring growth and margin expansion.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division\n\nWelcome to Workday's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Zane Rowe, our CFO; Doug Robinson, our Co-President; and David Somers, our Chief Product Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2024. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report our solid financial performance for the quarter, including 19% subscription revenue growth, 18% 12-month backlog growth, and non-GAAP operating margin of 26%. Over the past 6 quarters, we've made several key investments across the business as well as important organizational changes to set the foundation for durable growth and continued margin expansion.\nIn Q1, we continued to build on a number of important growth initiatives, including go-to-market changes that will help us further expand our total addressable market. And in the quarter, we closed several strategic deals, including a landmark federal win at the Defense Intelligence Agency. We also held our annual Innovation Summit, where we hosted 25 industry analysts and showcased our organic innovation engine, which continues to be one of the key strengths of our company. We already are seeing tremendous feedback from the event with lots of positive industry analyst coverage on the product road maps and the future of Workday.\nOur first quarter is always our seasonally slowest. We had clear areas of outperformance, including health care, public sector and continued strength in financials and full platform wins, but we also closed fewer large deals than last Q1, notably in EMEA. When purchase decisions are being made, our win rates remain strong. But within the quarter, we experienced increased deal scrutiny as compared to prior quarters, and we are seeing customers committing to lower headcount levels on renewals compared to what we had expected. We expect these dynamics to persist in the near term, which is reflected in our revised FY '25 subscription revenue guidance. While we can't control the macro, we are focusing on what's in our control, and that is innovation, scaling our go-to-market and partner ecosystem and delivering customer value.\nWe remain confident we're doing the right things to build a long-term durable business with balanced growth and margin expansion. With the emergence of AI, the shifting talent landscape, and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, organizations across geographies and industries are turning to Workday as their trusted platform to elevate humans and supercharge work. We made several key developments in Q1 that strengthen our position, and I'll share a few highlights.\nLet's start with customers. Our customers truly bring the power of Workday to life. A great example is our new partnership with the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DIA is the key intelligent agency for national defense in the United States. Workday will support the DIA on its mission to rapidly accelerate recruitment and onboarding efforts and create a diverse, trusted, and agile workforce. With Workday, they'll be able to identify, integrate, and direct skills and expertise to solve emerging intelligence problems when and where they are most needed.\nNot only is this a significant new win, but more importantly, it unlocks an incredible market opportunity for Workday in the federal government, and we expect it to increase our pipeline over the coming quarters. In fact, the DIA was on stage at our Federal Forum event in Washington, D.C. yesterday discussing digital transformation in the government. Now in its second year, the forum drew a record crowd of over 600 decision-makers across more than 70 agencies from the world of government and policy. This is up 100% from our Federal Forum last year, and the momentum we are building here is exciting.\nAnd speaking of momentum, we continue to take share in financials, bolstered by our go-to-market and platform investments combined with our compelling value proposition of having a single secure platform to manage both your people and money. In Q1, new Financial Management customers and full platform customers both increased more than 20% over Q1 of last year. And more than 90% of our nearly 2,000 FINS customers are now leveraging the power of our HCM platform as well.\nIn Q1, we added several full platform HCM and FINS customers, including Baptist Health, Covenant Health Systems, the City of Milwaukee, and Owning Group, the largest privately held staffing company in the U.S. We also had a number of expansions within the office of the CFO, including Alliance Bernstein, Hospital Sisters Health System and John Muir Health. During Q1, we also expanded our leadership in HCM, adding new relationships with organizations, including ALS Group USA, Carhartt, and one of the largest P&C insurers in the world, which expanded its core financials footprint to add HCM.\nAnd we had several strategic HCM expansions and renewals, including ING Bank, Sandvik AB, and Valeo Management Services. Beyond the wins, we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform. In Q1, Asda, Electrolux, Topgolf, county of Richland, Apex Group, and LVHN all successfully went live on Workday.\nCustomers trust Workday to help them navigate huge transformations. They did so with the cloud, and now they're turning to us to help them responsibly leverage AI to drive productivity, efficiency, and cost savings. Workday gives them the ultimate advantage. We've been delivering AI capabilities to our customers for nearly a decade. We fill AI into the core of our platform, which means AI features and functionality are embedded natively in all of our applications.\nAnd with more than 65 million users generating more than 800 billion transactions per year on our platform, the volume of clean, trusted data that Workday and our ecosystem can leverage for AI is truly unmatched. We continue to make significant investments to further enhance our leadership in this area and deliver trusted and responsible AI innovations that drive meaningful business results. We now have more than 50 AI use cases live in production and 25 generative AI use cases on our road map to help our customers make confident decisions faster, increase efficiencies, and make their people more productive.\nIn Q1, several new innovations went live for early access customers, including AI-powered content generation capabilities with growth plans, job descriptions, and knowledge-based articles. These automate repetitive tasks and put information in the hands of the right people faster. We also released AI-enabled Payroll Insights, which help payroll professionals detect anomalies faster and more accurately to save money and reduce risk. Perhaps the best example here is our talent optimization solution, which leverages Workday Skills Cloud. This is an AI-first SKU where we have seen strong attach rates on new deals and have significant momentum selling back to our customer base as well. I'm pleased to share that over half of our core customer base has now licensed this product, making it one of our fastest-growing ever.\nContinuing to accelerate our AI road map, we closed the acquisition of HiredScore in Q1, giving us a comprehensive AI-powered talent acquisition and internal mobility offering. Our shared customers are realizing a 25% increase in recruiter capacity with AI, one of the many reasons we're so excited about this combination. We closed our first joint deal this quarter and we're rapidly building pipeline, particularly across our base of more than 4,000 recruiting customers.\nThe power of Workday is our platform, and that gives us a ton of flexibility to fuel growth, for example, in industries. This is a key foundational element and a major differentiator for us. We've been focusing on deepening our purpose-built offerings in key verticals, including health care, public sector, financial services, and professional services. As you can see in the logos from this quarter, health care once again performed very well with new ACV growth exceeding 50% in Q1. At the same time, our professional and business services vertical is already well on its way to eclipsing $1 billion in annual recurring revenue.\nIn Q1, we released a natively-built configure price quote solution for services businesses, which integrates with CRM platforms to streamline the quoting process. Our research shows that for 95% of our customers, quoting is still happening in spreadsheets today so this is going to significantly increase their efficiencies.\nPublic sector was another highlight in Q1. In addition to the DIA, we continued to excel in state and local government, closing full platform wins with the cities of north Las Vegas, Milwaukee, and Palm Bay and Monroe and Washington counties. And in education, we had a record number of Workday Student go-lives in Q1 and now have taken 20 new customers live so far this year, including Iowa State University, University of Arkansas System, and Wake Forest University.\nGlobal expansion continues to be a key growth driver for Workday. We're focused on investing at all levels to build our regional businesses with local leadership, go-to-market, and product enhancements. For instance, this quarter, our native payroll solution for customers in Australia became generally available. And our global payroll platform is now available for early adopters as we extend the power of Workday with strategic partners like ADP, Alight, and more. On the go-to-market side, we began holding Workday Elevate events across APAC, Japan, and EMEA in Q1 and will continue throughout Q2. These events bring together thousands of prospects and customers, generating new pipeline and deepening our existing relationships.\nAnd just last week, we announced our plans to invest more than GBP 550 million in our U.K. operations over the next 3 years. We also announced that in early 2025, our customers will be able to access our core HCM financials and adapt the planning solutions locally on the AWS Cloud in the U.K. Not only are we enabling compliance with data residency requirements, we're also boosting performance and helping businesses scale for the future. So as you can see, we're continuing to invest for our growth, and I'm energized by how we'll be able to empower more U.K. organizations with the power of our platform.\nAnd while it was a more challenging quarter in some of our international markets, we saw strength in France, the Netherlands, and Japan. Key international wins in Q1 included OCP Group, Knight Frank, and Aman Resorts. Our partner ecosystem is a powerful driver of customer success, and it continues to grow in both breadth and depth. Across the board, we're seeing continued growth in our referral and co-selling efforts, with our partner sourcing more pipeline and closing more ACV in Q1 than all of FY '24 through our sales program. This points to increasing ecosystem-led growth, which is a key priority.\nWe have over 200 co-sell and referral partnerships that are helping expand our routes to market. One of the partners that we signed in Q1 that I'm particularly excited about is Google. Under our new partnership, GCP customers will have access to Workday products through the Google Cloud Marketplace. We're off to a fast start and we expect to have our first transaction via the Marketplace this month.\nWe also recently expanded our relationship with AWS to include co-innovation across industries and enhance go-to-market investments. We bill over $75 million of active ACV pipeline with AWS and the expanded partnership should only accelerate that. And in Q1, we formed a new reseller agreement with Kyriba that enables Workday customers to integrate with a network of over 1,000 global banks. This dramatically reduces the time, complexity, and costs needed to integrate and adapt with changing banking requirements.\nPartners are critical to helping us accelerate and broaden our innovation footprint. In 2 weeks, we'll welcome 1,200 partners and customers to Las Vegas for DevCon, our annual Developer Conference. DevCon, as well as our developer ecosystem, has grown by more than 50% since last year, which is a testament to the momentum we're building across our platform. At the event, we'll be announcing new ways for partners to build, distribute, and monetize their applications on the Workday platform. We are also launching several other components of the program to enable us to embed partner solutions within Workday in ways we've never done before.\nWith our cloud-native platform in Workday Extend, we are enabling AI innovation not just from Workday but our customers and partners as well. We now have more than 900 Extend customers and 1,600 apps delivering significant value across our ecosystem of customers and partners. Workday Extend Pro, which includes AI Gateway as well as Developer Copilot launching later this year, enables our customers and partners to build AI-first apps that leverage the power of our platform.\nThere is clearly an appetite to build AI-first apps on top of Workday. More than 50% of our Q1 Extend ACV was from Extend Pro, making it another one of our fastest-growing SKUs. And our AI Marketplace, which is going live next month, gives our customers access to the best of Workday AI and solutions from third-party partners together in 1 place. These are just a few of the latest examples of the breadth of our innovation and the reach of our platform.\nNow to close, as I've said many times, we have a durable business with multiple levers to drive long-term growth. With our leadership and investment in AI, our unique ability to address organizations' most critical challenges and the deep relationships we have with our customers and partners, Workday remains well positioned to extend our market leadership. This is exactly what drew me to Workday and what continues to excite me.\nWe also have a diverse business serving more than 10,500 customers across industries, which now includes more than 60% of the Fortune 500, an incredible milestone and a testament to the strategic nature of our platform. And yet, we're just getting started, with more than 40,000 organizations in our addressable market and a continued opportunity to expand our footprint and deliver even more value within our existing customer base. Moving into Q2, we are well positioned to achieve our objectives in the near term while continuing to build for the long term. I'd like to thank our customers who put their trust in us, our partners, and especially my 19,400 Workmates around the world for helping drive Workday forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Zane.\n\nZane C. Rowe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations across our key financial metrics. Subscription revenue in the first quarter was $1.815 billion, up 19%, including a 1 point benefit from the leap year. Professional services revenue was $175 million in the quarter, leading to total revenue in Q1 of $1.99 billion, growing 18%. U.S. revenue in Q1 totaled $1.49 billion, and international revenue totaled $497 million, both growing 18%.\n12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, was $6.6 billion at the end of Q1, representing growth of 18%. Renewal volume in the quarter, including early renewals, was in line with our expectations. Gross and net revenue retention rates remained strong at over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $20.68 billion, up 24%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $515 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.9%. Margin strength was driven by moderate revenue outperformance and lower expenses.\nQ1 operating cash flow was $372 million, growth of 34%. During Q1, we repurchased $134 million of our shares at an average price of $267.09 per share. In addition, starting in April, we began to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share withholding. This reduced our dilution by 1 million shares in the quarter relative to our prior sell-to-cover method and impacted our cash flow from financing by $239 million in Q1. We ended the quarter with $7.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nAs of April 30, headcount stood at over 19,400 Workmates around the globe. We were pleased to see the continued progress across our key growth initiatives, including momentum in full platform wins and continued ramping of our partner ecosystem, which we expect to support growth in the coming years. At the same time, we experienced elevated scrutiny in our sales cycle, particularly in EMEA. Within our customer base, we continue to see expansion, primarily through product add-ons versus customer headcount growth, which has slowed relative to our expectations.\nTaking these factors into account, we are updating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance to $7.7 billion to $7.725 billion, representing growth of approximately 17% compared to our previous guided range of 17% to 18%. We expect Q2 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.895 billion, representing 17% growth. We now expect FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $650 million to $660 million, reflecting the Q1 outperformance and our Q2 expectations along with our strategy of further leveraging our partner ecosystem. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $175 million.\nTurning to backlog. As we've highlighted previously, CRPO growth is influenced by quarter-to-quarter variability in renewal volume and new business bookings. The strength in overall renewal activity in FY '24, including early renewals, caused our CRPO growth to outpace subscription revenue growth throughout last year. This aggregate effect is impacting our backlog growth this year. In Q2, as we saw in Q1, we expect CRPO growth to be below subscription revenue growth impacted by the cumulative headwind from last year's strong renewal activity. In Q2, we expect CRPO to increase between 15% and 16%.\nWe continue to see momentum across our core growth areas and are continuing to invest for future growth while driving increased efficiencies across the company. We now expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 25%. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%, which reflects our typical seasonality. GAAP operating margins for the second quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 21 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We continue to expect FY '25 operating cash flow of $2.25 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $330 million.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate our commitment to investing to support long-term growth while expanding margins. We continue to see strong customer demand and engagement across our platform, supporting our financial targets and helping drive our strategic growth initiatives. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Carl Eschenbach, our CEO; Aneel Bhusri, our Executive Chair; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur first quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins on April 15, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nChief Operating Officer and Co-President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share that Workday delivered a solid Q4, achieving 18% subscription revenue growth and a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. These results were driven by momentum across the business and capped off a year of strong execution by our nearly 19,000 Workmates across the globe. Over the course of the last year, we've made key investments across our leadership team, go-to-market and partner ecosystem and our platform, positioning us to drive enduring growth in FY '25 and beyond.\nI couldn't be prouder of what we've accomplished over the last year, particularly in an environment where deal scrutiny remains high. I'd like to thank our customers, partners and especially my fellow Workmates for making these results possible. My belief in the opportunity ahead for Workday and our value proposition has only gotten stronger in the 14 months since I've joined. With the emergence of AI, shifting talent landscape and pressure to realize operational efficiencies, leaders are turning to Workday as their trusted platform to manage their most critical assets, their people and their money.\nCustomers have come to trust us with helping them navigate these huge transformations from the cloud to AI. In fact, the theme of building trust took center stage at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos last month. Throughout my conversations, it was clear to me that leaders see the business benefits of implementing AI, but they also recognize building trust is key. Workday stands apart in our commitment to the responsible development of AI technologies, its responsible deployment within our own company and our advocacy for its regulation. We've been delivering AI capabilities to our customers for nearly a decade, building AI into the core of our platform, and we're making significant investments to further enhance our leadership in this area.\nWorkday Skills Cloud, for example, uses AI to gain insights into an organization's current skills and identifies skills needed for the future, allowing for smarter decisions about talent across the company. In our upcoming R1 release, many of the generative AI use cases we showcased at Rising will be put into the hands of early adopters, including job descriptions and knowledge articles. To further accelerate our AI road map, today, we're excited to announce our planned acquisition of HiredScore, which provides AI-powered talent orchestration solutions. HiredScore's technology delivers data-driven insights to help improve recruiting and internal mobility processes.\nThe combination of our data set in Workday Skills Cloud with HiredScore's solution will provide customers with a transparent, AI-powered talent acquisition and internal mobility offering. Not only is it technology compelling, but HiredScore and Workday share a commitment to responsible AI development, including a focus on explainability and transparency. We are absolutely thrilled about the potential of what we can do together.\nNow let's move into the performance from the quarter, which reflects the diversity and durability of Workday's business. As we shared at our Financial Analyst Day, our net new business is driven by a balanced mix of new customer wins and expansions within our installed base, which speaks to the significant opportunity that we have ahead. From a net new customer perspective, we once again saw strength in full platform deals. We welcomed customers like Australian Stock Exchange, Boyd Gaming Corporation, HHS, Randstad, UHS of Delaware and VXI Global Solutions as full platform HCM and Financials customers. And new HCM customers this quarter included Crane Company, El Corte Inglés, Hitachi Astemo, Hungry Jack's, Kohler Co., [ Own Say ] and Swisscom.\nAlongside healthy net new customer activity, our customer base team again delivered in Q4. We had several strategic expansions and renewals in the quarter, including BJ's, Goodyear and Greystar Global Enterprise. And we had a number of core Financial Management expansions across our HCM customer base, including Allied Financial, Huntington Bank, Intermountain Health and Stewart Title Guaranty. Our create and close motion also had another great quarter and is becoming an important driver of our customer-based sales team's growth.\nFrom a solutions perspective, we saw healthy uptake across our portfolio, including Extend, where new ACV doubled year-over-year in Q4. We now have more than 850 Extend customers, and I'm pleased to share that roughly 1/3 of our Extend new ACV signed in Q4 was from our new professional SKU, which includes AI Gateway as well as Workday Developer Copilot launching later this year. Beyond the wins we celebrate when our customers go live on our platform and I'm pleased to share that in FY '24, over 95% of our deployments went live on time. In Q4, we had several strategic HCM deployments, including AT&T, Northern Trust and Whataburger, alongside notable Financial Management go-lives, including American University, Sagility Operations and UMass Memorial Health.\nTo propel our land and expand business, we continue to invest in several growth areas. I'll share a few highlights from those areas now, starting with international. Today, international represents over half of our addressable opportunity yet is 1/4 of our revenues. We're working to change that, and we're seeing early signs of progress. In EMEA, our leadership additions continue to drive improved and more consistent results. I spent a couple of weeks visiting our teams in Europe this past quarter, and I have to tell you, I am fired up by the momentum we're building.\nIn Q4, our teams once again delivered healthy new ACV growth across key markets such as the U.K., Spain and France. We also closed our first deal in EMEA with our Alight co-sell partnership, and we continue to build pipeline with important partnerships alongside ADP and Alight in addition to our broader referral and co-sell ecosystem.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, Australia delivered once again, and I'm pleased to share that Japan, which is a key investment priority, drove strong new ACV growth in Q4. While it's still early days for us in this market, we're focused on growing it. To help lead the way, I'm delighted to welcome Chikara Furuichi as our new leader of the Japanese market to help us win in one of the world's largest economies. Chikara brings over 25 years of experience in both SaaS security and cloud services from across Japan and APAC. He reports directly to Patrick Blair, our President of Global Sales.\nMoving to financials. We're seeing continued proof that our go-to-market and platform investments are paying off with healthy growth in core financials customers and new ACV and a robust pipeline looking forward. We drove a record number of new full platform wins in both Q4 and FY '24, and our industry approach is a clear driver of this momentum. Health care, for example, again grew new ACV over 50% in Q4, capping off a fantastic FY '24. Our innovation in key areas such as supply chain is differentiating us in the market and is driving industry awards such as the recent recognition in best-of-class in enterprise resource planning for the seventh year in a row.\nWe're also pleased to share that Gartner named Workday a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Financial Planning Software for the second time since the category's inception last year. Our education and government teams also drove continued success in FY '24, and higher ed was a standout in Q4 with a number of full platform wins, including Oregon State University, Portland Community College and the College of William and Mary.\nAnd to help accelerate our trajectory in the U.S. Federal business, I'm delighted to welcome Lynn Martin as our new federal leader. Lynn has more than 30 years' experience in the public sector, most recently running Google's U.S. federal business and before that, running VMware's public sector team for close to a decade.\nSupporting our progress around many of these investment areas is our partner ecosystem where our focus is delivering customer outcomes, growing our business through referrals and co-selling and building differentiated solutions. During Q4, we announced a strategic partnership with Insperity that delivers on all 3 of these priorities. Through this partnership, Workday will become the platform powering Insperity's PEO service for SMB organizations, effectively opening up a new market opportunity for us. It's a terrific example of how we're innovating our go-to-market strategy to drive growth.\nAnother great example is the Spark&Grow offering, which we launched with Kainos. It helps our emerging and medium enterprise customers to go live on Workday in less than 4 weeks. We've seen incredible demand for this offering, and we're just getting started.\nThese are 2 great examples of momentum that is building across our ecosystem, which I'm pleased to share now includes more than 200 partners that have been onboarded to refer new sales leads and co-sell with us. We launched this pilot program last May and we've seen momentum building throughout the year with a nice uptick in Q4 partner-driven pipeline generation.\nIn closing, I'm incredibly proud of our team's strong execution throughout FY '24, all while navigating a dynamic environment and embracing important changes we've rolled out across the business. We enter FY '25 with a strong foundation and a clear strategy to support durable growth while at the same time continuing to drive efficiencies across the business. As I said on my first Workday earnings call 1 year ago, we have the opportunity to be one of the largest, most enduring and profitable software businesses of our time. I've never been more convinced in that belief.\nBefore I turn the call over, I'd like to take a minute to acknowledge Aneel, who recently moved into a new role as Executive Chair. Aneel, it has been an incredible 14 months, and I'm truly grateful for your partnership and the trust you put in me to lead what you and Dave started nearly 19 years ago. Your technology vision and your commitment to Workday's special culture and values have put this company in an incredible position. I am excited for what we'll achieve together next. Thank you for continuing to be in my corner not just in guiding the applications and platform development but also as a friend. Aneel, over to you.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call. As Carl highlighted, we are continuing to see solid momentum across the business, fueled in large part by our ability to deliver the innovation our customers need to thrive in today's fast-paced and dynamic environment. There is no doubt that more and more organizations, spanning midsize to large enterprises, are seeing the increasing value in building their businesses upon the Workday platform with AI at its core.\nEarlier this month, we officially named Carl sole CEO of Workday while I assumed the role of Executive Chair. As I've said before, there is no better person than Carl to lead Workday through this next chapter of growth. He has already made a tremendous impact on the business from day 1. And thanks to his leadership, we are already successfully executing on several key growth initiatives and strategies that he put in place. Furthermore, and most importantly, Carl perfectly aligns with our values-driven approach, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us with him at the helm.\nAs Executive Chair, I'll remain actively involved but with an emphasis on my true passion as a technologist. Together with our Co-President, Sayan Chakraborty, and the rest of our amazing product and technology organization, I will focus on guiding the future direction of Workday's applications and technology platform while staying close to our Workmates and our customers.\nHow we evolve and expand the Workday platform in the coming years will be critical to our continued growth and scale. To help us do that, we have identified several core elements of our innovation strategy that we plan on building out over the next 12 to 18 months. The first is a continued focus on evolving our Financial Management and HCM applications so that we can further empower the offices of finance and HR to optimize their 2 most important assets, their people and their money.\nNext is AI. Fueled by our 10-year head start and unique approach to building AI directly into the core, we will continue to responsibly deliver new ML models that solve real business problems for our customers and enable their employees. We'll also incorporate high-value generative AI capabilities to enhance search, understand historical context, make recommendations and create content. Additionally, I'm incredibly excited about bringing HiredScore into the fold and how we'll further strengthen our overall AI capabilities.\nThird is industry, with an emphasis on deepening our offerings in retail and hospitality, education and government along with financial services, health care, professional services and tech and media. Extensibility is another important focus area so that we can enable IT teams to build and maintain integrations between Workday and third-party systems, ultimately extending the value of our platform. Our new Extend AI Gateway, which we announced at Rising last year, is a perfect example of the type of work we are focused on here.\nFifth is experiences. Delivering persona-tailored experiences empowers high-performing employees and teams for maximum productivity. Manager Insights Hub and Flex Teams, which we also unveiled at Rising, are just a few of the ways we've already been delivering enhanced experiences for managers.\nThe final area of investment is security and resiliency, which is foundational to everything we do. With more than 10,000 organizations depending on Workday to help run their businesses, it's essential that we design to protect the resilience and performance of critical processes, safeguard against the growing number of global cybersecurity threats and increase our investment in public cloud offerings to drive greater performance, scalability and security for our customers.\nWe're also investing in our long-term innovation strategy by continuing to strengthen our product and technology leadership team. I'm pleased to share that David Somers has been appointed as our new Chief Product Officer and will lead development across our full suite of products. David, who will continue to report into Sayan, has been instrumental in leading our HR product strategy and development in the last few years, and I'm excited that he will be helping to lead our efforts to build out the capabilities of Workday's full product portfolio.\nAs I think back to our early days, it's incredible to see the growth and scale we've been able to achieve. When our customers first went live in 2007, we offered a few different products. Today, we offer a full platform that helps our customers transform how they manage their people and their money. Additionally, we now have more than 5,400 core HCM and Finance customers, more than 65 million users under contract and process over 800 billion transactions per year. I'm proud of the company we've built and the continued value and impact that we deliver for our customers.\nIn closing, I want to extend my deepest thanks to our nearly 19,000 Workmates around the world for finishing our fiscal year 2024 in such a strong fashion. Workday's future is incredibly bright, and I'm energized to work alongside them, Carl and the rest of our leadership team to help drive Workday forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Zane. Over to you, Zane.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As Carl and Aneel mentioned, Q4 marked a solid close to FY '24 with momentum building across our key investment initiatives. We enter FY '25 well positioned to deliver another year of durable subscription revenue growth, coupled with expanding margins.\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in Q4 was $1.76 billion, up 18%, and full year FY '24 subscription revenue was $6.6 billion, growing 19%. Professional services revenue was $162 million in the quarter and $656 million for the year. Total revenue in Q4 was $1.92 billion and for the full year was $7.26 billion, both growing 17%. U.S. revenue in Q4 totaled $1.44 billion, up 16%, and international revenue totaled $478 million, growth of 21%. For the year, U.S. revenue was $5.46 billion and international revenue was $1.8 billion, both growing 17%.\nAs we have highlighted, we see significant long-term international market opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful driver of our growth. 12-month subscription revenue backlog or CRPO was $6.62 billion at the end of Q4, representing growth of 20% with the outperformance driven by higher-than-anticipated early renewals. Gross and net revenue retention rates remain over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $20.92 billion, up 27%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $461 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9%. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $1.74 billion, reflecting a non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. Q4 GAAP net income benefited from a onetime $1.1 billion valuation allowance release related to our U.S. deferred tax assets. Q4 operating cash flow was $996 million, with approximately $100 million of the outperformance driven by strong in-quarter collections and earlier-than-expected payments. Full year operating cash flow was $2.15 billion, growth of 30%.\nDuring Q4, we repurchased $136 million of our shares at an average price of $253.85 per share. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with $7.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to invest in growth areas of the business, and we ended January with over 18,800 Workmates around the globe.\nNow turning to guidance. We are reiterating our full year FY '25 subscription revenue guidance of $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%, which aligns with the preliminary outlook we provided last quarter. This guidance reflects our Q4 performance and our expectation for current macro conditions to persist throughout FY '25. We expect Q1 FY '25 subscription revenue to be $1.81 billion, representing 18% growth. I will highlight that Q1 benefits from an extra day of revenue recognition, given the leap year. Normalized for this, our guided subscription revenue growth in Q1 is approximately 17%. For Q2, we expect subscription revenue to increase approximately 5% sequentially, reflecting typical seasonality in the business when considering the leap year impact of Q1. We anticipate FY '25 professional services revenue of approximately $630 million to $640 million as we further leverage our partner ecosystem. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $163 million.\nTurning to backlog. As we've highlighted, CRPO growth is influenced by quarter-to-quarter variability in renewal volume, which can impact its growth in any particular quarter. In FY '25, we expect CRPO growth to come off the elevated levels we experienced in FY '24 as we lap periods of strong scheduled and early renewals. Given this variability, we expect CRPO to increase between 17.5% and 18.5% in Q1. We expect FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 24.5%. Our outlook contemplates incremental investments across our key growth initiatives while delivering continued margin expansion as we scale and optimize the business. For Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 24.5%.\nGAAP operating margins for the first quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 24 and 21 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '25 non-GAAP tax rate is 19%. We expect FY '25 operating cash flow of $2.25 billion, which is impacted by the $100 million of Q4 collections I called out as well as an extra payroll payment we expect to make in FY '25, given the leap year. In addition, we expect FY '25 capital expenditures of approximately $330 million.\nOur FY '25 outlook takes into account the acquisition of HiredScore, which is expected to close later this quarter. We're pleased with our execution in FY '24, thanks to the support of our customers, partners and Workmates. With momentum building across our strategic growth areas, we enter FY '25 focused on continuing to invest to drive long-term growth while also expanding margins. Let me turn it back over to Aneel before we begin Q&A.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Zane. Given my new role, this will be my last regularly scheduled earnings call as I fully hand over the reins to the great Carl and Zane. It's been a pleasure getting to know so many of you over the years, and I wanted to give a special thank you to Mark Murphy, Brent Thill, Pat Walravens, Kirk Materne and John DiFucci, who have all been covering Workday since our IPO in 2012, and also to Kash Rangan, who I'm sure wanted to cover us back then but couldn't because his wife was a Workmate at the time. Okay. With that, operator, let's go to the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Justin, you may begin.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our co-CEOs; Zane Rowe, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions.\nOur press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nPlease refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur fourth quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on January 15, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nChief Operating Officer and Co-President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining our Q3 FY '21 earnings call. I'm pleased to share that Workday delivered another strong quarter, achieving 18% subscription revenue growth, 22% 12-month backlog growth and non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. These results were driven by broad-based strength across net new and customer base teams, medium and large enterprise and across regions, notably the U.S. and EMEA. I want to thank the more than 18,300 Workmates around the globe for partnering with our customers to help drive these impressive results.\nThere is a clear sense of momentum across our business. and it was on full display at Workday Rising in September. There, we unleashed new AI innovation, delivered product and partnership announcements and drew a record 28,000 attendees in person and online. In fact, over half of our active pipeline was touched by a Rising event in San Francisco and just a couple of weeks ago in Barcelona, we followed up with our largest ever EMEA Rising event with over 4,500 people in attendance.\nIn speaking with customers, prospects and partners at these events, a few things stood out to me. First, talent continues to be a top C-suite priority. In this macro environment, businesses are looking to scale and drive productivity. They can't achieve both outcomes by simply hiring more. Leaders are turning to Workday to help them reskill and upskill their workforce, all while delivering a great employee experience. That helps them reduce attrition and ultimately drives productivity. Second, leaders are continuing to consolidate their technology footprint on a true platform to realize total cost of ownership benefits, while also accelerating their operations. Workday is perfectly positioned to benefit as the intelligent digital backbone businesses can rely on to manage their most precious assets: their people and their money. And finally, AI, and in particular, generative AI is becoming a business imperative. As a trusted partner and a market leader with over 65 million users under contract, we can uniquely drive efficiencies and improve the employee experience. Aneel will share more, but I will say that it is what we are doing and not just saying that it's resonating with our customers.\nSimply put, our value proposition has never been so relevant and powerful. That's clear in the results our team delivered in Q3 and in the first half of FY '24. At our recent financial Analyst Day, we talked about the diversity and durability of our business and how it helps us grow during times of headwinds and times of tailwinds. This theme was evident in the wins we had this quarter.\nFrom a net new customer perspective, we once again saw strength in full platform deals. We welcomed customers like AdventHealth, Bentley Systems, Houston Methodist and Lifespan as new full platform HCM and Financials customers, and new HCM customers such as Greene King Brewing, Group 1 Automotive, Minor Hotel Group and the U.S. Department of Energy helped us surpass 5,000 core HCM customers on Workday.\nAlongside helping new customer activity, we had several strategic expansions and renewals in the quarter, including Magna International, Mondelez Global, Sonoco Products Company and Southwest Airlines. And I'm pleased to share that our Create and Close business had another great quarter and is becoming a meaningful driver of our customer-based sales team's growth.\nNow I want to highlight some of the key growth areas we discussed with you at Financial Analyst Day. Starting with international, which represents over half our addressable opportunity. In EMEA, I'm pleased to say that our leadership additions are driving improved and more consistent results. The team here once again delivered strong new ACV, particularly in the U.K., Germany, France and Spain and helped us eclipse the $1 billion ARR mark in the region.\nWin rates were robust against our competitors, even in their own backyards. We had important new wins like AXA UK, AURELIUS Group and international schools, along with expansions at BBVA, Carl Zeiss and Thales Global Services, among others. And in the Asia Pacific region, Australia performed well with wins such as Ramsay Health Care and Wesley Mission Queensland.\nWe still have work to do in APAC, but we're focused on it, and I'm delighted Simon Tate has joined us to run the region. We're also making important investments in Japan to help expand our opportunity within one of the world's largest economies. As part of this, our leader in Japan will now report directly to Patrick Blair, our President of Global Sales.\nMoving to Financials. We're seeing proof that our go-to-market investments are continuing to pay off with healthy growth in both core financial customers and new ACV. New full platform wins are on the rise, and our industry approach is contributing to this momentum. Healthcare, for example, grew new ACV over 50% in Q3, and roughly half of the healthcare deals we landed in the quarter were full platform.\nState and local government also continues to outperform with strategic full platform wins at County of Kern, County of Chesterfield and the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Our back-to-base motion in Financials also delivered in Q3. Wins included Clearwater Analytics, Ochsner Clinic Foundation and Concentrix, which expanded their Workday HR footprint to include core financials when it combined with Webhelp, a Workday core Financials customer in EMEA.\nOur planning business also had a strong Q3, and we welcomed AWS as a planning customer along with NPR and stores Kogan Group. And finally, our win rates remain strong, and we see a growing pipeline of opportunities to replace our legacy ERP competitors.\nOn the partner front, we've always recognized the vital role our ecosystem plays in our customer success and it starts with go-lives. HCM go-lives this quarter included American Electric Power, Dave & Buster's and Iberdrola, along with Financials go-lives at NorthShore University HealthSystem SolutionHealth and Weis Markets. Increasingly, we're leaning into our partner ecosystem in other strategic ways.\nOur skills accelerator partnership with Accenture, which we announced at EMEA Rising, is a great example. Accenture will be reselling our skills solution, providing their own services expertise on top of the Workday Skills Cloud. We also announced a partnership with ADP to extend the capability of Workday HCM with ADP's payroll and SmartCompliance solutions in key global markets. And we announced AI Marketplace at Rising, which allows us to innovate with our ecosystem of partners to deliver trusted and responsible AI solutions for our customers' most compelling use cases.\nFinally, we see strong momentum from our partner referral program we launched earlier this year. We've already exceeded our full year targets for the number of partners that have signed on. And while it's early, we are starting to see a positive impact to our pipeline.\nAnother key investment area is around AI, which we've been building into our platform for nearly a decade. As I mentioned, at Rising, we demonstrated our leadership with new announcements in demos that illustrated how AI will shape the future of work. I won't steal Aneel's thunder. He'll be joining in just a minute to share more.\nIn closing, we had another quarter of strong and consistent performance amidst a dynamic environment. The diversity and mission-critical nature of our business continues to fuel our success. As we move through Q4, we have a solid pipeline and clear momentum for our solutions. And while we are clearly focused on delivering in the near term, we have our sights set on delivering durable 17% to 19% subscription revenue growth over the long term while expanding margins.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to my Co-CEO and good friend, Aneel, who will share more about our AI strategy and innovation highlights from the quarter. Aneel, over to you.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call. As you heard Carl mention, an increasing number of organizations across all industries and geographies are continuing to place their trust in Workday, which is why we remain focused on delivering the innovation our customers need to thrive in today's environment.\nFor the last couple of quarters, we've highlighted our longstanding and differentiated approach to AI, including generative AI, that is driven by our platform strategy, unrivaled data set, emphasis on being human-centric and commitment to delivering responsible and trustworthy solutions. At Workday Rising in September, our leadership in this space was showcased in a big way as we unveiled a series of new AI capabilities that will help redefine the way our customers work.\nOn the generative AI front, we announced several new capabilities that will benefit all users with an emphasis on increasing productivity, growing and retaining talent, streamlining business processes and driving better decision-making. Examples of the use cases we previewed, which we expect to be available next year, include the ability to generate job descriptions in minutes versus hours; analyze and correct contracts for faster, more accurate revenue recognition; create employee growth plans to foster and retain talent; and provide text-to-code generation capabilities to increase productivity of app development and Workday Extend.\nAnother way we're infusing generative AI into our platform is through our investment in conversational AI. While we are still in an exploratory phase with this technology, we believe conversational AI will fundamentally change how users interact with Workday by enabling them to easily surface information they need and interact with data through simple conversation.\nWe're also leveraging generative AI to create a conversational experience for Workday Adaptive Planning customers. The use of conversational text will simplify the process of surfacing key planning insights, enabling users to make quicker, more fatigue decisions about their businesses.\nAdditionally, we announced enhancements to Workday Extend, which continues to be a critical solution to help bring the Workday platform to life for our customers and partners. In fact, we've seen an increase of more than 70% in the number of apps built by customers and partners with Extend in the last year alone. At Rising, we unveiled Workday AI Gateway, which is available in Workday Extend. Our AI Gateway provides developers with access to Workday's AI services to enhance our ability to build intelligent and responsible apps on the Workday platform.\nTurning to the office of the CHRO. We introduced several new features within Workday HCM that leverage AI, many with a focus on elevating the manager experience by providing them with the tools and insights they need to effectively lead and foster the career growth of their teams. One example is Manager Insights Hub, which leverages AI to surface personalized recommendations and make it easier for managers to identify the best opportunities for their employees based on skills interest to improve talent mobility and employee engagement.\nAnd while we will continue to deliver on the promise of AI for our customers, many of our partners and other enterprise companies are delivering on the promise of AI as well. As Carl mentioned, we announced our AI marketplace to help harness the AI innovation happening across our ecosystem. To date, we have 15 early adopters, and that number will increase over time as we expand to include tailored solutions delivered by our partner ecosystem, Workday-related capabilities and third-party products and native AI-powered Workday Extend apps.\nOf course, none of these AI advancements can truly be effective without the right safeguards and regulations in place. Building on our continued efforts to advocate for smart AI policy at the federal level, Workday's Josh Landon, Vice President of Productivity Technology, was invited to testify before Congress on AI in the future of work. Josh spoke to the potential of AI to enhance how workers collaborate and amplify human potential and the steps Workday is taking to deploy these technologies in a trustworthy and responsible manner.\nAt the application level, Workday products continue to be recognized for the innovation that we deliver to customers. For the office of the CHRO, Workday was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for 1,000+ Employee Enterprises. Workday was positioned highest for ability to execute, and it marked the eighth consecutive year we were recognized as a leader.\nAdditionally, Workday VNDLY was named a 2023 Top HR Product of the Year by Human Resource Executive. The award recognized VNDLY's ability to provide organizations with a full set of capabilities for end-to-end life cycle management of external workers and its ability to integrate with Workday HCM to support full visibility into head count spend and more. And for the office of the CFO, Workday was named a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises based on completeness of vision and ability to execute. This is the second year in a row that Workday was recognized as a leader.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire Workday team for their incredible efforts in Q3. We have an amazing opportunity in front of us, and I remain confident in our ability to capitalize on it, thanks in large part to our more than 18,300 Workmates. They are relentlessly focused on driving innovation across the entire Workday platform to actively address our customers' finance and HR needs.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Zane Rowe. Over to you, Zane.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. As Carl and Aneel mentioned, Q3 was a strong quarter, highlighting the durability of our business and ongoing market adoption for cloud Financials and HCM.\nTurning to results. Subscription revenue in Q3 was $1.69 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $175 million, leading to total revenue of $1.87 billion, growth of 17%. U.S. revenue totaled $1.4 billion, growing 17%, and international revenue totaled $462 million, growing at the same rate.\nAs we've highlighted, we see significant long-term international opportunities, which we expect over time will become a more meaningful driver of our growth. As we discussed at our recent financial Analyst Day, we are providing our 12-month subscription revenue backlog, or CRPO, which was $6.05 billion at the end of Q3, representing growth of 22%.\nThe result was driven by strong new ACV bookings and healthy renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates of over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Early renewals in the quarter exceeded our expectations, adding more than 1 point of growth to 12-month backlog, and early renewals from prior quarters also continued to benefit backlog growth in Q3. 24-month subscription revenue backlog was $10.58 billion at the end of Q3, up 23%.\nEarly renewals in the quarter added nearly 2 points of growth to the result. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $18.45 billion, up 31%. Backlog benefits from increased contract duration, which speaks to our customers' continued commitment to our platform.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $462 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 24.8%. Margin strength relative to our guidance was driven by revenue outperformance and the timing of certain expenses and investments, which we expect to build in the fourth quarter. Q3 operating cash flow was $451 million, growing 10%.\nDuring Q3, we repurchased $148 million of our shares at an average price of $218.35 per share, and we had $139 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program as of quarter end. We intend to execute on the remaining authorization of our buyback during Q4.\nWe ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. We continue to invest in growth areas in the business, and we ended October with over 18,300 Workmates around the globe.\nNow turning to guidance. Following our continued momentum in Q3, we are raising our full year FY '24 subscription revenue guidance to $6.598 billion, representing 19% year-over-year growth. We expect Q4 subscription revenue to be $1.755 billion, representing 17% year-over-year growth. We now expect professional services revenue of $158 million in Q4 and $652 million for the full year.\nIn Q4, we expect 12-month backlog to grow approximately 19%. This includes our current outlook for early renewals in the quarter. We plan to continue disclosing our 12-month, 24-month and total backlog, but intend to provide guidance on 12 months going forward.\nWe are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 23.8%. And for Q4, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.5% as we ramp up our key investment areas. GAAP operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively.\nThe FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We are raising our FY '24 operating cash flow outlook to $1.975 billion, growth of 19% year-over-year. In addition, we now expect FY '24 capital expenditures of approximately $250 million. As we discussed at our recent financial Analyst Day, we see considerable opportunity to drive durable, profitable growth over the longer term.\nThe financial framework, which we shared in September is further bolstered by our Q3 performance and the momentum we see building across key growth areas of our business. In light of the continued uncertain macro and incorporating our Q4 outlook, we currently expect FY '25 subscription revenue of approximately $7.725 billion to $7.775 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%. We also expect to expand our FY '25 non-GAAP operating margins from FY '24 levels.\nOur outlook contemplates incremental investments across our key growth initiatives while delivering continued margin expansion as we scale and optimize the business. The confidence in our outlook is supported by the advocacy and support of our customers, partners and Workmates who are all key contributors to our success.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nAnalyst, William Blair & Co. LLC\n\nWelcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our Co-CEOs; Zane Rowe Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our Co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Carl.\n\nCarl Eschenbach\n\nChief Operating Officer and Co-President, VMware, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Call. I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter, achieving subscription revenue growth of 19%, 24-month backlog growth of 23% and non-GAAP operating margin of 24%. While we continue to see deal scrutiny, our workmates around the world did a remarkable job staying close to our customers in driving this quarter's results and positioning us for strength in the second half of the year and beyond. Workday continues to stand out from the crowd for a few key reasons.\nFirst, the mission-critical nature of our platform. Our customers, now representing more than 65 million users under contract, are all-in on Workday because they trust us to manage their two most important assets: Their people and their money. Trust is at the core of our customer relationships, and we will always work to earn it.\nSecond, our value proposition is strengthening as businesses consolidate their technology footprint from best-of-breed solutions to a true platform. Workday is a trusted platform they can turn to, to drive productivity gains, agility, skills-based talent strategies and a great employee experience all at the same time.\nThird is our unique approach to AI and ML, and Aneel will share more on our progress here shortly. And finally, our winning culture and talent, which is only getting stronger as we continue to attract our industry's best talent.\nWe recently welcomed Emma Chalwin as Chief Marketing Officer. Emma's not only a great culture fit, but she has extensive global experience across all facets of marketing at companies like Salesforce and Adobe. We also recently hired an incredible head of our U.S. federal government team and a senior executive in sales operations and another in our services organization to help us scale our go-to-market efforts.\nAnd of course, you all know our CFO, Zane Rowe, who is joining us today for his first earnings call. I could not be more excited to welcome these leaders, who, along with our existing team, will help us achieve our next phase of growth.\nTurning to the highlights of the quarter. I will focus on 5 key areas: land, expand, global, industries and partners. Starting with land, we see full Financials and HCM platform wins on the rise, illustrating the trust customers have in Workday. Wins this quarter include Advocate Health, AssuredPartners, Carillion Services, Fortrea, KinderCare and University of Florida. And we continue to build on our market leadership position in HCM with new customer wins, including Fresenius Digital Technology, Stellantis and Rio Tinto.\nOnce we land customers, we immediately turn our efforts to successful deployments. In Q2, notable HCM go-lives include A1 Telekom Austria, Korean Airlines, Nike and Rite Aid. Strategic financial go-lives include Fitness International, MultiCare Health Systems, Wintrust and the University of Washington. We also celebrated our first FedRAMP Go Live, which was a full platform rollout at a well-known civilian agency.\nExpanding our existing business with customers is key to our growth strategy. In addition to strong renewals this quarter, we had a number of expansions at companies such as Airbus, Dell Technologies, Lloyds Bank, Lowe's Companies and 7-Eleven. Our faster time-to-value solutions, which includes Planning, Peakon, Extend, Health and Talent Optimization continue to gain traction with many deals created and closed within the quarter.\nThis year, we put increased focus on Financial's go-to-market, and it's starting to bear fruit, with healthy customer growth in Q2. Beyond the full platform deals I mentioned earlier, we had a number of financial expansion wins in the quarter, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, Nordic Consulting and Rakuten. Given our momentum, we continue to invest in Financial's targeted sellers to lay the foundation for durable growth.\nFrom a geographic perspective, the U.S. continues to be our largest market, representing 75% of our revenue. The U.S. team drove solid results in Q2, with particular strength coming from our customer base and industry teams. We have a significant runway for growth in this market and a healthy pipeline looking forward.\nExpanding our footprint globally is among our largest untapped opportunities and is a top priority. During Q2, we held 20 Elevate customer events across EMEA and APJ, attracting over 5,000 attendees and generating hundreds of leads in net new opportunities. Not only are we building pipeline, we're starting to see more consistent execution in certain regions, notably EMEA. We saw strength in key markets such as Germany, U.K. and France, where wins included Rhenus Assets, Symrise, National Westminster Bank and ALD Automotive SA.\nOur industry-first approach is paying off. This quarter, retail and hospitality became our second industry joining Financial Services to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And we continue to have strong momentum in Financial Services, which outperformed in Q2.\nThe health care team also delivered another strong performance, with 3 large hospital systems going all-in on Workday's platform in Q2. A great example is Advocate Health, which is part of their merger with Atrium Health, selected Workday to replace a competitor's cloud HCM Financials and Supply Chain Management solution.\nWorkday Supply Chain continues to contribute to our traction in health care with more than 220 health care organizations investing in it to reduce costs, promote standardization and boost resiliency. Finally, our Education and Government team followed up a strong start to the year with an impressive Q2, with wins such as West Virginia University, DePaul University and Metropolitan Community College, to name a few.\nThe potential we have to accelerate our growth through our partner community is huge. We are seeing early signs that our partner referral program will positively impact new logos, and our partnership with the AWS Marketplace led to multiple strategic wins in Q2.\nIn EMEA, our recently announced payroll partnership with Alight is beginning to drive pipeline. And in APJ, our strategic partnership expansion with Samsung SDS is not only helping us drive overall business in South Korea, it also is enabling the development of region-specific applications built on Workday Extend.\nAfter spending time with many of our partners at our Annual Altitude Conference this past quarter, it is clear our momentum is building. We look forward to welcoming more than 15,000 members of our Workday community at our Annual Workday Rising Conference next month in San Francisco. We hope to see many of you there.\nAs this quarter's results show, the diversity and mission-critical nature of our business continues to fuel our success. We are the clear market leader for cloud HCM and finance, and our value proposition has never been more relevant or powerful. We are investing across our product portfolio, geographies, industries and through partnerships to drive durable long-term growth.\nIt is an incredible and exciting time to be a Workmate, and I truly believe our future has never been brighter. With that, I will turn it over to my co-CEO and good friend, Aneel, who will share more about our AI and ML strategy and innovation highlights from the quarter. Aneel, over to you.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carl, and to everyone joining today's call, and especially to our nearly 17,900 Workmates around the world for helping deliver another solid quarter. I couldn't agree more with the sentiment that our future is extremely bright. I've been on the road a lot recently to meet with current and prospective customers, and one thing is abundantly clear: more and more organizations are looking to Workday to be their trusted partner to help them navigate today's business landscape and thrive in this new world of work.\nCritical to our ability to be that trusted partner is our continued focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, including generative AI. Last quarter, I highlighted Workday's unique approach to AI and ML, which began in earnest in 2014 with a focus on 3 key aspects: AI and ML are embedded into the core of our platform, we place an emphasis on being human-centric with our AI and ML strategy, and we continue to believe the true potential of AI and ML can only be met by ensuring that it is leveraged in a trustworthy and ethical way.\nLooking ahead, generative AI will continue to be a major focus for us. Despite the recent hype cycle, Workday has been using large language models for years, and we're continuing to invest in a big way. What helps further set Workday apart is our unrivaled data set quality, which is fueled by our more than 65 million users under contract and $600 billion annual transactions to create data models that provide accurate, meaningful, and most importantly, trustworthy results.\nWe're currently building product capabilities that leverage generative AI for a variety of tests. Examples include natural language generation, content search, content summarization, content augmentation and document understanding. And we're looking beyond those use cases at how we can also leverage copilots, agents and conversational UI. Each will help our customers redefine the way they work, and we look forward to previewing these new capabilities along with the rest of our latest AI developments at Workday Rising in September.\nAll told, our differentiated approach is working as we are seeing continued momentum across the board with our over 3,000 customers having opted into sharing their data with our ML models. And we know they are realizing value once they have opted in as we are processing more than 50 million ML inferences per day, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year.\nFurthermore, we believe that the enhanced value that AI and generative AI provide to our customers will also create economic benefits to Workday by positively influencing competitive win rates, renewal rates and our already industry-leading customer satisfaction. We plan to offer most AI capabilities to our customers who opt in as part of their current product subscription with generous base usage entitlements.\nWe also expect AI to open up new market opportunities with direct monetization that are wholly based on AI technologies, similar to our talent optimization solution that leverages Skills Cloud, one of our fastest-growing SKUs. Last quarter, I also shared our perspective on the growing importance of AI safeguards and the active role we're playing in driving the development of smart regulations.\nSince then, the EU has entered final negotiations on its AI Act, which we expect to shape AI regulation globally. We've worked closely with policymakers in Europe over the last 2 years, and we're pleased to see many of our suggestions accepted in the Parliaments version that was recently approved.\nIn the U.S., under the leadership of Sayan Chakraborty, our Co-President, we played a leading role in helping develop the AI framework for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, which is a how-to guide for organizations to develop and use trustworthy AI. We are leading by example by implementing the NIST AI framework, and we're working with Congress to encourage adoption of it throughout the federal government.\nWe are also helping to drive the conversation with lawmakers at the state level, including California, as they look to find a path forward for new AI regulations. We're helping them develop legislative frameworks that build trust in AI tools while driving innovation across the enterprise. As we continue to drive thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI, you'll hear more from us on our work in the EU, the U.S. and around the world at this pivotal moment for AI policy.\nOn the application front, we're continuing to see our innovation story resonate with customers who are increasingly selecting Workday over the competition. According to Gartner Enterprise Application Software as a Service, market share research, which was published in Q2, Workday had the highest worldwide market share in 2022 for SaaS ERP at 21%. Additionally, we crossed another milestone in Q2 with more than 5,000 core HCM and finance customers, a testament to the power of the Workday platform.\nFor the office of the CFO, we enhanced Workday Adaptive Planning with the next generation of our patented Elastic Hypercube technology. Powered by new AI and performance improvements, Workday Adaptive Planning can now support our customers' most complex planning requirements, scaling automatically without sacrificing speed or performance.\nFurther proof to the continued momentum we are seeing with this application, Workday Adaptive Planning was named Best Financial Management Solution in the 2023 SIIA CODIE Awards. Workday was also named the Customer's Choice in the 2023 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer for Financial Planning Software report.\nAdditionally, Workday Accounting Center is proving to be a true difference maker for the office of the CFO, as shown by the 70% year-over-year growth it experienced in Q2. Today, Accounting Center is helping more than 150 customers across a dozen industries to pull from a larger, more diverse spectrum of operational data sources to deliver increased granular insights and allow them to better understand their profitability, all in one system.\nAnd for the office of the CHRO, Workday HCM was named a leader in the Forrester Wave: Human Capital Management Q2 2023 report, which highlighted our investments in VNDLY and Workday Peakon Employee Voice as well as our use of embedded AI and ML to reduce user friction.\nIn closing, I'm confident that our continued focus on driving innovation across the entire Workday platform will not only position us for future growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue but also play an integral role in helping us continue to build the highest levels of trust with our more than 10,000 customers. I'm excited to see many of you next month for Workday Rising, which is back in the Bay Area for 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Zane Rowe. As Carl pointed out earlier, Zane has been a perfect fit since joining Workday last quarter, and I'm thrilled to have him on board. Over to you, Zane.\n\nZane Rowe\n\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Aneel. As this is my first earnings call as Workday's CFO, I want to start by saying how honored I am to partner alongside you, Aneel, Carl and all of our fellow Workmates around the globe. I joined Workday because I thought it was one of the most compelling opportunities in all of enterprise software. The continued strength we saw in Q2 further reinforces that belief.\nTurning to the quarter. Subscription revenue in Q2 was $1.62 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $163 million, leading to total revenue of $1.79 billion, growth of 16%. From a geographic perspective, total revenue outside the U.S. was $442 million, representing 25% of total revenue and 15% growth in Q2.\nAs Carl mentioned, we see significant long-term international growth opportunities, which we expect, over time, will become a more meaningful portion of our revenue mix. 24-month subscription revenue backlog was $10.27 billion at the end of Q2, up 23%, driven by new ACV bookings and strong renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates of over 95% and over 100%, respectively.\nEarly renewals in the quarter exceeded our expectations and added roughly 1.5 points of growth to 24-month backlog. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.85 billion, up 32%. Early renewals in the quarter added roughly 3 points to the growth. In addition, we continue to see longer contract duration on both net new deals and renewals, which speaks to our customers' continued commitment to our platform and is causing our total backlog growth to significantly outpace growth in the 24-month backlog.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $421 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.6%. Margin strength relative to our guidance was driven by revenue outperformance and the timing of certain expenses. Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, which benefited from the timing of collections in the quarter.\nDuring Q2, we repurchased $139 million in shares at an average price of $218.33 per share. And we had $287 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nWe continue to add key talents across strategic growth areas of the business, and we ended Q2 with nearly 17,900 global Workmates. We are pleased with our financial performance in Q2 and focused on continuing to drive results in the second half while investing to support longer-term growth.\nNow turning to guidance. Following our momentum in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year FY '24 subscription revenue guidance to a new range of $6.57 billion to $6.59 billion, representing 18% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be $1.678 billion to $1.68 billion, representing 17% year-over-year growth. We're maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of $630 million to $650 million as we continue to strategically shift more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy.\nFor Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $165 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 21% year-over-year in Q3. This includes our current outlook for early renewals in the quarter. We are raising our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 23.5% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach of investing in long-term growth while we expand margins.\nFor Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.5%. GAAP operating margins for the third quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 20 and 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins, respectively. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We expect FY '24 operating cash flow of $1.95 billion, growth of 18% year-over-year.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate making our first semiannual payment of our employee cash bonus plan in Q3, which impacts our annual cash flow and quarterly seasonality for FY '24. In addition, we continue to expect FY '24 capital expenditures of approximately $300 million.\nI'll close by thanking our terrific community of customers and partners for their continued support. And I look forward to seeing many of you in the investment community at our upcoming Financial Analyst Day on September 27 in San Francisco.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

LLC\n\n-- to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2023. With that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. I'm pleased to share that Workday reported strong Q1 results and once again outperformed against our key operating metrics, which include a subscription revenue growth of 20% for the quarter. While the macro environment continues to be unpredictable, we remain positive about our future growth prospects for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, we got the year off to a strong start and have built a healthy pipeline of opportunities which gives us better visibility into the rest of fiscal '24. And second, we are seeing the value proposition of the full Workday platform, combined with our unique approach to artificial intelligence and machine learning, continue to gain momentum as more and more organizations across geographies and industries put their trust in us to help them drive the future of work.\nWhen it comes to AI and ML, we think about implemented differently than any other enterprise software company in the world. And we've been at it for nearly a decade, while many of our competitors are scrambling to catch up. We approach AI and ML with a heavy emphasis on being human-centric, using these capabilities to augment people and organizations to make them more productive, better informed to make decisions, and to help them reduce business risk.\nSeveral things set us apart. One, AI and ML are embedded into the very core of our platform, allowing us to rapidly deliver and sustain new ML-infused capabilities into our products to drive more business value for our customers. \nTwo, we have the quantity and quality of data that further differentiates us, meaning that we not only have access to an enormous amount of data due to the more than 60 million users representing more than 600 billion transactions over the last year, but we also have a unified data model that allows us to build and train models in a way our competitors simply cannot replicate.\nAnd three, we firmly believe that to deliver on the possibilities it offers, AI and ML must be leveraged in a trustworthy and ethical way. Workday has always been a trusted partner to help companies keep their most critical assets, their people and money, safe, secure, and private. This approach becomes even more essential when leveraging AI and ML. As you know, generative AI is driving the AI and ML discussion right now. Despite the recent hype around large language models, Workday has been delivering AI and ML, including LLMs, for several years.\nWe believe we need to look past the hype cycle and identify the real ways our customers can extract business value from LLMs. Today, we're using generative AI tools behind the scenes to help power products like Workday Search and Skills Cloud, while exploring a variety of generative AI use cases for our customers. For example, we're looking at many content generation use cases within our Workday talent management, recruiting, financial management, and core HCM applications.\nAdditionally, for years, we have taken a leading role in AI-focused policy discussions at the federal, state, and local level in the U.S. while partnering with the European Union and other governments around the world to provide thoughtful and concrete policy approaches to responsible AI. Simply put, we believe AI technology should be regulated. This is an area that you will continue to hear more from us in future quarters, and I look forward to sharing updates about how Workday is helping to drive AI policy globally. \nMoving to our core set of applications, we continued our investment in Workday Peakon Employee Voice by recently unveiling semantic search capabilities, which leverages AI to analyze millions of employee comments and present the most meaningful insights. While manual keyword searches take hours or days, semantic search can analyze employee comments in seconds to quickly provide leaders with the insights they need to address emerging workplace trends.\nEmployee engagement is one of the biggest hot buttons for CEOs today, and we're continuing to see more organizations turn to Peakon to help them stay on top of and address employee sentiment. In fact, Peakon hit a significant milestone in Q1 as it surpassed more than 500 million total survey responses and 70 million written comments, providing us with one of the world's largest standardized data sets on employee sentiment.\n For the office of the CFO, we recently unveiled Predictive Forecaster, a capability within Workday Adaptive Planning that creates ML-based forecasts, with the ability to add additional regressors and data sets. The feature, which is in limited availability today, supports our next evolution of Workday Adaptive Planning to produce increasingly predictive plans and enhance insights to help organizations more effectively navigate today's business landscape. Another important innovation focus area for us is to be more open and connected, whether that's by providing an open and extensible platform or by working closely with our partners to deliver added value to our customers. \nFor our Workday platform, we are continuing to deliver tools and capabilities that simplify and enhance application development with Workday Extend. For example, we introduced our first set of ML APIs in Q1 to enable our Extend customers to build extensions that leverage ML.\nWe also released low-code/no-code development functionality with App Builder, enabling developers to create apps with Extend via a simple drag-and-drop user interface. And we built on our decade-plus partnership with AWS to create a native integration from Extend to AWS. With this integration, developers can easily and securely leverage AWS services in their Extend applications. The integration is in early access, with GA to follow later this year. Extend, which surpassed 500 customers in Q1, continues to be a major differentiator for us with the office of the CIO.\nAdditionally, we held Workday DevCon, our third annual developers conference, earlier this month. In-person attendance for this year's event grew by nearly 200% over last year, which is a testament to the excitement we're seeing from our customers and partners to build on top of the Workday platform, not only with Extend, but with Prism, Adaptive Planning, journeys, and integrations. And on the partner front, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Alight to deliver an integrated payroll experience to customers across six key regions for us in Europe: Benelux, Germany, Italy, the Nordics, Spain, and Switzerland.\nAs you know, Workday's core values are foundational to everything we do and guide the decisions we make. In recognition of our efforts to always strive to do what's right, I'm pleased to share that Workday for the third consecutive year was named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Additionally, we continued our commitment to sustainability by joining Frontier, an advance market commitment to accelerate carbon removal. Finally, I want to note an organizational change that we will be making. After nearly nine years with Workday, Barbara Larson, our current CFO, is stepping away to spend more time with her family. During her time with Workday, Barbara has served in several senior leadership roles across our finance and product organizations and has played an integral role in shaping Workday into the company we are today. I'm extremely grateful for her friendship and for the countless contributions she has made to the company, and I wish her nothing but the best in her next endeavor.\nWith Barbara leaving, I'm pleased to announce that Zane Rowe will be joining Workday as our new CFO. Zane comes to us from VMware, where he was CFO since 2016, and before that held CFO roles at EMC and United Airlines. Carl and Zane worked together at VMware, so I'll let Carl share more in a minute on what Zane's addition to our leadership team will mean for Workday. In closing, we once again delivered a strong quarter and feel good about our growth prospects throughout the rest of fiscal year '24 despite what will continue to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. Innovation is core to who we are and fuels our continuing focus on infusing differentiated AI and ML across our entire product portfolio.\nDoing that will enable us to continue to serve as the digital backbone for organizations who want to thrive in today's changing world of work. With that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO and my good friend, Carl Eschenbach, to share our go-to-market highlights from the quarter. Carl, over to you.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, VMware, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aneel, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. I want to start by offering my sincere thanks to Barbara for all she has done for Workday in her nearly nine years here. As a board member and now as co-CEO, I've had the opportunity to watch her grow and help drive Workday forward across her many leadership roles.\nWithout question, Workday is a better company because of her. We will miss her, and we wish her well. As we search for a leader to take over as CFO, Aneel, the board, and I cannot think of a better person than Zane Rowe. I had the privilege of working alongside him at VMware, and I believe he is one of the finest executives and CFOs in all of enterprise software.\nAs we embark upon the next phase of our growth journey, Zane is the perfect person to guide us on our path of driving durable long-term growth and margin expansion. We are thrilled to welcome Zane to the team and expect a seamless transition over the next couple of months. Ninety days ago, at our global sales kickoff, we challenged our teams to deliver a strong start for FY '24. I'm proud to say that our work may met that goal, driving growth across key geographies, industries, and solutions, leading to strong new ACV growth in Q1. Because of their efforts, we are well positioned as we head into Q2 despite a challenging macro environment, which continues to cause customer uncertainty, increased scrutiny, and in some cases, lengthened sales cycles.\nI joined Workday as co-CEO six months ago. And while I was excited about the possibilities then, I am even more excited now. Sharing the co-CEO role with Aneel couldn't be going any better. Working alongside him, I've had the chance to witness the power of Aneel's 30 years of product experience, which is unmatched in our industry. Our complementary skills make a tremendous partnership.\nI've also spent a lot of time over the last few months meeting with our employees, customers, and partners around the world. These visits have shown me the energy and innovation across the Workday community firsthand. They've reinforced my belief that Workday has the potential to be one of the most enduring software businesses of our time. There are two key themes I keep hearing that sets us apart.\nThe first is that Workday is mission-critical. Workday is the intelligent digital backbone for enterprises who are looking to consolidate their technology footprint and move from best-of-breed applications to best in suite or best in platform.\nEnterprises are clearly looking to benefit from the reduced total cost of ownership and rapid pace of innovation that Workday delivers. Second, as Aneel mentioned, Workday's approach to AI and ML is a clear differentiator for us. With over 60 million users all on a unified data model, we are uniquely positioned to be the secure steady hand to support our customers through this tectonic technology shift, same as we did with cloud. Same as we did with cloud.\nTurning to highlights for the quarter, I would like to focus on five key areas: land, expand, global, industries, and partner. Our land motion with net new customers remains a primary driver of our growth. We had a strong performance landing new customers across our key buying centers, geographies, and industries in Q1 and continue to see significant runway.\nIn HCM, where we are the clear market leader, we saw sustained momentum with several new customer wins, including Dollar Tree, Interpublic Group, Johor Corporation, and McLane Company, along with notable HCM go-lives, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, J.Crew, and Lexmark International. Increasingly, customers are looking to leverage the full power of Workday by purchasing both HCM and Financial Management. New full platform wins in Q1 include IBEX Global Solutions, Pima County, the Rio, and Stevens Transport.\nWe also had several core FINs go-live, including Whole Foods, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and Extendicare, which went live on both financials and HCM. Another way that we strategically bring new customers into the Workday community is through our planning first motion, which drove healthy growth and had important wins in every major region this quarter, including Leonardo Hotels, LeoVegas, and a significant expansion of our agreement with ExxonMobil. Planning is an important first step on our customer's digital transformation journey. And once they are a Workday customer, we can partner with them to realize the full benefits of our platform.\nSeveral companies expanded from planning first to full platform in Q1, including DJE Holdings and The Nature Conservancy. Given this success, along with momentum we are seeing within the office of the CFO, we are adding significant sales capacity this year, focus on selling FINs. And while this is early, we are optimistic about the initial pipeline momentum from these resources. Customers are increasingly leaning into Workday as their trusted platform across the board.\nThis was reflected in strong renewals and healthy expansion activity across our installed base in Q1. Wins include Brown & Brown, IU Group, Nissan, and RaceTrac, to name a few. We are seeing expansion momentum across our product portfolio, including solutions that deliver faster time to value for customers such as Peakon, Planning, Help, and Talent Optimization. This momentum is helping our sales teams create and close a healthy amount of pipeline, all in the same quarter.\nGlobal growth continues to be a massive untapped opportunity for us. We drove strong execution across a number of our major geographies this quarter, yet less than 5% of our TAM is penetrated. In the U.S., we saw strong traction, particularly within large enterprise. In EMEA, we're seeing early signs that our new leadership team is coming together, with healthy growth across key markets, including Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordics, and wins, including Equinor, ASA, and Clyde & Co. In APJ, Australia was a highlight, with wins including Insignia Financial and the Australian arm of Tokio Marine.\nMomentum is also clearly building within our investment in native payroll in the Australian market. While we still have work to do in APJ to capture the full market potential, after spending time in the region in Q1, the executive team and I continue to see a lot of opportunity. Next, I want to highlight our industry-first approach, which is a critical part of winning the offices of the CFO and CHRO within our core services-based industries.\nIn higher education, for example, we have led the market over the last three years in cloud-native HCM, financial, and Student systems, according to The Tambellini Group. We saw continued momentum in Q1, with notable wins, including a FINs expansion at Northeastern University and new platform wins at the University of Richmond and Loyola University of Maryland. In the professional services industry, C wins I mentioned earlier include deals at DJE Holdings, IBEX, and Interpublic Group. In financial services, we had several wins and expansions, including Absa Bank, Fannie Mae, and First American.\nIn state and local government, we followed up a strong Q4 with another quarter of healthy growth. And in healthcare, we were pleased to be named the top-performing cloud ERP solution by KLAS Research, and we had important Q1 wins, including a significant expansion at Stamford healthcare. Our ability to accelerate our momentum in these industries and across our business depends on our ability to maintain a vibrant and engaged partner ecosystem. While our partner ecosystem has always been critical to our success, we are shifting even more deployments to our partners.\nAnd in return, we are looking to work with our partners in increasingly strategic ways to drive more co-innovation and greater lead generation for Workday. As part of that effort, we rolled out our new partner referral program in May, which puts clear incentives in place for our ecosystem to drive lead generation. In addition, following our go-to-market partnership with AWS we announced last quarter, I'm pleased to share that we had our first AWS private marketplace transaction during Q1. And as Aneel mentioned, the recently announced payroll partnership with Alight expands our global payroll coverage.\nIn closing, we're off to a great start in FY '24, with strong new business bookings, healthy pipelines, and continued progress toward our strategic growth initiatives. And while the macro remains uncertain, we are positioning the business to return to 20%-plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves and laying the foundation for driving durable growth in margin expansion for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Barbara. Barbara, over to you.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nGeneral Manager, Financial Management, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl. I appreciate the kind words. It's been such a pleasure to work and grow alongside you, Aneel, and this entire organization these last nine years. But after much thought, I know this is the right time for me to step back and focus on my family. And I can't think of a better person to pass the CFO reins to than Zane. He's a remarkable leader, an incredible person and culture fit, and the right person to take Workday on the next phase of its incredible growth journey.\nI look forward to working with him over the next couple of months to ensure a seamless transition. As Aneel and Carl mentioned, we had a strong start to the year, driven by solid execution and durable demand across our solutions as organizations continue their finance and HR modernization journeys.\nSubscription revenue in Q1 was 1.53 billion, up 20% year over year. Professional services revenue in the quarter was 156 million. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was 420 million in Q1, representing 25% of total revenue. Twenty-four-month subscription revenue backlog was 9.79 billion, up 23% at the end of Q1, resulting from strong new ACV bookings and renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively.\nAs Carl mentioned, we saw significant customer base expansion activity in the quarter. Many of the customers that expanded their strategic footprint elected to co-term and renew their existing contracts ahead of schedule. These early renewals in the quarter added roughly 1 percentage point to both 24 months and total backlog growth.\nTotal subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q1 was 16.65 billion, up 32%. In addition to the benefit from early renewals, we continue to see increased average contract duration on both new deals and renewals, causing total backlog to grow significantly faster than 24 months backlog. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $396 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 23.5%.\nMargin overachievement was driven by revenue upside, a slower-than-anticipated ramp in hiring, and the timing of certain expenses. Q1 operating cash flow was 277 million. As we discussed last quarter, the year-over-year decline was driven by the first full year payout of our performance-based cash bonus program, a $55 million interest payment on our debt, and payments associated with our January workforce realignment.\nWe ended the first quarter with more than 17,800 global workmates. We continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go to market and product and technology, but we continue to plan for fewer headcount additions in FY '24 as compared to FY '23. Overall, we're very proud of the strong companywide execution in Q1, and we are focused on maintaining our momentum as we enter Q2.\nNow, turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum of our business while also balancing what remains an uncertain macro environment. Following a strong Q1, we are raising the low end of our FY '24 subscription revenue guidance, resulting in a new range of 6.550 billion to 6.575 billion, an 18% year-over-year growth. We continue to view this guidance as prudent in the context of the environment.\nWe expect Q2 subscription revenue to be 1.611 billion to 1.613 billion, representing 18% year-over-year growth. Additionally, we continue to expect sequential subscription revenue growth in Q3 of approximately 4%. We are maintaining our FY '24 professional services revenue guidance of 630 million to 650 million. \nAs Carl mentioned, we are strategically shifting more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of our channel strategy. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of 160 million. We expect 24-month backlog to increase approximately 20% year-over-year in Q2. We continue to expect FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin of 23% and plan on maintaining a disciplined approach to investing in long-term growth opportunities while, at the same time, delivering healthy margin expansion. For Q2, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2.\nGAAP operating margins for both the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. We expect to achieve GAAP profitability on an operating income basis beginning in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year as we continue to drive margin expansion and reduce stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. To align our compensation plan with our focus on speed of execution and results, we recently modified our cash bonus program from an annual to a semiannual payout structure, beginning with our FY '24 bonus plan.\nWe expect to make the first semiannual payment in Q3 of this year, resulting in an additional bonus payment in FY '24 versus our initial expectations. As a result, we now expect FY '24 operating cash flow of 1.95 billion, growth of 18% year over year. In addition, we are lowering our guidance for FY '24 capital expenditures to approximately 300 million, driven by normalization we are seeing within our supply chain. We have 425 million in the remaining authorization under our buyback program and expect to resume buying back shares in Q2 after our trading window opens.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers, and partners for their continued support and hard work as we move through FY '24 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Furby\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Carl Eschenbach, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Doug Robinson, our co-President. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions.\nOur press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our fiscal 2023 annual report on Form 10-K, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our first quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period begins on April 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results Earnings Call. I'm pleased to share that we delivered solid Q4 results and once again outperformed against our key operating metrics, which included subscription revenue growth of 22% for the quarter and for full year fiscal year '23.\nWhile the macro environment continues to be unpredictable, Workday's value proposition is only getting stronger as more organizations turn to us to help them adapt and manage their 2 most important resources, their people and their finances. As a result, our thriving customer community continues to grow and feel our path to $10 billion in revenue and beyond.\nIn fact, we achieved a significant milestone in Q4 as we surpassed the 10,000 customer mark, with more than 4,750 of those being our core HCM and finance customers, a true testament to the power of the Workday platform and our ability to address the needs for the offices of the CHRO and CFO. Additionally, approximately 629 billion transactions were processed with Workday in fiscal year '23, an increase of 42% year-over-year and further proof of the scale that we have reached.\nBefore we share some Q4 highlights, I want to touch on several recent leadership moves and one organizational announcement that we made, all of which will help set us up for our next phase of growth. The first is the appointment of Carl Eschenbach as co-CEO, which we announced in December. Carl has been a Workday Board member since 2018 and for the past 35 years, has been one of the finest sales and operational leaders in enterprise technology. With his experience and commitment to our values and culture, Carl is a perfect fit to help Workday scale and lead us forward.\nAt the end of our fiscal year '24, Carl is expected to assume sole CEO responsibilities, while I will stay involved with our product and technology teams and all of our employees as a full-time Executive Chair and Chair of the Board. Carl's transition into the co-CEO role has been seamless, and I'm excited to work alongside him going forward as we continue to grow Workday and strengthen our position as the leader in cloud HR while building on our momentum in finance.\nI also want to acknowledge the great work Chano Fernandez did during his 9 years with Workday and for the last 2 years as co-CEO. He played a significant role in helping to shape the company into who we are today, and I want to thank him for his contributions.\nAdditionally, Sayan Chakraborty, our EVP of Product and Technology, has been elevated to co-President alongside Doug Robinson. Since joining Workday more than 7 years ago, Sayan has been a driving force behind our evolving and expanding innovation strategy, led our efforts to scale the Workday platform to support and enable some of the world's largest organizations and is one of the foremost experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning as it relates to the world of enterprise offerings. Sayan will continue to lead our product and technology organization, and we are pleased to recognize his leadership role across the organization now as co-President.\nWith Sayan stepping into a co-President role, Robynne Sisco, who was previously co-President and before that CFO, will now assume the role of Vice Chair. In this role, Robynne will work closely with our global sales team to help us build on our momentum with the office of the CFO and further cement Workday as a leader in cloud finance.\nThe last leadership update is related to our Board of Directors. I'm pleased to share that we announced today that Mark Hawkins has been elected as the newest member of our Board. With more than 35 years of finance leadership experience at global software and technology companies, most recently at Salesforce, Mark will bring invaluable experience and perspective to Workday.\nFinal announcement I want to highlight, which we made at the end of January, was a restructuring and realignment of some teams across Workday that led to the elimination of roles, impacting about 3% of our global workforce. While it's always difficult to see employees leave under those circumstances, we made this decision to align our resources and people against the most strategic areas of the business to help ensure that Workday is set up for continued growth for many years to come. Throughout this process, we did our absolute best to treat the affected employees with compassion and offered them generous severance packages. This restructuring move was not a cost-cutting effort, and we will continue to hire in fiscal year '24 for roles that support our strategic initiatives.\nWith that, I'd like to share some product and technology highlights from the quarter. From an innovation perspective, our continued focus on uniquely embedding AI and ML into the core of our platform is enabling us to drive the future of work for HR and finance customers and their more than 60 million employees around the world.\nOn the HR front, the combination of our Workday Skills Cloud, which is powered by AI and ML, and Workday Talent Optimization is supporting customers in their transition to a skills-first mindset. To date, nearly 50% of all live Workday HCM customers are leveraging Workday Skills Cloud, while Talent Optimization is Workday's fastest-growing SKU with an attach rate on new deals of more than 85% in fiscal year '23.\nFor Planning, we introduced new demand forecasting capabilities that leverage AI and ML to help retailers forecast business demand based on external data, such as sales and foot traffic history. Retail continues to be one of our target industries as more than 50% of the retail organizations in the Fortune 500 are Workday customers. And innovations like this will enable us to build on our momentum in this space.\nWe're also continuing to double down on AI and ML through our Workday Ventures fund. We announced a $250 million expansion of the fund to focus on larger growth areas such as generative AI, all with an eye to embracing emerging technologies to help us further enable our customers in today's changing world of work.\nFinally, I want to touch on how we're continuing to invest in our brand. Hopefully, you all saw our fun rock star-themed advertisement during the Super Bowl, which reached an estimated 110 million viewers. While finance and HR leaders are familiar with us, we saw the Super Bowl as the stage to help us become more well-known to a broader audience. We firmly believe that our brand is strategic, and investments in marketing drive awareness and demand for our products and services.\nGoing forward, we feel very confident in our ability to capitalize on the long-term growth opportunity in front of us, thanks to the strategy we have in place, the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the amazing talents of our more than 17,700 Workmates around the globe. In fact, we are hosting today's call from our annual sales kickoff meeting, and the excitement from all of our go-to-market teams here in Las Vegas about the incredible opportunity we have in front of us is palpable.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to our co-CEO, my buddy, Carl Eschenbach. Carl, over to you.\n\nCarl M. Eschenbach\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, for those kind words, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Let me start by saying that I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to partner and work alongside Aneel and our Workmates across this amazing company. I'm truly energized by Workday's unique opportunity to be one of the largest and most profitable software companies in the world. This was my first quarterly call as co-CEO, and I could not be more proud of our teams for their incredible execution.\nDespite a macro environment that remains uncertain and that no one is immune from, we drove strong close rates in Q4 and built a healthy pipeline for the year ahead. Our team was prepared to respond to the extra scrutiny we knew would come with deals in this environment. And because of that, we are heading into our new fiscal year in a position of strength. I can tell you, the excitement for the year is all around us as we are coming to you live from our annual sales kickoff conference in Las Vegas.\nAs a Board member for the last 5 years, I have been actively involved in Workday's growth journey. Today, more than 2 months in as co-CEO, I have had the privilege of spending time with hundreds of Workmates, customers, partners and prospects around the world. Those meetings have given me an even greater appreciation of how compelling Workday's value proposition is and how differentiated we really are.\nI've also gotten to know Aneel and the leadership team even better. And while I already considered Aneel a partner and a friend, our co-CEO relationship is working really well as we have very complementary skill sets. It's a true one plus one equals three equation.\nAs I reflect upon my first couple of months, a few things in particular have stood out, starting with the culture and values of Workday. This, frankly, was the most important driver for me taking this role. I have long admired the culture that Dave and Aneel built and see it as a true differentiator. We have 6 core values at Workday, and each of them are important. But to me, the one that I keep coming back to is integrity. If you do the right thing, everything else falls into place. I have been blown away by the talent that sits across this company and by how ingrained our values are in everything we do.\nAnother observation is around our land opportunity with net new customers. I will tell you, it's wide open. We have a footprint with over 50% of the Fortune 500 and more than 25% of the Global 2000, but we still see plenty of room to grow. Q4 was a great validation of this, with 7 new Fortune 500 and 11 new Global 2000 customers. New HCM customers we added in the quarter included Allstate, Camping World, Cracker Barrel, Delaware North Companies, Mercedes-Benz Group and Whataburger. And key go-live included Heidelberg Materials and Mitsui Chemicals.\nIn addition, we once again added several full platform HCM and financial customers, including Fidelity National Title, Panda Restaurant Group and the State of Georgia. And we had several FINS go-live, including The New York Times and Sanford Health.\nOne of the exciting things about our land opportunity is that it's not limited to replacing outdated on-premises systems. In fact, 3 of our new Fortune 500 wins replaced cloud solutions from our legacy ERP competitors. And the land opportunity extends well beyond the upmarket as the medium enterprise has become an increasingly important driver of net new ACV, and that team drove record performance in the quarter.\nWhat's also important is the strength of our customer relationships and the strategic nature of what we do for them. This provides us with an incredible opportunity to expand our business with our installed base of customers who rely on Workday as their intelligent digital backbone to adapt and manage their people and money. This quarter, we once again drove very strong renewals along with solid new ACV bookings, including expansions at Belk, GE, Old Dominion Freight, Prudential and Truist. We saw momentum across our solutions portfolio, including Learning, Planning, Prism Analytics, Accounting Center and candidate engagement. And an increasing number of our expansion deals added core financials as we lean into our market leadership in HCM to drive increasing momentum with the office of the CFO.\nOur opportunity is truly global. The U.S., which continues to be our largest market, had a solid Q4 and has a healthy runway going forward. We also have a tremendous international opportunity, which is only about 1/4 of our revenue, but more than half of our TAM. Our momentum is building in strategic markets like DACH and Nordics, where we had a number of important wins during Q4, including CCB Management Services, [Mila] and NorgesGruppen. Accelerating our international business is a strategic priority, and we are investing in both talent and products to help drive that.\nOur continued industry focus is gaining momentum, and it is a core part of our ongoing strategy. We had wins in a number of key verticals in Q4, including state and local government, where in addition to the win at the State of Georgia, we had wins at the City of Boston, the City of Charlotte and New York City Housing Authority to name a few. In fact, new ACV from our state and local teams more than doubled year-over-year in Q4, and we expect our traction to continue in FY '24.\nFinally, our partner ecosystem will be critical to our next phase of growth. Our partners from the global system integrators to the boutiques have been incredibly important to get us to where we are today. They drive the vast majority of our customer deployments and serve as an important source of co-innovation. One of the ways they do this is through Workday Extend, which now has over 1,000 applications in production across our customer community. We expect our partners will play an even more important role in FY '24 as we look for them to drive an increased number of new opportunities while we strategically shift more customer deployments to our ecosystem. We see this as a clear win-win.\nWe are also focusing our efforts across our broader ecosystem of ISVs and technology partners. A great example is our recent partnership with AWS, which extends our infrastructure relationship to a more formal go-to-market motion. I am excited to work alongside our Chief Customer Officer, Sheri Rhodes, and our newly appointed SVP of Global Partners, Matt Brandt, and our entire ecosystem on this journey.\nHeading into FY '24, we have a clear strategy in place, which is rooted in strengthening our HCM market leadership and winning in FINS across our key industries. We are optimizing the business to double down in strategic growth areas such as investing in our customer base, focusing on key industries, evolving and investing in our partner ecosystem and relentlessly focusing on innovation, including shaping the future of work to our application of AI and machine learning.\nHaving the right strategy is only part of the equation. You also need the right people, which is why we plan to continue to add sales capacity and key engineering talent as we position Workday for the next wave of growth. We also made some recent changes to strengthen our leadership bench that will be critical to helping us execute on our strategy. Doug Robinson will continue in his role as co-President and now has full responsibility for all go-to-market functions.\nAs Aneel mentioned, Sayan Chakraborty has also been elevated to co-President. And I'm also excited to have Robynne Sisco serve as our Vice Chair, now squarely focused on helping us sell FINS. Patrick Blair, who joined a year ago to run North America sales, has been elevated to Head of Global Sales. His team across the regions is a talented mix of seasoned Workday veterans and proven recently added external talent, who will rally around our global opportunity.\nIt's an amazing time to be at Workday, and I'm so inspired and energized by the incredible journey ahead. While we continue to see certain sales cycles, primarily net new opportunities taking longer than normal to close, our FY '24 subscription revenue guidance prudently factors this in. And we are positioning the business to return to 20% plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves while simultaneously delivering margin expansion. I look forward to meeting many of you on the road in the quarter ahead, and thank you for your support.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Barbara. Barbara, over to you.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Carl, and welcome. I know I speak for the broader Workday organization when I say that I'm incredibly excited to partner with you on the next phase of our growth journey.\nAs Aneel and Carl mentioned, we had a solid close to the year, driven by strong execution across the company combined with durable demand for our solutions as organizations of all sizes prioritize finance and HR modernization during these uncertain times.\nSubscription revenue in Q4 was $1.50 billion, up 22% year-over-year. For the full year, subscription revenue was $5.57 billion, also a growth of 22%. Professional services revenue was $151 million for Q4 and $649 million for the full year. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $396 million in Q4, representing 24% of total revenue.\n24-month subscription revenue backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $9.68 billion, up 21%. The result was driven by solid new ACV bookings and strong renewals, with growth and net revenue and retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. In addition, early renewals added roughly 1 percentage point of upside to 24-month backlog growth and roughly 2 percentage points to total backlog growth. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q4 was $16.45 billion, up 28%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $305 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 18.5%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue upside and continued cost discipline. The workforce realignment we announced at the end of January was a $34 million non-GAAP expense in the quarter, or a roughly 2 percentage point headwind to Q4 non-GAAP operating margin, most of which was factored into our guidance. For the year, non-GAAP operating income was $1.21 billion, representing a margin of 19.5%.\nQ4 operating cash flow was $694 million, growth of 13%. As a reminder, the Q4 result was impacted by a roughly $70 million onetime IP transfer tax payment. Full year operating cash flow was $1.66 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased roughly $75 million in shares and have $425 million in remaining authorization under our buyback program.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with more than 17,700 global Workmates. As Aneel and Carl mentioned, we will continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology, but we are planning for fewer headcount additions in FY '24 as compared to FY '23. Overall, we're very proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q4, and we enter FY '24 in a position of strength.\nNow turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum in our business while also balancing what remains an uncertain macro environment. In addition, we recently completed an assessment of our server and network equipment. And beginning in FY '24, we are increasing the useful life assumption from 3 years to 5 years, reflecting advances in technology that we're benefiting from. This change will have a positive impact on our FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin, which I will cover shortly.\nFollowing a solid Q4, we are maintaining the midpoint of our preliminary FY '24 subscription revenue guidance and narrowing the range to $6.525 billion to $6.575 billion, representing 17% to 18% year-over-year growth. We view this guidance as prudent in the context of the environment. But as Carl mentioned, we're positioning to return to a 20% plus subscription revenue growth when the environment improves.\nWe expect Q1 FY '24 subscription revenue to be $1.517 billion to $1.520 billion, representing 19% year-over-year growth. We expect subscription revenue to increase sequentially by approximately 6% in Q2 and approximately 4% in Q3. We expect FY '24 professional services revenue to be in the range of $630 million to $650 million. As Carl mentioned, we are strategically shifting more deployments to our partner ecosystem as part of ongoing investments we are making in the channel. For Q1, we expect professional services revenue of $148 million.\nWe expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in Q1. We currently expect FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin of 23%. The expected margin expansion is primarily being driven by the scalability of our model, a strong moderation of hiring and ongoing expense discipline.\nIn addition, we estimate the change in server and network equipment useful life will result in a roughly $100 million reduction to the GAAP and non-GAAP cost of subscription revenue in FY '24, creating a benefit to operating margin of about 150 basis points this year. Looking forward, the impact from this policy change is expected to trend down and result in an approximately $50 million reduction to GAAP and non-GAAP cost of subscription revenue in FY '25.\nWe estimate Q1 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 21.5% and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. GAAP operating margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 26 and 22 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margins. The FY '24 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.\nWe expect FY '24 operating cash flow of approximately $2.05 billion, growth of 24%. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter cash flow will be impacted by the first full year payout of our performance-based cash bonus plan, severance cost associated with the recent realignment and an interest payment that did not occur last Q1 due to the timing of our debt offering. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $340 million in FY '24 to support our continued business expansion.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) With that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Justin, you may begin.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nSenior Director of IR, Workday, Inc.\n\n(technical difficulty)\nand Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer; and Doug Robinson, our co-President.\nFollowing prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic conditions.\nPlease refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results.

Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur fourth quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on January 15, 2023. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Third Quarter Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. I'm happy to report that we had a solid Q3 as we once again outperformed across our key operating metrics. There is no question that the macro environment presents increased uncertainty, but as we've said before, we are well positioned in this type of environment because our cloud finance and HR solutions are truly mission-critical. As our Q3 results showed, more and more organizations are selecting Workday as their trusted partner to help them successfully navigate today's changing world.\nWe remain confident in our ability to capitalize on the opportunity ahead and are pleased to announce our first-ever share repurchase program of up to $500 million under authorization. This program will help reduce the rate of our share dilution going forward and is driven by our belief that our share price is undervalued given the long-term growth opportunity ahead. Barbara will share details shortly, but know that we feel confident that we'll reach a scale where we can roll out this repurchase program while continuing to prioritize investing for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'd like to share some highlights from the quarter. In Q3, we further solidified our position as a leader in cloud HR with notable new HCM customers, including Intermountain Health, SGS and Texas Roadhouse. In addition, we had several key HCM go-lives, including Best Buy, Canadian Tire Corporation and the state of Oklahoma. For Workday Financial Management, we continue to see strong demand and momentum in Q3. Key new wins included a Fortune 200 provider of information technology solutions, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, EZCORP and Thomas Jefferson University. It's important to note that each of these customers have also selected us for HCM, reinforcing the power of the full Workday platform and providing further evidence that companies are going all in with us. Key financial management go-lives during the quarter included City of Baltimore and Medical University of South Carolina.\nQ3 also saw us get back in person for Workday Rising, our annual customer conference for the first time since 2019. We had nearly 16,000 in-person and virtual attendees, and it was great to experience the energy and see firsthand how our community is growing and evolving. This was highlighted by the fact that this year's event has a large percentage of senior leaders, finance and IT attendees ever.\nOne big takeaway from Rising is that our innovation story is resonating with customers as we evolve to be more open and connected. While we've traditionally targeted the offices of CHRO and CFO, we have placed increased focus recently on the office of the CIO, which presents another growth opportunity for us.\nOne solution in particular that was a popular topic among IT attendees was Workday Extend. Workday Extend lets customers and partners build their own unique solutions on top of Workday, which is a huge point of emphasis for CIOs and, in their eyes, positions us even more as a true platform player. While we announced several availability at Workday Extend in 2020, we've continued to see accelerated demand for it over the last year as the need for organizations to quickly innovate and adapt in today's business environment increases.\nWe also announced new more personalized UX enhancements that meet every type of Workday user in the natural flow of their work such as mobile devices, Microsoft Teams and Slack, which helps us to address another CIO priority as they are more focused than ever on driving increased employee engagement.\nAnd finally, we further reinforced our leadership in artificial intelligence and machine learning with the announcement of next-generation skills technology that allows customers to more easily and securely bring skills data in and out of Workday. This helps customers leverage the full power of machine learning to gain deeper insights into their workforce skills and deliver more personalized employee experiences.\nIn closing, we once again delivered a solid quarter with strength across a number of key growth initiatives, showcasing why Workday is the backbone of digital business. And while we expect that the macro uncertainty will cause our growth to moderate in the near term, we continue to believe we are well positioned to navigate this environment and emerge even stronger. Driving constant innovation to address our customers' evolving needs has always been key to our success and will continue to be our focus in this environment.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Chano, over to you.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I want to start off by offering my sincere thanks to the more than 17,500 Workmates that help us deliver another solid quarter. Your relentless focus on the customer continues to push us and the broader Workday community forward. Great job, team.\nI've been on the road a lot the last few months, including Workday Rising in Europe which has wrapped up in Stockholm and Workday Rising in U.S. back in September. I've had the opportunity to spend time with hundreds of customers and prospects, and there are a couple of key themes emerging.\nFirst, despite all the challenges that companies are facing today, they increasingly realize the present need to modernize their HR and financial systems. The executives that I speak with have different viewpoints on what the macroeconomic climate will look like in the year ahead. But one thing they agree on is that the change is constant and it's nearly impossible to navigate with legacy systems.\nSecond, there is a clear desire to consolidate and prioritize spend across a new organization's more strategic technology vendors. Given our positioning as the backbone of digital business across HR and finance, this trend has led to more and more companies going all in with Workday as they look to harness the power of their data across the enterprise. And when I look at our solid Q3 results across both the large and medium enterprise, it's a direct validation of these themes being seen across organizations of all sizes.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, we saw solid results across North America with a number of CoreHR and FINS wins that Aneel mentioned, in addition to several strategic expansions across the Fortune 500. APA also outperformed with wins at Bank of Queensland, Fletcher Building, [Ono] Pharmaceutical and Trip.com, to name a few. And in EMEA, we had a number of important wins and expansions, including SGS, [Allianz] Medical Group and Equiniti.\nOur customer base sales team once again saw outstanding growth, a direct reflection of the trust that customers are placing in us and a validation of our strategy. We drove very strong renewal rates in Q3, and we closed a number of strategic expansions at companies such as Accenture, University of Maryland, the state of Nebraska, Pick n Pay, Puma and VF Corporation.\nAs we shared at our recent Analyst Day, our customer base momentum is being driven by our broad portfolio. Solutions such as Journeys, Help and Talent Optimization, for example, are seeing strong adoption as customers look to support employee experience, while our scheduling, time tracking and payroll solutions are all resonating as customers increasingly focused on labor optimization. And other products such as Planning, Extend, Accounting Center, VNDLY and our Spend Management solutions are all contributing to this quarter's strength across the customer base.\nOur industry focus continues to pay off. In Q3, nowhere was this more evident than the health care vertical where we had a strong growth in new ACV and where we surpassed $0.5 billion in annual recurring revenue. By far, the 2 largest costs for health care organizations are labor and materials. And by leveraging our full suite of HCM, FINS and supply chain solutions, they are able to help optimize spend across these critical areas. In fact, all of our larger Q3 health care wins were full suite and including Workday's supply chain management.\nWe also saw healthy momentum within the professional services industry highlighted by the aforementioned expansion at Accenture as we continue to co-innovate across the Workday platform, including significant new developments in the skills cloud, public cloud and accessibility.\nOther strategic wins in the professional services industry included Novozymes and Reed Global, which was a full suite win. Our expanding partner ecosystem is also becoming an increasingly important driver of our growth. Key to our strategy is driving core innovation across the platform, which increases the differentiation of our solutions, enables even faster innovation to address real-time customer challenges and allows our partners to leverage their deep industry and solution insights to differentiate in the market.\nExamples of recent partner-driven innovation built on the Workday platform include Accenture's digital revenue operations solution, which integrates CPQ capabilities with Workday's billing and revenue automation to enable seamless quote-to-cash functionality for software and technology companies.\nAnother great example is employee document management, built by partner Kainos on Workday Extend, which provides our customers with advanced document generation, access control storage and finely tuned document retention rules. These are just a few several solutions that were recently released by our partner ecosystem, and we have dozens more on the road map.\nAs we move into our fourth quarter, the environment remains uncertain, which has led to increased scrutiny and the lengthening of certain sales cycles, particularly with the net new opportunities. While we aren't immune to this and see signs that it will persist into next year, we are confident in our diverse pipeline and are focused on executing in Q4 and laying a strong foundation for FY '24 and beyond.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered solid Q3 results in the face of continued economic uncertainty, a testament to strong execution across the company as well as the strategic and mission-critical nature of our solutions.\nSubscription revenue in Q3 was $1.43 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and professional services revenue was $167 million, up 7%. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $394 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the third quarter was $8.62 billion, growth of 21%. The result was driven by solid new business sales and strong renewals, with gross and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q3 was $14.10 billion, up 28%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $314 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 19.7%. Margin overachievement was driven by revenue outperformance, favorable cost variances across the business and the timing of certain expenses shifting into Q4.\nQ3 operating cash flow was $409 million, growth of 6%. Our cash flow this quarter was impacted by a $55 million semiannual interest payment associated with our Q1 debt offering. We also paid off the principal balance on our $1.15 billion convertible debt with cash in October, resulting in a reduction to our non-GAAP diluted share count of roughly 8 million shares. Given the late Q3 timing, this share count reduction will be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count in Q4.\nDuring the quarter, we successfully added approximately 600 net new employees, ending Q3 with a global workforce of more than 17,500. We expect a strong moderation of hiring as we move into Q4, but we'll continue to add key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market and product and technology. Overall, we're extremely proud of the strong company-wide performance in Q3, and we're focused on executing in Q4, our seasonally strongest quarter of the year.\nNow turning to guidance, which reflects both the continued momentum in our business while also balancing an uncertain macro environment. With that context, our guidance for FY '23 subscription revenue is now $5.555 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Q4 subscription revenue to be $1.483 billion to $1.485 billion, 21% year-over-year growth. We now expect professional services revenue to be $645 million in FY '23 with the slight reduction driven by the delay of a large project. For Q4, we expect professional services revenue of $147 million.\nWe expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in Q4. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17.5%, which includes some expenses that shifted out of Q3. Our FY '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance is now 19.2%.\nGAAP operating margins for both the fourth quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 23 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP margins. This includes a change to our employee stock plan that will take effect in Q4 to provide more flexibility to our employees during the open trading window each quarter. Our vesting date will move from the 15th to the 5th of each month for all outstanding grants, resulting in an acceleration of stock-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million in Q4. This change will result in reduced stock-based compensation expense by the same amount over the next few years and has no impact on our dilution.\nThe FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We are maintaining our FY '23 guidance for operating cash flow of $1.64 billion, but are reducing our capital expenditures outlook to approximately $375 million, reflecting the timing of certain data center and real estate investments being pushed out to future periods. And as Aneel mentioned, we are pleased to announce a share repurchase program with authority to repurchase up to $500 million in shares over an 18-month period.\nWe will continue to prioritize allocating capital towards organic innovation, followed by targeted M&A, but given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we intend to use a portion of our capital towards the repurchase of shares, enabling us to partially offset future dilution from employee stock programs. This repurchase program is a direct reflection of our confidence in the business and our view that our shares are currently undervalued.\nWhile we are early in our planning cycle for next year and have an important Q4 ahead, we'd like to provide a preliminary view of FY '24. As discussed at our Financial Analyst Day, we have a significant long-term opportunity and multiple growth levers that drive our goal of sustaining 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue. While this remains our multiyear goal, given the continued macro uncertainty, we believe it's prudent to provide a preliminary FY '24 subscription revenue range of approximately $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion or 17% to 19% year-over-year growth. This outlook takes into account the lengthening of sales cycles that we're currently seeing impact our net new business.\nFrom a margin standpoint, we currently expect FY '24 non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 150 to 200 basis points from FY '23 levels, placing us firmly on track to our target of 25% non-GAAP operating margin and 35% operating cash flow margin at $10 billion in revenue. The expected margin expansion is driven by the scalability of our model, a strong moderation of hiring and ongoing expense discipline. We plan to operate the business with agility, and we'll continue to appropriately balance growth investments based on what we see in the underlying market environment. And finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) And with that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nSenior Director of IR, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer.\nFollowing prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic conditions. Please refer to the press release and the Risk Factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Additionally, our quarterly investor presentation will be posted on our Investor Relations website following this call. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Our third quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on October 15, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's Second Quarter Fiscal '23 Earnings Conference Call. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered a strong second quarter, thanks to healthy demand across all product areas and geographies. Additionally, we closed on 2 of the larger deals that had pushed from Q1, which we referenced on last quarter's call. Our results, which outperformed across our key operating metrics underscore the continued importance of digital transformation for finance and HR. And even with the uncertainty in this environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects because Workday continues to serve as a mission-critical partner to our customers with a proven track record of success.\nBefore I turn it over to Chano, who will share more on our go-to-market success and Barbara who will provide specifics on our Q2 financial results and outlook, I'd like to share some second quarter highlights. We had another strong quarter for Workday HCM, where the migration to the cloud continues with notable customer additions, including Electrolux, First Student, Groupe Adeo, Korean Air and Raymond James. And as always, customer success remains a key differentiator for Workday. In Q2, we had several HCM go-lives, including Cox Enterprises, Southwest Airlines and United Overseas Bank.\nTurning to Workday Financial Management. We saw very strong growth in the second quarter as we added 2 Fortune 500 core financial management customers, and I'm very excited to share that one of those was Salesforce, the global leader in CRM. Already a longtime Workday HCM customer and partner, Salesforce's expanded use of Workday now includes Workday Financial Management along with accounting center, Workday Adaptive Planning, Prism Analytics and more. Our growing partnership reinforces the opportunity we have to help support customers in the cloud. With this broad relationship, Salesforce becomes one of an increasing number of high-profile customers to expand from Workday HCM to both HCM and financial management.\nOther new financial management customers in Q2 included American Electric Power, which was the second of our Q2 Fortune 500 wins; Apex Fund Company; Dave & Busters, Express LLC; and the state of Vermont, while key go-lives in Q2 included Comerica Bank, RSM and the University of Virginia.\nIn addition to the strong growth from our core suite of HCM and finance applications, Q2 also saw notable momentum across our broader portfolio of solutions. Workday Adaptive Planning recently celebrated its 4-year anniversary as part of Workday, and I'm happy to share that we now serve more than 6,000 planning customers, including over 20% of the Fortune 500. It was also our second full quarter with VNDLY as part of Workday, and we're already seeing solid results as it's opening up new opportunities for us to expand our relationship with customers who want to embrace a more holistic workforce strategy.\nWe also continue to see strong adoption of Workday Extend and Prism Analytics as both solutions are providing organizations, including the office of the CIO, with the ability to adapt in today's changing world. With Extend, customers build apps that are tailored for their unique use cases, which can eliminate the need for other custom development tools. Over the last year, we have more than doubled the number of customers and now have more than 750 applications that have been developed on the Workday platform. And Prism Analytics, with now more than 1,000 customers, is enabling organizations to bring operational data into Workday to drive real-time business insights. These solutions are not only critical to our customer community, but are enabling a new level of engagement with our partner community as well.\nAnd speaking of our customer community, customer service has always been one of our core values. As a result, we strive to maintain a customer satisfaction rating of over 95%, and I'm pleased to announce that in 2022, we surpassed this rating again as we have for more than a decade. This achievement is a direct testament to the amazing work of our employees and their commitment to helping our customers thrive.\nWe look forward to sharing more about our product innovation, customer success and market opportunity in September at Workday Rising, our Annual Customer Conference. This will mark the first time since 2019 that we're able to hold Workday Rising in-person, and we are so excited to get more than 9,000 members of the Workday community together in Orlando with thousands attending virtually for what is always a special event.\nIn closing, we had a strong second quarter and the first half of the year. While we recognize that the current environment will likely moderate the pace of growth in the second half of the year, we firmly believe that the strong gets stronger during periods of economic uncertainty. And we will continue to manage the business with that mindset and expectation, all in support of driving enduring growth for many years to come.\nWith that, over to you, Chano.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. I want to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to the entire global organization for an incredible Q2. Every one of our nearly 17,000 workmates really leaned in and drove this result, and I couldn't be prouder of our execution. Great job, team. Our strong Q2 results were driven by momentum across several of our key growth initiatives, including customer base, international, medium enterprise and the office of the CFO, a testament to our strategy and the significant long-term opportunity that we have ahead.\nIn addition, as Aneel mentioned, we closed the 2 largest deals that slipped out of Q1. And while the near-term market environment remains uncertain and we are not immune to it, we continue to see organizations of all sizes prioritizing their investments with Workday to continue their digital backbone transformation and drive increased agility and flexibility.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, we executed incredibly well across our global markets. In the U.S., we saw healthy growth in the large enterprise, including 5 Fortune 500 core HCM or FINS wins, and in the medium enterprise, our suite approach continues to resonate, driving another quarter of very strong results. International performance was again a highlight as our investment in key regions and the ongoing journey to the cloud are resulting in significant growth. In EMEA, we had outperformance across a number of key countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. And finally, in APJ, we had very solid performance in strategic markets like Japan and Australia.\nAs you know, we go to market with land-and-expand sales motions, and both things drove healthy growth in Q2. Aneel already mentioned several of our core HCM and FINS wins, many of which were new customers to Workday. We also closed several strategic deals across our emerging land motions, including planning-first wins at ExxonMobil and Ninja Van and a Peakon-first led win at a 300,000-plus employee global organization headquartered in Europe.\nIn addition to strengthening our land motion, our customer base sales teams in Q2 once again drove very strong results, including solid renewals and meaningful acceleration in new ACV with broad-based strength across a number of solutions, including core FINS, Extend, Peakon, learning, payroll and talent optimization. We're also seeing momentum built within our planning-first customers who are expanding their footprint by adding core HCM and financials. Carle Health is a great example of this. They started as a planning-first relationship and expanded their footprint to include core FINS in Q2. Industry is another area of significant opportunity and investment, and I am pleased to share that financial services is our first industry to exceed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Some of our most strategic transactions and go-lives in Q2 came out of our financial services team, including new lands that Aneel referenced at Raymond James and Apex Fund, expansion deals at Bank of Montreal and Cushman & Wakefield and go-lives at United Overseas Bank and Comerica.\nOther established industries, including health care and education and government also saw continued momentum and we are gaining steam in verticals such as retail/hospitality and technology/media, where wins included Salesforce, Avalara and GoPuff. Needless to say, we have several other industries that are on the path to $1 billion and beyond.\nOur expanding partner ecosystem is becoming an increasingly important driver of our growth and industry success, and the excitement we're seeing within our partner community for the joint opportunity in front of us was on full display recently at Altitude, our annual partner event. Strategic system integrators such as Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC are not only ensuring successful deployment, but also serving as an innovation engine addressing our customers' needs. Together, we're also targeting industry accelerators with specific solutions and use cases. We look forward to sharing a lot more on this at Workday Rising in a few weeks.\nAs we move through the second half of the year, we expect the environment to remain uncertain. And we see signs that in certain deal cycles, particularly some of our more strategic opportunities, there is increased scrutiny and potentially longer sales cycles, as buyers do extra work before making investment decisions during these uncertain times. The good news is that when companies go through their due diligence, we typically come out on top, given the compelling return on investment and reduced total cost of ownership that our solutions provide, our track record of successful deployments of scale and our reference base of thousands of customers who can speak to the meaningful business value that Workday delivers.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we delivered a strong Q2 as enterprises of all sizes increasingly realize the need for a flexible, modern finance and HR solutions to navigate their businesses and drive change during these uncertain times. Subscription revenue in Q2 was $1.37 billion, up 23% year-over-year, and Professional Services revenue was $168 million, up 15%. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $383 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the second quarter was $8.37 billion, growth of 22%. The outperformance was driven by strong new ACV across both our land and expand sales motions along with solid renewals with growth and net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog at the end of Q2 was $13.47 billion, up 27%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $302 million, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 19.6%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of topline overperformance, the timing of certain projects and some favorable expense variances. Q2 operating cash flow was $114 million, which reflects typical seasonality from our annual merit cycle increase. In addition, with the final 2 days of the quarter falling over a weekend, we saw roughly $40 million of collections shipped out of Q2 into early Q3, which will have a positive impact on our third quarter cash flow.\nOur largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. During the quarter, we successfully added approximately 1,000 net new employees, ending Q2 with a global workforce of more than 16,900. Our hiring was focused on adding key talent across strategic growth areas of the business, notably go-to-market resources and product innovation roles. Overall, we're extremely proud of the strong company-wide execution in Q2 and remain focused on leveraging our leadership position to drive sustainable 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.\nTurning now to guidance, which reflects the momentum in our business and the mission-critical nature of our solutions, while also balancing an uncertain macro environment, which Aneel and Chano described. With that context, we are maintaining our guidance for FY '23 subscription revenue of $5.537 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Q3 subscription revenue to be $1.418 billion to $1.420 billion, 21% year-over-year growth. We still expect professional services revenue to be $650 million in FY '23, as we continue to tightly align with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure our customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.\nFor Q3, we expect professional services revenue of $164 million. We expect 24-month backlog to grow approximately 19% year-over-year in Q3. We now expect FY '23 non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, reflecting a more measured pace of hiring in the second half of the year as we continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment. Investing for long-term growth alongside ongoing expense discipline remains our priority. We continue to have confidence in the strength of our business model and in achieving 25% non-GAAP operating margin and 35% operating cash flow margin at $10 billion in revenue.\nFor Q3, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 18%. GAAP margins for the third quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 and 23 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margin. The FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%. We're raising our FY '23 guidance for operating cash flow to $1.64 billion. We now expect capital expenditures of $450 million this year to support our customer growth and continued business expansion. As a reminder, during the third quarter, we plan to pay off the principal balance of our $1.15 billion convertible debt in cash. When this occurs, our non-GAAP diluted share count will decrease by roughly 8 million shares. Due to the late Q3 timing, this share reduction will not be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count until Q4.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. We look forward to seeing you on September 13, either in-person or virtually, for our Financial Analyst Day, part of the broader Workday Rising program being held in Orlando, Florida, where we'll share more insights on our strategic product initiatives and long-term market opportunity.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

Also, the Customers page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur second quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on July 16, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2022.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's First Quarter Fiscal Year '23 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, we are heartbroken by the recent acts of violence and the senseless loss of life. There are no words to explain the pain the parents, children, families and loved ones of the victims must be feeling. Our thoughts are with them and the people of Uvalde, Texas; Buffalo, New York; Laguna Woods, California and every other community that has endured such tragedy. Everyone has the right to feel safe in the places where they learn, live, work, worship and do simple day errands.\nTurning now to our business and coming off an exceptional fiscal year '22 of acceleration in the business. Workday reported solid Q1 results, delivering subscription revenue growth of 23%. During the quarter, we continue to see companies across our target geographies and industries select Workday as they move their finance and HR systems to the cloud. At the same time, several key opportunities that we had expected to close in Q1 were pushed to later in the year, impacting backlog performance. Barbara will touch on later in the call.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our products and are optimistic about the year. We are mindful, however, of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments and the impact these conditions could have on businesses globally. With that in mind, our focus remains on what we can control, which is to continue to drive innovation as we broaden our offering to become an even more strategic partner to our customers, deliver the industry's top levels of customer support, cultivate our culture, which remains foundational to all that we do.\nNow I'd like to share some of the business highlights from Q1, starting with Workday HCM. Barclays, Callaway Golf and West Tennessee Healthcare were just a few of the many new customers that we welcomed last quarter. While these new wins are very important to us, we remain equally focused on ensuring our customers successfully go live, critical to our ability to drive customer satisfaction. Notable go-lives in Q1 include Hy-Vee; Kyndryl; and Royal Bank of Canada, better known as RBC.\nProven ability to support our customers' large volumes of data and transactions continues to be a significant differentiator in our success. It's not just our scalability that differentiates us. It's also our unique ability to innovate and deliver valuable insights to our customers across the office of the [CHRO]. In learning, for example, we recently crossed the 2,000 customer milestone. We now have over 3,100 recruiting customers. We're also opening new markets with solutions with Analytics, which now has over 500 customers; Workday Journeys, which has over 300 customers. We're a clear market leader in HCM, something that we don't take for granted. We continue to find new ways to increase our strategic positioning within the office of the CHRO.\nTurning to our offerings for the office of the CFO. We once again saw continued strength across the board. Highlights included key full suite wins at American University, Lehigh Valley Hospital and Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority along with several core financial customer go-lives in the quarter, including Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare, to name a few.\nOur strategy for many years now and one of our key differentiators is providing organizations with a unified solution to plan, execute and analyze their businesses in real time. That strategy is clearly resonating in the market with Workday Adaptive Planning now being used by nearly 6,000 organizations globally, including nearly 75% of our core FINS customers. Prism Analytics nearing 1,000 customers, being roughly 40% of our core financials customers.\nAs you know, Workday was founded on a core set of values that help guide our decisions as we look to do what's right for our employees, the customers we serve and the world around us. The example of this approach can be seen through our increased focus on supporting our customers' evolving ESG initiatives. We have quickly become a top priority in the boardroom and for the office of the CFO, especially considering the most recent and upcoming SEC disclosure requirements.\nIn Q1, we announced 2 new solutions that will be available this year to further help companies view their businesses through an ESG lens. First is social reporting for ESG to help our customers more easily track progress against goals and identify areas for improvement within workforce composition, organizational health, diversity and workforce investments.\nThe second is supplier and sustainability. We help customers to improve the sustainability and resilience of their supply chains, test Scope 3 emissions across their suppliers. Adding these 2 new solutions to our existing product portfolio further strengthens our ability to be a strategic partner of customers, shareholders on their ESG.\nSwitching to the people front. We continue to invest heavily in our company culture to sustain our belief that happy employees deliver the highest levels of satisfaction to our great customers. On that note, in early April, we announced exciting expansion plans for our European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. We intend to create 1,000 new jobs over the next 2 years, which will increase our overall Ireland-based workforce by approximately 60% in addition to breaking ground on a new European headquarters building. Dublin site plays a critical role in our product development and customer service efforts. We decided to build on the already incredible group of employees we have in Dublin.\nAs we look forward, amid the backdrop of macro uncertainty, we're comforted by the fact that, as a company, we've been through these cycles before, most recently navigating the pandemic, and as a younger company, the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Each time, we have come out stronger and remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and our long-term strategy. We believe that our leadership position will only strengthen. We have a proven track record of growth at scale, a robust business model with strong cash flow generation, a value-driven culture that attracts the best talent and constantly (inaudible) always been a recipe for long-term success for us.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today. I want to begin by extending a special welcome to the more than 700 many Workmates that joined the company during Q1. I recently had the opportunity to travel across several of our global offices and meet with many of our new and long-time Workmates. And I must say the energy within the company is amazing. I look forward to seeing what we can achieve together in FY '23 and beyond.\nWe delivered a solid first quarter as momentum across both our net new and customer-based teams continued, and we once again drove very strong renewals, a testament to the strategic nature of our solutions and our commitment to customer satisfaction. As Aneel mentioned, we did see the timing of several Q1 key deals push into future quarters, and we've also seen some Q2 pipeline opportunities move to the second half, but we are confident in closing them later this year. More broadly, we see healthy overall pipeline, positioning us to deliver a strong FY '23 as we remain focused on driving sustainable 20%-plus subscription revenue growth.\nFrom a geographic standpoint, in Q1, we had solid growth across several international markets, highlighted by the U.K. where we have significant wins at companies such as Barclays and NatWest Banking Group; in France, where people drove strategic lands at Accor and Orange S.A.; and in the Nordics and Netherlands, where we increased our footprint with companies such as Booking.com and Scandic Hotels.\nIn the U.S., we saw strength across multiple areas, including the medium enterprise, where our broad portfolio of solutions across the CHRO and CFO is driving our success. In the large enterprise, in addition to some of the new core HR and financial management wins, we expanded our strategic footprint with several of our existing customers, such as Voya, Advanced Auto Parts and one of the world's largest technology companies. Our customer base motion continues to drive strong momentum, and we're very excited by the growth we see ahead.\nIndustry is another area of significant opportunity, including emerging industries like the U.S. federal government as well as established ones such as health care, where we're the market-leading provider for both cloud-based HCM and financial solutions. Some of our most strategic transactions having go-lives in Q1 came out of our health care team, including wins at Lehigh Valley Hospital, Health Research Inc. and West Tennessee Healthcare as well as FINS go-lives at Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare. And there is clear momentum looking forward as our significant base of reference customers, along with our targeted product investments in areas like supply chain, are clearly paying off.\nAnother key growth opportunity is across our partner ecosystem, which from day 1 has been critical to our customers' success. Not only do our partners help ensure successful deployments. But through the extensibility of our platform, they're also accelerating our product road map. A great example is Huron Consulting who leveraged the industry expertise and operational supply chain knowledge to develop a demand planning solution on Workday Adaptive Planning, purpose-built for the health care industry. Using this solution, Dayton Children's Hospital is able to make data-driven decisions and ensure physical supplies, resources and space are available when patients need them most. This is just one of several areas of innovation we've seen from our ecosystem.\nOver the course of Q1, we deepened our partnerships with multiple systems integrators, like Accenture, Deloitte and PwC, to not only launch new partner-built solutions but to align our core innovation plans to scale and accelerate over the coming quarters. Helping us drive this effort and our overall ecosystem strategy is our new Chief Partner Officer, Sam Alkharrat, who brings more than 2 decades of experience to the role and who will report directly to me. Welcome, Sam.\nIn closing, we enter Q2 with healthy pipelines and a positioning across the offices of the CHRO and CFO that is as strategic as ever. We remain squarely focused on executing against our growth opportunities and in laying the foundation to support the durable 20%-plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.\nWith that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Barbara Larson. Over to you, Barbara.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano, and good afternoon, everyone. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we had a solid start to the year as organizations across the globe continue to choose Workday as their strategic partner in driving their finance and HR digital transformations. Subscription revenue in Q1 was $1.27 billion, up 23% year-over-year. And professional services revenue was $163 million, up 14%. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $360 million, representing 25% of total revenue. 24-month backlog at the end of the first quarter was $7.97 billion, growth of 21%. Growth was driven by solid new ACV and strong renewals with growth in net revenue retention rates over 95% and over 100%, respectively.\nAs Aneel and Chano mentioned, we saw the timing of several deals, including a few large ones, pushed from Q1 into future quarters in FY '23, which impacted our 24-month and total subscription revenue backlog growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Total subscription revenue backlog was $12.65 billion, up 26%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $289 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 20.1%. Margin overachievement was driven by a combination of top line overperformance and the timing of certain expenses. As expected, we made significant investments across the business in Q1 and began to transition back to the office as well as resuming travel and in-person events.\nWe had a strong start to the year for cash flow with Q1 operating cash flow of $440 million. During the quarter, we raised $3 billion in cash through a public debt offering at attractive fixed interest rates, enabling us to repay existing debt while also providing additional flexibility as we plan for the future. We prepaid our $694 million floating rate term loan in April and intend to pay the principal balance of our $1.15 billion convertible debt in cash when it comes due in October. When this occurs, our non-GAAP diluted share count will decrease by roughly 8 million shares. Due to the late Q3 timing, this share reduction will not be fully reflected in our non-GAAP weighted average share count until Q4.\nOur largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. During the quarter, we successfully added and integrated over 700 net new employees, ending Q1 with more than 15,900 employees. The strong hiring is a testament to our culture, our global brand and the significant growth opportunity that we have ahead. Overall, we are pleased with the solid company-wide execution in Q1 and remain focused on leveraging our leadership position to drive sustainable 20%-plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue.\nTurning now to guidance, which reflects continued momentum across our business while also taking into account a more back-end weighted year than we originally anticipated. We are raising our guidance for FY '23 subscription revenue to be in the range of $5.537 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $1.353 billion to $1.355 billion, 22% year-over-year growth, with sequential growth in Q3 of approximately 4.5%.\nWe still expect professional services revenue to be $650 million in FY '23 as we continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure our customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. For Q2, we expect professional services revenue of $164 million. We expect the 24-month backlog to grow approximately 20% year-over-year in Q2 of FY '23. We continue to expect FY '23 non-GAAP operating margins of 18.5%. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 17.5%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2.\nInvesting for long-term growth remains our priority, and we'll continuously evaluate growth/margin trade-offs, but we have confidence in the strength of our business model and in achieving 25% non-GAAP operating margins at $10 billion in revenue. The GAAP margins for the second quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 22 and 24 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margins. The FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.\nAs a result of our recent debt IPO, we are lowering our FY '23 guidance for operating cash flows to $1.61 billion, which takes into account approximately $55 million of cash interest payments associated with the debt. We continue to expect capital expenditures of $475 million this year to support our customer growth and continued business expansion.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) With that, I will now hand it over to Justin Furby, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nJustin Allen Furby\n\nSenior Director of IR, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Welcome to Workday's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will take questions. Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.\nBefore we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business and global economic conditions. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors and documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K for additional information on risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results, in our earnings press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.\nThe webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 90 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Also, the customers' page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly.\nOur first quarter fiscal 2023 quiet period begins on April 16, 2022. Unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be to our results for the comparable period of our fiscal 2021.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Aneel.\n\nAneel Bhusri\n\nCo-Founder, Co-CEO & Chairman of the Board, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter fiscal year '22 earnings call.\nBefore we begin, I want to spend a moment acknowledging the current situation in the Ukraine. Our thoughts are with all of those who are personally impacted by the devastating situation, including Workday contractors in Ukraine, Workmates across the western region in Europe and families of military personnel who have been deployed in the region.\nTurning now to our business results. I'm pleased to report that Workday delivered an exceptional fourth quarter, which helped us achieve the fastest growth in full year new ACV bookings in over 5 years. This acceleration in our business, along with our relentless focus on employees, customers and innovation, is serving as a strong foundation for driving durable growth on our path to $10 billion in revenues and beyond. Our business success is enabling us to attract talent at a pace we have never seen before and is allowing us to continue to expand and support new customers across our broad suite of solutions aimed at the CHRO and CFO. Indeed, we now serve more than 60 million total users across 9,500 organizations, including more than 4,100 core HCM and finance customers.\nAs our customer community continues to expand, so does our opportunity to serve them in more strategic ways. As Chano will soon share, we closed several significant transactions within our customer base sales team in Q4. Our continued commitment to our customer success is also reflected in our industry-leading gross retention rate of over 95%. Additionally, we are seeing customers increase their engagement and usage of our applications as evidenced by the over 440 billion transactions processed within Workday in fiscal year 2022, which is an increase of 67% over the previous year. Altogether, we now work with over 50% of the Fortune 500 and over 25% of the Global 2000.\nBefore I turn it over to Chano, who will share more on our go-to-market success; and Barbara Larson, our new CFO, who will provide specifics on our rate growth outlook for fiscal year '23, I'd like to share some fourth quarter highlights. First, momentum for our human capital management suite remains strong as organizations continue to transition their HR operations to the cloud. In Q4, we saw a healthy demand across all HCM product areas driven by our ability to attract new customers while strengthening and deepening our relationships with existing ones.\nNew customers in Q4 included Allied Financial, DICK'S Sporting Goods, National Australia Bank Limited, RiteAid Corporation, Smith Hill Foods and 7-Eleven, to name a few. Notable HCM go-lives in Q4 included Evonik Industries, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Wells Fargo Bank as we continue to have over 70% of our HCM customers in production.\nSwitching over to our financial management applications. Q4 was another solid quarter with several marquee wins, including Genpact Limited, Mass General Brigham, University of Melbourne and U.S. Bank. During the quarter, we doubled the number of add-on core financial management wins when compared to the same period a year ago and had several customers go live, including Bright Horizons Children Centers, Sharp Healthcare and SS&C Technologies.\nIn addition to the strong growth from our core finance application, we saw continued momentum from our expanding suite of products that support the office of the CFO, including planning, analytics and spend management, where our Strategic Sourcing solution experienced roughly 50% new ACV growth. And our procure-to-pay solution grew even faster. We continue to see very healthy attach rates for spend management solutions within our financial customers, illustrating health finances increasingly partnering with their procurement peers, drive visibility and bottom line impact for the single solution.\nAs we head into fiscal year '23, we are confident in the opportunity we have in front of us and our ability to execute on our growth initiatives on our path to $10 billion in revenues. As such, we expect fiscal year '23 to be another strong year for us.\nLastly, I'd like to share a couple of updates related to Workday's Board of Directors. First, Tom Bogan, who most recently served as Vice Chairman of Corporate Development, retired from Workday on January 31. And while we're excited for Tom and his well-deserved retirement, we are thrilled to announce that he has joined our Board. Tom came to Workday in 2018 as part of the Adaptive Insights acquisition, a company he led as CEO for nearly 4 years. During his time at Workday, Tom has been a trusted adviser, a true culture champion and passionate leader who embodies Workday's values. We are fortunate that he will now lend his expertise and guidance to help us capitalize on new opportunities for the business and work to accelerate future growth.\nThe second update I want to share is that Dave Duffield, my mentor, best friend and Workday's Co-Founder and former CEO and Chairman, has stepped down from our Board of Directors. I will now carry the honorary title of CEO Emeritus. While Dave will no longer be on the board, he remains our largest shareholder and will continue to provide his invaluable counsel as an adviser of Workday.\nWhen Dave and I started Workday nearly 17 years ago, our goal was to build a lasting multigenerational company with employees at the center and relentless focus on customer service and innovation. We wanted to have fun along the way. The growth we've experienced this past year in the face of a challenging macro environment has only solidified my belief in the foundation that we have built, thanks to the amazing group of employees and leaders who embraces our values and are committed to delivering the industry's best products and customer experience. I will end by saying that I'm quite optimistic about our future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. Over to you, Chano.\n\nLuciano Fernandez Gomez\n\nCo-CEO & Director, Workday, Inc.\n\nThank you, Aneel, and thank you to everyone for joining today. I want to start off by acknowledging the more than 15,200 Workmates across the globe who helped drive our incredibly strong finish to the year. Amazing job. I can't wait to see what we accomplish together in FY '23. I'm also looking forward to safely spending time with many of you this week at our sales kickoff here in Las Vegas, where we are taking great care to follow the safety measures in accordance with the CDC and local authority guidelines.\nAs Aneel mentioned, we delivered an exceptional Q4 and growth reacceleration driven by a strong execution and healthy demand across solutions and regions. Our performance in North America was a standout, and we had another solid quarter internationally, where Asia Pacific markets such as Australia and New Zealand were a highlight, in addition to healthy growth in key EMEA market such as Germany.\nWe had a solid quarter of landing net new core HCM and FINS customers, including several Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, along with healthy activity in the medium enterprise. Our expanding portfolio of landing solutions also experienced significant momentum, including Peakon, Workday Strategic Sourcing and Planning where new customers included Tony's Healthcare, Plastic Omnium and At Home Stores. And we couldn't be more excited to add VNDLY to our portfolio of strategic landing solution. Even though it's early, we're already seeing the results with Q4 wins including RSM, Leonardo U.K. and Guild Mortgage, among others.\nIn addition to strength from our net new teams, our customer base sales teams drove outstanding performance across both add-on and renewals, once again demonstrating the strategic nature of our platform. Customer base expansions in Q4 included U.S. Bank who purchased core FINS, Accounting Center, Prism and Extend; FIS who purchased Workforce Planning, Extend and Canadian U.K. payroll; and Merck, BP, International and Autocat Aurora Health who all added Extend.\nIn Q4, we also expanded our relationship with Accenture, who is deploying Peakon to gain a real-time post on its employee base to help power its global talent strategy. As strategic partners of ours, Accenture is applying its innovation in this area to drive engagement and deep employee-related insights for our mutual customers.\nFrom an industry lens, we continue to see our differentiated value proposition winning in the market. In financial services, for example, we closed several strategic deals in Q4, including core FINS win at the aforementioned U.S. Bank, Junior Mutual and Pam Mutual Life Insurance; and core HCM wins at National Australia Bank, Allied Financial and Autocat Group. In addition, we expanded our footprint with several financial services customers this quarter, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Kemper and Western Union.\nIndustry-specific investments such as Accounting Center, along with our deep industry knowledge and our rapidly expanding reference base of customers, which now includes more than 70% of the financial services companies in the Fortune 500, are all key to our success. And it's not just the innovation we are driving that is enabling our success but also that of our partners, such as PwC, who created a solution for multidimensional part planning and profitability by leveraging Workday Financials, Extend Accounting Center, Prism and Adaptive Planning.\nOur partners are key to our industry approach, and we're excited by the innovation happening across our ecosystem. We enter FY '23 with healthy pipelines and clear momentum in our business. In order to capitalize on that momentum, we plan to continue making significant investments within our go-to-market and service and support team with key focus areas, including customer base, international industry and emerging land motion, all of which are important growth vectors in achieving our goal of sustaining 20%-plus subscription growth well into the future.\nPart of this investment involves strengthening our leadership team as we continue to scale, to which I'm pleased to welcome Patrick Blair as our newly appointed President of the Americas. Patrick brings more than 25 years of enterprise software sales experience and not only is a proven leader, but he's a great person and a tremendous fit into the organization. I couldn't be more happy to have him join that and the team to lead our largest market.\nWith that, I'm now pleased to hand it over to our newly minted CFO and a cool start within the Workday organization, Barbara Larson. Barbara, over to you.\n\nBarbara Larson\n\nCFO, Workday, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chano. I appreciate the kind words. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I look forward to working with all of you over the coming quarters and years, and I'm thrilled to be joining Aneel, Chano and Pete today to update you on our progress.\nI joined Workday 7 years ago and have witnessed unbelievable growth in the company over that time. One observation I'd make is that our market position has never been stronger, and the broad-based momentum that we saw across the business in Q4 serves as a great validation of that.\nNow let's turn to our results. Subscription revenue was $1.23 billion in Q4, representing year-over-year growth of 22%. For the full year, subscription revenue was $4.55 billion, growth of 20%. Professional services revenue was $147 million for Q4 and $592 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue outside of the U.S. was $348 million, representing 25% of total revenue.\n24-month backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.98 billion, growth of 22%. The strong result was driven by new bookings outperformance and continued strength in renewals with growth and net retention rate over 95% and 100%, respectively. Total subscription revenue backlog was $12.81 billion, growth of 27%.\nOur non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $237 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 17.2%. As expected, our non-GAAP operating margin declined from last quarter driven by an accelerated pace of hiring, the rollout of our previously mentioned cash-based performance bonus and other growth investments made across the business, including the recent VNDLY acquisition. For the year, non-GAAP operating income was a record $1.15 billion or 22.4% of total revenue, showcasing the strength of our business model.\nOperating cash flow for Q4 was $615 million, bringing our full year operating cash flow to $1.65 billion, growth of 30%. Record cash flow results were driven by solid operating income performance as well as strong cash collections throughout the year.\nOur largest investments continue to be in our people and attracting top talent to Workday. We successfully added and integrated roughly 1,000 net new employees in Q4, including over 140 from VNDLY, ending the year with more than 15,200 employees, growth of 21% and in line with our hiring aspirations when we entered FY '22. The record hiring is a testament to our culture, our global brand and the significant growth opportunity that we have ahead. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong company-wide execution in our seasonally most important quarter.\nTurning now to guidance. We are encouraged by the significant momentum in our business, and we're optimistic that the environment will remain robust throughout FY '23 as organizations continue to prioritize and invest in their strategic finance and HR transformation initiatives. With that context, we now expect FY '23 subscription revenue to be in the range of $5.53 billion to $5.55 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth.\nFor the first quarter of FY '23, we expect subscription revenue to be between $1.263 billion and $1.265 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth at the high end. We expect subscription revenue to increase sequentially by approximately 7% in Q2 and approximately 5.5% in Q3 and Q4. We expect the 24-month backlog to grow approximately 22% in Q1 of FY '23. We are expecting professional services revenue to be approximately $160 million in Q1 and $650 million for the full year. We will continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value.\nFrom a margin standpoint, since the onset of COVID, we have demonstrated the scalability inherent in our model. As we've discussed, however, investing for growth remains our #1 priority. In FY '23, we plan to continue hiring across the company at a rapid pace with a focus on sales and products. We are also expecting a return to travel and in-person events. And as we have discussed, we've rolled out a performance-based cash bonus program across the company.\nGiven this ramped level of investment and taking into account our increased revenue outlook, we are raising our FY '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 18.5%. Investing for growth remains our focus, and we will continuously evaluate gross margin trade-off. But we're currently expecting to resume margin expansion in FY '24 and have continued confidence in reaching 25% margin at $10 billion in revenue.\nWe estimate non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 19% in Q1 and expect a normal seasonal sequential decline in Q2 as we invest in our people through our annual compensation process. The GAAP margins for the first quarter and the full year are expected to be approximately 28 and 24 percentage points lower, respectively, than the non-GAAP margin. The FY '23 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 19%.\nWe expect operating cash flow in FY '23 to be approximately $1.65 billion, flat from record levels in FY '22, driven by the ramp in growth investments, the corresponding decrease in margins and an estimated $80 million onetime tax payment related to the expected transfer of acquired intellectual property. We expect capital expenditures of roughly $475 million in FY '23 to support continued business expansion and phased return to office with investments across our existing facilities, corporate IT infrastructure and customer data centers. This includes opportunistic data center investment that was previously planned for FY '24 as we manage the supply chain and plan for future growth.\nAnd finally, I'll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work, which allowed us to deliver exceptional results during yet another unprecedented year. We are more confident than ever in our long-term opportunity ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

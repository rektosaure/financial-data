Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call. For my remarks today, I will summarize our third quarter top line performance, provide an update on EYLEA HD regulatory matters, briefly discuss our recent pipeline progress and close with some comments regarding our discussions with the United States government to lower drug costs for American patients while preserving innovation. I'll then hand the call over to George, who will provide more details on our pipeline progress. From then, Marion will review our commercial performance. And finally, Chris will detail our financial results and guidance.\nWe generally delivered a solid third quarter, driven by double-digit net sales growth for 3 of our leading products. Compared to the third quarter of last year, worldwide net product sales for DUPIXENT increased by 26% and LIBTAYO by 24% at constant exchange rates while EYLEA HD in the United States grew by 10%. Regeneron had DUPIXENT Global net sales for the third quarter were $4.9 billion, as recorded by Sanofi with strong growth continued across approved indications in geographic regions. In the United States, DUPIXENT net product sales grew 28% compared to the third quarter of last year while maintaining its leadership position in both new-to-brand prescription share and total prescription share across all indications approved prior to this year.\nDUPIXENT is now approved in the United States to treat 8 distinct diseases driven by underlying type 2 inflammation, including diseases of the skin, gut and respiratory system, spanning age groups from infants to the elderly. And with more than 1.3 million patients globally being actively treated. DUPIXENT is one of the most widely used biologic medicines. DUPIXENT's approved indications can potentially address more than 4 million patients in the United States alone, positioning it to remain a strong growth driver over the near, medium and long term. Global Libtayo net product sales were $365 million up 24% on a constant currency basis compared to the third quarter of last year. In the U.S., net product sales grew 12% when Libtayo continues to be the market-leading immunotherapy for advanced non-melanoma skin cancers, while building share in lung cancer.\nEarlier this month, the FDA approved Libtayo in high-risk adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma making Libtayo the first and only PD-1 antibody indicated for this setting. While it only has been a few weeks since approval, our launch is already off to a great start and we look forward to treating the up to 10,000 addressable patients in the United States who could benefit from this medicine.\nMoving to EYLEA and EYLEA HD affordability issues continue to dampen branded anti-VEGF category growth. As announced in June, we initiated a matching program for up to $200 million in contributions to the good days retinal vascular and neovascular disease fund. But I am disappointed to report that the match in the third quarter was under $1 million due to lack of donations from other potential contributors. We remain committed to matching future donations to this trend through the end of the year. Despite affordability headwinds, EYLEA HD had a strong performance in the third quarter, with U.S. net product sales reaching $431 million, an all-time high, driven by robust physician unit demand growth partially offset by a lower net price. We continue to believe that future product enhancements, such as a 4-week dosing interval, the inclusion of macular edema filing retinal vein occlusion or RVO, and a prefilled syringe administration are needed to fully unlock EYLEA's HD commercial potential.\nEarlier this month, we were notified by Catalent, Indiana LLC, an affiliate of Novo Nordisk that the FDA classified their facility as official action indicated or OAI. And to date, the issues identified during the July 2025 inspection have not been completely resolved. On that basis, the FDA issued a complete response letter yesterday for the prefilled syringe supplemental BLA with the sole approvability issue relating to unresolved inspection findings at Catalent. We continue to execute on our previously announced plan to submit an application to add an alternate prefilled syringe fill up by January 2026, which would trigger a 4-month FDA review.\nWe have also been diligently working with an alternate vial filler and have already submitted an application to include them in the EYLEA HD BLA with a PDUFA date in late December. This would provide an additional opportunity for the FDA to approve the SBLA for every 4-week dosing and RVO given we believe there are no other outstanding review issues for this application.\nMoving briefly to our pipeline, which George will soon discuss in more detail. We continue to make significant investments in R&D that yielded notable progress across several key programs. In just the past 3 months, we have announced positive Phase III or registration-enabling data for 6 distinct programs spanning immunology, neurology, allergy and rare diseases. Over the next several months, we look forward to rapidly expanding pivotal programs in hematology oncology, thrombosis, obesity and other metabolic diseases as well as allergies, all of which we believe represent an impressive next wave of innovative medicines discovered or developed by Regeneron.\nFinally, I'd like to take a moment to address our ongoing progress toward reaching an agreement with the U.S. government to help lower the cost of medicines for American patients. We are having constructive discussions with the administration and I'm pleased to share that our priorities are closely aligned. Both Regeneron and the administration are deeply committed to ensuring that American patients have timely and affordable access to groundbreaking medical breakthroughs. We likewise share the goal of preserving the United States position as a global leader in biotech innovation and manufacturing. For more than a decade, George and I have argued that foreign governments have benefited from American innovation without sharing the burden of its cost.\nWe are hopeful the efforts of this administration can level the playing field and convince high GDP nations to contribute their fair share rather than relying on the United States to shoulder the vast majority of this responsibility. By addressing this imbalance, we can ensure a more equitable global system that supports continued advancements in medicine while improving affordability for U.S. patients. Furthermore, we agreed that investing in U.S. manufacturing is not only vital for creating jobs and strengthening our economy but for safeguarding national security. In fact, in testimony before Congress in 2014, Regeneron highlighted the importance of prioritizing biotech manufacturing and innovation in the United States. Regeneron has already made significant commitments in this area including our plans to invest over $7 billion in infrastructure and manufacturing facilities in New York and North Carolina over the coming years. We remain optimistic about finding common ground with the university -- with the administration that strikes the right balance between achieving our shared priorities while advancing Regeneron's mission of harnessing the power of science to deliver life-changing medicine to patients.\nIn closing, Regeneron's business continues to perform well with impressive commercial execution, driving strong financial results in the third quarter. Our pipeline is poised to deliver scientific breakthroughs that can potentially help treat millions of patients and translate into meaningful commercial opportunities. The commercial team remains focused on maximizing growth drivers from our in-line brands while successfully launching new products and indications. Finally, we continue to prudently deploy capital with the goal of delivering long-term value to shareholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Len. Over the last few months, as Len just mentioned, we have delivered multiple important data readouts showcasing the strength of our robust pipeline and the potential to drive future growth with positive pivotal data for DUPIXENT for C5 program, our CAT and birch allergy programs as well as in our rare disease programs. I will also update progress in oncology, anticoagulation and other programs.\nStarting with immunology and inflammation. DUPIXENT continues to deliver remarkable outcomes in addressing indications driven by type 2 inflammation, potentially adding to its existing approvals for 8 diseases in the United States. We are anticipating the FDA's acceptance of our submission for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, or AFRS in patients aged 6 years and older based on positive data that we plan to present shortly. This represents yet another potential opportunity for expanding DUPIXENT's label.\nMoving to our IL-33 antibody, [indiscernible], which was studied in COPD, for which it met its primary endpoint in 1 of 2 replicate Phase III trials. We and Sanofi are contemplating another Phase III for [indiscernible] in COPD pending feedback from regulators. [indiscernible] development is also advancing other respiratory diseases most notably our ongoing Phase III studies in chronic rhinocyesitis with nasal polyps, where our genetic evidence is compelling. Moving to our innovative and multipronged allergy programs. As previously announced, our Phase III studies of our antibodies for CAT allergy and for birch allergy have yielded statistically significant and clinically meaningful outcomes on primary and key secondary endpoints. These results represent the first proof of principle that targeting allergies with highly specific monoclonal antibody cocktails can achieve improvements in both ocular itch and redness. Importantly, in prior clinical trials, our CAT and birch allergy approaches have delivered impressive and durable therapeutic benefits across nasal, respiratory and skin allergy symptoms.\nIn the coming months, we plan to present these results at an upcoming medical meeting and initiate confirmatory Phase III studies for these programs. In the U.S. alone, these therapies could help approximately 1.6 million people suffering from severe CAT allergies and the approximately 1.4 million people suffering from severe birth allergies. Regarding our innovative severe food allergy program, enrollment and dosing are progressing well in our small proof-of-concept trial combining limbosaltimab and DUPIXENT. The first 3 patients have responded remarkably with greater than 90% rapid reductions in the allergen causing imuglovlin-E levels following a short course of [indiscernible] treatment, which are then maintained and continue to decrease with ongoing DUPIXENT maintenance. Full enrollment of this small initial study is still expected over the next few months. Based on insights gained from the program so far, we are advancing the development of next-generation agents designed to specifically and safely deplete allergy-causing plasma cells, the first of which is expected to enter clinical trial next year alongside several other promising novel candidates in immunology and inflammation.\nMoving on to oncology and starting with Libtayo, which was recently FDA approved as the first and only immunotherapy for adjuvant treatment of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma following surgery and radiation based on the only successful clinical trial in this setting the [ C-post ] trial data that showed a notable 68% reduction in risk of disease recurrence or death. This approval expands and extends Libtayo's leading position in non-melanoma skin cancers. Moving to fianlimab. Our LAG-3 antibody study in combination with Libtayo, our pivotal trial in metastatic melanoma is ongoing with enrollment for our progression-free survival cohort completing in last January, and results are now anticipated in the first half of the coming year due to slower rates of event accrual.\nLynozyfic, our [ BCMAxCD3 ] bispecific has been approved in the United States and the EU for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Lynozyfic has the potential for best-in-class efficacy in this late-line setting compared to the other approved BCMA by CD3 bispecifics with almost double the rates of complete responses as reported in the respective label. This is the basis for our enthusiasm for studying Lynozyfic in earlier lines of myeloma and even in precursor setting as a monotherapy or in limited combinations. Consistent with this, we've recently presented promising Phase II results in high-risk modern myeloma patients with Lynozyfic monotherapy, demonstrating a 100% objective response rate in 19 evaluable patients with all 6 patients who have been following for at least 1 year, achieving a molecular complete response. A Phase III head-to-head study against DARZALEX is planned to start in the coming months. with DARZALEX having demonstrated a 9% complete response rate in this setting.\nIn addition, we have observed rapid normalization with Lynozyfic monotherapy in previously treated light chain amyloidosis patients, including patients who have previously received and failed a DARZALEX containing combination chemotherapy. Finally, I would like to highlight that Lynozyfic has demonstrated an 83% overall response rate as a monotherapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with responses deepening over time. Updated results will be reported at a medical meeting later this year. Altogether, these data give us confidence in terms of pursuing Lynozyfic as a monotherapy or in simplified combination in early lines and precursor settings of myeloma. Though I won't go into detail on odronextamab today, I want to highlight that our Phase III study evaluating odronextamab as first-line monotherapy against the standard of care in follicular lymphoma patients is fully enrolled.\nSimilarly to Lynozyfic, odronextamab demonstrated potentially best-in-class efficacy in late-line patients, driving our enthusiasm for this approach in the early aligned settings. I'd also like to remind you that in the leading cohort for this Phase III study in first-line follicular lymphoma, odronextamab monotherapy demonstrated a 100% complete response rate, further reinforcing the potential of odronextamab in this setting.\nMoving on to our C5 and complement inhibitor programs. Let me remind you that in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH, where de blockade of C5 seems critical to prevent breakthrough hemolysis and potentially catastrophic events, the lead-in cohort for our Phase III study demonstrated there are once monthly subcutaneous regimen combining a C5 antibody with a C5 sRNA may provide the best-in-class disease control with the best-in-class convenience. For PNH patients, we have also just initiated our first-in-human study of our siRNA targeting complement factor B primarily intended for the 20% to 30% of patients who remain anemic despite optimal C5 therapy due to so-called extravascular hemolysis.\nMoving on to our C5 program in generalized myasthenia gravis. In the third quarter, we announced positive Phase III results for our C5 sRNA cemdisiran. This sRNA conveniently dosed subcutaneously every 3 months show statistically significant results for the primary endpoint improvement in the MG-ADL score compared to placebo and numerically better results compared to other C5 inhibitor therapies in cross-trial comparisons. The convenience advantage for patients currently being treated with regular intravenous infusions together with its efficacy and safety profile, positions cemdisiran as a potential best-in-class treatment option for this debilitating neuromuscular disorder. We are planning on submitting a U.S. renter application for cemdisiran monotherapy in the first quarter of 2026 pending FDA discussions with global submissions to follow.\nFinally, for our C5 program in terms of our efforts in ophthalmology, we are hoping to complete enrollment in the first quarter of 2026 for the lead-in cohort of our first Phase III study in geographic atrophy with initial results expected by the end of 2026. Additionally, in ophthalmology, I'd like to note that we are initiating a clinical trial in active noninfectious uveitis of an intravitreally delivered CD3 monoclonal antibody, which is designed to locally block autoimmune T cell activity in the eye marking the first in a new series of novel ophthalmology targets that we will be progressing to the clinic over the next year.\nTurning to our anticoagulation efforts and in particular, to our Factor XI program involving 2 different antibodies designed to tailor anticoagulation therapy for each individual patient's needs. Pivotal studies in postoperative venous thromboembolism following total knee replacement surgery are in progress with data anticipated in 2027. Pivotal studies and other anticoagulation indications are set to launch in the coming months. On November 10, we will kick off a new investor event series called the Regeneron round tape, which will spotlight our various innovative pipeline programs starting with our Factor XI story in which we will provide, for the first time, exciting new clinical data in trials exploring the Factor XI antibodies in catheter associates thrombosis in provoked subclinical GI bleeding study. Upcoming Regeneron roundtables with spotlight or opportunities in hematologic and solid tumor oncology obesity and other areas.\nMoving to our growing siRNA portfolio coming out of our research collaboration with Alnylam. I'd like to highlight our ongoing clinical studies, including our PNPLA3 and side BSI RNAs in MASH, our SOD and HTT siRNAs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease and in addition, we plan to begin clinical trials for alpha-synuclein sRNA for parkings disease and our [indiscernible] sRNA for Alzheimer's in the coming months.\nFinally, I'd like to highlight our commitment to developing innovative new approaches in the ultra-rare disease space. In the third quarter, we announced unprecedented clinical benefit using [ daratuzimab ] in our Phase III OPTIMA trial in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive or FOP. Individuals suffering from this tragic genetic disorder progressively replaced their muscle and soft tissue with abnormal bone formation in casing themselves in a horrific osseous cage. Remarkably, in the OPTIMA trial, we're able to demonstrate a greater than 99% reduction in abnormal bone formation at 56 weeks, offering great hope for this ultra-rare genetic disorder. Regeneron plans a U.S. regulatory submission by the end of 2025. We are also providing new hope for children suffering from another ultra-rare genetic disorder in which absent of the OTOF gene results in profound genetic hearing loss.\nAs we recently described in the New England Journal of Medicine, our novel gene therapy approach provided meaningful hearing gains in 11 out of 12 treated children with several achieving normal hearing levels. The FDA recently announced that this program was the first new molecular entity selected for a commissioner's national priority voucher, and we are finalizing preparations for a U.S. regulatory submission this year. This program highlights Regeneron's commitment to advancing the leading edge of biotechnology.\nIn summary, Regeneron has delivered a quarter filled with positive clinical readouts, advancing our pipeline and reinforcing our leadership in scientific innovation, from groundbreaking advance addressing some of the most common medical conditions to transformative innovation in the ultra-rare disease space.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, George. Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of Regeneron's commercial portfolio. Today's results demonstrate our ability to drive growth of in-line brands and to accelerate launch opportunities delivering our transformative medicines to even more patients.\nBeginning with EYLEA HD and EYLEA, total combined third quarter U.S. net sales were $1.11 billion, comparable on a sequential basis. As a decrease in EYLEA net sales was offset by an increase in EYLEA HD net sales, EYLEA HD net sales grew 10% quarter-over-quarter to $431 million, again growing faster than any other innovative medicine in the category. EYLEA HD unit demand grew 18% quarter-over-quarter, which was partially offset by ongoing competitive pricing pressures within the category. As EYLEA HD grew, EYLEA's third quarter U.S. net sales decreased 10% quarter-over-quarter to $681 million, reflecting a commensurate decline in unit demand driven by the ongoing conversion to EYLEA HD patient affordability issues and competitive dynamics. We expect a similar demand decline in the fourth quarter for EYLEA, along with ongoing pricing pressure.\nTogether, EYLEA HD and EYLEA lead the branded and VEGF category based on best-in-class efficacy, safety and with EYLEA HD durability. And EYLEA HD now represents approximately 40% of Regeneron's U.S. retina franchise. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for EYLEA HD, we anticipate sequential demand growth to moderate to high single digits as we await label enhancements. Once approved, we believe these enhancements have the potential to generate a significant positive inflection in demand.\nNow with DUPIXENT. Third quarter worldwide net sales reached $4.9 billion, growing 26% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. In the U.S., DUPIXENT's net sales reached $3.6 billion, reflecting 28% year-over-year growth. DUPIXENT leads the market across all established indications, including atopic dermatitis asthma nasal polyps in the synopilic esophagitis. In addition, DUPIXENT is the main beneficiary of competitive market growth efforts based on its proven efficacy, safety, ease of access and ability to address unmet patient needs. Our recent launches in COPD, chronic spontaneous urticaria and bolus pensagoid are progressing very well. Across all launches, DUPIXENT's differentiated clinical profile and growing physician experience are driving strong uptake and COPD, prescribers see DUPIXENT's benefits across a range of appropriate patient types and recent market research found pulmonologists expected to substantially increase their prescribing of DUPIXENT over the next 12 months.\nIn lung cancer -- additionally, there has been rapid uptake among chronic spontaneous urticaria patients as both dermatologists and allergists embrace DUPIXENT. In [indiscernible], DUPIXENT is the first biologic medicine addressing a critical unmet need. Physicians are eager to transition elderly patients of steroid therapy, which depicts in offering them a safer and more effective alternative. In summary, DUPIXENT continues to transform the lives of patients across indications, geographies and age groups from as young as 6 months. There are currently more than 1.3 million patients worldwide benefiting from DUPIXENT for multiple type 2 diseases.\nTurning to oncology and hematology. In the third quarter, Libtayo delivered $365 million worldwide net sales, growing 24% on a constant currency basis compared with the prior year. In the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 12% year-over-year to $219 million based on strong demand across all approved indications. In non-melanoma skin cancers, Libtayo's strong performance is based on established market leadership in ongoing category growth. We are making encouraging early progress with U.S. launch in adjuvant CSCC, where physicians are already embracing the ties a new treatment option we estimate that up to 10,000 eligible patients may benefit from Libtayo in this setting. And now in lung cancer, Libtayo is now the second most commonly prescribed immunotherapy for newly diagnosed patients. Physicians increasingly recognize Libtayo as an important treatment option based on clinical experience, versatility as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy and an increasing body of clinical evidence, including recent 5-year survival data.\nOutside the U.S., Libtayo sales reached $146 million, growing 47% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, supported by sustained demand and ongoing launches in international markets. Moving to our new hematology therapy, Lynozyfic. We've made strong early progress in commercializing this important bispecific for fifth line multiple myeloma patients. Positive launch indicators include physician feedback, formulary listings, pathway inclusions, completion of REMS requirements and payer coverage. While we expect modest revenue contribution in this heavily pretreated population, Lynozyfic is an important therapeutic advance to the hematology community, and we look forward to additional clinical data supporting its potential use in earlier treatment settings. In summary, in the third quarter, Regeneron delivered ongoing growth across IDH DUPIXENT and Libtayo, and made important progress in several launches. Our commercial portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on many near-term growth opportunities enabling us to deliver more treatments to more patients.\nWith that, I'll turn the call to Chris.\n\nChristopher R. Fenimore\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.\nThird quarter 2025 total revenues of $3.8 billion grew 1% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher Sanofi collaboration revenue, driven by strong DUPIXENT sales growth and continued growth in net sales of Libtayo globally and EYLEA HD in the U.S., partially offset by lower net sales of EYLEA in the U.S. and lower buyer collaboration revenue. Third quarter diluted net income per share was $11.83 on net income of $1.3 billion.\nBeginning with the Sanofi collaboration, revenues were approximately $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 34% versus the prior year, driven by volume growth for DUPIXENT and improving collaboration margins. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $900 million at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $300 million since the end of the second quarter at approximately $730 million since the start of the year. DUPIXENT's continued strength has enabled a rapid reimbursement of the development balance in 2025, and we now expect this balance to be fully reimbursed by no later than the end of the third quarter of 2026.\nMoving to Bayer. Third quarter net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg outside the U.S. were $854 million, inclusive of $232 million of EYLEA 8 mg sales. Total buyer collaboration revenue was $345 million, of which $312 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S. Other revenue in the third quarter was $198 million, which included $165 million of profit share and royalties associated with license agreements. The increase from the prior year was driven by higher royalty income from Alaris and growth in our share of profits from Arcelis.\nNow to our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting continued investments to support Regeneron's innovative late-stage pipeline, including our pivotal programs for Lynozyfic and Ordspono in earlier lines of myeloma and lymphoma, our Factor XI program in anticoagulation indications and our ongoing efforts in other clinical programs. Third quarter SG&A was $541 million, down 12% from the prior year primarily driven by lower charitable contributions to an independent nonprofit patient assistance foundation. Third quarter 2025 gross margin on net product sales was 86%, the lower gross margin versus the prior year reflects a change in product mix and higher ongoing investments to support our manufacturing operations.\nRegeneron generated $3.2 billion in free cash flow through the first 9 months of 2025 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $16 billion. Through the first 9 months of 2025, we have repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of our shares, the most ever allocated to open market repurchases in any full fiscal year in our history. We continue to be opportunistic buyers of our shares and anticipate returning approximately $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases in 2025.\nMoving to guidance for 2025. We have updated and narrowed the ranges across our financial guidance, which can be found in our press release issued earlier this morning. Finally, as we turn to 2026, we continue to make significant progress across our innovative pipeline and anticipate advancing multiple large registrational programs in myeloma, lymphoma, anticoagulation, obesity and other hematology and solid tumor oncology programs as well as several new assets into the clinic. We believe investing in these programs can drive significant long-term value. And to support these efforts, we currently expect a mid-teens percentage increase in R&D expense in 2026 relative to 2025. We will provide details in 2026 guidance for other line items early next year.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron's third quarter results demonstrate the ongoing strength of our business and enable us to continue investing in our differentiated pipeline to deliver significant advances for patients and drive long-term value for shareholders.\nWith that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Shannon, can we please go to the first question, please?",

Similarly, when we know a little more we'll get that information out.\n\nTurn it over to Maryann to comment on the driving of our sales for HD. Thanks Lane, and then kind of just.\n\nGoing back to the numbers.\n\nKind of that sharing the demand growth in the quarter was impressive there was a 16% increase which resulted in $392 million in net sales for HD in the quarter.\n\nWe would attribute it to frankly physician depreciation for the product profile that Eylea HD provides the clinical efficacy or safety that we've talked about repeatedly and then also the durability that allows patients to have longer periods of time between dosing and the experience with the product has been very very favorable as a summer.\n\nWhen we do get those label enhancements will be able to even have more of a trajectory of growth in demand, but I, certainly very solid performance and I would attribute it to the product profile and our excellent commercial team.\n\nThank you Lynn and Marion, let's move to the next question. Please Sharon.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from Jpmorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nGreat. Thanks, so much just a couple more eylea ones as well just on the .\n\nBeyond the manufacturing dynamics is there anything else pending with these three filings based on your discussion with FDA or are you otherwise confidence that once the manufacturing has addressed will be seeing approvals here.\n\nAnd just the second one the second part on Eylea.\n\nCould you talk a little bit about the branded share erosion you are seeing in the category to Avastin is that starting to stabilize at all and how quickly do you expect to recapture some of that loss share once the affordability issues have been addressed thank you.\n\nYes, so I'll comment on the comment a little bit on the share issues.\n\nAs far as the producers go based on our discussions we believe that.\n\nThere is nothing significant left to be done obviously, some details, but we are expecting once the.\n\nResolution of the spelling issues has occurred to receive favorable action, we hope on the FDA.\n\nAnd then on overall branded dynamic and overall performance.\n\nSure that.\n\nIf you look at total Regeneron eylea, each C&I Leah category share branded share in the quarter with just over 60%.\n\nIf you look then at growth and what happened in the overall category anti VEGF overall category.\n\ndid grow but the branded anti VEGF category volume actually decreased by one 2% and that would be attributed primarily to the uptick in avastin based on affordability issues I.\n\nDon't have lend into and what potential will happen in the future.\n\nSo the next question please Shannon.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nGood morning, guys long time listener first time caller.

In addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our quarterly results press release and our corporate presentation, both of which can be found on the Regeneron Investor Relations website. Once our call concludes, the IR team will be available to answer any further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. For my remarks, I will review some of our key performance drivers, then briefly discuss some pipeline advances we have made this year. I will then hand the call over to George, who will provide additional insights on our pipeline.\nFrom there, Marion will review our first quarter 2025 commercial performance. And finally, Chris will detail our financial results and provide an update on our 2025 financial outlook. Let's get to it. Regeneron's performance in the first quarter was mixed with some difficult news related to our retinal franchise, offset by encouraging news relating to the rest of our commercial portfolio as well as advances in our robust pipeline of differentiated clinical candidates, beginning with EYLEA and EYLEA HD. On a macro basis, in the first quarter of 2025 and the overall size of the branded anti-VEGF category contracted due to an increase in the usage of low-cost off-label repavastin, likely driven by patient affordability issues because of a funding gap at co-pay assistance foundations.\nWith respect to EYLEA, first quarter 2025 U.S. net sales were $736 million down 39% compared to the first quarter of last year and down 38% compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. However, physician unit demand decreased by 14% sequentially, with the balance of the decline primarily attributable to lower wholesale inventory levels, which ended the quarter in the normal range.\nWith respect to EYLEA HD in the United States, first quarter 2025 sales were $307 million, up 54% compared to the first quarter of last year, and were essentially flat on a sequential basis. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, EYLEA HD physician unit demand grew by 5% which was offset primarily by a modest wholesaler inventory jot down. On the regulatory front, last Wednesday, we were disappointed with the FDA's decision to issue a complete response letter for our submission seeking approval for the EYLEA HD prefilled syringe. Since receiving the CRO, we have held several teleconferences with the FDA to better understand the content of the CRO and believe the key outstanding issue relates to a question posed by the FDA to a third-party component supplier.\nThis component supplier has expeditiously responded to FDA requests for information. The CRL did not identify any issues with respect to the safety or efficacy of EYLEA HD the usability of the device proposed labeling or preapproval inspection findings. We also recently announced that the FDA had accepted for priority review and BLA for EYLEA HD to treat macular edema following retinal vein occlusion or RVO, and for monthly dosing in approved indications following the use of a priority review voucher. We believe these product enhancements will strengthen EYLEA HD's position in the competitive anti-VEGF category, if approved.\nMoving to DUPIXENT. First quarter 2025 net product sales grew 20% globally on a constant currency basis versus the first quarter of 2024 reflecting strong growth across all approved indications in all groups -- in all age groups, I should say, and in all geographic regions. In the U.S., where net product sales grew 19%, DUPIXENT now leads in both new-to-brand prescription share and total prescription share across all of its approved indications with the only exception being chronic spontaneous Artcare or CSU, which was approved by the FDA only 11 days ago. The COPD launch in the U.S. continues to gain momentum with prescribers increasingly appreciating the role of type 2 inflammation in certain patients with COPD, coupled with greater urgency to identify and treat edible patients.\nPayers are increasingly recognizing the value that DUPIXENT offers and have implemented broad and favorable coverage decisions for commercial and Medicare patients. With those pieces in place, we now look to drive patient awareness of DUPIXENT as a new treatment option for COPD through a recently launched direct-to-consumer campaign.\nLibtayo in the U.S. grew 21% compared to the first quarter of last year and has established itself as a cornerstone therapy for advanced non-melanoma skin cancer while the share of the lung cancer market continues to increase. In the highly competitive first line advanced non-small cell lung cancer market, Libtayo is now second in new-to-brand prescription share despite launching years after other competing therapies, reflecting its differentiated clinical profile and our commercial strategy.\nWe expect Dupixent EYLEA HD and Libtayo to continue delivering significant growth for the foreseeable future to additional penetration in approved indications potential future indications, potential combinations with other pipeline candidates as well as other potential product enhancements.\nNow briefly moving to our pipeline, which now includes approximately 45 product candidates in clinical development. We continue to make significant investments in R&D, which have yielded notable progress across 7 key programs so far this year including 4 regulatory approvals and 9 regulatory submissions. For the remainder of 2025, we anticipate U.S. regulatory approvals for limboseltimab and relapsed refractory multiple myeloma and odeneximab in late-line follicle lymphoma, Libtayo in adjuvant CSCC, Dupixent in PulasPimfogoid as well as differentiated enhancements to the EYLEA HD U.S. label.\nWe also now expect to read out pivotal or proof-of-concept data across programs in immunology, oncology, hematology, internal medicine and rare diseases, programs that George will discuss in a minute. In closing, Regeneron remains in a very strong position, scientifically, commercially and financially, enabling us to invest heavily in R&D and deliver scientific breakthroughs, maximize growth opportunities from our in-line brands, successfully launched new products and indications and return capital directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We look forward to providing updates on these efforts as we move through the remainder of 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lynn. 2025 is shaping up to be an exciting year for advancing our broad and differentiated pipeline, and we look forward to reporting several pivotal or proof-of-concept data sets from multiple programs. I would like to briefly highlight the significant opportunities and discuss additional pipeline advancements, starting with DUPIXENT, which continues to set a high bar across multiple type 2 allergic diseases.\nEarlier this month, DUPIXENT was approved for the treatment of adults and adolescents with chronic spontaneous urticaria who remain uncontrolled despite antihistamine treatment. This approval marks the seventh type 2 allergic disease for which DUPIXENT has been approved by the FDA and is the first new treatment option for CSU patients in over a decade. DUPIXENT was also accepted for priority review for the treatment of [indiscernible] with a PDUFA date of June 20, bullish pemphigoid represents yet another first-in-class opportunity for DUPIXENT, which is the only biologic to achieve significant improvements in disease remission and symptoms in this set.\nAnd finally, DUPIXENT became the first ever biologic medicine to be approved for COPD in Japan, marking the 45th country in which the COPD indication has been approved. We are eagerly awaiting the pivotal readout for linvoseltamab, our interleukin-33 antibody for COPD and former smokers regardless of eosinophil levels with data expected in the middle of 2025.\nIn addition to COPD, we recently initiated a Phase III program for iriticumab in chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps, an indication of strong genetic validation as well as a Phase II study in chronic rhinositis without nasal polyps. In addition, next year, we are expecting proof concept data for inepicaman in noncysticfibrosis bronchiectasis.\nTurning now to oncology efforts. We recently submitted U.S. and EU regulatory filings for Libtayo, [indiscernible] where Libtayo became the first immunotherapy to show a benefit in a high-risk population. In early June, these data will be presented in an oral presentation at the American City of Clinical Oncology or ASCO Annual Meeting, highlighting a 68% reduction in Arista disease recurrence or death compared to placebo with no new safety signals identified.\nThis data set underscores our belief that Libtayo provides a best-in-class foundation for combinations with our other oncology assets. And in this regard, Libtayo is being tested in combination with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in several solid tumor settings. In melanoma, early clinical data have suggested that this combination can provide substantial additive benefit compared to PD-1 monotherapy without exacerbating safety.\nAn ongoing Phase III trial in first-line metastatic melanoma evaluating this combination compared to KEYTRUDA monotherapy is expected to read out in the second half of this year. We reiterate that these data confirm best-in-class activity in melanoma, we will increase our confidence for this combination in other cancer settings. In first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, a preplanned interim analysis was conducted this month on 2 ongoing Phase II studies evaluating this combination.\nDue to limited follow-up, the Phase II portion of the studies will continue unchanged until additional data are available. The next analysis for these studies are expected in the first quarter of 2026 in which a decision whether to advance to Phase III will be made. No new safety signals were observed in either study.\nTurning to our CD3 bispecifics. The European Commission recently granted conditional marketing authorization for LinoZific or limboceltaman, or BCMA by CD3 bispecific for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma we have received at least 3 prior therapies, marking [indiscernible] first global regulatory approval in the U.S., our resubmission of the limboseltumab BLA for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma was accepted by the FDA with a PDUFA date of July 10.\nWe believe limvosetimab has the potential to be the best-in-class BCMAxCD3 bispecific due to its differentiated clinical profile, dosing and administration. Our broad clinical program in earlier lines emphasizes monotherapy and limited combinations and continues to advance with a confirmatory Phase III linker MM3 study in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma now fully enrolled.\nAt ASCO, also in oral presentations, we will present the initial results from the Phase I/II linker MM2 trial, the valuing limboceltumab in combinations with carfilzomab and with bortezumab in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Both combinations demonstrated a high rate of deep and durable responses with a safety profile consistent with the individual drugs, supporting further development.\nFor odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, the FDA has accepted the BLA resubmission for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma with a PDUFA date of July 30. Ogenextumab has demonstrated potentially best-in-class efficacy in this late-line setting in our differentiated clinical development focuses on monotherapy and limited novel combinations in earlier line and continues to advance.\nTurning to hematology. We are rapidly advancing our Factor XI program where we are investigating 2 different antibodies that target different Factor XI domains to create a tailored approach to anticoagulation offering the potential for improved blood clot prevention and lower bleeding risk. We remain on track to enroll patients in pivotal studies this year, both in settings with large patient populations and longer follow-up as well in settings with small populations and shorter follow-up that may provide a quicker path to market.\nMoving to our obesity efforts. Regeneron has decades of experience in muscle biology, growth factor signaling pathways and genetics. We are capitalizing on this expertise to position ourselves as a key player in the rapidly expanding obesity market by investigating agents that enhance GLP-1 weight loss by maintaining muscle mass. Our muscle-sparing Phase II CAR study is investigating the addition of[indiscernible] , our GDF8 antibody to semaglutide with and without gartatimab are active in antibody with the goal of improving the quality of weight loss. We expect to report data for the 26-week primary endpoint including percentage of weight loss and percentage of fat loss compared to baseline in the second half of this year.\nAt the upcoming American Diabetes Association meeting in June, we anticipate that Lilly will present Phase II data from a very related program evaluating semaglutide combined with an antibody that binds to active and type 2 receptors, which blocks myostatin in active and signaling. The weight loss lean mass preservation overall metabolic profile along with safety and tolerability will help perform next steps for our programs as well.\nAnd finally, moving to our Regeneron Genetic Medicines pipeline. Our novel C5 sRNA and anybody combination has demonstrated rapid, complete and uninterrupted inhibition of C5 as seen in our ongoing pivotal program in patients with paroxysmal maternal hemoglobin urea. These profound findings increase our confidence in seeing robust improvement in generalized myasthenia gravis, where pivotal results from an ongoing Phase III program are expected in the second half of this year.\nOur unique mechanism of action provides more complete C5 inhibition than observed with other C5 approaches that are approved in this indication as well as the potential for more convenient subcutaneous regimens. In summary, Regeneron continues to deliver scientific firsts and drive innovation. Our unique R&D capabilities have allowed us to build with the most prolific pipelines in our industry, and we look forward to reporting multiple impactful readouts later this year. With that, let me turn it over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Despite a challenging environment in the first quarter, our commercial teams are positioned to capitalize on multiple near-term opportunities across the portfolio including product enhancements and launches of both new medicines and new indications for previously approved medicines.\nLooking to the future, as Stuart highlighted, our pipeline is poised to deliver the next wave of significant commercial opportunities that may provide innovate medicines to even more patients. Beginning with our first quarter results for EYLEA HD and EYLEA, combined U.S. net sales were $1.04 billion, down 30% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower wholesaler inventory levels for both products, which declined during the quarter to the normal range as well as continued competitive pressures in aggregate sequential physician unit demand for ELE HD and EYLEA declined by 11%.\nWe believe there was a significant negative impact in the branded anti-VEGF category due to an ongoing funding gap at nonprofit patient assistance foundations that provide copay support for eligible patients with retinal diseases. Consequently, low-cost off-label repackaged Avastin increased its anti-VEGF category share by approximately 6 percentage points to 32%.\nDespite these challenges, EYLEA HD and EYLEA captured 41% of the anti-VEGF category, maintaining market leadership. For the first quarter, EYLEA U.S. net sales were $736 million primarily due to lower wholesaler inventory levels, lower physician demand as well as increased competition. While we expect competitive pressures for EYLEA to persist, our focus remains on promoting the ongoing adoption of EYLEA HD, which has the potential to become the new standard of care.\nEYLEA HD was the only branded medicine in the anti-VEGF category to maintain U.S. net sales quarter-over-quarter, achieving $307 million and growing 54% year-over-year. In August, we anticipate potential FDA approvals of EYLEA HD in retinal vein occlusion and for every 4-week dosing across all approved indications. If approved in RVO, EYLEA HD would be the first and only treatment that can be dosed up to every 8 weeks, which is twice as long as any other product in the category.\nIn addition, with the potential approval of every 4-week dosing, EYLEA HD would offer physicians the most flexible dosing options in the category. With these label enhancements and anticipated approval of the prefilled syringe, we expect to see an acceleration in EYLEA HD demand. And now to DUPIXENT. In the first quarter, DUPIXENT achieved global net sales of $3.7 billion, representing a 20% year-over-year increase on a constant currency basis.\nIn the U.S., net sales grew 19% to $2.6 billion based on robust demand across all approved indications. In the first quarter, U.S. net price was unfavorably impacted by the annual reset of commercial insurance deductibles and the implementation of Medicare Part D redesign. DUPIXENT continues to live up to its potential to dramatically improve patients' lives with approvals in 7 indications, 4 of which have achieved blockbuster status globally.\nDUPIXENT's unique mechanism of action makes it the only medicine that addresses the underlying drivers of disease and treats multiple comorbid type 2 conditions. Despite increasing competition in established indications, DUPIXENT remains the market leader. In atopic dermatitis, increased promotional spend from competitors and accelerated market growth with DUPIXENT continuing to capture the vast majority of new patients.\nIn asthma, DUPIXENT continues to lead all biologics new-to-brand share and is now the category leader in total prescriptions. Momentum in new indications continues to build and COPD uptake is accelerating. Most pulmonologists have extensive experience in prescribing DUPIXENT for asthma and are increasingly prescribing it for COPD. Many have remarked on DUPIXENT's ability to reduce exacerbations, rapidly and meaningfully improve lotion and reduce the need for oxygen therapy with physician and patient awareness building and strong reimbursement established.\nThe COPD launch has outperformed all other DUPIXENT indication launches in cumulative new-to-brand prescriptions with the exception of atopic dermatitis. Earlier this month, DUPIXENT was approved to treat patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria or CSU, where we estimate there are more than 300,000 patients in U.S. with the disease inadequately controlled by antihistamines.\nDUPIXENT is the first new targeted treatment for CSU in over 10 years, providing a new treatment for patients that previously had limited options. The launch is underway and early feedback has been favorable. Our DUPIXENT team is also preparing for potential approval in bolus pemphigoid which would represent the fourth approval in a chronic and debilitating skin disease driven by type 2 inflammation.\nNearly 30,000 adults in the U.S. suffer from this difficult to treat condition where current care is limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. These treatments have core clinical efficacy as well as safety concerns, particularly in older patients. Improved DUPIXENT will be the first and only targeted medicine to treat this disease.\nIn summary, DUPIXENT is now firmly established as the standard of care across a range of type 2 conditions and has substantial growth opportunities in both existing and new indications. Turning now to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales grew 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $285 million, with U.S. net sales reaching $193 million, up 21%.\nFirst quarter results reflect typical seasonality dynamics and the timing of shipments and lower inventory levels and the U.S. demand continues to increase across both non-melanoma skin cancer indications and lung cancer and we are seeing growth in approved indications internationally. We look forward to the potential FDA approval of Libtayo for adjuvant treatment of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma where we estimate there are approximately 10,000 patients in the U.S. who may benefit from this treatment.\nOur oncology teams are excited about the potential to launch 2 new hematology products later this year. linvoseltamab in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and odronextamab in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, both have demonstrated best-in-class clinical profiles in these later-line settings. In summary, our commercial portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on many near-term growth opportunities enabling us to deliver more treatments to more patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristine Ann Poon\n\nIndependent Vice-Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board & Secretary, Koninklijke Philips N.V.\n\nThank you, Mario. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. First quarter 2025 total revenues were $3 billion, inclusive of higher Sanofi collaboration revenue driven by DUPIXENT growth and higher U.S. net sales of EYLEA HD compared to the prior year.\nFirst quarter diluted net income per share was $8.22 on net income of $928 million. Beginning with collaboration revenue, revenues from the Sanofi collaboration were approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 27% versus the prior year driven by volume growth for DUPIXENT and higher collaboration margins. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $180 million from the end of 2024.\nMoving to Bio. First quarter net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg outside the U.S. were $858 million, up 5% versus the prior year on a constant currency basis and inclusive of $146 million of EYLEA 8 mg sales. Total buyer collaboration revenue was $344 million, of which $317 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S.\nNow our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Modest growth versus the prior year was driven by continued investments to support Regeneron's innovative pipeline, including higher personnel expenses and clinical manufacturing costs. First quarter SG&A was $537 million down 8% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower general and administrative expenses, while selling expenses were flat year-over-year.\nThird quarter 2025 gross margin on net product sales was 85%. The lower gross margin versus the prior year reflects higher inventory write-offs in the first quarter of 2025 and a change in product mix. Our effective tax rate increased versus the prior year, primarily driven by a lower benefit from stock-based compensation deductions.\nRegeneron generated $816 million in free cash flow in the first quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $17.6 billion and debt of approximately $2.7 billion. We continue to monitor developments regarding pharmaceutical sector tariffs. While we do not expect previously enacted tariffs to have a material impact on our business, any potential impact from sector-specific tariffs is not quantifiable at this time due to uncertainty around the details of implementation.\nRegardless of any potential tariffs, Regeneron has always been committed to making significant investments in the United States to expand our manufacturing capabilities. We recently announced a new agreement with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies in North Carolina to invest over $3 billion to nearly double our U.S. large-scale manufacturing capacity.\nThis agreement, along with our $3.6 billion expansion of our Tarrytown, New York R&D and preclinical manufacturing facilities, our fill/finish facility in Rensselaer, New York and the acquisition of an additional property in Saratoga Springs, New York represent planned U.S. investments of over $7 billion. These investments will enable us to continue to grow in the U.S. and support our differentiated R&D engine while significantly increasing our ability to manufacture both clinical and commercial supply.\nBeyond these investments, we continue to return capital to shareholders in the first quarter, both through share repurchases and the payment of our recently initiated quarterly dividend. We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion worth of our shares in the first quarter with approximately $3.9 million remaining available for share repurchases as of March 31. We continue to see share repurchases as an efficient use of capital and remain opportunistic buyers of our shares. In addition to share repurchases, our newly initiated dividend program allows us increased flexibility to return capital to shareholders.\nWe paid our first quarterly dividend last month, and the Board of Directors has declared the next dividend of $0.88 per share, which will be paid in June. Finally, we have updated our 2025 gross margin guidance to be in the range of 86% to 87%. This change is primarily driven by higher-than-expected inventory write-offs in the first quarter. A full summary of our latest guidance can be found in our press release issued earlier this morning. In conclusion, Regeneron's strong position will allow us to continue to invest in our differentiated R&D capabilities and pipeline to deliver new medicines to patients and long-term value to shareholders. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nMatthew Thomas Holt\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nThank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Josh, can we go to the first question, please?",

Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We Regeneron capped 2024 with a strong fourth quarter, highlighted by 10% revenue growth, reflecting the strength and durability of our key franchises, primarily DUPIXENT, Libtayo and EYLEA, and EYLEA HD. 2024 was also a year in which we made significant investments across our broad pipeline, which yielded notable progress across several key programs. For my remarks today, I will review some of our key performance drivers, then briefly discuss a few of the more differentiated pipeline opportunities and calls with a few comments on capital allocation.\nAfter my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline. Marion will then review our commercial performance. And finally, Chris will detail our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 our guidance for the current year. To start, I would like to share my perspective on the current state of Regeneron. From the beginning, our focus has been on science and innovation, developing cutting-edge technology platforms that repeatedly yield scientific breakthroughs. These efforts have led to 13 products that have been approved or authorized worldwide, seven of which are driving revenue growth and hold significant future potential. Our approach has already delivered 5 blockbuster drugs, a leading pipeline of approximately product candidates across various therapeutic areas and a world-class DNA sequence linked health care database, providing us with unparalleled insights into key drivers of disease.\nAt the JPMorgan conference last month, we detailed 10 differentiated mid- and late pipeline opportunities that could collectively address a total market opportunity of over $220 billion. Given these opportunities, the strength of our early-stage pipeline and our turnkey technology platforms, we have never been more confident in Regeneron's future and we are incredibly excited about what lies ahead. Moving to our quarterly results. DUPIXENT continues to be a transformative medicine, with over 1 million patients on treatment around the world across 7 approved indications.\nIn the U.S., DUPIXENT remains the leader in new-to-brand prescription share across all of its approved indications and continues to be well positioned for future growth given the potential for further penetration in approved indications, the ongoing launch in COPD, and potential 2025 launches in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bolus tempogoid. Regarding the ongoing launch in COPD, where DUPIXENT is the first and only biologic approved, we and our partner, Sanofi, have made great progress securing broad payer coverage and reimbursement, positioning us to drive uptake over the course of this year and beyond.\nEYLEA HD and EYLEA continued to lead the anti-VEGF category, and our commercial efforts remain focused on driving EYLEA HD uptake while preserving share for EYLEA in an increasingly competitive category. Over the course of this year, we expect continued competitive pressure on EYLEA while strengthening the profile of EYLEA HD by offering a more convenient prefilled syringe administration, broadening its label to include macular edema following retinal vein occlusion or RVO, and adding more dosing flexibility, including every 4-week dosing as well as extended dosing intervals of up to every 24 weeks for certain indications.\nWith these anticipated label enhancements, EYLEA HD will offer the broader set of retinal disease indications with the greatest dose and flexibility of any product in the inter VEGF category, positioning it to become the new standard of care in the category. And we anticipate these enhancements will lead to acceleration in EYLEA HD uptake starting in the second half of this year. The Turner became Regeneron's latest blockbuster product in 2024, and we are looking to build on that by expanding shared metastatic non-melanoma skin cancers, along with making further inroads in lung cancer. We also plan to seek regulatory approval for high-risk adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, a setting in which KEYTRUDA failed and over the longer term, could represent a blockbuster opportunity globally in and of itself.\nMoving to our pipeline and focusing on the upcoming year. We expect regulatory approvals for limboseltomab in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, ogenextamab, in late line follicular lymphoma and the aforementioned entire indication in adjuvant CSCC. In addition, we expect to read out pivotal or proof of concept data this year from several other programs including our pivotal Arif studies for itepekimab our IL-33 antibody in former smokers with COPD. Pivotal data for the fianlimab-Lubtyo combination in first-line metastatic mylaloma are also anticipated in 2024. We also expect pivotal data for our C5 antibody siRNA combination and generalized myasthenia gravis . Finally, we expect to learn more about our potential opportunity to improve the quality of weight loss in obese patients on semiglutide by blocking myostatin and Activin A. George will soon discuss these programs in more detail and provide updates on many of the other programs in our broad and differentiated pipeline.\nFinally, regarding capital allocation, this morning, we are pleased to announce the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program and an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization, increasing our total current buyback capacity to approximately $4.5 billion. These decisions reflect our Board and managers ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders, but this does not change the core of our capital allocation framework. Importantly, our dividend will not impact the way we plan to heavily invest in our business and pipeline going forward does not impair our ability to business development in the future, and we anticipate that share repurchase will remain the primary means of returning capital to shareholders. However, initiating the dividend reflects our continued confidence in the future cash flows from our business, provides more balance to our approach to capital returns, gives us flexibility in how we return capital in the future and expands the pool of potential Regeneron's shareholders to include funds with a dividend mandate.\nIn closing, Regeneron remains in a very strong position scientifically, commercially and financially, enabling us to invest heavily in R&D and deliver tremendous innovation from our pipeline, maximize the growth opportunities from our in-line brands, initiated quarterly dividend and significantly increased our capacity to repurchase shares. We look forward to keeping you updated in these innovations throughout 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Len. At last month's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, we showcased our robust R&D efforts and the promising opportunities within our pipeline that have the potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine across several different disease areas. This year holds the potential to be transformative for Regeneron as we hope to capitalize on several of our scientific and technological breakthroughs. We anticipate reporting pivotal or proof-of-concept data from multiple programs across diverse therapeutic areas, including in oncology, COPD and obesity, while also rapidly advancing our Factor XI antibodies to multiple Phase III trials.\nThese programs represent significant opportunities for Regeneron to address substantial unmet needs across large commercial categories positioning Regeneron for long-term growth. Let me highlight some of these opportunities and recent pipeline advancements. Starting with EYLEA HD. In December, we and Bayer reported positive data from the Phase III QUASAR study in retinal vein occlusion, where EYLEA HD demonstrated non-inferior vision gains within every 8-week dosing regimen compared to the standard of care 2-milligram EYLEA dosed every 4 weeks. Additionally, approximately 90% of our LHD patients we're able to maintain 8-week dosing intervals throughout the 36 weeks. These data, together with our recently presented long-term follow-up data from the PULSAR and PHOTON studies in wet AMD and DME, respectively, continue to support EYLEA HD's best-in-class clinical profile.\nWe remain on track to submit a supplementary BLA for this indication later in the first quarter. We also plan to seek approval from the FDA to potentially include every 4-week dosing, maximizing EYLEA's HD's dosing flexibility for physicians. Along with the submission for a prefilled syringe and the potential FDA approval in April to extend dosing intervals to up to 24 weeks, the longest intervals in the category, EYLEA HD is set to provide the greatest dosing flexibility across the broadest indication set of any anti-VEGF therapy, all in a convenient prefilled syringe. Next, immunology and starting with DUPIXENT. In November, DUPIXENT was approved in Europe to treat eosinophilic esophagitis in children as young as 1 year old, making it the first and only medicine indicated for these young patients in the U.S. and the European Union and further highlighting Dupixent's exceptional safety profile.\nThe supplementary BLA resubmission for chronic spontaneous urticaria was recently accepted by the FDA with a target action date of April 18, potentially making it the first new target therapy for CSU in a decade. Finally, our supplementary BLA was submitted for bullous pemphigoid late last year, marking another first as DUPIXENT is the only biologic to achieve significant improvements in disease remission and symptoms for this indication. While Marion will discuss the ongoing launch of DUPIXENT and COPD, I want to remind you of another potentially significant opportunity in COPD with itepekimab, our interleukin-33 antibody discovered by Regeneron. We anticipate reporting pivotal results in former smokers from the RF program in the second half of this year, partially over oping and distinct population from that treated with DUPIXENT.\nAs part of our long-term commitment to improving the lives of patients with allergic conditions, I would also like to highlight the compelling initial data from our ongoing DUPIXENT plus lymboceltimib trial for severe fruit allergy. These 2 agents have the potential to eliminate immunoglobulin E or IgE, the key driver allergic reactions and prevent IgE for returning, thereby reversing severe allergies. Last month, we shared initial clinical data from the first patient in our proof-of-concept study, which showed greater than 90% reductions in both total and food specific IgE levels following initial treatments at low doses. This trial is continuing to enroll patients, and we plan to provide updates throughout 2025.\nTurning now to oncology, where we continue to break new ground. Last month, we announced positive data for Libtayo in high-risk adjuvant CSCC, becoming the first immunotherapy to show a benefit in this high-risk population. At the first prespecified interim analysis for disease-free survival adjuvant Libtayo demonstrated a 68% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death compared to placebo, with no new safety signals identified. This is the same setting in which Merck reported last year that KEYTRUDA had failed, highlighting that antibodies even within the same class, do not always produce the same treatment effect. We plan to submit these data to the FDA in the first half of 2025 and present these results at a medical meeting later this year. This data set reinforces our belief that Libtayo provides a best-in-class foundation for combinations with our other oncology assets.\nData from early clinical trials in melanoma suggests that [indiscernible] our LAG-3 antibody, when combined with Libtayo might be the first combination to demonstrate meaningful additive benefit compared to PD-1 monotherapy without exacerbating safety. This combination is being studied in an ongoing randomized Phase III trial versus KEYTRUDA monotherapy in first-line metastatic melanoma, with results expected in the second half of this year. If these data confirm best-in-class activity in melanoma, it will increase our confidence for this combination in other cancer settings. Turning to our CD3 bispecifics. We are pleased to announce that we have recently resubmitted the BLA for linvoseltamab, or BCMA by CD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma following the resolution of third-party manufacturing issues. Linvoseltamab has the potential to be the best-in-class BCMA by CD3 bispecific due to its differentiated clinical profile, dosing and administration with nearly double the reported complete response rates at similar duration of follow-up.\nGiven the strength of the data in late lines of therapy, including the observed level of efficacy and favorable safety profile of lumoseltimab, we are pursuing a differentiated approach in earlier lines of therapy emphasizing monotherapy and novel limited combination approaches. For odronextamab, our CD20 x CD3 bispecific we are pleased to announce that we have resubmitted the BLA for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma where odronextamab has also demonstrated potentially best-in-class efficacy, and we expect an FDA decision in the second half of 2025. In December, at the American Society of Hematology meeting, we presented initial results from the safety lead-in portion of the confirmatory Phase III OLYMPIA trial. Odronextamab monotherapy delivered complete responses in all 12 patients evaluable for efficacy with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. As a reminder, the standard of care regimen in this setting, rituximab plus chemotherapy has historically achieved complete responses in approximately 67% of patients.\nBased on this impressive monotherapy efficacy for odronextamab in both late line and first-line patients we are once again exploring a differentiated program in early lines of therapy, highlighted our head-to-head evaluation of odronextamab monotherapy compared to Rituxan plus chemotherapy in our Phase II OLYMPIA 1 trial, which has already achieved over 40% enrollment. Our CD28 costimulatory bispecifics for solid tumors are also progressing. We're working to mitigate safety concerns related to their combination with PD-1 blockade while prioritizing combination with CD3 bispecifics. The science suggests that this approach may enhance efficacy with fewer immune-mediated adverse events. We will provide updates on these innovative combinations later this year.\nMoving now to a rapidly advancing Factor XI program. We're employing a two-pronged approach to anticoagulation that offers a potential for improved blood prevention and lower bleeding risk supported by genetic data from the Regeneron Genetics Center our approach has delivered 2 antibodies with unique profile to meet different market needs. Regeneron 708, which targets the catalytic domain of Factor XI may provide improved efficacy compared to standard of care options. Offering patients who need significant anticoagulation activity, a potentially more effective option. On the other hand, ReGeN-9933, which targets the 2 domain is expected to carry a lower risk of bleeding. Potentially making it a viable option for patients with the highest bleeding risk who would otherwise not be candidates for currently available anticoagulants.\nLate this year, we reported positive proof-of-concept data with the prevention of venous thromboebulism following total knee replacement with both antibodies demonstrating robust antiserobotic effects, Regeneron 7508 was superior to enoxaparin and non-inferior pixaban, while ReGen-9933 was numerically better than [ enoxaparin. ] These data support the advancement of both antibodies into broad pivotal programs across multiple indications and patient types with initial Phase III studies expected to begin enrolling this year. Moving briefly to obesity, where we are progressing early clinical programs and an expansive pipeline of preclinical assets. Our muscle-sparing Phase II COURAGE study is investigating the addition of tezivogrimab to semaglutide with and without garatizumab to improve the quality of weight loss and evaluate the maintenance of weight loss after discontinuing semaglutide. This trial is fully enrolled with data expected in the second half of the year.\nMoving to our Regeneron Genetics medicine pipeline, starting with our differentiated siRNA plus antibody approach. We have a potential to address multiple complement-mediated diseases. In December, at the ASH Annual Meeting, we presented compelling updated results from an exploratory cohort in our Phase III program for paroxysmal lateral hemoglobin urea. Our combination achieved greater disease control compared to the standard current of care, ravulizumab and only our combination lowered mean LDH levels to the normal range. When ravulizumab patients were switched to our combination, their mean LDH levels, which remained higher than normal, also became normalized. We are also evaluating this combination in generalized myasthenia gravis with pivotal results expected in the second half of this year.\nIn addition, we recently initiated our Phase III program exploring this combination in geographic atrophy in dry age-related macrodegeneration where we believe our systemic approach has several advantages over currently approved intravitreal agents. For DB-OTO, our autoferilin gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss, we announced data last month from the ongoing clinical program, [ DB ] OTO is an AAV-based dual vector gene therapy delivered to the inner ear to enable hearing and children suffering from profound genetic hearing deficit. We reported that 10 out of 11 treated children with at least one post-treatment assessment showed a notable increase in hearing with some reaching the normal range. We look forward to continuing to share additional data later this year. Regarding our collaboration with [indiscernible] , we are advancing several new siRNA CNS programs, including synuclein for Parkinson's and tau for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases with trials initiating later this year.\nAnd finally, I would like to highlight 2 recent advances that extend our leadership position in the field of structured big data that will be necessary to allow computational approaches to revolutionize the health care industry. Over the past decade, we have become the leader in high-throughput human DNA sequencing, enabling us to create the world's largest G&A sequence linked health care database, encompassing nearly 3 million individuals, all with DNA sequence linked to de-identified health care records. We are now emerging also as the leaders in high-throughput proteomics, as reflected by the selection of the Regeneron Genetic Center to generate the proteomics data for the U.K. Biobank pharma proteomics project, building on our previous selection to provide the sequence data for the U.K. Biobank.\nImportantly, our new strategic collaboration with Truveta is expected to dramatically expand our database to include up to an additional 10 million individuals from Truveta's network of leading U.S. health system with the opportunity to generate both DNA sequence and proteomics information. While our leadership position in this big data space has already proven invaluable for our drug discovery and development efforts we believe it can ultimately help us contribute to revolutionizing the field of health care analytics and management. In summary, I have never been more excited about the future of Regeneron and our potential to transform the practice of medicine and revolutionize the health care industry.\nOur pipeline is more innovative and exciting than ever, and we anticipate several pivotal or proof-of-concept data readouts throughout 2025, positioning Regeneron for long-term success. Let me now turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Regeneron's fourth quarter performance demonstrates our ongoing leadership across therapeutic categories. Our commercial team is well positioned to optimize our 2025 growth opportunities driven by new indications, new product enhancements and new product approvals. Turning to fourth quarter results, starting with EYLEA HD and EYLEA. In January, we announced combined fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.5 billion for EYLEA HD and EYLEA capturing over 46% of the total anti-VEGF category.\nFor the full year, net product sales grew by 1.4% to approximately $6 billion despite increasing competition in the category. EYLEA HD net sales were $305 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year, representing 20% of the combined net sales for LHD and EYLEA. Fourth quarter net sales for EYLEA HD were affected by elevated wholesaler inventory levels at the end of Q3, which were absorbed over the course of the fourth quarter. In 2025, our team is laser-focused on growing EYLEA HD adoption. Physicians tell us that EYLEA HD has the potential to be the new standard of care for retinal diseases and several catalysts occurring this year will put us in a position to grow our competitive share. The team is ready to launch the prefilled syringe and our 2-year label updates, both of which are anticipated to occur in the second quarter.\nPhysicians easily await the prefilled syringe, which has been described as being changing by clinical trial participants. Further, our 2-year long-term follow-up data from the Pulsar photon studies in wet AMD and DME, respectively, clearly illustrate EYLEA HD's ability to extend dosing beyond any other competitor in the anti-VEGF category. Two other potential FDA approvals are also expected later this year, the RVO indication and additional dosing flexibility. In RVO clinical trials, EYLEA HD dosing could be extended to every 12 weeks following loading doses making it the only medicine with durability beyond 4 weeks and also the only medicine to show a numeric improvement and vision for RVO patients compared to EYLEA dosed every 4 weeks.\nIn terms of additional dosing flexibility across all of our approved indications, we look forward to the potential FDA approval of every 4-week dosing for the subset of patients who need it which would mean EYLEA HD has the most flexible dosing schedule of any anti-VEGF medicine. Fourth quarter EYLEA net sales were $1.2 billion, primarily driven by persistent physician demand in spite of a recent aflibercept 2-milligram biosimilar launch, wholesale inventory levels were elevated at the end of the fourth quarter, and we expect EYLEA net sales will be negatively impacted in the first quarter of 2025 as this increase in inventory is absorbed. We also expect ongoing market dynamics will put downward pressure on EYLEA business. We continue supporting existing and new patients who benefit from EYLEA while prioritizing uptake of EYLEA HD, which has the clinical profile to potentially become the new standard of care in the anti-VEGF category.\nTurning now to Libtayo, which achieved blockbuster status in 2024 with global net sales of $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter, global net sales grew by 50% year-over-year to $367 million with U.S. net sales reaching $251 million. Libtayo's strong performance was based on growth in non-melanoma skin cancers and steady gains in lung cancer. Looking forward, we eagerly await the submission and potential approval of Libtayo in high-risk adjuvant CSCC beginning in the U.S., where we estimate there are approximately 10,000 patients who may benefit from treatment. And next to DUPIXENT, which continues to deliver exceptional results in type 2 inflammatory diseases, approved in 7 indications worldwide, more than 1 million patients are currently benefiting from DUPIXENT treatment. Three of these indications, atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps have achieved blockbuster status each generating over $1 billion in annual net sales.\nIn the fourth quarter, DUPIXENT worldwide net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $3.7 billion with increasing volume across all indications, age groups and geographies. In the U.S., net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, driven by a 24% increase in total prescriptions including the recent COPD launch. As Sanofi noted, fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by onetime items. We continue to see broad growth across all blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps, despite new entrants and atopic dermatitis, DUPIXENT continues to be first choice for physicians who now understand that IL-4 and IL-13 are crucial drivers of type 2 inflammation. Additionally, there is robust uptake in our recent U.S. launches for cenozoic esophagitis, [ Pragagilaris, ] with current trends suggesting that these indications will likely also achieve blockbuster status. We are off to a promising start in COPD, following approvals in more than 30 countries.\nIn the U.S., the FDA approved DUPIXENT in September of last year, and we are very encouraged by our progress in early market adoption Together with our partner, Sanofi, we've made significant strides in securing U.S. access and reimbursement for commercial and Medicare patients. At the start of this year, nearly 85% of commercial patients and nearly 90% of Medicare patients have coverage Additionally, we are pleased that global gold treatment guidelines for COPD now include DUPIXENT as the only recommended biologic medicine for these patients. We look forward to accelerating the launch of this important indication and to make a significant difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of COPD patients worldwide. Our teams are also preparing for a potential April launch in chronic spontaneous urticaria pending FDA approval, we believe DUPIXENT offers a compelling treatment option and if approved, would be the first new targeted therapy in the U.S. in over a decade for the estimated 300,000 CSU patients.\nIn conclusion, we continued to deliver solid performance across our commercial portfolio in the fourth quarter. We also see significant growth opportunities in 2025 and beyond with near- and medium-term catalysts to drive growth. With that, I'll turn the call to Chris.\n\nChristopher R. Fenimore\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2024 with strong financial performance in the fourth quarter, delivering growth on both the top and bottom line. Total revenues grew 10% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting higher Sanofi collaboration revenue driven by DUPIXENT growth and strong global net sales growth for Libtayo and modest growth for combined net sales of EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the U.S. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $12.07 on net income of $1.4 billion, up 2% from the prior year.\nOn a full year basis, total revenues were $14.2 billion, representing growth of 10% when excluding revenues from Ronapreve. 2024 earnings per share grew 4% from the prior year to $45.2. Turning to collaboration revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenues from the Sanofi collaboration were $1.2 billion, of which $1 billion related to our share of collaboration profits. Regeneron's share of profits grew 18% versus the prior year driven by volume growth for DUPIXENT and higher collaboration margins. For the year, our share of profit, net of development balance reimbursement increased to the highest level since initiation of the collaboration, reaching approximately 20% of of total antibody net sales. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $1.6 billion at the end of 2024, reflecting a reduction of approximately $175 million from the end of the third quarter and approximately $700 million from the end of 2023.\nWe continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed by the end of 2026 which is expected to result in a significant increase in Sanofi collaboration revenue and cash flow thereafter. Moving to Bayer. Fourth quarter ex U.S. net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8 mg were $888 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total buyer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $349 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S. Now to our operating expenses. R&D expense was $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase in R&D expense versus the prior year was driven by cost to support advancement of Regeneron's broad clinical pipeline, including our C5 and Factor XI programs in hematology, certain oncology programs, itepekimab in COPD and our ongoing program in obesity.\nFourth quarter SG&A was $681 million, with growth from the prior year, primarily reflecting investments to support the launch of EYLEA HD and our international expansion. Fourth quarter 2024 gross margin on net product sales was 86%, up slightly from the prior year quarter. Now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $3.7 billion in free cash flow in 2024 and ended the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $15.2 billion. In 2024, we deployed $2.6 billion towards share repurchases, including a meaningful step-up in the fourth quarter, during which we repurchased nearly $1 billion of our shares. Consistent with our capital allocation framework, we are investing heavily in our R&D capabilities to drive long-term growth, exploring business development opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.\nThis morning, we announced an additional share repurchase authorization of $3 billion, increasing our capacity for repurchases to approximately $4.5 billion as of today. In addition, we are enhancing our approach to returning capital to shareholders. As announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized the initiation of a quarterly dividend with the first dividend payable on March 20 and to shareholders of record as of February 20. The dividend will be $0.88 per share, equivalent to $3.52 per share on an annual basis. We are confident in the long-term growth of our business, our innovative R&D engine, our differentiated pipeline and the durability of our cash flows, all of which support the initiation of our first quarterly dividend and the announcement of an additional share repurchase authorization.\nI'll conclude with a review of our 2025 financial guidance. We expect 2025 R&D spend to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.2 billion. The increase versus 2024 is driven by cost to support our expanding late-stage pipeline including Phase III programs for our Factor XI antibodies and hemoc bispecifics as well as programs in obesity and genetic medicines and the advancement of multiple new assets into the clinic. We expect 2025 SG&A to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.7 billion, representing 3% growth at the midpoint of this range versus 2024, driven by investments to support multiple potential oncology launches. We expect our gross margin on net product sales to be in the range of 87% to 88%. This guidance reflects a change in product mix as well as ongoing start-up costs for our new fill/finish facility and investments to drive future efficiencies across our manufacturing network.\nWe expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.15 billion in 2025 and primarily driven by higher Dupixent volumes. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs as revenue, making them generally neutral to net income. We expect 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $85 million to $975 million, primarily related to ongoing expansion of the R&D facilities at our Tarrytown headquarters and investments to increase both manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and Ireland to support our expanding pipeline. Finally, we expect our 2025 effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. In summary, Regeneron delivered solid financial results in 2024 and our strong financial position and prudent capital allocation enables Regeneron to deliver long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A to ensure we were able to address as many questions as possible. We will answer only one question from each caller before moving to the next. Towanda, can you go to the first question, please?",

Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call.\nRegeneron continued its track record of strong execution, highlighted by double-digit revenue and earning growth in the second quarter, along with important advances across our broad pipeline. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of the key performance drivers for the quarter and then discuss near-term pipeline opportunities. After my remarks, George will provide further updates on our pipeline; Marian will then review our commercial performance and finally, Chris will detail our quarterly financial results and discuss updates to our full year guidance.\nSecond quarter 2024 total revenues grew 12% to $3.55 billion, primarily driven by sales of EYLEA HD in the United States; higher Sanofi collaboration revenues, reflecting the continued strong performance of DUPIXENT; as well as robust growth for LIBTAYO. EYLEA HD generated $304 million in its third full quarter on the U.S. markets and continues to outperform recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Net product sales for EYLEA HD and EYLEA combined were $1.53 billion, representing a 2.3% growth compared to the prior year.\nWe are encouraged that despite increased competition in the anti-VEGF space, we have achieved a strong EYLEA HD launch trajectory while maintaining our category leading combined EYLEA HD and EYLEA market share of 45%. Our efforts to bring an EYLEA HD pre-filled syringe United States market, we made a high priority and we're tracking towards a potential pre-filled syringe launch by early 2025. In summary, we'll continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal diseases based on its differentiated clinical profile, coupled with strong familiarity and satisfaction among retinal specialists.\nDUPIXENT global revenues grew 29% on a constant currency basis to $3.65 billion, reflecting string growth across all approved indications, age groups and geographies. In June, the European Commission approved DUPIXENT for COPD in patients with raised blood eosinophils, marking the first global regulatory approval for DUPIXENT in COPD. This approval enables DUPIXENT to address the approximately 220,000 eosinophilic COPD patients in the EU that are currently uncontrolled on maximal inhaled triple therapy.\nThe approval also represents the first biologic approved to treat this disease. We continue to work with the FDA regarding its ongoing review for this indication and expect their decision by the September 27th PDUFA date. We, and our partner Sanofi, are prepared for a U.S. launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients have been eagerly anticipating. There is a high unmet need in COPD with tag to inflammation, with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States. And our potential launch represents a significant driver for DUPIXENT's continued growth.\nLIBTAYO global net product sales were $297 million in the second quarter, an increase of 43% on a constant currency basis. Despite intense competition, LIBTAYO has maintained its leadership position in non-melanoma skin cancers while making impressive inroads in non-small cell lung cancer. We are also pleased with the progress we have made in establishing an international commercial footprint to support LIBTAYO and other future products following our purchase of full global rights to LIBTAYO from Sanofi in mid-2022.\nRegarding LINVOSELTAMAB--a BCMAxCD3 bispecific for relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma--during its review of the LINVOSELTAMAB BLA, the FDA informed us that the third-party fill-finish manufacturer for LINVOSELTAMAB had unresolved findings from approval inspection for another company's product candidate. While we now believe these findings have been resolved, a re-inspection will be required and therefore, we anticipate that a potential FDA approval for LINVOSELTAMAB is likely to be delayed beyond the August 22nd PDUFA date.\nThe FDA has not informed us of any approvability issues for LINVOSELTAMAB related to safety, efficacy or the status of our ongoing confirmatory trial. While broadly on our pipeline, we are excited about several upcoming readouts later this year or in 2025, to further inform programs that could support significant long-term growth opportunities--which George will discuss in a moment.\nIn closing, our pipeline continues to generate innovative and differentiated opportunities and now has over 35 programs in clinical development, spanning several distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team is executing well with our in-market products and is building momentum in competitive categories. Finally, we continue to prudently deploy capital with the goal of delivering long-term value to shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Yancopoulos\n\nThank you, Len. Starting with DUPIXENT, regarding COPD, data from our second confirmatory trial notice was featured as a late-breaking presentation at the American Thoracic Society Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In NOTUS, DUPIXENT reduced exacerbations by 34% while significantly improving lung function, confirming the unprecedented results from the previously reported Phase III BOREAS trial. Based on data from NOTUS and BOREAS, DUPIXENT was recently approved by the European regulatory authorities for eosinophilic COPD patients uncontrolled on maximal standard of care inhaled therapy. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world, including in the U.S., China and Japan.\nBeyond COPD, later this year, we are looking forward to data readouts from Phase III studies of DUPIXENT in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. Seven years after its initial FDA approval and with approval in seven different indications around the world, DUPIXENT continues to deliver potential new approvals for additional important disease indications.\nRegarding our small pilot study to potentially eliminate severe food allergies using our innovative approach that combines DUPIXENT and LINVOSELTAMAB--our BSMA xCD3 bispecific--we continue to expect to see initial data by the end of this year. On ITEPEKIMAB, our IL-33 antibody in development for certain COPD patients, our two Phase III studies are now fully enrolled. Study readouts and regulatory submissions for our second therapeutic candidate for this devastating disease are expected in the second half of next year.\nMoving to oncology and starting with FIANLIMAB, our LAG-3 antibody, in combination with LIBTAYO. At the upcoming ESMO meeting in September, we look forward to presenting longer term follow up on the metastatic melanoma cohorts for our first in-human study. Responses have continued to deepen with the proportion of complete responders and median progression-free survival continuing to improve. These results strengthen our view that FIANLIMAB and LIBTAYO may be the most promising immunotherapy combination in clinical development.\nAs we recently announced, we are looking forward to the Phase III readout in this melanoma setting next year, which could position FIANLIMAB and LIBTAYO as a new standard of care in melanoma and eventually, potentially, other cancer settings. Additionally, we hope to gain insights into the anti-tumor activity of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer later this year. We're also advancing FIANLIMAB development to earlier lines of therapy, with proof of concepts in perioperative non-small cell lung cancer and perioperative melanoma now underway, with additional indications likely to follow.\nOn to bispecifics with solid tumors. Our costimulatory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with LIBTAYO. At the ASCO Conference, we presented the results for our EGFRxCD20 bispecific in combination with LIBTAYO in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy, EGFRxCD20 in combination with LIBTAYO demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity with an overall response rate of 20% in patients without liver metastases.\nRegarding safety, to date, we have not observed severe immuno-related adverse events with this agent in our recommended Phase II dose. Dose expansion cohorts testing EGFRxCD20 plus LIBTAYO continue to enroll in various solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGFR mutations, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and others.\nOn to our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, which has already demonstrated promising activity in late-line prostate cancer when combined with LIBTAYO. We have now initiated combination treatment of our PSMAxCD28 costim bispecific with our PSMAxCD3 bispecific, which based on pre-clinical studies, may maintain efficacy observed with the LIBTAYO combination but may improve the safety and tolerability profile. We're also testing PSMAxCD28 in other cancers. Next, to our bispecifics for hematology/oncology.\nLINVOSELTAMAB, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, at an oral presentation at the European Hematologic Association Conference, we presented updated pivotal data which continued to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma, in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing as well as hospitalization burden. As we expected, responses continued to deepen with longer follow up. At 14-month median follow up of 117 patients, 50% achieved a complete response or better within objective overall response rate of 71%.\nAdditional studies of LINVOSELTAMAB are now also underway in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or MGUS. Developing LINVOSELTAMAB in earlier-line myeloma settings presents an important opportunity for us to help patients and their physicians in these diseases, which currently have complex treatment paradigms.\nTouching on our non-oncology/hematology pipeline. As highlighted previously, later this year, we are anticipating proof of concept results for our two Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. The study for the antibody which targets the Factor XI A2 domain is now fully enrolled and we expect to present results at a medical meeting in the second half of this year.\nInterim Phase II results for our second Factor XI antibody, which targets the catalytic domain are expected by the end of this year for internal analysis. We have also started an additional proof of concept study to further evaluate the two antibodies' profile for thrombosis prevention in patients who have a peripherally-inserted catheter. Results of these studies will inform whether to proceed to registrational studies with one or both of these antibodies by next year.\nMoving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address the potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP and GLP receptor agonists. As has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents unfortunately can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning in older obese patients. Our myostatin antibody, when combined with semaglutide--with or without our anti-activin A antibody--may protect against this muscle loss, as previously demonstrated in non-human primates.\nPart A of our COURAGE Phase II study testing a higher dose of TREVOGRUMAB, our myostatin antibody, in healthy subjects has now been successfully completed with now new safety signals identified. Part B of the study, which evaluates our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide in obese participants has started enrolling patients. Assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we continue to expect to report top-line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass, by the second half of 2025.\nI will conclude with our genetics medicines efforts. At the ASGCT conference, we presented updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss due to mutations of the otoferlin gene. The first child treated with this therapy, an 11-month old girl who was profoundly deaf at baseline, had hearing in the normal range by 24 weeks after treatment. Also, initial hearing improvements were observed in a second child, dosed at 4 years of age at a six-week of assessment, with additional follow up plan. As of July, we have dosed five patients in our study and we are on track to enroll several patients more this year. We also look forward to bringing additional otoferlin gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years, with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss.\nRegarding our Intellia collaboration, transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy--the world's first Phase III program for an in vivo CRISPR-based therapy--is enrolling in a rapid pace, indicating considerable interest from investigators and patients. In addition, we are also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene, in vivo, for a deficiency disease--hemophilia B. As noted previously, we've enrolled initial patients in lead-in portion of this trial and first patient should be dosed soon.\nOur siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver but also, for the first time, for siRNA in the brain. This opens up opportunities for us to go after other disease-causing genes in the brain. A study of ALN-SOD in ALS patients with SOD1 mutations recently initiated. Other CNS direct to siRNA programs are expected to enter the clinic shortly, including targeting HTT for Huntington's disease, synuclein for Parkinson's and tau for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.\nAdditionally, with regard to our C5 program, our innovative approach involving the first combination of an antibody together with an siRNA, both targeting the same molecule, is progressing well and we are expecting to present updated data for our initial potential indication, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, by the end of this year. We are also looking forward to starting our Phase III program in geographic atrophy in the second half of this year. In summary, we will continue to drive forward our innovative development pipeline and anticipate reading out several pivotal and proof of concept data sets over the next 12 to 18 months. Our early research efforts continue to be productive, with multiple novel programs potentially advancing to the clinic over that same time frame.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion McCourt\n\nSenior Vice President & Head-Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Our second quarter commercial results further solidify Regeneron's leadership across therapeutic categories. Our performance demonstrates the ongoing strength and diversity of our product portfolio, with continued growth opportunities powered by existing and upcoming product in indication launches across multiple geographies. I'll start with EYLEA HD and EYLEA in the U.S. In the second quarter, combined net sales for both medicines grew 2.3% year-over-year to $1.53 billion.\nEYLEA continues its clear category leadership while EYLEA HD remained the fastest-growing medicine in this highly competitive category. EYLEA HD continued its launch momentum in the second quarter, delivering net product sales of $304 million, which represents 52% sequential growth. EYLEA HD continues to be the fastest launch of any anti-VEGF therapy since EYLEA more than a decade ago and the trajectory confirms a significant transition to EYLEA HD is underway. The breadth and depth of EYLEA HD prescribing continues to grow with utilization across a broad range of patients, including the treatment-naive population--which has doubled since last quarter.\nPhysicians are also increasingly switching patients to EYLEA HD from other anti-VEGF treatments based on their positive early treatment experiences. In these switch patients, early real-world data indicate that treatment intervals are being extended with EYLEA HD. EYLEA HD's durability, along with the same trusted efficacy, visual acuity and safety as EYLEA, represents a meaningful improvement for patient lives in greater efficiency for physician practices. The number of physician offices ordering EYLEA HD during the second quarter increased by more than 50% compared to the prior quarter.\nWe believe this suggests prescriber confidence in EYLEA HD's clinical profile, as well as in reimbursement now that the permanent J-code has been well-established. Of note, we recognize the importance of providing physicians with a pre-filled syringe option, and as Len mentioned, we're excited about our anticipated EYLEA HD prefilled syringe launch. In summary, we're pleased with our second quarter performance for EYLEA HD and EYLEA and remain on track to achieve our goal of establishing EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal disease.\nNext is DUPIXENT, which delivered 29% growth in the second quarter on a constant currency basis, with global net sales of $3.56 billion. We are approaching the important milestone of 1 million patients on DUPIXENT worldwide. In addition, there's substantial opportunity for even more patients to benefit from DUPIXENT, based on significant unmet need across indications, ages and geographies. In the U.S., net sales grew 24% to $2.61 billion, driven by an increased demand across all five approved indications.\nDUPIXENT continues its number one leadership position and new-to-brand prescriptions across all approved indications. Our commercial team remains laser-focused on pursuing initiatives that drive patient awareness and support prescribing. We continue to see increasing penetration in our blockbuster indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Additionally, recent launches in eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis are exceeding our expectations and new patient initiations are steadily increasing.\nWe hear remarkable stories of patients as young as one year of age with EoE, who are now thriving on DUPIXENT following its approval in January of this year. The European Commission also recently approved DUPIXENT in COPD patients with raised blood eosinophils, with patients already getting treatment in Germany. We all recognize that there's significant unmet need worldwide among patients with this debilitating disease and DUPIXENT represents the first biologic medicine for COPD.\nOur U.S. team is ready for the anticipated FDA approval of DUPIXENT in COPD by late September and estimate approximately 300,000 U.S. patients may benefit from DUPIXENT and its indications. Separately, an FDA decision for DUPIXENT in adolescents with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps is expected next month. As George mentioned, there are two DUPIXENT Phase III programs reading out later this year in chronic spontaneous urticaria and bullous pemphigoid. If data from these trials are positive, DUPIXENT has the potential to support even more patients with unmet need.\nWe also made significant progress with LIBTAYO in the second quarter, with global net sales of $297 million, up 43% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Strong commercial execution resulted in market share gains across both skin and lung cancers. In the U.S., net sales grew 40% to $182 million, with growth across all market segments and indications. In non-melanoma skin cancer, we continue to extend LIBTAYO leadership with increasing demand in market share. In lung cancer, LIBTAYO is recognized by physicians as an important therapy for their lung cancer patients and continues to gradually gain market share.\nOutside the U.S., our teams are delivering excellent results with net product sales of $115 million, as Regeneron continues its international expansion. LIBTAYO net product sales in some of these international markets were favorably impacted by approximately 15 million of stocking purchases. Our oncology team is also eagerly the potential FDA and EU decisions for LINVOSELTAMAB in late-stage myeloma. We believe LINVOSELTAMAB represent a best-in-class opportunity and we look forward to potential launch.\nIn summary, our commercial team continues to deliver on our goal to provide Regeneron medicines to even more patients worldwide. There's meaningful growth potential within our approved indications and our robust pipeline provides both near and long-term opportunities to advance patient care.\nWith that. I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Fenimore\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.\nRegeneron delivered strong double-digit top and bottom line growth in the second quarter. Total revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, primarily driven by strong execution of the ongoing EYLEA HD launch in the U.S., higher Sanofi collaboration revenue and continued global sales growth from LIBTAYO. Second quarter diluted net income per share grew 13% from the prior year to $11.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Second quarter revenues from our Sanofi collaboration grew to $1.1 billion, primarily composed of our share of collaboration profits of $988 million--which increased by 32% compared to the prior year, driven by DUPIXENT's continued volume growth and improving margins.\nReimbursement from manufacturing a commercial supply, the other component of the Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $157 million. Taking into account increased volumes offset by manufacturing efficiencies, we continue to expect reimbursement for manufacturing of commercial supply in 2024 to be comparable to 2023 on a full year basis. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting a reduction of approximately $190 million from the end of the first quarter. We continue to anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed to Sanofi by the end of 2026.\nMoving to Bayer. Second quarter ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA 8mg were $908 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $375 million, of which $353 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S. Now, to our operating expenses, Second quarter R&D expense grew 10% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investments to support our robust pipeline, including late-stage oncology and hematology programs. We continue to make thoughtful investments to enable us to move quickly into Phase III programs if supported by data readouts anticipated over the next 12 to 18 months. \nSG&A grew 19% from the prior year to $666 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by investment to support the launch of EYLEA HD as well as our ongoing international commercial expansion. Second quarter gross margin and net product sales was approximately 89%, which reflected ongoing start up costs for our fill-finish manufacturing facility. Now, to cash flow and the balance sheet. Regeneron generated approximately $1.6 billion in free cash flow through the first six months of 2024 and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of approximately $14.8 billion.\nWe repurchased approximately $900 million of our shares through the first six months of the year and had approximately $3.6 billion available for repurchases as of the end of the second quarter. Finally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. We have updated our 2024 gross margin guidance and now expect gross margin to be approximately 89%, primarily reflecting anticipated changes in product mix as well as higher non-product specific costs, including start up costs for our fill-finish facility. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. In summary, Regeneron delivered outstanding results in the second quarter and is well-positioned to continue to drive growth in the near and long-term.\nWith that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star 1-1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw you question, please press star 1-1 again.\nOur first question comes from the line of Tyler van Buren with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nTyler Van Buren\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nHey guys, good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. Regarding the EYLEA franchise, I'm really encouraged to see that the overall franchise is up year-over-year and that the 45% category share is maintained quarter-over-quarter. So, do you believe that EYLEA HD is reaching a stage in maturity of its launch where it will allow the overall category share to be relatively stable in the coming quarters that will allow you to participate in the retinal disease market growth? And is the market still growing around 10% year-over-year?\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nMarion?\n\nMarion McCourt\n\nSenior Vice President & Head-Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSo, Tyler, I'll take it in a couple of pieces. Thank you for the question. First, I did want to comment, we were very pleased to report the total net sales of $1.4--excuse me, $1.54 billion in the quarter. Obviously, as you mentioned, that's a 2.4% increase year-over-year. Additionally, I'll just comment a little bit more on EYLEA HD--we certainly are very much in the launch stage, this is our third full quarter of results that we're reporting today. And certainly, we're encouraged in the quarter, we had a 52% increase in net sales and certainly, that calculation represents $100 million net sales increase from the prior quarter--which is very significant in this competitive market.\nSo certainly, we are continuing to progress our launch and [inaudible] is important. Certainly, EYLEA is an important source of switch patients for EYLEA HD. Next, we see switches coming from FARICIMAB, also AVASTIN. Very pleased as well this quarter to report that we're increased use of EYLEA HD in naive patient populations. So, all in all, we see this indicative that EYLEA HD has the potential and certainly, the profile to be the new standard of care. I think you also asked me about market growth--overall market growth. Let me cover that as well. I would say probably, at this stage in the year, we're tracking more on single-digit growth in the category in the mid-range as opposed to double-digit--which I think is what was cited in your question.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThat's right. Okay. Thank you, Marion. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets, Your line's now open.",

Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan. Thanks to everyone joining today's call.\n\nRegeneron is off to a strong start in 2024, reflected in our solid first quarter financial results, as well as the progress we've made across our pipeline in the first four months of the year. From my remarks today, I'd like to briefly review some of our key performance drivers and then discuss a few of our more differentiated development programs, which have the potential to drive sustainable long-term growth for the company and value for our shareholders. After my remarks, George will provide an update on our pipeline, Marion will then review our commercial performance and Chris will discuss our financial results.\n\n1st quarter 2024 revenues grew 7% after excluding last year's revenue contribution from our COVID antibodies. Growth was primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and LIBTAYO global net product sales, which grew by 14% and 45%, respectively. DUPIXENT global net product sales worth 3.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. EYLEA HD generated $200 million in its second full quarter on the U.S. market, outperforming recent launches in the anti-VEGF category. Now, with a permanent J-code in place, improving payer coverage, broad prescriber familiarity and satisfaction with the EYLEA HD clinical profile and direct-to-consumer TV promotion underway, we continue to position EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal diseases.\n\nShifting to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, where Regeneron and Sanofi have two differentiated opportunities to transform the treatment paradigm for patients living with this debilitating disease. As announced in February, our sBLA for DUPIXENT for the treatment of COPD with Type 2 inflammation was accepted by the FDA for priority review with a June 27th PDUFA date. During its review of our submission, the FDA has requested additional efficacy analyses, including an information request received earlier this week regarding sub-populations from the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal studies.\n\nOur analyses across these requested patient subgroups indicate a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in COPD exacerbations. While the FDA has requested these analyses be submitted by the end of May, we anticipate providing them substantially sooner. We and Sanofi are confident that these additional analyses strongly support the approval of DUPIXENT in eosinophilic COPD. If the FDA determines that they need additional time to review these analyses, a decision on the sBLA could be delayed for up to three months.\n\nWe and our partner, Sanofi, are preparing for a launch that many pulmonologists, respiratory key opinion leaders and their patients are eagerly anticipating. If approved, DUPIXENT would be the only biologic therapy for COPD and the first new treatment approach for this disease in more than a decade. There is a high, unmet need for COPD with Type 2 inflammation, with approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the United States and another approximately 300,000 eligible patients in the EU and Japan, where we are also seeking regulatory approvals.\n\nTurning to ITEPEKIMAB, our IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated in former smokers with COPD regardless of the eosinophilic phenotype. We remain on track to report results and enable potential global regulatory filings in the second half of next year. ITEPEKIMAB can potentially address up to 1 million patients in the G7 countries, while China also represents a significant opportunity. We are very excited about potentially bringing these important new therapies to COPD patients while expanding our commercial respiratory franchise.\n\nIn a moment, George will describe another key opportunity in our pipeline, involving DUPIXENT in combination with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody, LINVOSELTAMAB -- which we believe has the potential to address any severe allergy and allow the millions of severe allergy sufferers to stop living in fear of an accidental exposure. Moving from LINVOSELTAMAB in severe allergy to its differentiated opportunity in multiple myeloma, where it is currently under FDA and EMA review in the relapsed refractory setting.\n\nIn our registration enabling dataset, while cost trial comparisons and caveats apply, we believe LINVOSELTAMAB represents a best-in-class opportunity because it has the highest objective response rates and complete response rates at similar follow-up observed across the BMA bispecific class to date, requires the least number of days in the hospital compared to other drugs in the category and is the only BCMAxCD3 agent currently under review or already approved by the FDA, that evaluated every four-week dosing. If approved, we believe these are all important considerations for patients, caregivers, providers, and payers that could drive LINVOSELTAMAB adoption.\n\nIn closing, I am excited and energized by the differentiated opportunities in our pipeline, which now has over 35 programs in clinical development spanning many distinct therapeutic areas. Our commercial team continues to execute well and is building momentum in competitive categories and we continue to deploy capital with the goal of driving shareholder returns over time.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Len. Since Len covered the status of the DUPIXENT and ITEPEKIMAB programs in COPD in great detail, I'd like to start with a bit more about our innovative treatment approach for severe allergies. A first-ever combination of an immunomodulatory antibody, that is DUPIXENT, with a bispecific antibody. Despite the remarkable benefit demonstrated by DUPIXENT across multiple diseases characterized by allergic or Type 2 inflammation, DUPIXENT alone does not immediately reverse severe allergies by itself.\n\nThese allergies are caused by high levels of an immunoglobulin class known as IgE, made by long-lived plasma cells. This has caused some to refer to the E in IGE, as E for evil. Although DUPIXENT will prevent formation of new IgE plasma cells, it does not eliminate those that have already formed. Regeneron scientists have shown that these allergy-causing IgE plasma cells can be rapidly eliminated with a short course of treatment with our bispecific antibody known as LINVOSELTAMAB.\n\nWhile DUPIXENT treatment will then prevent these cells from returning, as recently highlighted in our publication in Science Translational Medicine. We have commenced our proof-of-concept clinical trial to explore the potential for this combination approach to eliminate severe food allergy. We are hoping to see initial observations from this small study later this year, which will inform next steps.\n\nMoving on to oncology and LIBTAYO combinations. Early clinical results of our LAG-3 antibody, FIANLIMAB, in combination with LIBTAYO suggest that these antibodies represent one of the most promising checkpoint inhibitor combinations in clinical development. Recall, FIANLIMAB-LIBTAYO demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy in first-line metastatic melanoma, with objective response rates of approximately 60% across three independent cohorts from our first-in-human study, with a safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy.\n\nWith longer-term follow-up, these initial responses continue to deepen, including patients converting into complete responses. We look forward to presenting updated results from these expansion cohorts in the second half of this year. Encouraged by these initial results, last year, we initiated a Phase II/III study of the combination of FIANLIMAB and LIBTAYO in first-line metastatic melanoma. This study is enrolling faster than expected and will now be conducted solely as a Phase III study, with the final analysis to be reported during 2025. These pivotal melanoma data will inform whether FIANLIMAB and LIBTAYO have the potential to emerge as a new standard of care in melanoma.\n\nNext, to our bispecifics for hematology/oncology. Regarding ODRONEXTAMAB -- our CD20xCD3 bispecific -- as announced in March, we received complete response letters from the FDA for our BLA for relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma and relapsed refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The only approvability issue was related to the limited enrollment of these confirmatory trials, which we intend to address as we continue to enroll patients in these studies. The EU decision on ODRONEXTAMAB application is expected in the second half of this year.\n\nMoving on to LINVOSELTAMAB. As Len noted, this bispecific continues to demonstrate a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing and hospitalization burden. In an oral presentation at the recent AACR medical meeting, we presented results of an 11-month median follow-up of 117 patients, a 71% objective response rate with 46% of patients achieving a complete response or better.\n\nWe are planning to present updated 14-month follow-up results at the upcoming EHA meeting, in which we anticipate observing a further deepening of responses. Regarding the ongoing FDA review, we believe that confirmatory study will be sufficiently enrolled to support approval. We're also evaluating LINVOSELTAMAB in earlier stages of myeloma and in precursor conditions, such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or MGUS.\n\nNext, bispecifics for solid tumors. Our co-stimulatory bispecific antibodies are being tested in numerous studies, including as monotherapies as well as in combination with CD3 bispecifics and with LIBTAYO. Our EGFRxCD28 bispecific in combination with LIBTAYO, we are planning to present updated dose escalation results in an oral presentation at ASCO. Most notably, in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer -- a tumor historically unresponsive to immunotherapy -- EGFRxCD28 in combination with LIBTAYO, demonstrated anti-tumor activity.\n\nRegarding safety, to date, we have not observed severe immune-related adverse events with this agent at our recommended Phase II dose. Based on these data, we're enrolling dose expansion cohorts, testing our EGFRxCD28 co-stim bispecific plus LIBTAYO in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer with or without EGF receptor mutations, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and others.\n\nOn to our PSMAxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific, which is already demonstrating promising activity in prostate cancer in combination with LIBTAYO. We will soon initiate combination treatment of our PSMAxD28 co-stim bispecific with our PSMAxCD3 bispecific, which, based on preclinical studies, may maintain efficacy but with better tolerability. We're also evaluating our MUC16xCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific with UBAMATAMAB -- our MUC16xCD3 bispecific -- as well as with LIBTAYO; our CD3xCD28 co-stim with LINVOSELTAMAB for myeloma and our CD22xCD28 co-stim with ODRONEXTAMAB for lymphoma.\n\nMoving on to our classical hematology pipeline. Our C5 approach involves a first-in-class combination of an sRNA with an antibody for a more complete target blockade and our initial clinical data supports potential best-in-class efficacy in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH. Results from the preliminary cohort of the PNH Phase III study will be presented at the EHA conference in June, with additional results expected later this year.\n\nIn addition to PNH and myasthenia gravis, which are already enrolling their respective pivotal trials, we are planning on extending the systemic combination approach to geographic atrophy in dry AMD, with the first pivotal study in GA expected to get underway this year. We are also anticipating proof-of-concept data later this year for two complementary factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Depending on these data, one or both of these antibodies could remain on a rapid path to registrational studies, which could begin by late 2024 or early 2025.\n\nOur first-in-class antibody, TMPRSS6, a genetically-validated target for iron-overload diseases such as beta-thalassemia, is also making progress. This antibody has potential to meaningfully reduce toxic organ iron in patients for whom iron chelation is inadequate or intolerable. Updated proof of mechanism data in healthy volunteers will be presented at the upcoming EHA conference. These results demonstrated deep, sustained reductions in serum iron and robust induction of the liver hormone hepcidin, supporting the potential to release iron from organs. We are on track to start a Phase II proof-of-concept study in beta-thalassemia patients in the second half of the year.\n\nMoving to obesity. Our most advanced approach is designed to address potential negative consequences of widespread use of GLP-GIP receptor agonists. As has been widely reported, the profound weight loss caused by these agents, unfortunately, can also result in substantial loss of muscle, which is particularly concerning in older obese patients. Our antibodies to myostatin-related pathways may prevent this muscle loss.\n\nIndeed, our data in obese non-human primates show that combining semaglutide with TREVOGRUMAB -- our antibody-targeting myostatin -- with or without GARETOSMAB -- our antibody-targeting activin A or myostatin-2 -- demonstrated a comparable reduction in body weight at week 20 relative to semaglutide monotherapy but with improved quality weight loss, resulting in more fat loss while preserving or even increasing lean mass. Part A of our proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers, intended to demonstrate safety of a higher dose of TREVOGRUMAB, has completed enrollment.\n\nNote that over 400 subjects, including healthy volunteers and sarcopenic patients, have been dosed with TREVOGRUMAB throughout its clinical development, with no meaningful safety or tolerability concerns observed to date. Part B of the study, which will evaluate muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide in obese participants, remains on track to start enrolling mid-year. Assuming a reasonable pace of enrollment, we expect to report top-line results, including changes in body weight, fat mass and muscle mass, in the second half of 2025.\n\nI will conclude with our genetic medicines effort. At the upcoming ASGCT conference, we will present updated data from our DB-OTO gene therapy program for genetic hearing loss. The first patient treated with this therapy, a 10-month-old girl who was profoundly deaf at baseline, now at 24 weeks after treatment, has hearing in the normal range and the second treated patient is following a similar trajectory of improvement through earlier stages of follow-up. We are aiming to enroll several more patients this year, potentially enabling regulatory submissions by the end of next year. And we also look forward to bringing additional auditory gene therapy programs to the clinic in the coming years, with the potential to address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss.\n\nOur collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance. We've begun to enroll patients in the Phase III MAGNITUDE study of Intellia 2001 for a lead indication of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the first in vivo CRISPR program cleared to enter Phase III studies in the United States. We are also on track to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene in vivo for a deficiency disease. We have now achieved clearance from both the U.S. and EU authorities for our insertion program for factor IX and we have already enrolled initial patients into the leading portion of this program.\n\nMoving on to our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, which has not only demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver but also, for the first time for siRNA, in the brain. Additionally, we're excited about potentially initiating later this year, a potentially pivotal study for ALN-SOD treatment in ALS patients with SOD-1 mutations.\n\nWith that overview, I will turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion McCourt\n\nSenior Vice President & Head-Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, George. Our results in the first quarter demonstrate the strong performance of our commercial portfolio and future growth opportunity. We continue to strengthen and expand our leadership positions across our in-line brands and we are preparing for potential upcoming launches.\n\nI'll start with our anti-VEGF franchise and the ongoing launch progress of EYLEA HD. First quarter U.S. net sales grew 63% sequentially to $200 million. As real-world experience with efficacy and safety continues to grow, EYLEA HD is delivering on its promise of extending the duration between treatments, with the majority of patients achieving this goal. Retina specialists are highly satisfied with EYLEA HD, as demonstrated by prescribing across a broad range of patients. To date, most EYLEA HD patients are being switched from existing medicines, most notably EYLEA and FARICIMAB and we are also seeing an increase in treatment-naive patients.\n\nFor the quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together, secured 45% of the anti-VEGF category share. Combined U.S. net sales were $1.4 billion, which includes a reduction in wholesaler inventory of approximately $40 million. This reflects the sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory, ahead of the permanent J-code on April 1st. Since launch, our team has made significant progress to enhance reimbursement and market access for EYLEA HD. The permanent J-code has increased prescribers' reimbursement confidence, reflected by increased use among existing customers, as well as a step up in new customers ordering for the first time.\n\nWe're very encouraged by EYLEA HD update, despite a different payer market today compared to when EYLEA was launched more than a decade ago. For example, while more than 80% of medical benefit lives are now covered for EYLEA HD, increases in utilization management or step edits are impacting all branded products. We are also highly focused on educating patients about the potential for EYLEA HD to deliver best-in-category vision and safety benefits with fewer injections.\n\nIn mid-March, we began our direct-to-consumer TV campaign, designed to raise brand awareness among treatment-experienced and treatment-naive patients. Since initiating the DTC campaign, retina specialists have reported a significant increase in patients actively asking about and being prescribed EYLEA HD. In summary, the EYLEA HD launch outperformed expectations and we are on track to establish EYLEA HD as the new standard of care for retinal disease.\n\nTurning now to DUPIXENT, where first-quarter global net sales grew 25% on a constant currency basis to $3.1 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by continued robust demand and the impact of customary 1st quarter seasonality dynamics, including annual resets of insurance plans. DUPIXENT is the clear leader in new-to-brand prescription share across all five FDA-approved indications and leads in total biologic prescriptions in four of its approved indications. More than 850,000 patients are currently on therapy worldwide and three DUPIXENT indications have achieved blockbuster status: atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps.\n\nAcross all three of these indications, DUPIXENT is competitively differentiated based on its clinical profile, depth of clinical experience and potential to be prescribed to very young patients, as young as six months in the case of atopic dermatitis. We continue to see great progress with our recent launches in EoE, DUPIXENT's GI indication and prurigo nodularis in dermatology. Patient initiations across both indications continue to reach all-time highs and in late January, DUPIXENT was approved in pediatric EoE, the brand's fourth pediatric indication. Early launch indicators are positive, as DUPIXENT is transforming the standard of care for these children aged 1 to 11, as it has for adults and adolescents with EoE.\n\nIn addition to its approved indications, there's great potential for DUPIXENT in an increasing list of additional Type 2 diseases, including COPD. If approved, DUPIXENT will achieve two important firsts. The first biologic medicine for COPD and also, the first new treatment in more than a decade for this devastating disease. In the U.S., approximately 300,000 patients with uncontrolled COPD show evidence of Type 2 inflammation. If approved, we will work to rapidly establish the unique clinical benefits of DUPIXENT, activate physician adoption, motivate patients to seek treatment and also, advance access and affordability.\n\nWe are confident that COPD will drive meaningful growth for DUPIXENT if approved in this indication and see an additional opportunity to address patient unmet need with ITEPEKIMAB, our investigational IL-33 antibody designed to help COPD patients who are former smokers. With significant runway for growth and existing and potential new indications, we are confident in DUPIXENT's ongoing growth trajectory.\n\nAnd finally, to LIBTAYO. In the first quarter, global net sales were $264 million, up 44% on a constant currency basis from the prior year, driven by our dual focus in skin and lung cancers. In non-melanoma skin cancer, LIBTAYO continues to lead the immunotherapy category in CSCC and BCC, with opportunity for continued market growth. In lung cancer, we are making steady progress in capturing category share in both monotherapy and chemotherapy combination patients.\n\nOur Oncology team is also preparing for the upcoming August 22nd LINVOSELTAMAB PDUFA data. Recent data reinforces that LINVOSELTAMAB has the potential to be best-in-class for late-stage myeloma patients and we look forward to its potential launch. In summary, our commercial team continues to bring important medicines to patients across an expanding range of diseases. We are focused on differentiating our medicines to increase category share and drive market growth. Potential upcoming launches across our portfolio provide the opportunity to extend the benefits of our medicines to even more patients.\n\nAnd with that, I'll pass the call to Chris.\n\nChris Fenimore\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted.\n\nRegeneron delivered solid financial results in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding contributions from our COVID antibodies, total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, primarily driven by continued sales growth and margin expansion from DUPIXENT and strong global sales growth from LIBTAYO. 1st quarter diluted net income per share was $9.55 on net income of $1.1 billion.\n\nMoving to collaboration revenue. 1st quarter ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA and EYLEA HD, known as EYLEA 8mg outside the U.S., were $849 million, up 2% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $356 million, of which $334 million related to our share of net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 14% in the 1st quarter to $910 million. Our share of collaboration profits was $804 million, an increase of 26% versus the prior year, driven by DUPIXENT's continued volume growth and improving margins.\n\nReimbursement for manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $106 million for the quarter, which is expected to be the lowest of the year. On a full year basis, due to higher DUPIXENT volumes, we expect the amount of these reimbursements to be comparable to 2023. The Sanofi development balance was approximately $2.2 billion at the end of the 1st quarter. We anticipate this balance will be fully reimbursed by the end of 2026, which we expect will result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration profits thereafter.\n\nBefore moving to expenses, I will mention that despite lower volumes, U.S. PRALUENT sales in the 1st quarter reflected a gross-to-net adjustment, related to a true-up of rebates due to an adverse change in payer coverage. We now expect U.S. net sales of PRALUENT to be modestly higher in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to this adjustment. Now, to operating expenses.\n\n1st quarter R&D expense grew 17% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued investment in our robust pipeline. SG&A grew 13% from the prior year to $544 million in the 1st quarter, driven by investment to support the launcher by EYLEA HD, including direct-to-consumer promotion, as well as higher headcount and related costs primarily for our ongoing international commercial expansion. 1st quarter gross margin on net product sales was approximately 89%, which was impacted by ongoing startup costs for our fill-finish manufacturing facility. 1st quarter COCM was $193 million, reflecting a decline of 22% compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower DUPIXENT drug substance manufacturing cost.\n\nNow, to cash flow in the balance sheet. Regeneron generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the 1st quarter and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of approximately $14.8 billion. We repurchased approximately $300 million of our shares in the 1st quarter and we had approximately $1.2 billion available for repurchases under our February 2023 authorization at the end of the 1st quarter. This morning, we also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which provides us with additional flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders over time and we remain buyers of our shares.\n\nFinally, we have made some minor changes to our full year 2024 financial guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning. We now expect 2024 R&D expenses to be in the range of $4.4 to $4.6 billion. The change in R&D guidance is solely due to the inclusion of operating expenses associated with the acquisition of 2seventy bio's development programs, which closed on April 1st. In summary, Regeneron performed well in the 1st quarter and is positioned to continue to deliver strong results in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWith that, I'll pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThank you, Chris. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Josh, can we please go to the first question?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star 1-1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star 1-1 again. One moment for questions.\n\nAnd our first question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. You may proceed.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, great question. As you know, when you block with other approaches like BIMAGRUMAB, you're blocking over a dozen members of the so-called BMP/GDF family and so forth. And that raises the concern because only a couple of those are actually involved in muscle preservation, you may end up doing more harm than good. What we have identified over the years, is we identified two members of this very large family of almost 20 factors, which two are specifically involved in muscle preservation.\n\nAnd we created antibodies to each of these two individually and we're testing these antibodies individually, as well as together. And obviously, in this field of obesity, safety matters almost as much as efficacy here. So, we believe we have the best program that is testing, specifically, just the specific members of this very large family that are involved in muscle preservation -- whether blocking either one or both together, is going to benefit the quality of the weight loss in terms of preserving muscle and maybe even causing more fat loss while creating, hopefully, the best possible safety profile.\n\nSo, we think that that's a big difference between our program and other programs that are blocking, as I said, almost 20 different members that are involved in all sorts of things from, you know, growth factors for the bone marrow, for red blood cells; controlling all sorts of things from clotting to liver function and other things. And so, anyway, that's the major difference in our program.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks, George. Can we move to the next question, please, Josh?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nWell, just to remind you, if you look at our paper where we did the non-human primate studies and so forth, is the first thing we're going to be looking for is there is the very real possibility of increased weight loss. And that might be the simplest regulatory endpoint of all. After that, if we don't see that but we see better quality of weight loss, that could be manifested in a variety of ways -- though we, of course, recognize that those would, perhaps, create more complicated ways of being regulated.\n\nSo, obviously, if you increase the fat loss while preserving muscle, you should have dramatic benefits in metabolic parameters -- which are often used in the field, particularly in people with diabetes and so forth. As well as, ultimately, in terms of function -- by having maintenance of function as opposed to losing function and maintaining those sort of functional endpoints. So, the simplest path might be simply weight loss.\n\nOne could then move into metabolic parameters or muscle actual functional outcome measures but, to us, the most important thing in the Phase II study is to really just demonstrate the quality of the weight loss in terms of fat versus muscle because, ultimately, if you're preserving muscle and increasing the fat loss, it has to be much better for patients and it may avoid a lot of catastrophic long-term effects of widespread GLP-1 use. And, so if we see that, we think that we have a real opportunity to to turn that into real, widespread benefit for patients using this class of drugs.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nOkay. Thanks, George. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Raymond with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\n\nMarion McCourt\n\nSenior Vice President & Head-Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSure. So, let me take the inventory item first and then I'll come back to the overall marketplace. But this was an aggregate, as I mentioned. In the quarter, we saw reduction in wholesaler inventory, broadly, of about $40 million. So, that reflects market-wide but that was a combination of two elements. It was a sequential drawdown of EYLEA inventory that was partially offset by a modest increase in EYLEA HD inventory ahead of the permanent J-code on April 1st.\n\nAnd then, I would share on the overall market -- in all the categories where we participate, we're always very conscious of the segmentation of the market, targeting the market, what's occurring in terms of customer base. And certainly, our strategies and our approach to the marketplace is reflective of that. And the range of customers we have, as you point out, in retina and how that market has evolved over time. And I think our commercialization approach has been very effective in addressing that market evolution.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nOkay. Thanks, Marion. Next question, please, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. Salveen, thanks for the question. You're right. From our perspective, we think the data broadly supports the entire BLA and as well as all these analyses, the approval of the drug in eosinophilic COPD. As you might imagine, the FDA, when anticipating or looking at a new class of biologics, is very interested in checking it up and down and down and up and making sure that there's no sub-population of the study that might be driving the data.\n\nSo, if one saw that, one might think about labeling it differently. But none of that has occurred. We've looked at all these analyses, we're going to submit them way ahead of the schedule that they've asked for and all of the analyses show a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in COPD exacerbations across all of these subgroups that have been asked for.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks, Len. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tyler Van Buren with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThese are great questions. We hope, from the first few patients -- if the results are as dramatic as they are in the preclinical studies -- that we'll be seeing meaningful indicators that we are really reversing severe food allergy. Of course, the first thing and the most important biomarker, as I said, is this evil immunoglobulin, IgE -- which you can both measure but they are also routinely tested using these skin prick tests, which are how people are actually evaluated for allergies.\n\nSo we expect, first of all, to be seeing that happening in the study in obvious ways. And then, we can follow that up. And it is allowed in the study, if we see dramatic responses in these markers of the actual allergy causing immunoglobulin, to then go on and do actual food challenge and so forth in the patients. So, it all depends on how obvious the reductions in this IgE are and if they're really dramatic, we can go on and do additional allergen challenge tests. But we hope, if the humans behave like the non-human primates, that we might be seeing something dramatic in the initial stages.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nGeorge, can you comment? I think they also wanted to know how long you have to stay on DUPI.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. The interesting thing is, the animal studies suggest that the antibodies against the allergens come back as IgG -- G for good antibodies. The whole point of -- if you guys are familiar with so-called immunotherapy or desensitization therapy -- all of those therapies, what they're trying to do is induce the production of IgG to overwhelm the IgE. That's a much harder thing to do because they're not really getting rid of the IgE, they just have to overwhelm it with a lot more IgG. In the animal studies, it suggests that we get rid of the IgE and we replace it with IgG. We don't know, obviously.\n\nIn humans, it may be possible that short-term treatment -- relatively short-term treatment -- may allow patients who have replaced their IgE with IgG and they will have long-term protection. On the other hand, we may see that, to prevent these patients from making IgE and more IgGs in the future, that they may have to stay on DUPIXENT for substantial long periods of time. The good news about that, as we all know and as was highlighted in Marion's comments, DUPIXENT, compared to most other immunomodulatory agents, is not immunosuppressive.\n\nIt actually is corrective for the immune system and, as indicated by its labeling, for very, very young patients, it's a very, very relatively safe immunomodulator and biologic. And since most people who have severe allergies also have a lot of other concomitant atopic diseases, it may be that it is best for these patients to keep their abnormal atopy or abnormal Type 2 inflammation under control. So, short answer is, there's a possibility it could be relatively short-term but there's also a possibility, at least for some or the majority of patients, it could be relatively long-term. But the good news is that they may actually have a long-term benefit for the patient because these patients are almost, by definition, what you call atopic patients who might need control of their Type 2 excess inflammation.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nAlright. Moving to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nRight, that's a great question. Obviously, the thing that gets us excited about our program compared to the field is that we've seen levels of activity that haven't been seen in the other LAG-3 programs, particularly in melanoma. If that's true in melanoma, there would be hope that this would be seen broadly in other settings and indications.\n\nWe are certainly excited to see the follow-up details on the BMS story, with potential activity in a specific sub-population. That will certainly help point us in our own studies to see what we're seeing within that sub-population that they're talking about, as well as more broadly. But of course, the hope, as I said, is that if it is indeed more active in one setting, such as melanoma, the hope is it will be broadly more active across other cancer settings as well. So, we are excited to see follow-up on their data, we're excited to see follow-up on our data, both in melanoma and in our lung studies.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks, George. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from William Pickering with Bernstein. You may proceed.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. These are all great questions. So, what we've already actually shown, based on a variety of studies that we've done, is that normal, non-malignant, non-cancerous plasma cells -- the cells that are the immunoglobulin factory cells -- the normal versions of the cells are much more susceptible to bispecific than are malignant myeloma cells. So, in discussions and communications with the FDA, we're actually starting at much lower doses than the doses that are used in the myeloma programs, though there is an intrapatient dose escalation process.\n\nSo, we're literally watching, we're starting with low doses and we're going up in doses until we actually, hopefully, see elimination of the IgE. That said, in terms of the safety, I just want to remind you that the much higher myeloma doses we came up with, as Len briefly summarized in this program, we believe that we have a differentiated program in terms of not only efficacy and hospitalization burden and so forth but also in safety. We have less than 1% grade 3 events at those high doses, in the much sicker myeloma patients. So, we hope and we expect that with lower doses in a much healthier population, that this will be a, hopefully, pretty well tolerated approach.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nAnd a much shorter --\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nAnd a much shorter, yeah. We think that, ultimately, we may get by with a single, short course or a very short course of treatment. In terms of whether, you know, if somebody takes a holiday, whether one has to then start all over again with the elimination of the IgE cells, we think probably not because it takes a long time to get to those levels of IgE. So, you know, just delaying for a short period of time, you may not bounce back to those levels. As I said, you may have converted all of those cells to IgG or good cells by that point anyway.\n\nBut of course, we have to be doing the studies and we have to be looking at these patients in the clinic to really understand. I should mention that the grade 3 events that I was talking about are reflected by cytokine release syndrome. A lot of that is also thought to be due to the load of the cancer cells. And obviously, these normal patients have much less of a load here. So, it's just another reason to expect, hopefully, better safety. We're going to be going with lower doses, more gentle treatment and they have much less load in there. So, you'd expect much less reason to be seeing things like cytokine release syndrome.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nOkay. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. You may proceed.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYou know, that's a phenomenal question. And first of all, let me remind you that with our long-term collaboration and recent acquisition of 2seventy, 2seventy had exactly the sort of CAR-T programs that you're referring to in lupus and other autoimmune settings, which we are now obviously pursuing together with them. But that is one of the reasons why we were excited about turning the collaboration into a situation where we brought all the expertise and the scientists and leadership from 2seventy in-house. Because we're doing exactly what you suggested.\n\nWe're hoping to actually literally look at side-by-side studies how CAR-T approaches in these settings of autoimmune, severe autoimmune diseases like lupus and so forth, compare directly head-to-head to our bispecifics. And as you were sort of suggesting, you would think that there would be really little reason to think that the CAR-T solutions would be preferable in this setting, both in terms of off-the-shelfness and the ability to eliminate the normal cells. As I said, it's usually a lot easier to get rid of normal cells than it is malignant cells.\n\nSo whatever advantages you might have in certain settings of CAR-Ts, you would think in the normal disease settings, or at least normal cells in autoimmune disease settings, that bispecifics might be just as good, much more convenient, and much safer. So, together with, now, our internal Regeneron cell medicines group that has involved a lot of the expertise and leadership of 2seventy, we're exploring that exact question.\n\nI should also say that, as clearly been announced by the company and is available in our public disclosures, we have already initiated separately, a variety of studies looking at our bispecifics to decrease autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in other settings as well. So, we were already looking at this but, now, we're looking at these in direct comparison to our CAR-T approaches with our, now, internal Regeneron cell medicines efforts.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nOkay. Thank you, George. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\n\nMarion McCourt\n\nSenior Vice President & Head-Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSo, certainly, we look forward to the potential launch of DUPIXENT in COPD. There's such unmet need and such opportunity to help those patients with eosinophilic COPD. Our team, as you know, is very experienced with launches in DUPIXENT so, work is very much underway at Regeneron and also, obviously, in our collaboration with Sanofi to make sure that we apply the best practices in launch of new indications. I will share that many of these physicians have already experienced use of DUPIXENT with tremendous results.\n\nWe've made great progress, as you know, in asthma, leading in new scripts and certainly making tremendous overall performance strides. But we will be very thoughtful on how best to reach physicians, how to make sure that we're aligned with reimbursement and affordability for patients, educating in the way we've come to understand is best for DUPIXENT and the various markets and indications that we've entered. So, we look forward to this opportunity.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nOkay. I think we have time for two more questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nWell, there's always the possibility of disease modification. We actually believe, for example, DUPIXENT in asthma may be doing exactly that sort of benefit. One of the best ways of actually looking at that is looking at overall loss of lung function over time. Because as you know, in these lung diseases -- as Marion said -- in both asthma and COPD, these are diseases of the lungs followed largely by pulmonologists, the same sort of doctors. And it is well known that in both of these diseases, over time, patients start permanently losing lung capacity and lung function.\n\nWe are and have been and have early data suggesting that DUPIXENT may prefer that in asthma and we'll certainly be looking at those sorts of things for, not only DUPIXENT but ITEPEKIMAB in COPD patients, in terms of modifying disease and long-term preservation and prevention of this otherwise unstoppable lung function loss.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nOkay. Last question, please, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our last question. And our last question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nMarion can take the question on the launch and everything. I mean, obviously, the MRD negativity as endorsed by that panel, gives an opportunity to get these kinds of drugs to patients earlier in a variety of settings. So, we're looking forward to applying that approach in our future studies as we move towards earlier and different lines of therapy. Marion, on the launch?\n\nMarion McCourt\n\nSenior Vice President & Head-Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSure. So, we're certainly preparing for the potential launch with the August 22nd PDUFA date. And we're really excited because, as I've mentioned before, the recent data reinforces LINVOSELTAMAB as potentially a best-in-class product for late-stage myeloma patients. So, it's a wonderful opportunity to extend our oncology franchise in the new disease area.\n\nRyan Crowe",

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Fourth quarter 2023 capped another strong year for Regeneron and Bob will walk you through our financial results. For my remarks today, I'd like to briefly look back at 2023 and then discuss what's to come in the year ahead. .\n2023 was another remarkable year for Regeneron, highlighted by several significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. At the start of the year, we identified 5 key strategic imperatives. First, obtaining FDA approval and successfully launching EYLEA HD. We did encounter a minor delay when we received the complete response letter in late June due to an issue at a third-party filler. But this was quickly remedied and EYLEA HD was granted approval in mid-August.\nWith what we believe to be a best-in-class potential clinical profile, EYLEA HD is poised to become the new standard of care for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye diseases. The launch is off to a great start, which Marion will discuss in a few minutes.\nSecond, we had to defend our intellectual property related to EYLEA. We presented our best case and prevailed in the District Court, which found that one of EYLEA's formulation patents was both valid and infringed by a biosimilar aflibercept manufacturer. This favorable decision may have broad implications and could result in a delay to biosimilar aflibercept launches.\nThird, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, needed to continue driving Dupixent growth not only by further penetrating previously approved indications by also reaching even more patients suffering from other diseases driven by Type 2 inflammation. In 2023, we did both. Dupixent global net product sales grew by 34% on a constant currency basis to $11.6 billion. Dupixent led in new-to-brand prescription share in the United States across all 5 of its approved indications.\nWe also had a major breakthrough in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. In March, we reported strong data from the BOREAS study, which enrolled COPD patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe disease and evidence of Type 2 inflammation. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation during the summer but required additional evidence of efficacy to support a regulatory filing. Based on this feedback, we and Sanofi decided to conduct an interim analysis on the [ Replicate Notice ] study which read out similarly compelling results, enabling our December sBLA submission and a potential U.S. launch for this indication as early as mid-2024.\nFourth, we continued making progress toward our long-term goal of becoming a global leader in oncology. 2023 was highlighted by our regulatory submissions for linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific in myeloma, and odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in lymphoma, while continuing to advance other opportunities in solid tumors.\nAnd finally, we needed to advance our early-stage pipeline. And over the course of 2023, we presented intriguing proof of mechanism or proof-of-concept data across hematology and genetic medicines, as well as other areas, including obesity with data from nonhuman primates. Many of these early programs, which George will run through in a few minutes, represent first or best-in-class opportunities that we believe can drive long-term growth for Regeneron.\nAccomplishments in 2023 have put us in a position of strength entering 2024. For this year, one of our strategic imperatives is to continue driving commercial execution, especially the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD, with the goal of accelerating the pace of conversion from other anti-VEGF agents.\nAnother important launch milestone was achieved last month when the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigned a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1, 2024, at which point a potential reimbursement concern for physicians will be removed.\nWe also need to continue to drive Dupixent growth in its currently improved indications as well as from the potential FDA approval and launch in COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. If approved, Dupixent would represent the first meaningful advance in over a decade for the 300,000 patients in the United States suffering from this form of COPD and would be the first ever biologic approved for COPD.\nIn oncology this year, aside from continuing to build on the success of Libtayo in non-melanoma skin cancers and non-small cell lung cancer, we are excited about the potential launches of odronextamab and linvoseltamab, the latter of which has the potential to be the best-in-class bispecific for myeloma.\nWe also expect to make significant advances across our pipeline in 2024, with key readouts for fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Libtayo in adjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and our Factor XI antibodies in thrombosis, which may inform pivotal studies.\nWe also plan to initiate clinical trials in obesity, geographic atrophy, hemophilia B and severe food allergies, in addition to expanding early studies of our CD28 co-stimulatory bispecific programs in solid and hematologic malignancies.\nIn closing, we had a strong 2023 and are poised to deliver in 2024 and beyond. Our pipeline of over 30 clinical programs is delivering important and differentiated innovations. Our commercial team is executing well. And we continue to look at ways to efficiently deploy capital to drive shareholder returns over time.\nBefore I hand it over to George, I want to take a moment to thank Bob Landry for his many contributions to Regeneron over his 10 years as our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to helping fortify Regeneron's financial strength and discipline, Bob has been an incredible mentor to many of Regeneron's current and future leaders, helped drive our financial results over the past decade, and worked tirelessly to ensure we have the resources needed to help improve the lives of patients around the world. Bob, on behalf of the entire Regeneron family, thank you, and we wish you continued good health and happiness.\nAs we first announced back in September upon Bob's retirement next week, Chris Fenimore will become the CFO of Regeneron. We all look forward to working closely with Chris in his new role knowing he brings a similar rigor and depth of financial knowledge that will ensure continuity and collaboration across the organization.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Len. That was really an impressive overview, I have to say.\n2023 was another year of firsts delivered by Regeneron, as well as together with our collaborators, all of which have the potential to change the practice of medicine.\nStarting with inflammation and immunology. As you heard from Len, we are planning yet another launch for Dupixent, this time in eosinophilic COPD, which would represent the sixth disease that this remarkable medicine is approved to treat, and the fifth for which it would be first in class. Dupixent's transformative potential in COPD is based on the unprecedented results from our first Phase III trial, BOREAS, which were then confirmed by our second Phase III trial notice, demonstrating that Dupixent treated patients had a 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate, severe COPD exacerbations [Technical Difficulty] IL-33 blocking antibody.\nThe pivotal [ RFI I and II ] studies passed an interim futility analysis last year. The studies are now on track to complete enrollment in 2024 with an anticipated readout in 2025. If the Phase III results from these studies even approach the Phase II data reported in former smokers, where a 42% reduction in annualized exacerbation rate was observed, [indiscernible] has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm for COPD.\nLater this year, we are planning on testing an innovative new treatment approach for severe food allergies using a combination of transient BCMAxCD3 bispecific intervention in patients receiving Dupixent therapy. As many of you know, allergic responses are driven by pathologically high levels of the immunoglobulin E or IgE. This is why many say the E in IgE stands for evil.\nAbout 40 years ago, it was discovered that interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 were the switch factors required for switching to IgE production. Based on exciting preclinical data, including in nonhuman primates, as well as human data, our innovative approach has the potential to reverse severe allergies by, first, eliminating the long-lived plasma cells that serve as an IgE reservoir with the BCMAxCD3, followed by blocking of de novo immunoglobin class switching to IgE with the Dupixent.\nWe are looking forward to starting a small proof-of-concept study, which will inform next steps for this program. We believe this approach has the potential to benefit the millions of people suffering from severe allergies who are at constant risk, as tragically highlighted just last week by the widely reported death of yet another young person unknowingly exposed to a food allergen.\nMoving to oncology. Libtayo is the leading PD-1 antibody for non-melanoma skin cancers, including metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, and basal cell carcinoma. We are looking forward to potentially expanding the currently approved CSCC indication to include adjuvant CSCC. And we expect results from potentially pivotal interim analysis in this setting in the second half of the year.\nRegarding Libtayo combinations, our most advanced is the combination with our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab. As a reminder, our early clinical data in 3 separate first-line metastatic melanoma cohorts demonstrated potential for best-in-class efficacy when compared cross trial with the approved anti-LAG-3 PD-1 combination product, highlighted by objective response rates greater than 60% and estimated median progression-free survival of longer than 15 months. These early clinical data suggested that the Libtayo-fianlimab combination may be one of the most exciting examples of a checkpoint inhibitor combination with clinically meaningful benefit and with the safety profile that is similar to that seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy.\nWe are expecting a potentially pivotal initial readout from our first-line metastatic melanoma trial by the end of this year. We also anticipate Phase II data in non-small cell lung cancer in late 2024.\nOn to bispecifics, starting with solid tumors. In the dose escalation trial of our EGFR by CD28 costimulatory bispecific combined with Libtayo, we have observed promising activity in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer with higher doses of [ Decostin ]. In terms of safety, so far, we have not seen an increase in immune-related adverse events with [ Decostin ]. Based on these encouraging early data, which will be presented at a scientific forum later this year, we will be initiating expansion cohorts across several solid tumors in the first half of the year.\nIn 2024, we are also planning to provide updates for our MUC16xCD3 and MUC16xCD28 program in advanced ovarian cancer.\nNext, our bispecific for hematology oncology. For linvoseltamab, or BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, FDA acceptance of our BLA submission is expected later this month. And the EMA recently accepted our MAA submission. These submissions were supported by a potentially best-in-class profile in late-line myeloma in terms of efficacy, safety, dosing, as well as convenience. A confirmatory Phase III study as well as studies in earlier stages of myeloma and premalignant disease are enrolling or will soon begin enrolling patients.\nFor odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the FDA decision for our BLA is expected by its March 31 PDUFA date, and the [ new ] decision is expected in the second half of the year.\nIn terms of additional recent news for our oncology and immunology pipeline this week, we announced the formation of Regeneron Cell Medicines unit, and that we are acquiring full development and commercialization rights for 2seventy bio's pipeline of investigational immune cell therapies. We have worked with 2seventy since 2018 on many of these programs and are excited about the opportunity to continue advancing our collective efforts. After deal closing, certain 2seventy employees will join Regeneron cell medicines and continue to work on addressing cancer and other serious diseases in novel ways, including by combining Regeneron's antibody capabilities with CAR-T therapies.\nMoving from immunology and oncology to obesity and metabolic diseases. Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding GLP-1 agonist for obesity, it has been increasingly recognized that the profound weight loss is accompanied by substantial muscle loss, accounting for up to as much as 40% of the weight loss. This potentially irretrievable muscle loss can be catastrophic for patients and may even lead to major public health concerns in the future.\nWe have previously shown that our antibodies targeting myostatin and [ ActiveNA ] have the potential to preserve and grow muscle in human trials. Based on these data as well as additional data in obese nonhuman primates, we believe that inhibiting these pathways, on top of GLP-1 receptor agonism, has the potential to achieve comparable overall reductions in body weight, but with improved quality of the weight loss, resulting in more fat loss while preserving or actually increasing muscle mass.\nIn mid-2024, we plan to start our first clinical trial to evaluate the combination of our muscle preservation antibodies in combination with semaglutide.\nAlso in 2024, we are anticipating proof-of-concept data for a Factor XI antibodies in the setting of prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee replacement surgery. Based on preclinical and healthy volunteer data, our antibody approach demonstrated more complete Factor XI blockade compared to competing approaches in development for coagulation disorders. And the program is on a rapid path to a registrational trial starting late this year or early next year.\nWe'll now conclude with our efforts in genetic medicines. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam has demonstrated successful silencing of genes in the liver, and for the first time for siRNA, in the brain. Proof of principle was achieved for ALN-APP last year, and we are anticipating additional data from that program this year, including from patients who have received multiple doses. Based on the success, we are looking forward to new siRNA programs targeting CNS diseases entering the clinic this year, such as ALN-SOD for ALS patients with SOD1 mutations.\nOur collaboration with Intellia on CRISPR gene editing continues to advance, where we together produced the first example of CRISPR-based gene editing of a pathological gene in human beings. This initial program for our lead indication of TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is now in the first in vivo CRISPR program clear to enter Phase III studies in the United States. Together with Intellia, we also hope to be the first to use CRISPR technology to insert a corrective gene for deficiency disease. We recently achieved IND clearance for our CRISPR-based gene insertion program for Factor IX and initiated the lead-in portion of a clinical trial to evaluate it as a potential cure for hemophilia B.\nMoving to genetic hearing loss. We were the first U.S.-based company to announce hearing restoration in a young child suffering from genetic hearing loss after treatment with our novel gene therapy approach. We are excited by these early results for this ultra-rare disease and look forward to advancing to the clinic additional programs potentially address more common forms of monogenic hearing loss. These data represent validation of our viral-based gene therapy program, in this case, locally delivered to the cells of the inner ear.\nBeyond these efforts, we have made significant investments in leveraging our monoclonal and bispecific antibody expertise to use these agents to systematically deliver virally based genetic-based payloads directly to specific tissues in the body non-amenable to local delivery, such as to muscle and the central nervous system. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we will be progressing these approaches to the clinic in the coming years.\nFinally, concluding with another notable first-in-class program involving a combination of an siRNA with an antibody, in this case to block the C5 complement target. Normally, one needs very high levels of [indiscernible] antibody to achieve sufficient efficacy because of high target levels regarding C5. But our siRNA cotreatment dramatically lowers C5 target burden, allowing lower and more convenient antibody dosing. We recently shared encouraging initial data from a Phase III study in patients with PNH, which supported our hypothesis that this combination approach could provide better efficacy and control of breakthrough hemolysis with more convenient dosing.\nBased and building on these data, we continue to enroll our Phase III studies in PNH and myasthenia gravis. We're also planning to extend this combination approach to geographic atrophy and dry AMD. While this combination is expected to have manageable systemic toxicities, including elevated risk of infections, we believe that our approach has several potential advantages over recently approved complement inhibiting agents for GA which are delivered directly into the eye and have resulted in rare but serious cases of retinal vasculitis, sometimes resulting in permanently impaired vision.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver many firsts, including differentiated early, mid- and late-stage opportunities. And we are looking forward to additional progress in 2024.\nBefore I turn the call over to Marion, I would like to add my thanks and appreciation to Bob for his many years of devoted efforts and leaderships, and welcoming and look forward to adding Chris Fenimore to our leadership team. With that, I will turn it over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, George. Our business delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and for the year. Over the course of 2023, we successfully launched EYLEA HD, grew Dupixent across approved type 2 inflammatory diseases, and expanded Libtayo's presence in lung and non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to several potential approvals this year in new therapeutic categories, including in COPD with Dupixent and a hematologic oncology using new treatment modalities.\nI'll start with our retinal franchise. In January, we announced fourth quarter combined U.S. EYLEA HD and EYLEA net product sales of $1.46 billion. In its first full quarter, EYLEA HD net product sales were $123 million, based on growing demand and positive early physician experience. EYLEA HD is already being used across a broad range of patient types, including those switching from EYLEA, other branded agents or Avastin, as well as modest but increasing use in treatment-naive patients.\nIn the fourth quarter, EYLEA HD and EYLEA together secured 49% of the anti-VEGF category share, despite increasing competition and changing market dynamics. This share gain was driven by the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of our medicines as well as a short-term disruption in compounded Avastin due to a quality issue at a large supplier that has since been resolved.\nSince launch, we have made significant progress in securing access and reimbursement for EYLEA HD. More than 2/3 of eligible lives are now covered, with the vast majority having first line or single step edit access. Medicare fee-for-service, which represents approximately 45% of total category use, claims are being paid across 100% of jurisdictions using a miscellaneous J-code.\nLooking ahead in 2024, we remind you that the first quarter is typically impacted by payer reauthorizations and that EYLEA HD will remain subject to a miscellaneous J-code. However, in late January, we achieved another important launch milestone with CMS's assignment of a permanent J-code for EYLEA HD that will go into effect on April 1. This will provide additional reimbursement confidence for those physicians hesitant to prescribe before a permanent J-code based on their negative experiences with other new eye disease medicines.\nOverall, we are very excited about the future of our retinal franchise. We continue to see physicians prescribe EYLEA HD in both treatment experienced and treatment-naive settings as EYLEA HD is increasingly recognized as the new standard of care.\nNow to Dupixent, where fourth quarter 2023 global net sales grew 31% on a constant currency basis to $3.2 billion and U.S. net sales grew 28% to $2.5 billion. With more than 800,000 patients on therapy worldwide, Dupixent is one of the most important biologic medicines for patients across the spectrum of diseases. Additionally, it continues to have significant growth potential based on new and upcoming indications.\nIn the U.S., Dupixent leads new-to-brand prescription share across all 5 approved indications, an important leading indicator for future growth. In addition, Dupixent already leads total prescription share in 4 or 5 approved indications, and we are approaching share leadership in biologic asthma.\nIn atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication, physicians continue to prescribe Dupixent as a therapy of choice. Despite increased competition over the course of 2023, fourth quarter Dupixent new-to-brand prescription share in AD modestly increased sequentially compared to the third quarter 2023, driven by its differentiated mechanism of action, clinical results and trusted safety profile, including approval in patients as young as 6 months of age.\nDupixent's U.S. label was recently updated with efficacy and safety data for patients with moderate to severe hand or foot atopic dermatitis. Dupixent is the only biologic medicine with data in the label supporting use for this subset of patients with this hard-to-treat disease.\nBeyond atopic dermatitis, growth also continues in asthma and nasal polyps, both of which are already blockbuster indications. The recent launches for eosinopilic esophagitis, known as EoE, in prurigo nodularis, further contributed to DUPIXENT's performance and represent indications of significant growth potential. In EoE, which prior to DUPIXENT's approval had no FDA-approved treatments, nearly 25,000 patients in the U.S. alone have already initiated therapy on Dupixent. The FDA's recent approval of Dupixent in pediatric EoE extends this indication to patients as young as 1 year of age, where approximately 20,000 children in the U.S. being treated for EoE with unapproved therapies.\nPatient initiations also continue to accelerate in prurigo nodularis, solidifying Dupixent as the standard of care for multiple dermatologic conditions. In summary, Dupixent is delivering on its potential as one of the most important biologic medicines of our generation with significant remaining opportunity for growth. We anticipate bringing Dupixent to many more patients this year across approved indications. The pediatric EoE launch is already underway, and we are actively preparing to launch Dupixent in eosinophilic COPD pending potential FDA approval later this year.\nAnd finally, to Libtayo. Fourth quarter global net sales grew 43% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $244 million, with U.S. net sales of $155 million. Libtayo continues to lead the category in non-melanoma skin cancers, and we've made progress in penetrating the non-small cell lung cancer market.\nIn 2024, we expect continued growth across all indications, advancing our goal to exceed $1 billion in annual Libtayo net sales.\nIn conclusion, 2024 provides the opportunity to further build Regeneron's market-leading positions with our medicines across even more therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.\nRegeneron ended 2023 with strong performance in the fourth quarter. Excluding contributions from Ronapreve, total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by sales growth and margin expansion from Dupixent the launch of EYLEA HD and strong sales growth from Libtayo.\nFourth quarter diluted net income per share was $11.86 on net income of $1.4 billion.\nMoving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2023 ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $890 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $345 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S.\nTotal Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $993 million. Excluding a $50 million sales milestone recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022, Sanofi collaboration revenue grew 26%. Our share of collaboration profits was $886 million, an increase of 43% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by Dupixent's continued volume growth and improving margins.\nReimbursements for manufacturing of commercial supply, a component of Sanofi collaboration revenues, declined 36% versus the prior year due to the implementation of a new higher-yielding manufacturing process. At the end of 2023, the Sanofi development balance was $2.33 billion, reflecting a net decrease of $534 million compared to the balance as of December 31, 2022. Recall, this decrease is primarily recorded as a reduction to our share of collaboration profits. We continue to expect this balance to be fully reimbursed in the next few years, which would result in a significant step-up in our Sanofi collaboration profits.\nOther revenue was $213 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 66% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher royalties from Novartis on sales of Alaris and an increase in our share of Arcalyst profit from Kiniksa. The increase in other revenue also reflects higher reimbursements for increased shipment volumes of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi.\nMoving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 13% year-over-year to $1.03 billion, which reflects continued investment in our growing pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs, funding of our advancing late-stage programs, and increased clinical manufacturing activity. SG&A grew 7% from the prior year to $622 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher commercialization expenses, including costs to support the launch of EYLEA HD in prelaunch activities for an anticipated 2024 hem/onc product launches.\nFourth quarter COCM declined 12% from the prior year quarter to $210 million. Recall that we are reimbursed for these costs.\nNow to cash flow and the balance sheet. In 2023, Regeneron generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow, ending the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $13.5 billion. In 2023, we repurchased over $2.2 billion of our shares with approximately $1.5 billion remaining authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2023. Since we began repurchasing our shares in 2019, we have bought back approximately $12 billion worth and planning to continue to make opportunistic repurchases.\nNow moving to our financial guidance for 2024. Note that these guidance ranges do not assume the completion of any business development transactions that were not completed as of today, including our recently announced agreement to acquire preclinical and clinical programs from 2seventy bio. Starting with R&D expense in 2024, which is anticipated to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion. As George just discussed and as we highlighted at the JPMorgan conference, our pipeline continues to expand, with a growing number of registration-enabling studies ongoing are expected to initiate this year. These include potentially pivotal studies for fianlimab, Phase III studies in earlier lines of odronextamab and linvoseltamab in our C5 programs. In addition, we expect to bring 8 to 10 new molecules into the clinic in 2024.\nWe expect 2024 SG&A spend to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion. This reflects increased promotional activities for the ongoing launch of EYLEA HD investments to support 2 anticipated hem/onc product launches and higher headcount to support our growing organization inclusive of our ongoing international expansion.\nCOCM is expected to be in the range of $850 million to $910 million. This range reflects lower drug substance manufacturing costs for Dupixent, offset by higher Dupixent volumes, and higher production costs for other collaboration products, including EYLEA HD for Bayer. Recall, we are reimbursed for COCM expenses and, as a result, we expect reimbursement from Sanofi, which are recorded as a component of Sanofi collaboration revenue, to be slightly lower in 2024 as compared to 2023.\nWe expect the 2024 gross margin on net product sales to be in the range of 89% to 91%. We also expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12%.\nFinally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million, which reflects expansion of our R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters, as well as continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, including ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility in Rensalier, New York.\nIn addition to our full year guidance, we expect U.S. net product sales of Praluent to be lower in 2024 as compared to 2023 due to changes in payer coverage. We also expect 2024 net product sales for Inmazeb to be in line with 2023 revenues with nearly all 2024 revenues expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, we anticipate other revenue in 2024 to be in line with 2023, with the second half expected to be higher than our first half.\nOverall, Regeneron performed well in 2023 and our continued investments position the company to drive long-term shareholder value.\nBefore I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank Len and George for their kind words. It has been an honor to serve as Regeneron's CFO for these past 10 years and I have appreciated all of my interactions with each of you in the investment community. I wish Chris Fenimore much success in this role and have the utmost confidence that he and the rest of the management team will continue to deliver breakthrough medicines for patients and value to shareholders.\nThank you, and I wish you all continued success. With that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Bob, and congratulations again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer 1 question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?",

Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release and our corporate presentation, both of which can be accessed on our website.\n\nOnce our call concludes, Bob Landry and the Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Leonard Schleifer. Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank Ryan and thanks to everyone joining today's call.\n\nRegeneron delivered another strong quarter, marked by continued execution across the company, which drove double digit top line growth and notable progress across our innovative R&D pipeline.\n\nTotal revenues increased by 15 per cent on reported basis compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by scientific collaboration revenues and the title global net product sales, which grew by 50% and 62% respectively.\n\nDupixen global net product sales were 3.1 billion, up 33% reflecting strong growth across all approved indications. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share increased by 4%, including an unfavourable 77 [inaudible] impact from acquired IP R&D.\n\nBriefly discuss the launch of EYLEA HD, the progress we continue to make across our pipeline and our latest thinking on capital allocation. I will then hand the call over to George, Mary, and Bob who provide additional commentary on our pipeline developments, commercial execution, and our financial results for the quarter.\n\nStarting with EYLEA HD, which is off to a great start, we launched in late August shortly following FDA approval and recorded $43 million of net product sales in the final six weeks of the quarter, which compares favorably to recent launches in the retinal disease category.\n\nImportantly, revenues were driven by strong initial demand with multiple reorders by distributors before the end of the quarter. In addition, samples for EYLEA HD were made available shortly after the launch, enabling prescribers and patients to try out the product.\n\nEarly EYLEA HD utilization come from across the spectrum of [inaudible] age related [inaudible] generation and diabetic macular edema patients and momentum continues to build as positive real world clinical experiences accumulate. We have also made significant progress establishing access and reimbursement and we will continue to work on positioning EYLEA HD, the highest dose anti veg in therapy approved by the FDA as the new standard of care in these retinal diseases.\n\nMoving onto the recent progress we have made advances in our pipeline within hematology and oncology and our CD3 bispecific platform, the BLA for [inaudible] our CD20 by CD3 bispecific in certain lymphomas was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review with a March 31st PDUFA date assigned.\n\nWe also remain on track to submit a BLA next month for LINVOSELTAMAB, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma. With pivotal trials now under way for both programs to support potential accelerated approvals, we are preparing for two commercial launches next year.\n\nLast week, we reported a potential breakthrough for patients with profound congenital hearing loss. The first patient enrolled in the phase I/II two quart clinical trial of DB-OTO an investigational self selective adenovirus associated viral gene therapy, designed to provide durable physiological hearing to individuals with profound congenital hearing loss caused by mutations in the [inaudible] gene experienced hearing improvements six weeks after treatment compared to baseline. We are looking forward to continue to follow up with this patient as well as enrollment of additional patients to further validate this gene therapy approach. While [inaudible] gene deficiency is an ultra rare condition, we are hopeful that we can expand our approach to gene therapy in the year to more common genetic causes of profound hearing loss.\n\nFinally, regarding capital allocation, we continued to prioritize internal R&B investment. Given the strength of our balance sheet and anticipated future cash flows, we believe we have the flexibility to take additional actions to drive shareholder value. Beyond our ongoing share repurchase program, we continue to actively pursue emerging science and innovative platforms that compliment our core R&D strengths.\n\nIn addition to the [inaudible] acquisition, we announced last month an expanded research collaboration with Intellia combining our proprietary antibody targeted viral vector delivery technologies with Intellia's crystal platform to jointly explore and rebuild programs outside of the liver for neurological and muscular diseases.\n\nWe have always managed Regeneron with a focus on generating long term returns and we will continue to think carefully about how to strategically deploy our capital with the goal of delivering breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders.\n\nIn closing, we had a strong third quarter, the EYLEA HD launch is progressing well, our pipeline is delivering important innovations, and we continue to look at ways to efficiently allocate capital. With that, let me turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks Leonard. I'd like to start with our recent data update for EYLEA HD. \n\nAt the EU retina meeting last month, we presented the two year results from the Pulsar study and wet AMD, which demonstrated that the vast majority of EYLEA HD patients randomized at 12 and 16 weeks dosing continued to sustain vision and anatomic improvements through 96 weeks. 78% of all EYLEA HD patients were able to maintain at least every 12 week dosing intervals for the entire two year period with 88% assigned to at least every 12 week dosing by the end of the two year period. \n\nSimilarly, 70% of patients randomized every 16 week dosing at baseline were able to maintain at least at intervals through two years with 78% assigned to at least every 16 week dosing at week 96. Moreover, during the second year, many patients met the criteria for extension to even longer dosing intervals with 47% meeting the criteria for at least 20 weeks dosing intervals including 28% who were eligible for 24-week dosing.\n\nThe safety profile EYLEA HD remains consistent with EYLEA sustaining vision and anatomic improvements, while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over two years in both wet AMB and DME is a remarkable advancement to the patients and their physicians. We believe that these results give EYLEA HD the potential to become the new standard of care for these retinal diseases.\n\nMoving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline. On DUPIXEN and COPD, our first pivotal study met the primary to secondary endpoints in previously unprecedented success for biologics in a phase III study of patients with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of type two inflammation. \n\nBased on recent feedback from the FDA, in addition to the positive results from [inaudible] study, a positive interim analysis of the replicate based notice study would enable an SBLA submission. An independent data monitoring committee will conduct an interim analysis of the notice study later this year.\n\n[inaudible] are anti IL 33 antibiotics. The phase Aerify one and two studies remain on track for rehab and potential regulatory submissions in 2025. [inaudible] and DUPIXEN could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by leveraging their distinct mechanism of actions in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD disease progression and we look forward to the results of these studies.\n\nMoving to oncology and combinations with LIBTAYO, we remain on target and are currently enrolling our pivotal study of LIBTAYO combined with our [inaudible] antibody [inaudible] in first line metastatic melanoma. We believe this combination may provide a significant advance for patients in this setting based on our encouraging earlier stage studies.\n\nAt the annual ESMO meeting, we presented data from a phase two trial of Neo adjuvant [inaudible] treatment for [inaudible] squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, which demonstrated event free survival for the vast majority, 89% of patients at one year.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that of the 51% of patients who had a pathological complete response, none have since experienced disease recurrence. These results add to the growing body of evidence with LIBTAYO and other checkpoint inhibitors may have utility in earlier stages of CSCC and other malignancies.\n\nTo further explore this, we're conducting a LIBTAYO trial in adjuvant CSCC for patients with heightened risks. We're also validating the combination of LIBTAYO with [inaudible] in adjuvant melanoma and plan to initiate a study of this combination in the Peri optic melanoma setting as well.\n\nOnto bispecifics, first in hematology oncology, we are pleased that [inaudible] our CD20 by C3 bispecific was recently accepted for review by both the FDA and European regulatory authorities in relapse refractory follicular  lymphoma and [inaudible] lymphoma.\n\nBased on the pivotal phase two data from the [inaudible] study, we have initiated a robust Olympia [inaudible] development program investigating [inaudible] as monotherapy as well as in combination with current standards of care in order of lines of follicular lymphoma, and DL. DCL. We're looking forward to the pivotal data presentations from L2 later this year.\n\nWe're also on track to submit our regulatory application for LINVOSELTAMAB, our [inaudible] antibody for relapse refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. This bispecific may potentially offer best-in-class efficacy and convenience. The linker MM3 confirmatory phase three study [inaudible] LINVOSELTAMAB  mono therapy compared to a standard of care regimen is enrolling in studies in earlier lines with multiple myeloma and other plasma cells diseases will be enrolling soon.\n\nFinally, in addition to the ongoing phase one combination study of [inaudible] in our CD22 by CD20 inventory bispecific, we're also on track to initiate a study of LINVOSELTAMAB with the corresponding [inaudible] bispecific next year.\n\nNext, onto bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with LIBTAYO and other modalities. At ESMO, we shared initial clinical data for the combination of [inaudible] bispecific with LIBTAYO in advanced ovarian cancer. It is early data. Promising durable responses were observed [inaudible] mono therapy as well as encouraging combination activity with LIBTAYO with evidence of turnaround responses after initial progression on mono therapy reunions in multiple patients upon addition of LIBTAYO. A randomized phase two expansion study is ongoing to evaluate two active monotherapy doses of [inaudible] with the lower dose also tested in combination with LIBTAYO in order to optimize dosing and evaluate the potential added activity of LIBTAYO. In addition, we're exploring [inaudible] in multiple rare cancers that are known to express high levels of [inaudible].\n\nIn terms of our [inaudible] bispecifics for solid tumors, we are currently exploring multiple different CD28 [inaudible] bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials [inaudible] in combination with LIBTAYO with corresponding C3 bispecifics. We are continuing development of [inaudible] bispecific in advanced prostate cancer, focusing on identifying the window of opportunity for maintaining the remarkable anti-tumor activity observed [inaudible] so far while minimizing serious toxicity.\n\nIn order to explore this, we've expanded enrollment in the PSMA mono therapy cohort and will soon initiate cohorts [inaudible] will have an option of adding a low dose of [inaudible] to the PSMA by C280 treatment in certain patients. Moreover, we plan to initiate a trial combining PSMA CD28 with PSMA CD3 since based on preclinical data CD28 [inaudible] with appropriate CD3 bispecifics may yield anti tumor activity without severe immune related adverse events.\n\nWe also hope to progress an additional prostate [inaudible] bispecific towards the clinic in the next year, which we may also combine with our PSMA [inaudible] bispecific.\n\nIn terms of our [inaudible] by CD28 combination with ovarian cancer, we're planning on presenting initial data by the end of the year.\n\nRegarding our Egfr by CD28 in combination with LIBTAYO, we're planning on presenting updated dose escalation data in 2024. We will soon commence enrollment across eight tumor specific expansion cohorts in the study, including colorectal cancer with or without liver metastases as well as Egfr mutation in non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nNow to genetic medicines, we and Intellia recently announced expansion of our research collaboration to include Regeneron's proprietary antibody target delivery technology with the goal of expanding the reach of in vivo gene editing to neurological and muscle diseases. The aim of this expanded collaboration is to address a current bottleneck in genetic medicines, the inability to deliver genetic payload beyond the liver. Our proprietary preclinical validated antibody directed AV approach will initially test two in vivo non liver targets.\n\nAdditionally, we and Intellia announced FDA clearance to start a pivotal phase three trial of NTLA 2001 for the treatment of A2TR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, the first time an investigation of in vivo [inaudible] based gene therapy editing is cleared to enter a late stage clinical development in the United States. The trial is expected to initiate by year end 2023.\n\nMoving to our Alnylam collaboration, Alnylam recently presented updated interim ALN APP data in early onset Alzheimer's disease. Updated data showed that single doses of ALN APP achieved sustained robust reduction in APP Alpha and APP Beta measured in the CSS up to 10 months after administration as well as reduction of emetogenic peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease and in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\n\nAlnylam has also announced that the first patient has been redosed with ALN APP in the multidose portion of the study currently proceeding outside of the United States. We and Alnylam plan to initiate additional clinical programs for neurodegenerative diseases, including for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis next year.\n\nFinally, I would like to highlight DB-OTO, our oto feral and gene therapy, Regeneron's first clinical program for genetic hearing loss, which we developed over the last few years in collaboration with Decibel Therapeutics, a company we recently acquired. Last week, we announced the first preliminary results from this trial. A child who receives an injection of GB-OTO in one year experienced improvements in hearing tests in that ear through week six compared to baseline, including both auditory brain stem responses as well as behavioral audiometry. We're looking forward to continuing evaluation of this innovative approach in the ongoing trial for the ultra rare oto feral gene related hearing loss as well as in other planned clinical programs, which include more common forms of genetic hearing loss.\n\nIn conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early stage opportunities and we're looking forward to progress in the remainder of this year and looking ahead to 2024.\n\nWith that, I will turn it over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nI'm delighted to share details of our commercial performance in the third quarter including very encouraging early signals for EYLEA HD as well as ongoing results from our inline bands.\n\nStarting with our anti [inaudible] franchise, Regeneron achieved 1.49 billion in total net sales for the quarter in the US. We were excited to rapidly launch EYLEA HD in late August following its US approval and total net sales for the quarter was $43 million.\n\nEarly launch indicators have been very positive. Physician enthusiasm was extremely high prior to EYLEA HD's launch and that interest has translated into early use in a broad range of patient types across rev MMB and diabetic eye disease. It is worthy to physicians prescribing EYELEA HD [inaudible] switch and know your patients. We're already hearing anecdotal case reports from physicians whose [inaudible] patients are returning. Many of these patients have now been able to achieve [inaudible] that they were unable to obtain with other products.\n\nTo accelerate this early lunch momentum, our highly experienced team is rapidly advancing reimbursement in market access. We have confirmed paid claims from 100 per cent of Medicare jurisdictions, and many large payers have recently published coverage policy for EYLEA HD. This includes both Medicare advantage and commercial plans. While early, the speed of EYLEA HD coverage is significantly outpacing recent competitive launches. In addition, we continue to be on track to have [inaudible] by April 1, 2024, which we anticipate will drive additional updates.\n\nThese early reimbursement successes and positive physician experiences are being shared by prescribers this with our team and more broadly with the retina community. These initial results bode well for the future of EYLEA HD and a substantiate our belief that EYLEA HD will rapidly become the new standard of care across its approved indications.\n\nEYLEA HD unsurpassed safety and durability demonstrated in clinical trials, coupled with prescriber confidence in EYLEA's efficacy and safety record is expected to drive continued category leadership.\n\nIn summary, while the launch is still in early days, we are pleased with our progress and look forward to providing future updates.\n\n[inaudible] remains the category leader with 45% [inaudible] share for the quarter in an increasingly competitive market. With over 70 million injections worldwide since launch, EYLEA continues to demonstrate a strong and consistent safety profile, a key differentiator given retinal vasculitis and intra ocular inflammation events with certain new products introduced in the retinol category. EYLEA HD and EYLEA, our formidable retina franchise is poised for sustained leadership.\n\nNext to [inaudible] global net sales grew 33 per cent year over year to $3.1 billion and US net sales grew 30 per cent to 2.4 billion. This impressive third quarter performance demonstrates clinical and safety differentiation across all approved indications as well as its continued growth potential. In the third quarter more than 50,000 new patients are taking DUPEXIN in the US alone and there are now more than 750,000 patients on DUPEXIN worldwide. In atopic dermatitis, DUPEXIN's largest indication we continue to see more than 20 per cent growth six years post launch. Physicians have great confidence from the combination of efficacy, safety, and ease of use across all age groups, including as young as six months. Not only is it a remarkable adherence once patience begin therapy, we also see DUPEXIN as being the clear treatment of choice for new patients with moderate to severe disease with significant growth opportunity.\n\nIn asthma, DUPEXIN is differentiated from all other medicines in the category based on its rapid and sustained effect on lung function, reduced exacerbations, and reduced [inaudible]. In the US, DUPEXIN continues to lead new patient prescriptions and we are quickly approaching our goal of being the number one prescribed medicine for asthma.\n\nTogether with our partner [inaudible], Regeneron continues to [inaudible] recent launches in [inaudible], which are already meaningfully contributing to growth. Since the FDA's approval, approximately 20,000 new patients with [inaudible] esophagitis have been initiated and demand is also robust for [inaudible] where DUPEXIN is rapidly becoming the standard of care within a year of approval. We also look forward to offering DUPEXIN to even more patients in the future with anticipated regulatory approvals of pediatric as [inaudible] as well as multiple near term phase three data to read out on COPD [inaudible].\n\nIn summary, DUPEXIN continues to be a key driver of our growth and we look forward to seeing its transformational benefits extended to even more patients with type two inflammatory diseases across indications, demographics, and geographies.\n\nAnd finally to LIBTAYO, third quarter global net sales grew 59% year over year on a constant currency basis to $232 million with US net sales up 52% to $144 million. Global growth was driven by non-melanoma skin indications coupled with increased utilization in both mono therapy and chemotherapy combination settings in lung cancer. We're working to expand access and use in many additional countries following recent regulatory approvals. We continue to see a growing number of prescribers choosing LIBTAYO when treating their patients.\n\nIn conclusion, Regeneron's performance in the third quarter continued to deliver growth and value for patients and shareholders with opportunity for sustained growth. We're encouraged by favorable early indicators from the EYLEA HD launch and continue to deliver compelling performance from our inline brands, including EYLEA, DUPEXIN and LIBTAYO. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted.\n\nRegeneron performed well in the third quarter with execution across the business continuing to drive strong top and bottom line growth. Third quarter 2023 total revenues increased 15% year over year to 3.4 billion primarily driven by sales growth for depiction, coupled with improving margins within the SANAFI collaboration as well as continued growth from LIBTAYO..\n\nThird quarter diluted net income per share grew 4% to $11.59 on net income of $1.3 billion. This included $100 million dollar acquired IP R&D charge incurred in the third quarter of 2023, which decreased growth by approximately seven percentage points.\n\nMoving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Third quarter 2023, ex-US EYLEA net product sales were $872 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis versus the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the US.\n\nTotal SANAFI collaboration revenue was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 50 per cent versus the prior year, which included the final $50 million sales based milestone. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPEXIN and CAMZARA was $863 million, an increase of 57% versus the third quarter of 2022, driven by DUPEXIN's continued volume growth and improving margins.\n\nAs we guided last quarter, third quarter reimbursements for the manufacturing of commercial supplies from SANAFI, a component of SANAFI collaboration revenues declined sequentially, primarily due to the ongoing season of a new higher yielding manufacturing process.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect a continuation of this trend with reimbursements from manufacturing of commercials supplies expected to be sequentially lower by approximately 40 million.\n\nOther revenues were $138 million in the third quarter of 2023, up 62% versus the prior year and inclusive of $34 million reimbursements from BARDA for ongoing development of our next gen COVID antibody as per the agreement announced in August 2023.\n\nMoving now to our operating expenses. Third quarter 2023 R&D expense grew 17% year over year to $954 million, representing continued investment in our expanding pipeline. R&D growth was primarily driven by higher head count related costs in funding our advanced late stage pipeline as well as increased clinical manufacturing activity.\n\nSG&A grew 14% from the prior year to $534 million in the third quarter, reflecting higher headcount and related costs and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization.\n\nIn the third quarter, we recorded acquired IP R&D of 100 million, reflecting the payment of a development milestone tour collaborator Alnylam related to the phase one AON-AP program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. This impacted both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS by approximately 77 cents.\n\nThird quarter COCM was $212 million, up 20% versus the prior year driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher sales volumes from collaboration products, partially offset by lower DUPIXEN manufacturing costs.\n\nFourth quarter COCM is expected to be the lowest quarter of the year as we continue to transition to the higher yielding manufacturing process for DUPIXEN.\n\nNow to cash flow and the balance sheet. Through the third quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $3 billion in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $13 billion.\n\nWe continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, buying back 507 million and 1.9 billion of our shares in the third quarter in the first nine months of 2023 respectively with 1.8 billion remaining authorized under our existing share repurchase program.\n\nAdditionally, in the third quarter, we also announced and completed the acquisition of Decibel Therapeutics for approximately 100 million to strengthen our genetics medicine portfolio.\n\nAs Len mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to utilize our strong financial position and build upon our core competencies with the goal of delivering long term shareholder value.\n\nFinally, we've made some minor changes to our full year 2023 financial guidance based on our year-to-date results in our latest outlook, updating the guidance ranges for SG&A, R&D, gross margin, COCM, and capital expenditures. A complete summary of our latest full year 2023 guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning.\n\nAs we approach the end of 2023, I would like to provide some commentary on the preliminary outlook for 2024. We expect continued improvements in profitability from the SANAFI collaboration which will continue to accelerate the pay down at the antibody development balance, which as of September 30th, 2023 was approximately 2.5 billion.\n\nOnce this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step up in our share of SANAFI collaboration profits. Separately for [inaudible] we expect significant category in competitive pressures that negatively impact US sales in 2024.\n\nMoving to our operating expenses. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we continue to invest in our growing internal R&D pipeline to drive long term growth. As you just heard from George, our pipeline continues to broaden while our infrastructure to support that growth continues to expand. R&D investment in 2024 will be driven by advancing strategically important late stage programs such as our [inaudible] and LIBTAYO combination confirmatory key monk studies, including in earlier lines of therapy, our expanding collaboration in genetic medicine as well as higher clinical manufacturing costs and the continued expansion of our R&D organization. With this in mind, we expect year on year R&D growth in 2024 to be in the mid-teens compared  to our anticipated 2023 spend. We also expect to make additional investments in our commercial business and G&A functions to support the launch of EYLEA HD, [inaudible] launches in our international expansion.\n\nIn conclusion, Regeneron continues to deliver stronger results and our robust financial position allows us to make strategic investments to drive this growth over time. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you Bob. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure that we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we please go to the first question?\n\nTo withdraw your question, please press star one, one again. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. \n\nOur first question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO  Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nHi, guys. Thank you for giving me the question and congrats on all the progress. So you have over $15 billion of cash and marketable securities on your balance sheet, maybe Bob you could talk about how you think about capital allocation. I know interest rates are high but how else could you spend that money to drive even higher returns for Regeneron shareholders?\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, thanks Evan. I mean, I know, having dealt with you and certainly many of our investors, this is certainly an issue that we've been task to solve. Now obviously interest rates are a lot higher so obviously, what we're returning on that is certainly much better than kind of the days of 2020 and 2021. But you know we kind of stick to our knitting here with regards to our capital allocations. I mean, George just went through a plethora of obviously pipeline progress that we're making. Again, first and foremost, we're gonna make sure that that is fully funded to the extent possible on that. And then with regards to acquisitions, you heard with Len's intro I mean, we continue to look at a lot of opportunities. Certainly the market that is out there in the biotech tech space is not in the greatest shape as you know, so again, we think there are opportunities out there, but just because we have the means doesn't mean that we're gonna kind of push into something that may not give us an optimal result. It may not be kind of you know, we we like franchises as you've heard me say that before, so we need to make sure that it's the right fit with George and the team with regards to that, so we'll continue to do that. \n\nAnd you've seen our share repurchases of which we're at $1.9 billion through nine months. We've done that at a very good price with regards to how we're buying that back. We're very kind of scientific in our approach on that. We do think that stock continues to be undervalued given all the the pipeline progress and the catalysts that we have so we're going to continue to push that button going forward. So we're gonna stick to our knitting, but again, as Len kind of alluded to, we are looking at a lot of opportunities that are out there and if the right one makes the necessary fit then we'll move forward. And again, you kind of saw that with Checkmate and Decibels, albeit those were smaller, but again those were nice kind of franchise fits into the business.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nNext section please Shannon.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. \n\nMohit Bansal\n\nSenior Equity Analyst\n\nThank you for taking my question and congrats on the progress. My question is regarding the [inaudible], could you talk a little bit about the rationale behind that and [inaudible] or any other marker there? Thank you.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, so as you sort of hinted at, what we have realized is that all of the diseases that we are treating with DUPIXEN really are interrelated diseases that reflect a systemic disorder that is upregulation of so-called type two inflammation and in some cases it manifests in the lungs, in some cases in the skin, in some cases in the gut and so forth all over the body and in many cases, in most patients actually, in more than one location. And so in every disease that we're going after, including now as you mentioned in ulcerative colitis, we believe that there are a subset of patients who may be marked with type two inflammation in their gut. We are as you say utilizing biomarkers that might select out these patients and so we're going to see whether a subset of ulcerative colitis patients are driven by this type two inflammation that's driving all the other related manifestations of this systemic disorder.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks George. Move to the next question please Shannon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nChristopher J. Raymond\n\nAnalyst, Piper Jaffray & Co.\n\nYeah, thank you. Just maybe on DUPEXIN COPD, I think the last time we talked to you guys on this you were talking about the risk reward on taking an interim look on notice just given the alpha hit. It looks like you've decided to take that step here, but can you give us a sense of the alpha hit you are taking by doing this interim look? I mean, just looking at [inaudible] with a 30% reduction in exacerbations, it would seem to have a decent amount of room here and notice is tracking similarly, but if you can give us any more color on how you're thinking about this the risk reward of this decision and assume you're going to press release the result of that if it's gonna be the end of the year. Thanks.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah. I want to kind of get into the details of the statistical niceties and how you do this. An alpha sparing approach is what's typical for an interim analysis so we'll work closely with SANTAFI on how to do this in the most efficient manner possible and go to the information as appropriate when it appears.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks Len. Next question please Shannon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow of UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nColin Nigel Bristow\n\nAnalyst, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nHi, good morning, and congrats on the quarter. Not surprisingly, we've been getting a an increasing number of questions on your obesity assets and I was wondering if you could just talk to your strategy and level of enthusiasm here and maybe frame out some of the time lines when you think of the GOP 75, the [inaudible] antagonist, you shared some pretty provocative data at ADA on the myostatin blocker and the [inaudible] A blocker. Maybe you could just tell us your level of enthusiasm. Is this something that you're going to go full force and plan to have a major presence in down the road. Just some color there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, as you said, we're very excited about I guess two of the approaches that we've been taking in obesity. One is our unique collection of targets that we've either been the first to discover like the GPR 75 genetically identify target that came from our Regeneron genetic center, which is a very exciting new target for obesity, as well as our new approaches such as our [inaudible] receptor agonistic antibodies.\n\nOne thing we're doing is moving those programs forward and understanding exactly what their potential is in the field of obesity. But as you said, right now the field is dominated by this these [inaudible] one agonists, also is recognizing increasing problems with this type of weight loss. Meaning that about 40% of the weight loss is due to muscle loss. That means if you lose 20 pounds, eight pounds of that approximately on average will be muscle. Most patients will never get that muscle back. This can overtime, especially when patients go off these drugs and regain the weight as fat can create potentially a very large public health problem and dilemma. So we also have been, as you pointed out, very active in the field of muscle preservation and muscle growth agents. We've developed I think some of the most exciting candidates in the field that have the ability to do this and we are certainly considering how to study these muscle preservation and muscle growth agents in combination with existing weight loss agents to see whether we can maintain or even grow muscle in the setting of weight loss, hopefully, perhaps increasing the quality of the weight loss, maybe even resulting in even greater weight loss, but most importantly, making sure that the patients in terms of their muscle and so forth do a lot better. And we will be talking about our clinical trials in this area, we hope very shortly.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks George. Next question please Shannon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tyler Van Buren of TD Cowen. Your line is now open. \n\nTyler Martin Van Buren\n\nPrincipal & Senior Biotech Analyst, Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\n\nGreat. Thanks guys and congrats on the tremendous quarterly results. It's great to see the early sales of course, and you mentioned that may even switch patients are being treated. Are you saying switches from [inaudible specifically and to what extent are you guys sending samples out as we think about assessing additional demand beyond sales?\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks Tyler. So let me address the first part. The positive anecdotal case reports we're getting back really carry across the theme of better vision, better [inaudible] than they've seen with other anti [inaudible] products. They also comment on very frequently the tremendous confidence that they have in the safety of EYLEA and the experience over many, many years.\n\nIn terms of the switches, it's early days. We are seeing switches from EYLEA, as you would expect, and of course, we're the category leaders so they're more potential patients to consider as well. But we are also hearing switches from [inaudible]. We're also switches from AVASTIN and other products in the category and the early reports have been quite encouraging. \n\nTo the other part of your question related to sampling, we do have a sampling program for EYLEA HD. It's intended to give physicians experience with EYLEA HD in an appropriate way. The program is constructed on an on demand basis. We don't disclose the number of samples or things of that sort and certainly that's not what you were asking but I can share with you that we have seen a high conversion rate from practices ordering EYLEA HD samples and then subsequently placing orders of commercial products through commercial channels.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThank you Marion. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nMatt Score\n\nGreat. Thank you. This is Matt Score on for Terence Flynn. Thank you for taking our question. Quick one from us, could you provide an update on the timing or relative implications of the biosimilar EYLEA litigation with [inaudible]? Thank you.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, so we had a trial in West Virginia, a bench trial and we are waiting for a decision from the judge. It's out of our control and if it comes it'll come. It's been several months so it could come soon or not. It's one of those things where it's really beyond our ability to predict and control.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks Len. Next question Shannon. \n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open. \n\nCarter Lewis Gould\n\nLarge Cap Biotech Analyst, UBS Investment Bank, Research Division\n\nGreat. Good morning and congrats on all the progress. Maybe a follow up for Marion, thanks for all the color on the commercial dynamics for high dose EYLEA. One thing you didn't touch on as much though is sort of how maybe some of the stuff added language has evolved as that sort of tracking in line with what you were seeing with high dose EYLEA? Any broader commentary on how that's tracking relative to your expectations. Thank you.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSure. So as a quick reminder, as we get into payer mix, I'll remind everybody that these are approximate based on you typical patterns in the category. It's a little bit different when you look at a product that just launched. But about 45% of our overall business in Medicare fee for service. And as I mentioned to you in the call today, we've made great progress there, not only in coverage, which is the first step to get coverage, but then taking the extra step to make sure that claims are being paid, so we're seeing now that 100% of Medicare fee for service jurisdictions have coverage and demonstrated paid claims. \n\nWhen we go over to Medicare advantage, which is roughly about 25 per cent of anti budget category business and commercial which is about 20, what we're seeing so far and we are making good progress with payers, we're seeing that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands in the category and there are plans as you know that have a [inaudible] or utilization management. The good news is that EYLEA HD is being positioned consistently with EYLEA and other brands. We don't see a differentiation there.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nMarion, thank you. Next question Shannon please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Robin Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. \n\n>>Robyn Kay Karnauskas - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for the question. Question on CSU, I know, it's a big opportunity, many patients are not controlled well with antihistamine and you have a CRL. Does the study seem sufficient, anything in particular you'd think the FDA is I'm looking for? Is there a disconnect or are they changing what they do for the [inaudible] approval? What's your thoughts there? Thanks.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, well as you know, we had one very positive study, we had a second study that actually had a PA 0.049, but for various statistical purposes, just missed meeting it's predetermined statistical hurdle, but certainly all the indicators are going in the right direction. And what the FDA indicated that they wanted to see the results of our ongoing study-C as we call it to make their decision. And so what we're hoping is that that study, which is in the same population of the very positive initial study, remember the second study was in these [inaudible] patients, who had failed Xolair among other therapies, but study-C is in the same population is our very first study A, very positive study, and we're hoping that if we get consistent data in that study that the FDA will consider to look favorably upon it.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks George. Next question Shannon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nSalveen Jaswal Richter\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regards to your cancer portfolio as we look to additional data coming out at ASH and the proof of concept we've seen so far but the combination data that we're looking to with LIBTAYO, can you just talk to us about the optimizations still required here and how you're thinking about positioning it in the context of emerging targets and competitive dynamics? Thank you.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, we have a very large collection of combination opportunities that we're very excited about. The first one that we hope has a chance of really crossing the finish line in a very significant way, in a very significant population is our combination of LIBTAYO in combination with [inaudible]. Putting together these two checkpoints, the anti PD one and the anti lag three and I think in this case, we believe we have evidence that we have the best-in-class type of activity with both agents separately. And as you've hopefully seen in our earlier stage clinical trials, the data suggests that when we put them together, we really can make a remarkable advance for patients in terms of the number of patients who respond and the extent of their progression free survival. And we're now as we announced in a pivotal trial where we hope that within the next year, perhaps be able to provide the results from that trial, which might confirm this remarkable advance for patients. If it works in this first line melanoma setting, it really opens up the door to a whole series of other opportunities both related to melanoma settings, such as an even earlier stage melanoma setting, such as the adjuvant perioperative settings, but we can be moving to other cancers as well with that proof of principle. So that's the nearest term LIBTAYO check point combination approach.\n\nAs you know with our bispecifics the combination of opportunities there are also very exciting, either with LIBTAYO or with each other. And we have, in that space, shown that our individual agents, the important thing is we have now validated so many of our individual agents as having once again the potential for best-in-class type of activity, whether it's our agent for myeloma or our CD25 bispecific in for example, [inaudible] and so forth and so on. But we're also excited about our coast in bispecifics. We've released the data about the incredible advocacy in early stages that we see in combination with LIBTAYO, but that one is countered by concerns with new mediated adverse events that we're seeing in these patients. It is hard to dramatically increase the extent of immunotherapy benefit without having associated with increased auto immune type reactions. We're working very hard on that and we think based on preclinical data that the trick may be combining our [inaudible] with our CD3 bispecifics where we don't see these dramatic potential increases in the mechanisms that may lead to immune adverse events.\n\nSo in summary, our checkpoint combinations are very near term, our bispecifics to single agents have been validated and hopefully we will be being considered by the FDA for approval in the relatively near future and the combinations are beginning to demonstrate exciting opportunity and we're trying to tune that in order to try to present the best efficacy safety profile for patients.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nAlright, thank you George. Shannon please, the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Corey Abrahams\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Advisors LLC\n\nHey, guys. Congrats on the good launch so far and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned in the press release some impact of price on EYLEA, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on this, when you think this might stabilize and extent that this might affect high dose EYLEA as well. Thanks.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
    "content2": "Sure Brian. So I would comment that in an increasingly competitive category, there of course, has been some pressure on EYLEA. I'd also reflect that in 12 years in the market, it's really modest rebating and discounting if you look at the history of the brand and of course that's on a brand that has never taken a price increase but we will continue to be very much watching uptake of EYLEA HD, taking very responsible and appropriate and thoughtful measures on pricing. And certainly as I reported to early days we're making some very strong progress in the marketplace in terms of making sure that physicians gain confidence in the reimbursement of EYLEA HD as they initiate patients.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks Marion. Please move to the next question Shannon.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of [inaudible] with Guggenheim, your line is now open.\n\nUnknown\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Question on DUPIXEN, could you share your views on the mechanism for example, [inaudible] or perhaps longer acting version of DUPIXEN and the franchise, maybe if you can talk about your efforts in terms of lifecycle management of DUPIXEN. Thank you.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, maybe getting back to some of the comments that I made before, the collection of so called allergic or type two conditions, which DUPIXEN addresses are all characterized by a systemic inflammatory problem, increase in this so called type two inflammation, which if you look at the signs and the literature it's really of a residual pathway that largely evolved and was one of the most active parts of immune system to fight things like sequel parasites, which are really not an issue now in the developed world. This part of the immune system should essentially in the modern world be entirely quiesce, it serves almost no role. The problem is it becomes unleashed abnormally to do things that it shouldn't be doing like fighting allergies or attacking the skin or the gut in atopic dermatitis or [inaudible] esophagitis.\n\nWhat DUPIXEN does uniquely is that it controls and the data now demonstrate this incredible fact that it puts this useless angry tiger back in the cage where it belongs and that is why it has this incredible profile of not only advocacy, but safety because what it's shutting down is it's shutting down a pathway that should be residual in the modern world, but becomes unleashed and attacks all different parts of the body.\n\nWe believe that any of this current competition that's ongoing doesn't share these remarkable features that give DUPIXEN it's incredible broad  efficacy across the spectrum of diseases with its unique safety profile because all of these other approaches including for example, the [inaudible] 40  approach and so forth are addressing different fundamental immune pathways that are important in the immune systems function to do a lot of actually useful things in the modern world, like for example, fighting viral infections and cancer and so forth. So DUPIXEN really has a very unique profile, which if we can help explain and if all physicians and patients can understand that make it the perfect drug for this condition. It uniquely blocks this this residual pathway that gets out of control and appropriately and causes disease all over the body. DUPIXEN shuts down what should be a residual pathway and it helps disease, whether in the same patients it can be manifesting in the skin, in the lungs, and the nose, in the gut and  so forth, it shuts it down without really untoward effects with regards to the ability of the body to actually fight infections and so forth. In fact, if you look at our clinical studies and some of the data that we published in many, if not most cases, you actually see unbelievably reduced infections in the setting of the DUPIXEN treatment because what you're doing is you're putting the the bad part of the immune system back under control and you're allowing the rest of the immune system to do its function.\n\nAll of these other approaches are trying to attack critical parts of the immune system that have important other functions and they don't address the widespread problem that occurs systemically and causes all of these diseases. So as you've seen already with various agents, they may work in one of DUPIXEN's indications, but they don't work, they failed in other indications. And if they work, they also often come with the concerns about safety because they're designed to be immuno suppressive, which DUPIXEN is not.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nSo just add a small point to George's eloquent explanation of why DUPIXEN is such a special drug and the prediction that it would be safe because it's attacking the residual part of the immune system. You're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of three quarters of a million people on the drug, maybe more than that so that demonstrated the safety that is predicted by the science, including in children, as we know as young as six months to improve where it's been demonstrating not only incredible safety, but incredible efficacy.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nGreat points. Thank you. Shannon, I think we have time for two more questions please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\n\nDane Vincent Leone\n\nResearch Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\n\nThanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a strong quarter. This is actually really two quick ones from me. First one being, can you just comment whether you saw any impact from increased utilization biosimilar Ranibizumab during the quarter on EYLEA sales? A number of high volume clinics highlighted favorable margin opportunities from using more biosimilar, Ranibizumab, which seems to be essentially a transient impact and use of some of the brands, but would be interesting your commentary there. And then, we've gotten a just a lot of inbounds in terms of the ongoing patent litigation of EYLEA, could you just maybe state for us what your current expectation is for EYLEA patent life and just any thoughts you have on how the ruling that we're awaiting could actually impact your base case. Thank you.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nYeah, so I'll cover the patents and Marion can cover additional insight into the market place. On the patents, we're involved in litigation. There are a couple of key factors that are involved in this case that both relate to formulation as well as dosing. The base case for us is that we're assuming that the exclusivity will expire in May, but we will see what happens in the litigation which could be an upside obviously for the franchise.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nAlright and then [inaudible] impact, it's relatively early in their launches and there hasn't been a notable impact to the category. [inaudible] biosimilar shares in the low single digits area in the third quarter and certainly the impact has been seeing more relatively [inaudible] which has declining share but certainly this is not extended to EYLEA HD.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThanks, Marian. We'll just take our last question please Shannon.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question from the line of Brian Skorney with Bayer. Your line is now open. \n\nBrian Peter Skorney\n\nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. It looks like J&J had a really good first quarter of their myeloma bispecifics so it seems like there's a good demand there but also an element of having control of a lot of offerings for myeloma. So obviously [inaudible] in oncology, but with the initial launch of your bispecifics next year I'm just wondering what your strategy is for computing initial slate line as a third to market, do you think that there's differentiated enough data here on share or is the focus really on generating data in earlier lineup combos to kind of move up market share? Thanks.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nWell of course, it's both. We do believe that data rules both efficacy safety profile, but also convenience profile and we will be continuing to show our evolving and maturing data, which we believe could result in best-in-class in terms of efficacy, in terms of response rates, and complete response rates, in terms of safety, in terms of the frequency of cytokine release syndrome, and so forth, and in terms of differentiation in terms of mandated hospitalization. So we will be continuing to present our data. Of course, we'll see exactly ultimately what gets in the label and what the FDA supports but there's the potential here for best-in-class differentiation in terms of efficacy, safety, and convenience and schedule.\n\nAnd of course, as you said, we're also moving with we think an exciting program in earlier of lines of therapy and all of this is also going to be combined with the opportunities for our future combinations. We have a variety of coasting bispecifics that we're excited about combining specifically with this agent in the plasma cell Dyscrasia settings. So we think it's a very exciting opportunity. As you said, unfortunately there's a large opportunity out there because there's a lot of patients that are still in need. I think that if you have the best agent for late stage patients a lot of people will want to use it and then if we figure out the best program to demonstrate how it can be utilized in earlier stage patients that can certainly enhance that opportunity, let alone if we come up with one of our magic combos that really takes it to the whole next level.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nOkay, thanks George and thanks to everyone who dialed in today and for your interest in Regeneron. We apologize to those remaining in the queue that we did not have a chance to hear from, but as always, the Investor Relations team here is available to answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you once again and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."

My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Shannon. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. .\nAn archive of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly Shortly after the call ends. Joining me on today's call are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Board Co-Chair Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Board Chair Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.\nI would like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements of Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, revenue diversification, development is collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition.\nEach forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2023, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nIn addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding conciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release and our corporate presentation, which can be accessed on our website. The IR team will be available to answer further questions. With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ryan, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron delivered strong results across the organization in the second quarter of 2023 while continuing to make progress toward our long-term revenue and earnings streams.\nTotal revenues increased by 11% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by Sanofi collaboration revenues and Libtayo net product sales, which grew by 39% and 49%, respectively.\nNon-ILEA revenue contributions were 41% of total revenues. The highest proportion for any quarter in the last 10 years, excluding those with COVID antibody revenue contributions. Overall, we were pleased with the trajectory of the business and believe the company continues to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth.\nIn a few minutes, George, Marion and Bob will provide commentary on pipeline developments, commercial execution and financial results that we achieved during the second quarter. For the remainder of my remarks today, I will focus on aflibercept 8 milligrams.\nWe are very excited about the emerging clinical profile including the compelling 2-year data from the pivotal PHOTON study in patients with diabetic macular edema, which George will discuss in more detail.\nNow I will summarize the progress that has been made toward getting this important product candidate approved by the FDA. As we announced in late June, the Complete Response Letter, or CRL, that we received from the FDA regarding our biologic license application for aflibercept 8 milligrams for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, DME and diabetic retinopathy did not identify any issues related to aflibercept 8 milligrams clinical efficacy, safety profile, trial design, labeling or drug substance manufacturing nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data.\nThe CRL was entirely based on unresolved observations resulting from the May 2023 FDA pre-approval inspection of a third-party contract manufacturing organization, Catalent that we generally engage to complete vial filling for aflibercept 8 milligrams. The inspection observations were noted in a Form 483 and were related to a manufacturing line in Catalent's facility that is used to fill vials with the flibacet 8 milligrams as well as our C5 antibody, pozelimab, for the ultrarare chapel disease, which has a PDUFA date of August 20.\nThe inspection was conducted as part of the FDA review process for both the aflibercept 8-milligram BLA and the pozelimab BLA. Broadly speaking, the observations cited production and process control procedures, equipment validation and facility maintenance.\nWe, Catalent and the FDA have had multiple discussions since the aflibercept 8-milligram CRL. There is a clear understanding of the remediation work that is required to allow the FDA to resume approving BLAs that involve manufacturing on this line. Catalent has already provided data and information to the FDA that could satisfy some of these requirements and expect to be able to provide the remaining required data and information by mid-August.\nThe FDA said they will strive to complete their review expeditiously prior to the August 20 PDUFA date for pozelimab. However, if they are unable to complete their review before this date, the FDA said that they may need to extend their review by up to 3 months.\nIf they do extend the review, FDA has stated that they will continue to prioritize the review and complete it as early as possible.\nImportantly, the FDA has also stated that their review of the Catalent manufacturing data in the context of the pozelimab BLA will support actions for both the pozelimab BLA and the Aflibercept 8-milligram BLA resubmission, which has already been submitted. In summary, we and Catalent expect to submit by mid-August, all of the Cana manufacturing data and information required to address the observations resulting from the preapproval inspection.\nThe FDA has stated that they will try to complete their review expeditiously prior to August 20. If not, we anticipate the FDA will act on pozelimab and Aflibercept 8-milligram BLAs before the end of the third quarter.\nIn closing, we remain confident in our strategy of focusing investment on our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential external collaborations as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Len. I would like to start with our recent update on the aflibercept 8-milligram data in DME that Len referred to. At the Annual American Society of Retina Specialists Meeting, we presented the 2-year results from our PHOTON study. These data demonstrated that the vast majority aflibercept 8-milligram patients randomized to the 12-week and 16-week dosing intervals continued to sustain vision and atomic improvements through 96 weeks. Of all aflibercept 8-milligram patients were able to maintain at least every 12-week dosing intervals for the entire 2-year period, while 84% of patients assigned to every 16-week dosing at baseline, we're able to maintain that interval or extend beyond it.\nOn that point, many patients met the criteria for extension to longer intervals with 44% meeting the criteria for greater than 20-week dosing intervals, including 27% who are eligible for 24-week dosing. The safety profile of aflibercept 8-milligram remained consistent with EYLEA. Sustaining vision and anatomic improvements while maintaining such extended dosing intervals over 2 years is unprecedented in the field.\nOur results further strengthen the clinical profile of aflibercept 8-milligram and position this investigational medicine to become the future standard of care for retinal diseases. Later in the third quarter, we and bear our plan to share initial results from the second year analysis of the PULSAR study in patients with wet AMD.\nMoving to our immunology and inflammation pipeline on Dupixent. We look forward to the FDA decision for our sBLA in chronic spontaneous Arteria by October 22, 2023. In terms of DUPIXENT in patients with COPD, we and Sanofi are pleased to announce that DUPIXENT was granted breakthrough designation for uncontrolled COPD with a near synetelotype based on the positive results of the Phase III BORIS study.\nBased on ongoing discussions with the FDA, we expect that in addition to the FOURIER study results, we will need to provide data from the Replicate Phase III notice study to support a BLA and such data requirements remain under discussion with the FDA.\nWe continue to expect final results for the NOTA study by mid-2024. Moving to itepekimab, our anti-IL-33 antibody, which is being evaluated for COPD and former smokers. In May, Sanofi announced that the Phase III RIP1 and 2 studies had passed an interim futility analysis. These studies remain on track for readout and regulatory submissions in 2025. And both itepekimab and DUPIXENT could transform the treatment paradigm for COPD by levering their distinct mechanism of action in reducing different types of inflammation that contribute to COPD.\nMoving to oncology and combinations with Libtayo. In June, in an oral presentation at the ASCO conference, we presented data for the combination of fianlumab, our LAG-3 antibody plus Libtayo which showed consistent response rates ranging from 56% to 63% across 3 independent cohorts of advanced melanoma patients including a new cohort of patients who had received prior anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant melanoma setting.\nThese response rates represent about double the rate historically seen with anti-PD-1 monotherapy in similar settings, and clinically meaningful responses were observed in post-hoc analysis of various populations of interest including patients with poor prognosis factors and varying tumor PD-L1 expression levels.\nThe safety profile of fianlamab and the Libtayo combination in these cohorts appears to be generally consistent with the safety profile of the tile monotherapy and other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agents, except for the higher rates of adrenaline sufficiency, which were grade to or lower in the majority of cases.\nWith all cases successfully managed with steroid replacement. Our Fianilabplus LeTAO Phase III studies in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma are enrolling patients as are the Phase II portions of the Phase II/III studies in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.\nNext, on to bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo and other modalities. Later this year, we are planning to share initial clinical data for the combination of ubumatimab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific plus of tile in advanced ovarian cancer.\nLast year, we showed encouraging rubumatimab monotherapy data in advanced ovarian cancer, and we believe that combining it with Libtayo may lead to enhanced antitumor activity.\nMoving to coast inventory bispecifics. We are currently exploring multiple different CD28 coast inventory bispecific antibodies in early clinical trials in a variety of tumor settings in combination with Libtayo, or with corresponding CD3 bispecifics.\nIn our Phase I study of ReGen 5678, our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific in advanced prostate cancer in combination with Lithia which has demonstrated promising antitumor activity. The safety profile of this combination continues to pose a challenge, highlighted by a recently observed second grade 5 adverse event or death. Although serious immune-mediated adverse events continue to be highly correlated to patients who experience profound responses, we have decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients with the full dose Libtayo combination.\nAnd explore PSMA by Seaway combination with lower doses of Libtayo. We also will continue to explore PSMA by CD28 as a monotherapy where we are seeing antitumor activity in some patients and we will explore PSMA by CD20 in combination with other immunotherapy modalities.\nWe believe our prostate cancer data support the exciting potential of cost inventory bispecifics, but with the challenge of focusing the response sold to the tumor. Our preclinical studies and mechanistic insights suggest a degree of immune-related adverse events seen when combining costims with PD-1 blockade may depend on the particular cost on target and tumor type.\nMoreover, combining costims with CD3 bispecifics may not result in these types of severe immune-mediated adverse events. Along these lines, our other cost inventory bispecific programs continue, including our MUC16 by CD28 costim with Libtayo and our Moxi team by stay cotiniubumatimab, both in ovarian cancer. As well as our EGFR by CD28 costim with Libtayo in colorectal and other cancers.\nIn these early dose escalation studies, we have observed limited immune-mediated toxicities to date. We're also excited about combining our cost inventory bispecifics with our CD3 bispecifics in our hem/onc programs, which continue to progress. We have initiated dosing of our CD22 CD20 costimutor bispecific with 1 our CD20xCD3 bispecific in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope can improve on the impressive efficacy demonstrated by odrneximab alone in that setting.\nIn terms of argenexatan monotherapy, U.S. and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma remain on track. Regarding livoseltumab, or BA by C3bspecific, we recently presented updated data at the ASCO annual meeting, demonstrating early, deep and durable responses in patients with heavily pretreated a myeloma with 71% objective response rate and 59% of patients achieving a very good partial response or better at the recommended 200-milligram dose with a median follow-up of only 6 months with the data potentially improving as they mature.\nWe believe these data support limvoseltimab's best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety, hospital requirements and favorable dosing schedule. In the fourth quarter of this year, we are planning to present additional data with longer follow-up and to submit regulatory applications for limboseltamab.\nWe also plan to start combination sites with a myeloma-specific costim next year.\nNext, to genetic medicines. In the second quarter, we and Alnylam jointly announced the first human data suggesting that an siRNA can be used to silence pathological genes in the brain. Which may open up an entirely new approach for fighting back against neurodegenerative and other central nervous system diseases.\nWe plan to initiate additional clinical programs for CNS diseases next year. As announced by our collaborators at Intellia, we plan to initiate the first in vivo CRISPR-based Phase III clinical program by year-end. Subject to regulatory feedback in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy.\nAnd in terms of our targeted gene delivery pipeline, we hope to initiate our first clinical program in 2024 for hemophilia B.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues to grow and deliver differentiated late and early-stage opportunities, and we are looking forward to several important clinical milestones in the second half of this year.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. In the second quarter, Regeneron delivered impressive results across our commercial portfolio. Notably, Regeneron medicines currently lead multiple disease categories and our future is promising with short- and longer-term scientific innovations on the horizon.\nAs Len mentioned, we eagerly await the anticipated approval of aflibercept 8-milligram for retinal diseases. Beyond that, a robust late-stage pipeline supports additional commercial opportunities that we anticipate will continue to drive growth.\nStarting with EYLEA, the anti-VEGF category leader in retinal diseases U.S. IDEA net sales were $1.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. EYLEA total category share's remained stable at 46% over the last 2 quarters and at approximately 70% for branded share. At the end of the second quarter, there was minimal sequential change in wholesaler inventory levels compared to the levels at the end of the first quarter.\nOur strategic focus is to maintain and grow Regeneron's anti-VEGF leadership, and we're well positioned to deliver on this goal in an increasingly competitive category. Last week at ASRS, we presented our 2-year data in diabetic macular edema, which further confirmed the unprecedented durability of aflibrisib 8 milligram, with 44% of patients has signed intervals of at least 20 weeks at the end of their second year.\nMarket enthusiasm remains high for this important innovation and our commercial team is ready and excited to launch aflibercept 8-milligram upon approval.\nMoving now to Litao Global net sales were $210 million, up 49% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales were $130 million, up 43% and driven by steady growth in non-melanoma skin cancer and strong growth in lung cancer. In lung cancer Libtayo use in new patient shares accelerating both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. With an expanding base of prescribers in the community and academic settings. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales were $80 million, a 58% increase on a constant currency basis Growth was driven by demand in the non-melanoma skin cancer indications and initial launches in lung cancer.\nWe expect to drive accelerated performance as we build Regeneron's presence in key international markets and secure access and reimbursement for lung cancer indications. And lastly, to DUPIXENT, which continues to revolutionize the lives of patients with type 2 diseases Global net sales were approximately $2.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nIn the U.S., net sales grew 33% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, driven by growth across all indications and age groups. Once again, DUPIXENT is the #1 prescribed biologic medicine for new-to-brand patients across all approved indications and is the category leader in total prescriptions in 4 out of 5 indications. We see impressive uptake across our recent U.S. launches with significant opportunity for future growth.\nIn eosinophilic esophagitis, well over 15,000 patients have been initiated since launch, and we are actively investing in disease awareness initiatives to empower patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for this debilitating disease. Our Paragua Nagel launch is off to a fast start with physicians rapidly recognizing DUPIXENT as the go-to treatment for this often underdiagnosed dermologic conditions.\nAdditionally, we look forward to our October 22 PDUFA date in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where we estimate DUPIXENT could benefit up to 300,000 U.S. patients. We also continue to generate impressive growth across atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps, DUPIXENT's 3 largest indications.\nThere is robust demand among all indicated age groups with a significant opportunity for future growth beyond the hundreds of thousands of patients around the world whose lives have already been transformed by DUPIXENT.\nIn summary, we delivered a strong commercial performance in the second quarter with Regeneron's Medicines position for sustained growth. We continue to demonstrate industry-leading execution across our current portfolio, and we are prepared to maximize opportunities from our robust pipeline with the goal of extending Regeneron's scientific innovations to even more patients. Now I will turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron's second quarter results demonstrate continued growth and strong financial performance across the organization.\nSecond quarter 2023 total revenues increased 11% and year-over-year to $3.2 billion, driven by strong DUPIXENT sales growth, coupled with improving profitability within our Sanofi collaboration and continued momentum from Libtayo.\nSecond quarter diluted net income per share was $10.24 on net income of $1.2 billion. Moving to collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2023 ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $886 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $377 million, of which $350 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S.\nTotal Sanofi collaboration revenue was $944 million in the second quarter and grew 39% versus the prior year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZAR was $751 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter of 2022, reflecting higher volumes and an improving margin profile for DUPIXENT.\nWe expect further margin expansion from the collaboration driven by continued DUPIXENT global sales growth, coupled with higher gross margins due to significant drug substance yield improvements resulting from dupilumab manufacturing process enhancements. These factors are also contributing to a gradual increase in the rate in which we are repaying the antibody development balance to Sanofi.\nOnce this balance is fully repaid in the next few years, we expect a meaningful step-up in our share of Sanofi collaboration profits. Recall that a portion of our Sanofi collaboration revenue is related to the manufacturing of commercial supplies for which we are reimbursed by Sanofi as we continue to phase in the higher yield manufacturing process for DUPIXENT. We expect these second half reimbursements to be approximately 25% lower than the first half of 2023, with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year.\nOther revenues were $69 million in the second quarter, up 17% versus the prior year. We continue to expect other revenue to be higher in the second half of 2023 as compared to the first half Recall that other revenue primarily includes reimbursements for the manufacturing of certain Regeneron discovered products commercialized by other companies, including ex-U.S. PRALUENT Arcelis and Zaltrap as well as royalties for Alaris and in our share of global profits for Arcilist.\nMoving now to our operating expenses. Second quarter 2023. R&D expense was $974 million, representing continued investment in our robust pipeline. Year-over-year R&D growth was primarily driven by higher head count and related costs in funding of the company's pipeline, which encompasses approximately 20 late-stage or potentially registrational studies, including our ongoing aflipercept-8 mg studies. Phase III studies in earlier lines of therapy for our hem/onc product candidates and our advancing fianlimab development program.\nThe increase in R&D expense was also driven in part by the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Sanofi collaboration agreement and increased manufacturing activity associated with the company's earlier stage product candidates. SG&A was $562 million in the second quarter, reflecting the ongoing build-out of our ex U.S. operations following the acquisition of global rights to Libtayo last year, higher head count and related costs and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization.\nSecond quarter 2023 COCM was $213 million, up 44% versus the prior year. driven by manufacturing costs associated with higher DUPIXENT volumes. As we progress the phasing of the improved manufacturing process for DUPIXENT, we expect COCM in the second half of this year to decline versus the first half as our unchanged 2023 COCM guidance reflects with the fourth quarter expected to be the lowest of the year.\nNow to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first half of 2023, Regeneron generated approximately $2.1 billion in free cash flow we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $12.6 billion. We continue to opportunistically deploy cash towards share repurchases and throughout the second quarter buying back $723 million of our shares. At current levels, we remain buyers of our shares.\nAnd as of June 30, approximately $2.3 billion remained available for repurchases under our existing authorization.\nFinally, we've made some minor changes to our full year 2023 guidance ranges based on our first half results and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year, we have tightened guidance ranges for 2023 SG&A and R&D spend and provided updated guidance ranges for our effective tax rate.\nA complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron delivered positive financial results in the second quarter of 2023 and and we remain excited for the potential upcoming launch of aflibercept 8 mg in the third quarter. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Bob. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will only be able to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Shannon, can we go to the first question, please?",

My name is Josh, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ryan Crowe, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Josh. Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to everyone listening around the world. Thank you for your interest in Regeneron and welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. An archive of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website shortly after the call ends.\nJoining me today are Dr. Leonard Schleifer, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. George Yancopoulos, Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer; Marion McCourt, Executive Vice President and Head of Commercial; and Bob Landry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for Q&A.\nI would like to remind you that remarks made on today's call may include forward-looking statements about Regeneron. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, those related to Regeneron and its products and business, financial forecast and guidance, revenue diversification, development programs and related anticipated milestones, collaborations, finances, regulatory matters, payer coverage and reimbursement issues, intellectual property, pending litigation and other proceedings and competition.\nEach forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected in that statement. A more complete description of these and other material risks can be found in Regeneron's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC this morning. Regeneron does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nIn addition, please note that GAAP and non-GAAP measures will be discussed in today's call. Information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our financial results press release and our corporate presentation, which can be accessed on our website. Once our call concludes, Bob Landry and the IR team will be available to answer further questions.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Following our significant achievements in 2022, Regeneron is off to a good start in 2023, highlighted by important regulatory and pipeline advances, commercial execution and prudent capital allocation, all of which position better the company to deliver sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value over time.\nGeorge, Mary and Bob will cover details of our first quarter performance in a few moments. In the meantime, I would provide an update on our goal of continuing to grow our business while simultaneously diversifying our revenue and earnings streams, which is part of our long-term vision for Regeneron.\nWe have made substantial progress toward achieving that goal. Over the past 4 years, while total revenues have nearly doubled, EYLEA accounted for only 57% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 88% of total revenues for the year 2019. Driven primarily by the growth of Dupixent, our Sanofi collaboration accounted for 25% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 compared to only 6% of our total revenues in 2019. We expect this trend of revenue growth, along with diversification to continue.\nFor example, assuming the approval and successful launch of aflibercept 8 milligrams, which has a June 27 PDUFA date, EYLEA 2 milligrams is expected to become a smaller share of our revenues, while aflibercept 8 milligrams is expected to contribute to overall revenue growth. In addition, Dupixent remains in a high-growth mode, with global net product sales up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all 5 approved indications. We believe the positive Phase III results for Dupixent in the subpopulation of COPD patients with evidence of type 2 inflammation, as well as the promising results for our IL-33 antibody [ hittepecimab ] in former smokers represent additional significant opportunities to accelerate revenue growth as well as diversification.\nOur oncology portfolio is also starting to make a meaningful contribution to our top line, with last year's acquisition of full global rights to Libtayo and the recent launch of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Moreover, we believe that [indiscernible], our LAG-3 antibody, in combination with Libtayo, has the potential to become an important therapy in both melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where we have already advanced to pivotal studies.\nWe are also quite excited about the emerging clinical profile for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. Updated data for which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting. We remain on track to submit a BLA seeking accelerated approval in late-stage myeloma later this year.\nWe continue to invest in our research and development engine and expect it will deliver new differentiated medicines that will drive organic growth over time. Our broad development pipeline of nearly 3 dozen programs spans many different therapeutic areas and modalities, notably: Our co-stimulatory bispecifics in cancer; our early pipeline in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; as well as our collaborations with Alnylam, Intellia, [indiscernible] and others are expected to drive medium- and long-term revenue growth, profitability and diversification.\nBefore handing over to George, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the contributions that Dr. Roy Vagelos has made to Regeneron over the nearly 3 decades that he has served as our Board Chair. Over the years, he has provided invaluable guidance and he continues to inspire us as we work to turn world-class science into medicines. Roy will retire from the Board after his current term ends next month. At that time, in addition to our current roles in the company, George and I will be appointed by the Board to serve as co-Chairs, and Christine Poon, a member of Regeneron board since 2010, will be appointed as the board's Lead Independent Director.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nFounding Scientist, President & Chief Scientific Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Len. The first quarter of 2023 delivered multiple significant milestones for Regeneron and for our collaborations, from the positive Dupixent Phase III COPD data to progress in our oncology pipeline, as well as exciting new landmarks from our genetic medicines programs.\nStarting with Dupixent. In March, together with our Sanofi collaborators, we announced that Dupixent was the first immune mechanism of action treatment to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a Phase III trial for COPD in over a decade. Our [ BORIS ] trial enrolled COPD patients with moderate to severe disease and evidence of type 2 inflammation. Dupixent-treated patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful 30% reduction in exacerbations, a significant improvement in lung function as well as quality of life benefits: An impressive trifecta in a potential paradigm-changing treatment for this deadly disease. We are looking forward to presenting the detailed BOREAS results in a late-breaking presentation at the upcoming American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. We also plan to discuss these exciting results with regulatory authorities and expect to report results mid next year for the replicate Phase III NOTUS study.\nI would remind you that we are also trying to address an overlapping COPD population with our IL-33 antibody, which is in Phase III studies based on positive Phase II proof-of-concept data. This approach is further supported by genetic analysis from our Regeneron Genetics Center, which demonstrated association of loss of function in [indiscernible] with reduced COPD risk. Similar genetic analysis supported the role for a Dupixent benefit in COPD.\nthe BOREAS COPD data indicates that Dupixent can help even more patients beyond the 5 current FDA-approved indications and diseases caused or exacerbated by type 2 inflammation, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. We are also expecting an FDA decision for Dupixent for chronic spontaneous urticaria on October 22, 2023, and we are continuing to tailor Dupixent development to patients with other type 2 inflammatory diseases, most likely to be responsive to this method.\nMoving to oncology. With the progress of our late and early stage pipeline, we are looking forward to several important milestones this year. Starting with Libtayo. In addition to expanded use in lung cancer, Libtayo was recently added to the NCCN guidelines for neoadjuvant treatment of CSCC. The Libtayo U.S. label was also recently updated with more mature CSCC and BCC data, supporting its differentiated clinical profile in these tumor settings and satisfying all post-marketing commitments that require full approval in these indications.\nRegarding our exciting new combinations with Libtayo. Starting with fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibodies, for which we are planning a broad pivotal program spanning several cancer indications. These efforts were triggered by our robust and confirmed data in first-line metastatic melanoma patients, which will be presented in further detail at ASCO, suggesting that the fianlimab-Libtayo combination could produce about double the response rates with longer progression-free survival, the anti-PD monotherapy standard. Based on this, we have already initiated pivotal trials in metastatic and adjuvant melanoma, and we will start a study in perioperative melanoma in the second half of the year. In addition, based on promising data in small patient cohorts, we started a seamless Phase II/III pivotal study for treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and we will soon start a Phase II study in the perioperative setting.\nNext, the bispecifics for solid tumors, which are being investigated in combination with Libtayo. Earlier this year, ASCO's GU represented initial positive first-in-human data for our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in advanced prostate cancer, the tumor type considered immunologically cold and largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Over the next 12 months we plan to present updated PSMAxCD28 8 data in more patients, some of which will have been prophylactically treated with our anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, [indiscernible] it, to potentially reduce the severity of immune-mediated side effects while maintaining or improving antitumor activity. Also during this time frame, we plan to present data in advanced ovarian cancer for both our MUX16xCD3 bispecific in our MUX16xCD3 co-stimulatory bispecific as well as data in several tumor types from our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, or in combination with Libtayo.\nOur hematology oncology pipeline continues to advance. In an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO Annual Meeting, we will present updated data for linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific tested in late-line multiple myeloma. We believe these data will show that linvoseltamab has the best-in-class potential with differentiated efficacy, safety and a favorable dosing schedule in the competitive environment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatment candidates. We remain on track for a regulatory submission in the United States in the second half of this year for linvoseltamab.\nFor odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, we are on track to complete U.S. and EU regulatory submissions for both relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the second half of this year. Odronextamab in late-line relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile, and our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved our generic safety profile without impacting efficacy. Also, we have initiated a first-in-human study of our CD20xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL, which we hope could further improve upon the anticancer benefit for these patients.\nNow to genetics medicines. Starting with our collaboration with Alnylam, and siRNA therapeutics. Just last week, we and Alnylam announced an important update for our Alnylam APP program in early onset Alzheimer's disease. For the first time, an RNAi therapeutic demonstrates sustained silencing of a pathological gene in the central nerve system in a clinical trial. In the earnings call this morning, our Alnylam collaborators provided additional details on these results. Our siRNA approach aims to prevent production of amyloid precursor protein as opposed to clearing existing amyloid plaques after they have already formed, providing a new way to potentially address Alzheimer's disease, which will still have a devastating impact on patients and their families even with the emergence of amyloid-clearing antibodies.\nPatients treated with single dose of ALN-APP experienced dose-dependent, rapid and sustained reduction of up to 90% in APP production as assessed by biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. The safety and tolerability profile with single dosing is encouraging so far. While the multi-dose Part B portion of the study is on partial clinical hold in the United States due to finding reserved in prior nonclinical chronic toxicology studies, Part B has already received regulatory approval to proceed in Canada, where the majority of the part A clinical trial patients had been enrolled. Detailed results from the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting. We are looking forward to advancing additional development candidates for the many other neurodegenerative diseases that currently have few or no therapeutic options such as other targets for Alzheimer's as well as for ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's.\nIn addition to these exciting developments in central nervous system diseases, we are continuing our progress with liver targeted medicines, including our broad and multipronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We're enrolling a Phase II study of ALN-HSD in NASH patients with genetic risk factors, continuing in development of ALN PNP, and we are planning to progress additional more recently genetically validated NASH targets as well.\nFinally, I would like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics' discover, develop and commercialize regulatory T cell therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This collaboration will bring together our industry-leading technologies for the discovery and characterization of fully human antibodies and T cell receptors, as well as our additional biologics candidates with Sonoma's pioneering approach to developing and manufacturing gene modified T reg cell therapies.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine truly continues its productivity in both late and early-stage pipeline. Before turning the call over to Marion, I would also like to thank Roy Vagelos for serving as a role model for all of us at Regeneron as well as for so many others across the industry. I hope that we can continue to live up to the high stage that Roy has set over his distinguished career.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nSenior VP & Head of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Our first quarter performance demonstrates ongoing leadership across multiple therapeutic categories. Taken together, our in-market brands anticipated near-term launches and extensive development pipeline uniquely position Regeneron to expand our leadership across multiple disease areas.\nFirst quarter EYLEA U.S. net product sales declined 6% year-over-year to $1.43 billion. On a sequential quarter basis, EYLEA U.S. net product sales decreased 4%, reflecting the favorable impact of higher demand volume, offset by lower sequential wholesaler inventory levels, higher sales-related deductions and increasing competitive pressure. EYLEA captured approximately 70% branded share in the first quarter.\nBased on presentations at scientific meetings, the retina community has expressed increasing enthusiasm about Regeneron's portfolio with the aflibercept 8-milligram PDUFA date, now 7 weeks away. EYLEA is the well-established gold standard anti-VEGF treatment and aflibercept 8-milligram has the potential to be as paradigm changing as EYLEA when it was introduced more than a decade ago. In clinical trials of aflibercept 8-milligram demonstrated improvements in visual acuity with less frequent injections and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA, exactly what retina specialists have told us they need in a next-generation medicine. Launch preparations are well underway, and we look forward to bringing this important treatment option to patients following FDA approval.\nOn Libtayo, which is foundational to Regeneron's oncology portfolio, first quarter global net product sales grew 49% on a constant currency basis, reaching $183 million, which includes $6 million from Sanofi transition sales in international markets. In the U.S., net sales grew 39% to $110 million. Libtayo continues to lead the market in both advanced CSCC and advanced BCC as demand volume increases. Following last November's FDA approval of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer, new patient starts have accelerated as physicians of Libtayo has an important new treatment option, initiatives to raise brand awareness and improve access have driven share gains in both the academic and community settings.\nOutside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 67% on a constant currency basis to $73 million, driven by steadily increasing demand and additional country launches. The European Commission recently approved Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for PD-L1 positive lung cancer, and we are in the process of securing access and reimbursement for this new indication.\nTurning to Dupixent. First quarter global net sales grew 40% on a constant currency basis to $2.49 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 43% to $1.9 billion, with notable volume growth across all approved indications. Driven by its outstanding efficacy and safety profile, Dupixent is the #1 prescribed biologic for new patients in all 5 of its approved indications. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the leading systemic treatment based on its unique mechanism of action, clinical profile and real world experience. Strong prescribing trends continue across moderate and severe disease and across approved age ranges. There's also significant opportunity to further increase market penetration as Dupixent is uniquely positioned to provide an effective, safe and convenient treatment for patients 6 months and older.\nIn prurigo nodularis, Dupixent is the only FDA-approved systemic treatment. Launch update is progressing well, and we anticipate ongoing growth as we leverage our dermatology commercialization capabilities for patients in need. Across the competitive asthma space, Dupixent continues to gain market share as naive and biologic switch patients are initiated on treatment. Dupixent also continues to capture the majority of market demand in nasal polyps with increased prescribing from allergists and ENTs. Our cytosolic esophagitis launch is exceeding expectations. In the first year following U.S. approval, more than 11,000 patients have initiated therapy, demonstrating extensive unmet patient need and our strong launch execution and collaboration with Sanofi. Both gastroenterologist and analogists have embraced Dupixent as the new standard of care setting meaningful improvements in disease symptoms and quality of life for those now on therapy. A new patient campaign is underway to raise awareness of the scientific advancements in treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.\nOutside the U.S., Dupixent net sales were $587 million, growing 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across approved indications and launches in new geographies. Recent European approvals of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis in young children are expected to contribute to Dupixent's ongoing growth. In summary, our commercial portfolio continues to diversify across many serious medical conditions and delivered solid results in the quarter. Moving forward, we are well positioned to serve even more patients driven by the strength of our existing portfolio, coupled with anticipated launches that have the potential to advance standards of care.\nWith that, I'll turn the call to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.\nRegeneron performed well in the first quarter of 2023 with solid financial results. First quarter total revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion as Dupixent and Libtayo contribute to increasingly diversified revenue and earning streams. First quarter diluted net income per share was $10.09 on net income of $1.2 billion, which included a previously announced $0.42 impact of acquired IPR&D.\nBeginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. First quarter 2023 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $847 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter 2022. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $357 million, of which $332 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $798 million in the first quarter and grew 26% versus last year's first quarter, which included a $50 million sales milestone that did not recur this year. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and [indiscernible] was $637 million, an increase of 53% versus the prior year. We continue to see increasing profitability from our antibody collaboration and expect further margin expansion as we begin to realize drug substance yield improvements from a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for Dupixent.\nFinally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $222 million in the first quarter for our share of gross profits from ex U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. We do not expect to record any additional revenue from Ronapreve in 2023, absent a new contract.\nMoving now to operating expenses. First quarter 2023 R&D expense increased 28% year-over-year to $960 million as we continue to invest in our pipeline to drive organic growth. The increase in R&D was primarily driven by higher headcount and related costs and funding of the company's growing pipeline, which now encompasses approximately 35 programs in clinical development in more than 15 ongoing late-stage studies with additional study starts expected this year. These late-stage programs include our expanding fianlimab development program, upcoming Phase III studies and early reliance for our hem/onc assets, as well as ongoing development programs for Dupixent and itepekimab for which we now record our full 50% share of development costs as a result of the Libtayo transaction.\nSG&A expense increased 32% year-over-year to $515 million due to higher contributions to an independent, not-for-profit patient assistance organization, higher headcount and related costs, and the impact of the Libtayo transaction. First quarter 2023 COCM was $249 million, up 26% versus last year, due to increases in shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies of Praluent to Sanofi and manufacturing costs for Dupixent. Reimbursements for these production costs are recorded as part of other revenue in Sanofi collaboration revenue respectively.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023, Regeneron generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities, less debt, of $12.3 billion. We have continued to strategically deploy our cash to deliver on our capital allocation priorities, which are focused on investing in innovation, both internal and external, as well as returning capital to shareholders.\nWe purchased nearly $700 million of our shares in the first quarter with $3.1 billion remaining under our existing authorization as of March 31. Additionally, as George discussed, we announced the collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, investing $75 million through an upfront payment and equity investment to add a new approach to our scientific capabilities.\nI'd like to conclude with some select updates to our financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We are updating 2023 COCM guidance to be in the range of $820 million to $880 million, an increase of $90 million at the midpoint, reflecting increased shipments of ex-U.S. commercial supplies for Praluent and Dupixent to Sanofi. Importantly, these anticipated incremental expenses will be reimbursed by Sanofi, generally resulting in a neutral impact to Regeneron's 2023 operating profit. Approximately half of the incremental $90 million of reimbursements from Sanofi are expected to be recorded as Sanofi collaboration revenue, with the balance recorded as other revenue.\nAs a result, we now expect 2023 other revenue to be higher than 2022 other revenue. For modeling purposes, second quarter 2023 other revenue is expected to be the lowest of the 2023 quarters, with the vast majority of the remaining other revenue to be recorded in the second half of this year. We are also updating our 2023 gross margin to be between 89% to 91%. The change in expected gross margin is primarily driven by an unfavorable change in product mix, as well as an increase in the start-up costs associated with our new fill/finish facility located in upstate New York.\nFinally, we are lowering our guidance for our effective tax rate to 10% to 12%, reflecting the benefit of higher than previously anticipated stock-based compensation deductions. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in the first quarter of 2023, and the company remains well positioned to drive further growth in the remainder of the year and beyond.\nWith that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Bob. Josh, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Please go ahead, Josh.",

Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nCo-Founder, President, CEO & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nI'm the Chief Executive.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVP of IR, Myovant Sciences Ltd.\n\nChief Executive Officer.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nCo-Founder, President, CEO & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nBut it's okay. Good morning to everybody. And for those of you experiencing the arctic freeze, I hope you're staying warm.\nOur strong fourth quarter performance kept a remarkable year of Regeneron, highlighted by significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 14% compared to the prior year when excluding the impact of contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve underscoring the commercial strength and increasing diversity of our business.\nWe also made several important advances across our pipeline during the quarter, notably the submission of a biologic license application for aflibercept 8 milligrams in neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD as well as diabetic macular edema, or DME, positioning us for a potential U.S. launch in late August of this year.\nAdditionally, we received FDA approval for Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, making Libtayo only the second PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody approved in this setting, regardless of a patient's histology or PD-L1 expressions level.\nWe also presented data from our rapidly advancing oncology pipeline, including for fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer; odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in B-cell lymphomas; and linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific in multiple myeloma; finally, Dupixent was approved for prurigo nodularis in Europe.\nBriefly reflecting on 2022, we ended the year with 3 strategic imperatives that we felt we had to accomplish in order to position the company for long-term growth. First, we had to fortify the medium and long-term outlook for our retinal franchise. Based on the positive results that we reported in September 22, we believe aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients with wet AMD and DME by becoming the new standard of care for these patients, positioning Regeneron for prolonged leadership in this category.\nSecond, we needed to maintain and grow Dupixent leadership across a variety of type 2 allergic diseases. 2022 turned out to be a phenomenal year with Dupixent global net product sales approaching $8.7 billion and growing 44% at constant currency. Despite new competition, Dupixent maintained a leading market position in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps and was also approved in new indications, geographies and younger populations, which George will detail shortly. Collectively, these 2022 approvals meaningfully expanded the Dupixent commercial opportunity, allowing the addressable population to increase by approximately 225,000 patients, bringing the total addressable population to over 7 million patients globally.\nAnd third, we wanted to make significant progress towards becoming a leader in immuno-oncology, and 2022 turned out to be a crucial year. Key to this long-term goal was acquiring Sanofi's share of global rights to Libtayo, an antibody discovered by Regeneron, which was a necessary step towards realizing the full clinical and commercial potential of this foundational therapy. It also enables us to unlock combination opportunities from promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, including with our LAG-3 antibody, our costimulatory bispecifics and our 3 -- our CD3 bispecifics. Looking ahead, we expect 2023 to be another notable year with significant incremental progress across these imperatives as well as in other areas of our business.\nWe are preparing for a potential U.S. launch for aflibercept 8 milligrams in late August, given prescribers decade-plus experience with EYLEA. And now with the 48-week data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, which demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to EYLEA, but with longer treatment intervals, we believe that over time, there is an opportunity for aflibercept 8 milligram to become the new standard of care for wet AMD and DME.\nWe expect Dupixent to continue to strengthen its leadership position across approved type 2 allergic diseases based on its differentiated mechanism of blocking both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. In 2023, we have an opportunity to reach even more patients with potential regulatory approvals in new diseases, geographies and younger populations that could add another approximately 500,000 patients globally to the [biologic] eligible population. Additionally, we look forward to the upcoming readout of our first Phase III study of Dupixent in COPD in the first half of this year.\nIn oncology, we expect to continue rapidly advancing our pipeline. For our LAG-3 combination with Libtayo, we are moving forward with expansion beyond melanoma to include lung cancer and potentially other solid tumors.\nFor our costimulatory bispecifics, in combination with Libtayo, we are continuing dose expansion in our Phase I/II PSMAxCD28 program in advanced prostate cancer. We also expect to report additional Phase I data from our EGFRxCD28 program in solid tumors and to present initial clinical data for our MUC16xCD28 program in recurrent ovarian cancer.\nAnd within Hema, we anticipate second half regulatory submissions for odronextamab in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as linvoseltamab in refractory multiple myeloma.\nIn 2023, we also plan to rapidly move forward with clinical development of our next-generation COVID-19 antibody, which we believe could help protect the millions of (inaudible) patients who were unable to [map] a sufficient immune response from vaccination and treat those who require other alternatives. Activities enabling clinical manufacturing have commenced, and we expect to enter clinical development later this year.\nIn closing, 2022 was a pivotal year at Regeneron, and we expect to continue making significant progress in 2023. Our strategy remains focused on investing in our internal R&D capabilities which has historically generated a high rate of return.\nWe remain confident in our near and long-term growth prospects with approximately 35 pipeline candidates currently progressing through clinical trials. We will also continue looking for opportunities to complement these internal efforts by exploring potential collaborations. With our commercial capabilities continue to drive revenue growth and our strong financial position, Regeneron is extremely well positioned to continue delivering breakthroughs for patients and value to shareholders.\nNow I will turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nCo-Founder, President, Chief Scientific Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Len.\nI would like to briefly walk you through our pipeline's progress in 2022 and touch upon what lies ahead in 2023.\nIn ophthalmology, we presented pivotal -- positive pivotal results for aflibercept 8 milligram in wet AMD and DME. These trials showed that aflibercept 8 milligram extended dosing intervals to every 12 or even 16 weeks for the vast majority of patients through 48 weeks without compromising the visual improvement or safety seen with EYLEA. These are truly unprecedented and potentially game-changing results who have not -- which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agents.\nMoving to Dupixent. In 2022, Dupixent became the only biologic approved in atopic dermatitis, for infants as young as 6 months of age, the first treatment for prurigo nodularis and the first treatment in the United States for eosinophilic esophagitis. And just this week, we obtained the European Commission approval for eosinophilic esophagitis as well. In addition, we submitted a supplemental BLA for chronic spontaneous urticaria and shared positive Phase III data in children with eosinophilic esophagitis.\nDupixent is now approved in 5 related type 2 allergic conditions, and our data shows that these diseases are mediated by IL-4 and IL-13 driven type 2 inflammation because many patients suffer from systemic type 2 inflammation, they often suffer from several of these diseases concurrently. And thus, Dupixent has the potential to holistically address these patients multiple type 2 conditions for which Dupixent is approved.\nWhile many other immunomodulators are associated with worrisome immunosuppression and carry boxed warnings, Dupixent's safety profile supports its approval in infants. In 2023, we are looking forward to the initial results of BOREAS, the first Dupixent Phase III study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.\nOur Dupixent COPD Phase III studies have enrolled patients with elevated blood eosinophils aiming to select the patients with COPD driven by type 2 inflammation. The BOREAS study passed an interim futility analysis in 2020, an encouraging event, which triggered the start of the replicate Phase III NOTUS study. We are looking forward to the readout of BOREAS with the primary endpoint of annualized rate of acute, moderate and severe COPD exacerbations expected in the first half of '23.\nMoving on to oncology. 2022 was an important year for our oncology programs. Libtayo was approved by the FDA in combination with chemotherapy in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology or PD-L1 expression levels, an achievement met by only one other PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agent.\nLibtayo is also emerging as an essential backbone of our oncology pipeline as several programs in combination with Libtayo are starting to yield encouraging data. First, I'll discuss our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab in combination with Libtayo, where we have recently shown positive data from a second confirmatory cohort of PD-1 naive metastatic melanoma patients and reported encouraging results from a smaller dataset in non-small cell lung cancer patients. These initial results suggest that the fianlimab Libtayo combination has a potentially best-in-class profile in melanoma and we are advancing broad pivotal programs in both melanoma and lung cancer. Phase III studies in metastatic melanoma in adjuvant melanoma are already enrolling, we have plans to soon initiate another Phase III study in perioperative melanoma as well as Phase II/III studies in first-line advanced as well as perioperative non-small cell lung cancer.\nOther notable Libtayo combination used from this year was the early but very encouraging data with our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, a tumor type considered immunologically cold with multiple recent Phase III failures demonstrating that prostate cancer is largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy in other (inaudible) as well as in other types of chemo combination.\nOur proof-of-concept study of our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, we observed first evidence that combining this new class of bispecifics with anti-PD-1 can confirm profound responsiveness to tumors previously thought to be cold and unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy with 3 out of the 4 patients treated at the highest dose levels showing greater than 90% reductions within 6 weeks of initiating combination therapy in the prostate cancer biomarker, PSA. Following up on these early but exciting results, we're continuing to enroll patients in this study, and we are planning to present additional data at medical meetings in 2023.\nWe also presented our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor. For ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in development for advanced ovarian cancer. As a single agent in a Phase I dose escalation study in heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer patients, we observed a 4% overall response rate with a 31% response rates in a small subset of patients with high MUC16 expressing tumors. We expect initial dose escalation data later this year for ubamatamab with Libtayo as well as for our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer. We also expect updated clinical data for our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in various solid tumors later this year.\nMoving on to our hematology oncology pipeline. At the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting, we presented new data from odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as linvoseltamab our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. For odronextamab, we presented pivotal Phase II (inaudible) data. Odronextamab in third or later line relapsed or recurring follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile with 82% of patients responding and 92% of these responders achieving a complete response with encouraging durability.\nOur optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved odronextamab's safety profile while retaining efficacy similar to the prior dosing regimen. In third or later line relapse or recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, odronextamab demonstrated efficacy regardless of prior CAR T experience and a safety profile generally similar to that seen in follicular lymphoma.\nWe are planning regulatory submissions in the second half of 2023 for both indications, which we hope will support potential accelerated approvals. In 2023, we anticipate initiating several Phase III studies in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including in earlier lines of therapy. These trials will serve as confirmatory studies which could potentially support conversion to full approval. We also expect to initiate a proof-of-concept study of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope could further add to the anticancer benefit for these patients.\nFor linvoseltamab, our BS -- BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody, we presented efficacy and safety data from our pivotal Phase II study in third or later line multiple myeloma at ASH. Early, deep and durable responses were observed in patients with high disease burden, and these responses may improve with longer follow-up.\nIn 2023, we plan to initiate a confirmatory Phase III study of linvoseltamab in second line multiple myeloma and are on track for a BLA submission in the second half of the year. As with odronextamab, we plan to initiate combination studies for linvoseltamab with costimulatory bispecifics in the near future.\nI'd also like to update some additional clinical programs. Our antibody blocking Factor XI for anticoagulation in an antibody that activates the NPR1 receptor for heart failure are both completing proof of mechanism trials.\nMoving on to Regeneron genetics medicine. Regarding our collaboration with Alnylam in siRNA therapeutics, we are planning a broad and multipronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We are initiating a Phase II study of ALN-HSD in NASH patients with genetic risk factors. We also dosed first subjects in the first in-human study of another siRNA medicine in development for NASH, ALN-PNP, which targets a different gene and can be potentially combined with ALN-HSD in appropriate patients. We have discovered additional NASH targets, which we have validated using our Regeneron Genetics Center, including [Side B], which will potentially be the next NASH therapeutic candidate to enter the clinic. With regard to our collaboration with Alnylam for central nervous system targets, our initial dose escalation study is ongoing.\nOur collaboration with Intellia in CRISPR-based therapeutics is expected to progress further in 2023, building on continuing data readouts from the Phase I study of NTLA-2001 in transthyretin amyloidosis in both cardiomyopathy and neuropathy patients, which provided the first demonstration in humans that CRISPR-based technologies can deliver up to 90% reduction of the pathological gene product for over a year.\nRegarding our gene therapy efforts, our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics recently announced that a clinical trial has been authorized by both the U.S. FDA and the U.K. MHRA for DB-OTO, a virally delivered gene therapy designed to restore hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. A Phase I/II study in patients 2 years of age and younger is expected to initiate in the first half of 2023 with initial data from the first [cohort] of patients anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.\nI'd like to conclude with our next-generation COVID-19 efforts. As we recently announced, we have identified a potent broadly neutralizing COVID-19 antibody, which, unlike other neutralizing antibodies find outside of the so-called receptor binding domain, or RBD, of the [spike] protein. This antibody retains activity against all the viral variants seen throughout the pandemic because it binds to an epitope that has remained highly conserved, greater than 99.9% across all known variants. The vast majority of antiviral antibodies generated as a result of vaccination or due to natural infection target the RBD domain, which results in overwhelming selective pressure driving the emergence of these resistant variants. We hope that by targeting this unique and conservative epitope outside of the RBD, this antibody will also retain its activity in the face of future variants. We plan to initiate clinical trials to test this antibody this year, and we are looking to develop it in both treatment and prophylactic setting.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron's R&D engine continues its productivity, including the early-stage pipeline. Just in the first weeks of this year, we have initiated clinical studies for 2 new drug [candidates] and we anticipate clinical trials starting or IND submission for up to 10 new therapeutic candidates this year as well as for additional indications for candidates that are already in the clinic.\nSo with that, I will turn it over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nEVP of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, George.\nThe fourth quarter capped off a strong year of execution and growth, delivering results across our commercial portfolio. We expanded into new indications, which, coupled with our existing business, is expected to drive meaningful growth in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to several important potential approvals and subsequent launches this year, providing additional opportunities for growth.\nStarting with EYLEA, where we announced in January, fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.5 billion, full year 2022 net sales were $6.3 billion, representing 8% year-over-year growth and outpacing total growth of the anti-VEGF category for the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, EYLEA category share was approaching previous levels of approximately 50% of injections. This followed the short-term shift earlier in the quarter where EYLEA was negatively impacted by a temporary increase in use of off-label compounded Avastin. During this time, there was a short-term closure of a not-for-profit patient co-pay assistance fund, which we opened later in the quarter.\nWe believe we have substantially recovered from the issue encountered in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect competitive pressures but remain confident in Regeneron's overall retinal franchise as we look forward to our potential upcoming aflibercept 8 milligram launch.\nIn summary, our retinal franchise leads the anti-VEGF category with EYLEA as the current standard of care and aflibercept 8 milligram, if approved, offering a differentiated clinical profile that can potentially shift the treatment paradigm.\nTurning to Libtayo. Total fourth quarter global net sales were $169 million, growing 44% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 36% to $110 million with contributions across all indications. In advanced non-melanoma skin cancers, we continue to build our leadership position in the PD-1 class. In lung cancer, Libtayo continues to see steady growth in utilization in prescribers. Customer ordering has accelerated following the chemotherapy combination approval last November. We are working to maximize launch uptake by increasing depth and breadth of prescribers.\nEarly launch indicators are positive, community and academic centers have welcomed Libtayo's expanded role as an important treatment option in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. There are more than 200,000 new cases of lung cancer per year in the U.S. alone for which Libtayo is an important treatment option.\nOutside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 60% on a constant currency basis to $59 million driven by steady demand growth and additional launches as we secure access and reimbursement globally. We continue a targeted approach to extend our global commercial footprint in priority international markets designed to maximize opportunities for Libtayo in potential future medicines.\nFinally, turning to Dupixent, where in the fourth quarter, global net sales grew 42% on a constant currency basis to $2.45 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 44% to $1.94 billion, with strong growth continuing across atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps with additional contributions from recent launches in the eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. Dupixent is well positioned to expand market penetration and drive revenue growth across established new and potential future indications in 2023 and beyond.\nAtopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication continues to rapidly grow across all age groups, firmly establishing Dupixent as the preferred systemic therapy for patients with moderate to severe disease. There continues to be rapid uptake in younger populations, further confirming Dupixent's differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We've also seen meaningful early adoption in prurigo nodularis where Dupixent is the only FDA-approved medicine for this debilitating disease. We expect ongoing uptake of Dupixent as the launch progresses and physicians identify patients' need.\nDupixent continues to perform well in the highly competitive biologic asthma space with steady market share gains and strong growth in total prescriptions and new patient starts. In nasal polyps, Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile continues to drive uptake as the leading first line treatment option in patients requiring systemic therapy.\nIn the eosinophilic esophagitis, the launch is going exceptionally well, finally offering physicians and their patients a treatment to effectively manage the underlying mechanism of the disease. Patients treated with Dupixent have experienced dramatic improvements in their symptoms and quality of life. We've seen rapid uptake across both gastroenterologists and allergists. We also continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where there is also substantial unmet need.\nOutside the U.S., Dupixent net sales worth $513 million, growing 37% on a constant currency basis, driven by rapid uptake across approved indications and launches in new geographies. In Europe, Dupixent was approved for prurigo nodularis in December. And earlier this week, Dupixent was also approved for eosinophilic esophagitis. We expect these new indications to contribute to Dupixent's ongoing international growth.\nIn summary, during 2022, we executed on our core focus to deliver life-changing medicines to patients. Our commercial initiatives and strategies are driving increases in market penetration for our [in-line brands] and optimizing the potential of new and upcoming launches. Taken together, we are confident in Regeneron's future and are well positioned to deliver long-term and sustainable growth.\nNow I'll turn the call to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marion.\nMy comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted.\nRegeneron ended 2022 with a strong fourth quarter with continued execution driving positive results across the business. Excluding contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve, fourth quarter total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3 billion, driven by growth across our core brands. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $12.56 on net income of $1.4 billion.\nBeginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2022 ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $839 million, up 7% on a constant currency basis versus fourth quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $355 million, of which $324 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S.\nTotal Sanofi collaboration revenue was $836 million in the fourth quarter and grew 61%, driven by Dupixent. Our share of profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $619 million, an increase of 60% versus the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales-based milestone in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to achievement of $2.5 billion of ex U.S. sales of antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis.\nFinally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $396 million in the fourth quarter for our share of gross profits from ex U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract.\nMoving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2022 R&D expense increased 43% year-over-year to $911 million, driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction with Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo and our full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D spend for Dupixent and itepekimab as well as additional costs incurred in connection with the company's late-stage pipeline and increasing clinical manufacturing activities and higher headcount-related costs.\nSG&A expense increased 17% year-over-year to $579 million due to higher headcount and related costs, incremental costs to fully support the global commercialization of Libtayo and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization. Product gross margin in the quarter increased to 93% as compared to 86% in the prior year. The improved gross margin was driven by a favorable change in product mix and no longer having to pay Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross profits. Finally, fourth quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.3% compared to 12.6% in the prior year.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For full year 2022, Regeneron generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow, favorably impacted by our first quarter 2022 payment from the U.S. government for sales of REGEN-COV that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. We ended 2022 with cash and marketable securities [less debt] of $11.6 billion.\nWe continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities in 2022 by deploying approximately $3.4 billion towards business development and share repurchases while continuing to fund our internal R&D efforts. In 2022, we executed approximately $1.3 billion in business development initiatives, including the acquisitions of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals in the exclusive worldwide rights to Libtayo.\nWe also purchased approximately $2.1 billion of our shares in 2022, including $431 million in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization reflecting our continued confidence in our business and our pipeline. We remain buyers of our shares at current levels, and this new authorization enables us to continue returning capital directly to shareholders.\nI'd like to conclude with our initial financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 SG&A spend to be in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.28 billion. This primarily reflects the full year impact of global Libtayo commercialization expenses, the build-out of our international commercial infrastructure in select markets and higher headcount to support our growing organization.\nWe expect our 2023 R&D expense to be in the range of $3.725 million to $3.925 billion. As George mentioned, we have numerous strategically important development programs advancing in 2023, including late-stage studies for our fianlimab, Libtayo combination in melanoma and lung cancer in confirmatory Phase III studies for odronextamab, both in FL and DLBCL and linvoseltamab in myeloma.\nIn addition, we continue to advance programs in our early pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas including with collaborators such as Alnylam and Intellia positioning us for long-term growth. This range also includes the full year impact of the Libtayo transaction, we are now recording all development expenses for Libtayo and recognizing our full 50% share of development expenses for Dupixent and itepekimab.\nCOCM is expected to be in the range of $720 million to $800 million, similar to 2022 reflecting the gradual phase-in of a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for Dupixent that is designed to improve drug substance yields. We expect our capital expenditures in 2023 to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million. These expenditures will support the continued expansion of our manufacturing facilities, including ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility as well as the previously announced expansion of R&D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters.\nFinally, we anticipate 2023 gross margin to be between 90% to 92% and our effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. In addition to our full year financial guidance, we expect higher interest income in 2023, given our greater cash balance plus higher interest rates as compared to last year, which will favorably impact other income and expense. We also expect 2023 other revenue to be slightly lower than 2022. Finally, as I said in November, we no longer expect to record any material other operating income or expense in 2023 or beyond, absent a new transaction.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in 2022, and we are well positioned to drive continued growth in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVP of IR, Myovant Sciences Ltd.\n\nThank you, Bob.\nShannon, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. To ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving on to the next. Shannon, please go ahead and poll for questions.",

Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call. Regeneron's strong operational momentum continued in the third quarter, highlighted by important developments across our pipeline and outstanding commercial execution. Total revenues for the quarter increased by 11% compared to last year when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail With global net sales of Dupixent and Libtayo, as well as U.S. net sales of EYLEA once again reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits.\nBefore diving deeper into our commercial results, I'd like to review some of the recent progress we have made across our pipeline, starting with the striking pivotal data that we reported in September for our investigation of aflibercept 8 milligrams, which we believe could ultimately transform the treatment landscape for patients. With nearly 90% of DME patients and 80% of wet AMD patients able to sustain 16 weeks maintenance dosing through 48 weeks of treatment, we believe aflibercept 8 milligrams may shift the current treatment paradigm with more patients receiving less frequent injections while achieving visual acuity gains, anatomical improvements and a safety profile comparable to EYLEA. It has proven to be very difficult to decrease the treatment burden beyond what we were able to achieve with EYLEA over a decade ago with many potential treatments failing either due to suboptimal visual outcomes or safety issues.\nA recently approved anti-VEGF agent did not demonstrate in pivotal studies that the majority of patients in either the disease were able to sustain 16-week maintenance dosing throughout the first year of treatment, supporting our view that aflibercep 8 milligrams has the potential to become the next-generation standard of care anti-VEGF treatment, assuming regulatory approval. We plan to submit the aflibercep 8-milligram pivotal data to the FDA under a single BLA at the end of this year and have decided to use a previously granted priority review voucher to expedite the FDA review process. Prelaunch planning is already underway with the potential FDA approval by late August 2023.\nIn addition to the pivotal of aflibercep 8 milligram data, Regeneron continue to make notable progress in our immunology and oncology pipelines. Starting with immunology. In September, we received FDA approval for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis, the first systemic therapy for this indication and the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved.\nSo far this year, Dupixent has received 4 U.S or EU regulatory approvals, expanding the treatment-eligible population by approximately 225,000 patients including 2 diseases that previously had no FDA-approved systemic therapies.\nIn the first half of next year, we are looking forward to EU regulatory decisions for eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis in patients as young as 6 months. With these potential additional indications, approximately 200,000 more patients with these type 2 inflammatory diseases could benefit from Dupixent's unmatched clinical profile. Additionally, we expect pivotal data readouts for Dupixent in chronic inducible cold urticaria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the first half of next year.\nMoving to Oncology, where the depth and breadth of our pipeline has positioned Regeneron to ultimately become a global leader. We presented several data sets at this year's European Society for Medical Oncology Annual Meeting, further underscoring the importance of Libtayo as the foundation for our overall oncology strategy. George will review the data in more detail during his remarks, but we were particularly encouraged by the results for Libtayo monotherapy in neoadjuvant CSCC as well as the Libtayo combination with Fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in first-line metastatic melanoma. We also presented monotherapy data for our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in recurrent ovarian cancer which has the potential will be combined with Libtayo as well as data for our METxMET biparatopic, bispecific in metaled non-small cell lung cancer. I'd also note the early but very exciting results for our PSMA by CD28 Co-stimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo, which showed promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.\nThe patients enrolled in our study have a poor prognosis with an expected survival of 1 to 2 years, depending upon their treatment history. Given prostate cancer has been largely unresponsive to PD-1 inhibition and immunotherapy in general, there is a clear need for new treatments. In 2020 alone, there were over 375,000 deaths globally from prostate cancer and it was the second leading cause of cancer death in American Man. We continue to expand our co-stimulatory bispecific efforts in prostate cancer with an acceleration in enrollment in our first-in-human study since we reported our top line results in August, and we look forward to updating you on this program in the first half of next year.\nNow turning to our commercial performance. In the third quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 8% at constant currency to $2.4 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales were $1.63 billion, up 11% year-over-year and outperforming the anti-VEGF category growth of only 4%. Despite recent branded and biosimilar entrants, EYLEA set a new all-time high for anti-VEGF category share in the United States.\nDupixent continued to grow at a remarkable pace bolstered by approvals in new diseases and younger patient populations in previously approved indications. In the third quarter, global net product sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% at constant currency compared to last year, reflecting growth across all indications in all geographies. And Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients in both currently approved indications and potentially for additional type 2 inflammatory diseases -- is expected to drive strong growth in the future.\nLibtayo total net sales grew 25% globally at constant currency to $143 million in the third quarter, including 21% growth in the United States driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. At the start of the third quarter, we acquired global rights to Libtayo from Sanofi with potential future combinations, including with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer as well as other pipeline agents in development, we believe Libtayo is poised to become a more meaningful revenue contributor over time.\nWe are excited about the strong commercial performance for our core products, the compelling efficacy, safety and durability data that we reported for aflibercep 8 milligrams as well as the notable progress we have made advancing our pipeline, particularly in oncology. Our pipeline now includes approximately 35 product candidates in clinical development including a number of marketed products that we're investigating for additional indications, some of which George will discuss in a moment.\nIn closing, our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in this strategy and in our growth prospects as well as in our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nScientific Founder, President, Chief Scientific Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Len. I'll start with ophthalmology. The positive pivotal results for aflibercept 8-milligram in the PULSAR and PHOTON studies, we recently presented the American Academy of Ophthalmology Annual Meeting. The results of these trials in wet AMD and DME, respectively, demonstrated that a remarkably high percentage of patients were able to be rapidly initiated into and then successfully maintained through week 48 on 12- and 16-week dosing intervals. While achieving vision gains that were not inferior to the current standard of care, EYLEA 2-milligram dose every 8 weeks. These results suggest that aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to become the new standard of care in these retinal diseases. I think it would be helpful if we step back for a minute and try to put these results in context.\nWhile what our trials did was push the limits far beyond what has been accomplished with any currently available anti-VEGF therapies. Rather than using response criteria to try to identify or slowly extend patients to longer dosing intervals, our trials tested whether all patients could be randomly assigned and rapidly initiated on extended dosing intervals of aflibercept 8-milligram without compromising visual improvement or safety. These aflibercept 8-milligram trials accomplished just that for the vast majority, while delivering a safety profile consistent with that of EYLEA. 89% of DME patients and 77% of wet AMD patients -- we're able to be rapidly initiated and maintained on a 16-week of aflibercept 8-milligram dosing regimen, while 93% of DME and 83% of wet AMD patients we're able to be rapidly initiating maintained on at least a 12-week dosing interval, all while delivering efficacy similar to that of EYLEA administered every 8 weeks.\nWe believe these are truly unprecedented and potentially game-changing results, which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agent. This has speculated that our PDUFA and PHOTON results were due to our dose modification criteria and even try to theoretically extrapolate that their agent could have somehow approached these results using our criteria. We put these speculative extrapolations into the category of wishful thinking. And based on our expert analysis of the data, we conclude it is all about the drug and not the trial design.\nBriefly moving on to Dupixent. Building on our recent approval in eosinophilic esophagitis in adults and adolescents, we are planning on submitting a supplementary BLA for eosinophilic esophagitis and in 1- to 11-year-old children in mid-2023. Dupixent ability to treat eosinophilic esophagitis highlights how important it is that our IL-4 and IL-13 blocker more completely targets the entire type 2 inflammatory cascade and not only eosinophils.\nAs you heard Len mentioned, the FDA label was expanded yet again in the third quarter as Dupixent became the first and only treatment indicated for prurigo nodularis, a debilitating chronic skin disease. This marks the fifth disease for which Dupixent is now approved. Our collective clinical data with Dupixent support a unifying molecular mechanism underlying these related diseases from asthma to atopic dermatitis to nasal polyps to prurigo nodularis to eosinophilic esophagitis. In this unifying hypothesis, IL-4 and IL-13 induced inflammation is driving all of these related diseases in different tissue compartments.\nMoving to Libtayo in oncology. In the third quarter, our robust oncology pipeline has started to deliver data readouts from our latest and most innovative programs, and we are expecting these readouts to accelerate in the remainder of 2022 and continuing to 2023. The European Society of Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Annual Meeting in September, was truly a banner event for Regeneron with several notable oral presentations for assets in our oncology pipeline, which I'd like to briefly summarize.\nStarting with Fianlimab our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo. At ESMO, we shared data from 2 independent advanced melanoma expansion cohorts from our first-in-human study, which importantly showed consistent efficacy and safety between the 2 replicate cohorts. Fianlimab in combination with Libtayo demonstrated greater than 60% response rates in each cohort, a median PFS estimated to be 24 months across both cohorts and a median duration of response that had not yet been reached. The preliminary safety profile of the combination appears to be in line with anti-PD-1 monotherapy and potentially with less toxicity compared to anti-CTLA-4 combinations.\nWhile dual LAG-3 and PD-1 inhibition has previously shown promise in advanced melanoma, response rates greater than 45% with median PFS of more than a year had not been previously reported. These initial results in melanoma suggest that Fianlimab-Libtayo combination has a potentially best-in-class profile in this setting. We are enrolling our Phase III metastatic melanoma study -- we intend to initiate a Phase III adjuvant melanoma study later this year and have additional plans in other solid tumors where Fianlimab has the potential to be first-in-class.\nThe neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, a Phase II study of Libtayo monotherapy has shown promising results. Given prior to potentially curative surgery in patients with large tumors Libtayo was able to deliver major pathological responses to 63% of patients prior to surgery. This raises the possibility that Libtayo could decrease the burden of these major and potentially disfiguring surgeries for the many patients who require them each year. We are pleased that concurrent with the ESMO presentation, these data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nRegarding next steps, we are talking to regulators about possible pathways for labeling and potential inclusion in the NCCN guidelines. Also at ESMO, we presented initial clinical data for Ubamatamab and our MUC16xCD3 bispecific developed for advanced ovarian cancer, our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor. In heavily pretreated ovarian cancer population, we observed durable responses to this MUC16xCD3 monotherapy in a patient subset whose tumors overexpressed MUC16, response rates were as high as 31%. Most of the treatment of Vergent adverse events occurred with the initial step-up dosing. Ubamatamab is being developed as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Libtayo as well as in combination with our MUC16 costim bispecific. We are looking forward to more data across these programs in 2023.\nIn our ESMO investor presentation, we shared more detailed data for a PSMA by CD28 costim bispecific in combination with Libtayo representing the first efficacy and safety data for this new class of bispecifics, which we had initially top lined and discussed at our second quarter earnings. We have since continued to enroll patients in this study, and we are planning to present updated data at a medical meeting in the first half of 2023.\nRegarding our hem/onc pipeline, we are looking forward to data from odronextamab. -- our CD20 x CD3 bispecific as well as linvoseltamab, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific at the American Society of Hematology or ASH Annual Meeting in December. For odronextamab, we will present pivotal Phase II data for both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 2 separate oral presentations. Upon discussions with the FDA, we are now targeting a second half 2020 regulatory filing for this program. We hope to initiate combination studies with an appropriate CD20 costim bispecific in the near future.\nFor linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody remained on track with development and are planning to file pending discussions with the FDA in 2023. We have now completed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II study. As I mentioned earlier, data from this study will be updated at ASH.\nAs with odronextamab,we are planning on initiating combination studies for linvoseltamab with co-stimulatory bispecifics in the near future. We believe existing standard of care therapies leave significant room for improvement in these difficult-to-treat settings, and we have been encouraged by the interim efficacy and safety data we have generated to date for both odronextamab and linvoseltamab.\nFinally, at ESMA, we also shared initial data for our METxMET bispecific antibody in MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer. Responses were enriched in patients with higher levels of met expression. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Even the modest overexpression of MET may render lung cancer susceptible to this mechanism of action and we're looking forward to the METxMET antibody drug conjugate data next year.\nIn summary for oncology, a rich commentator of the pipeline is delivering competitive data. And with our full ownership of Libtayo, we're excited about the potential to advance standard of care in oncology with our portfolio approach.\nConcluding with the Regeneron Genetic Medicines efforts, where we continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. In September, we and Alnylam reported promising data from our ongoing Phase I study of Alnylam HSD in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. -- we are planning on initiating a Phase II study shortly, which is just one part of our multipronged approach, exploring multiple genetically validated targets for NASH.\nAlso in September, we and Intellia announced initial data from the cardiomyopathy arm of our ongoing Phase I study of NTLA-2001, an investigational CRISPR-based therapy for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, which show deep and sustained mean serum TTR reductions of over 90% and was generally well tolerated. Finally, in October, our collaborators a decibel Therapeutics announced FDA clearance for an NDA application for DB-OTO, our first virally delivered gene therapy product candidate designed to provide hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. This IND provides clearance to initiate a pediatric Phase I/II clinical trial in the United States.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nEVP of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Our third quarter performance reflects strength in growth across our commercial portfolio. We continue to extend our leadership position in additional therapeutic categories is part of our commitment to deliver life-changing medicines to patients in need. With Dupixent's approval in prurigo nodularis, Libtayo's anticipated approval in combination with chemotherapy in first line advanced non-small cell lung cancer and recent data demonstrating the compelling profile of aflibercept 8-milligram Regeneron's commercial business is poised to deliver long-term growth.\nStarting with EYLEA, which reached $2.4 billion in global net sales for the third quarter. This represents an 8% increase on a constant currency basis, a remarkable achievement for a brand that launched 11 years ago. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 11% year-over-year to $1.63 billion to again achieve over 1 million injections in the quarter. despite the overall 2% sequential category decline in volume from the second to third quarter of 2022,\nEYLEA continued to grow across all indications, gaining share from both branded and unbranded agents. In fact, EYLEA reached all-time highs in category share of approximately 50%, with a commanding 75% share in the branded category. We continue to strengthen and extend EYLEA's leadership position in the anti-VEGF category.\nAs we recently announced, the FDA has granted pediatric exclusivity for EYLEA, thereby extending the period of EYLEA U.S. market exclusivity by an additional 6 months through May 17, 2024. Since announcing positive Phase III results earlier this year, there's been widespread excitement in the retina community about the aflibercept 8-milligram data set and aflibercept 8-milligrams potential to become the future standard of care if approved.\nNext to Libtayo. Total global product sales were $143 million, growing 25% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 21% to $95 million based on growth in our lung and non-melanoma skin indications. We see particular opportunity for growth in lung cancer over time. In monotherapy, there are already steady increases in prescribers and total utilization. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which significantly expands the patient opportunity.\nAnd finally, to Dupixent, third quarter global net sales were $2.3 billion, up 45% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 45% to $1.82 billion, driven by robust demand across atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. Growth was also driven by a rapid launch trajectory across recent indications, including Eosinophilic Esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis where Dupixent is the only biologic to be approved from infancy through adulthood. Starting with dermatology and atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the leading first-line systemic therapy with strong uptake across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease and across age groups. The ongoing launch in children as young as 6 months is progressing very well, providing relief to children and their families as well as reinforcing the safety of Dupixent for all age groups. We have also expanded Dupixent's leadership in dermatology following its approval in prurigo nodularis. Dupixent is the only FDA-approved medicine for this chronic debilitating skin disease that affects approximately 75,000 adults in the U.S. Early launch indicators are positive with patients already being initiated on therapy.\nDupixent also continued to perform well in the highly competitive asthma market with steady growth in prescriptions and new patient starts as well as in nasal polyps. Early launch performance in the Eosinophilic Esophagitis has been very strong, with broad adoption from both gastroenterologists and allergists. The medical community has embraced Dupixent as patients previously had very limited options Dupixent is the only medicine indicated to treat Eosinophilic Esophagitis and is the only treatment shown to address the underlying disease causes resulting in unprecedented symptom relief. There are approximately 50,000 adults in adolescent patients in the U.S., and we continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where substantial unmet need remains. Outside the U.S. Dupixent net sales were $506 million, growing 44% on a constant currency basis. There is rapid uptake across approved indications, and we continue to execute on recent launches and expand into new geographies. As part of this, Regeneron's increased presence in key international markets supports efforts to bring Dupixent to even more patients.\nIn conclusion, our third quarter performance demonstrates strength and growth across our commercial portfolio. We are successfully executing on initiatives to deliver life-changing medicines to patients and advancing strategies to maximize new and upcoming launches. Our commercial portfolio is positioned well to drive long-term and sustainable growth.\nNow I'll turn the call to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Regeneron performed well in the third quarter, with growth from key brands and execution across the business, continuing to drive strong financial results on both the top and bottom line. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, third quarter total revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, demonstrating continued growth momentum from our core business in reflecting the favorable impact of the Libtayo transaction.\nThird quarter total diluted net income per share was $11.14 on net income of $1.3 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Third quarter 2022 ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $817 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis versus third quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $333 million, of which $315 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $711 million in the third quarter of 2022 and grew 22% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent.\nRecall that in connection with the Libtayo transaction, we increased the repayment of our antibody collaboration development balance from 10% to 20% of antibody collaboration profits, A portion of this step-up is recorded as a reduction to antibody collaboration revenues, while another portion is recorded as R&D expense. Given Regeneron is now recording its full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&D expense as incurred. Previously, Regeneron had only recognized a partial share of its antibody collaboration R&D expenses as incurred, with the remaining share of expenses added to the antibody development balance.\nAlso, as we highlighted last quarter and in accordance with the agreement, we recorded a onetime development balance repayment of $57 million as an incremental reduction to Sanofi collaboration revenue in the third quarter of 2022. We have posted to our website supporting materials to further explain the accounting associated with this and other elements of the Libtayo transaction.\nMoving now to our operating expenses. R&D increased 38% year-over-year to $817 million, partially driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction, which affects R&D in 2 ways. First, Regeneron now records all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared equally with Sanofi. Second, as I mentioned earlier, Regeneron now records our full 50% share of antibody collaboration spend for Dupixent and itepekimab.\nSG&A expense increased 20% year-over-year to $467 million primarily driven due to incremental cost related to assuming global rights to Libtayo. Cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $109 million, and product gross margin in the quarter increased but 94% as compared to 90.2% in the prior year. The more favorable gross margin was driven by the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales in the current period in the removal of the payment to Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin. Finally, the third quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 12.1% compared to 10.8% in the prior year.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow and ended the third quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of approximately $10.3 billion. We remain focused on leveraging our strong financial position to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Over the first 9 months of 2022, we have deployed in excess of $2.8 billion in capital. We have executed approximately $1.2 billion in business development initiatives, including the $900 million acquisition of Libtayo rights. Additionally, we have repurchased over $1.6 billion of our shares including over $900 million in the third quarter alone. As of September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, and we remain opportunistic buyers.\nAs we approach the end of the year, we've made some minor changes to our 2022 guidance ranges. A complete summary of our latest full year financial guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning.\nIn addition to these changes, I would also like to provide some initial thoughts on our 2023 expense outlook. We continue to make investments to advance our pipeline and position the company for long-term growth. We expect R&D investment to grow in 2023 comparable to or slightly above the 9-month year-to-date growth rate reported earlier today. The incremental R&D investment in 2023 will be driven by advancing our immuno-oncology, hematology, immunology and genetic medicine pipeline as well as the continued expansion of our R&D organization.\nIn addition, 2023 will be the first full year reflecting the impact of the Libtayo transaction where we record a 100% of the global R&D spend for Libtayo and our full 50% share of the Sanofi antibody collaboration R&D spend as incurred.\nFor SG&A in 2023, we currently project growth in the mid-teens versus 2022, given we'll be recording a full year of global Libtayo expenses, along with targeted investments in the build-out of our international infrastructure.\nFinally, for other operating income and expense in the third quarter of 2022, we recognized the remaining $44 million of deferred income related to previously received upfront payments and development milestones for Fasinumab as a result of the program's discontinuation. We do not currently expect any material other operating income or expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 in 2023 and beyond absent any new transactions.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron has performed exceptionally well in the first 9 months of 2022, and our strong financial position enables continued investment to drive long-term growth.\nWith that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVP of IR, Myovant Sciences Ltd.\n\nThank you, Bob. Towanda, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A with the number of callers in the queue, I'd like to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible. As a result, we'll only be able to answer one question from each caller before moving to the next. Towanda, please open the call for Q&A.",

Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone joining today's call.\nRegeneron had a strong second quarter with notable execution across R&D, commercial and business development functions. Total revenues increased by 20% when excluding contributions from our COVID antibody cocktail, with net sales for EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo each reaching new all-time quarterly highs and growing by double digits year-over-year on a constant currency basis.\nIn addition to exceptional commercial execution, we made significant pipeline progress with 3 regulatory approvals, 2 accepted regulatory filings and 1 positive Phase III readout. We also completed the acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals and the third quarter purchase of worldwide rights to Libtayo from Sanofi, both of which we believe will strengthen our oncology franchise in the near, medium and long term.\nWe also reported today preliminary, but promising anti-tumor activity and safety data for REGN5678, our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in patients with advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. George will have more to say on this shortly, but we believe this represents an important step towards validating our costimulatory approach to fighting cancer and potentially advancing the science of immuno-oncology.\nTurning to our commercial performance. In the second quarter, EYLEA global net sales grew 13% at constant exchange rates to $2.5 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales were $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year and outperforming anti-VEGF category growth of approximately 8%. Despite new competition, EYLEA's share was approximately half of the anti-VEGF category and 75% among branded agents, affirming its status as the gold standard anti-VEGF therapy.\nWe believe aflibercept represents a significant potential growth opportunity going forward, given favorable demographic trends as well as the potential for aflibercept 8 milligrams to augment the category and complement our retinal franchise.\nRegarding our investigational aflibercept 8 milligrams, the goal of our clinical program is to evaluate where the visual acuity among wet AMD and DME patients can be maintained or improved compared to EYLEA while extending the interval between doses. Equally important is maintaining the high bar for safety that has been set by EYLEA over the past 10 years, 55 million injections worldwide and 8 million patient years of experience. We anticipate pivotal results in late quarter 3 or early quarter 4. And with supportive data, a BLA submission completed by early 2023.\nDupixent continues to grow at a remarkable pace after 5 years and more than 450,000 patients treated since launch. In quarter 2, global and net product sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 43% at constant exchange rates compared to last year, reflecting Dupixent's differentiated clinical profile and ability to effectively treat more and more patients with the type 2 inflammatory diseases where Dupixent is approved. In the U.S., we saw growth across all indications, including initial contributions from atopic dermatitis in patients as young as 6 months to 5 years of age and from eosinophilic esophagitis, both of which are indications approved by the FDA during the second quarter and represents the first approved systemic treatment options for these patients. We hope to add a third first-in-class indication for Dupixent later this year in patients with prurigo nodularis, which is currently under priority review with the FDA.\nIn oncology, Libtayo net product sales grew 25% globally at a constant currency to $141 million in the second quarter of 2022, including 17% growth in the U.S. driven by non-melanoma skin cancer indications and monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer. We have long believed that the key to fully unlocking the opportunity in oncology is through differentiated combinations, with Libtayo possibly serving as our foundation for many of them. That belief was the basis for acquisition of the global rights to Libtayo.\nWe plan to invest further in Libtayo-based combinations, pairing it with promising candidates in our oncology pipeline such as LAG3 antibody fianlimab and our many investigational bispecifics, as well as with candidates from external collaborations. We continue to make progress with these Libtayo combinations and intend to share initial data in the second half of this year from our emerging oncology pipeline, which George will discuss in more detail.\nRegarding the FDA's review of our Libtayo-chemo combo supplemental BLA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, we are pleased with the progress that we have made as the FDA continues its review. However, we recently were informed that an FDA travel complication relating to scheduling a routine clinical trial satisfaction in Eastern Europe will likely delay their decision until after our September 19 PDUFA date. While any delay is disappointing, a new site inspection date has been scheduled. Therefore, we do not expect a lengthy extension of the review period, and we do not expect it to meaningfully impact our launch plans assuming FDA approval. We continue to actively work with the FDA, believing the ongoing review is otherwise progressing well and all other elements of the review remain on track.\nRegarding our COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combatting the virus by developing additional novel antibodies. We continue to work with the FDA to establish a regulatory pathway for these antibodies, which could potentially serve an important role in protecting immunocompromised individuals, who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines as well as treating infected patients, whom oral antiviral therapy is not appropriate.\nIn closing, as I reflect on our performance in the first half of the year, I am very proud of our numerous achievements, which were only made possible by the dedicated Regeneron employees around the world. Together, we have continued to serve patients in need while strengthening the foundation of the company and leveraging our financial strength to better position Regeneron to achieve sustainable growth over time.\nWe are excited about the increasing commercial momentum for our core products and the important progress we have made in advancing our pipeline. Our strategy continues to focus on investing in our internal R&D capabilities while exploring potential collaborations that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. We remain confident in the strategy and in our growth prospects as well as our ability to deliver breakthroughs to patients and value to shareholders.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nScientific Founder, President, Chief Scientific Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Len. I will start with ophthalmology.\nWe are looking forward to the upcoming Phase III readouts of aflibercept 8 milligram in patients with diabetic macular edema and in wet age-related macular degeneration. PHOTON in patients with DME and PULSAR in patients with wet AMD will test whether the patients treated with 8 milligrams dose every 12 weeks or every 16 weeks can achieve non-inferior best corrected visual acuity at week 48 compared to the currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram dose every 8 weeks.\nUnlike studies from other sponsors in which patients were assigned to a dosing interval based on disease activity assessment following the loading phase, patients enrolled in the PHOTON and PULSAR studies were randomized at baseline into 1 of the 3 treatment groups, we believe will allow us to determine whether extent dosing can truly be achieved. If the studies are positive and the high safety standard established with EYLEA is maintained, we believe aflibercept 8 milligram would represent a significant clinical advance for patients, and we would target a U.S. regulatory filing by early 2023.\nMoving to Dupixent, which continued to deliver notable milestones in the second quarter of the year. Dupixent was recently approved and chosen with atopic dermatitis as young as 6 months old, making Dupixent the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood. Marion will talk more about this as well as about our recent earlier-than-expected FDA approval for a brand-new gastroenterology indication, eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE.\nSince receiving approval in adults and in adolescents age 12 and over, we have reported positive data in pediatric patients with EoE as young as 1 year of age. Our Phase III study in children 1 to 11 years of age met the primary endpoint, with 68% of patients on the higher Dupixent dose and 58% of the lower Dupixent dose achieving histological disease remission compared to 3% of children on placebo at 16 weeks.\nEoE symptoms can be difficult to assess in these young patients, however, we also observed a numerical improvement in the EoE symptom score and in exploratory analysis, we recorded a 3.1% increase from baseline and body weight for age percentile for the higher dose group compared to 0.3% of the placebo on. These data will be discussed with the regulatory authorities, starting with the FDA, later this year.\nRegarding approvals for new indications expected in the near future. For prurigo nodularis, we received a PDUFA action date from the FDA of September 30 and the European Commission decision expected in the first half of 2023. Also in the first half of next year, we're also looking forward to the readout of the first Dupixent study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD.\nMoving on to Libtayo and oncology. As Len mentioned, we are excited to have acquired Sanofi stake in Libtayo, thereby gaining exclusive worldwide rights to a PD-1 inhibitor review as foundational for our oncology franchise, which has the potential to be utilized in numerous combinations with other candidates in our pipeline such as our costimulatory bispecifics, our CD3 bispecifics and novel checkpoint inhibitors such as fianlimab.\nRegarding such combinations, I'd like to provide a brief update on our first clinical data from our costimulatory pipeline involving REGN5678, our PSMAxCD28 costimulatory bispecific, in combination with Libtayo. This combination is being studied in patients with advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, who have previously progressed on multiple antiandrogen therapies. These patients, unfortunately, have a poor prognosis, with approximately 1 to 2 years of life expectancy and with limited treatment options. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is considered an immunologically cold tumor and is largely resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitor, with large trials of PD-1 antibodies showing monotherapy response rates in the single digits.\nAs just announced today by Merck, the challenge of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in terms of the lack of efficacy for checkpoint inhibitors used in standard way is emphasized by the failure of their large Phase III trial in an earlier stage of this disease. Our costim program was designed to innovatively enhance responsiveness in these types of cold tumor classes such as prostate cancer and essentially turn these cold tumors into hot tumors.\nI remind you of the extensive preclinical data we have published supporting this hypothesis. Since 2019, we have been in careful dose escalation for this prostate cancer program in close collaboration with the FDA. In our study, patients are dosed weekly with REGN5678 in every 3 weeks with Libtayo. However, first dose of Libtayo was not co-administered until week 4, permitting a period of PSMAxCD28, leading to evaluate monotherapy safety and efficacy.\nEarlier today, we announced the first clinical data from 33 patients across 8-dose levels, which show dose-dependent antitumor activity. The key efficacy endpoint in the study is objective response rate defined as a greater than 50% decline of prostate-specific antigen or PSA from baseline and/or tumor shrinkage. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland and by prostate tumors and is most commonly used as a biomarker to diagnose and follow-up prostate cancer, as many metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients have disease limited to bone lesions and cannot be assessed by conventional RECIST criteria.\nPreliminary data from the ongoing dose escalation portion trial across 8-dose level cohorts in a total of 33 patients showed dose-dependent antitumor activity as assessed by PSA values at the 5 lowest dose levels, which our preclinical models predicted might be subtherapeutic. There was almost no evidence of any antitumor activity, with only 1 of 17 patients showing a decrease in PSA. There were no greater than greater or equal to Grade 3 immune-related adverse events or irAEs these doses. The lack of antitumor activity among these patients was consistent with the approximate 6% response rate reported in other trials with anti-PD-1 monotherapy.\nAt the next 3 dose levels, we began to see clear evidence of dose-dependent antitumor activity, which was generally seen within 6 weeks of starting the combination treatment. At dose level 6, 1 of 4 patients experienced a 100% decrease in PSA and a complete response in target lesions based on RECIST criteria. The patients discontinued therapy due to a grade 3 immune-related adverse events of the skin. That was considered to be a recurrence of preexisting condition, and have since resolved with treatment per investigator report. Despite termination of the treatment, he has maintained his 100% decrease in PSA and complete response in target lesions were approximately 10 months to date per investigator report.\nWe continue to see antitumor activity at the next dose level or dose level 7. And in our eighth and most recent dose level, 3 out of 4 patients had dramatic and rapid PSA reductions, 2 with greater than 99% reductions and 1 with an 82% reduction. Of the 2 patients with greater than 99% PSA reductions, one experienced a grade 3 case of mucositis, which has resolved, and the other experienced a grade 3 case of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy, which is ongoing.\nIn terms of safety, very importantly, no grade 3 or higher irAEs were observed in patients without antitumor activity. And the occurrence of irAEs was correlated with antitumor activity. This is consistent with previous trials with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy wherein irAEs have been reported to occur at a higher rate in responding patients. No grade 4 irAEs or greater than or equal to grade 2 cytokine release syndrome have been observed in the trial to date.\nThere was one death that was considered unrelated to treatment. In this trial, irAEs are being treated according to standard management practices used for checkpoint inhibitors. We are planning on sharing more detailed data from this study at an upcoming medical meeting.\nLet me remind you that through extensive preclinical research, we have hypothesized that augmenting T cell costimulation alongside PD inhibition could be a key to turning immunologically cold tumors hot. These preliminary data for our PSMAxCD28 costimulated bispecific provides the first clinical evidence supporting the promise of our broader pipeline of costimulatory bispecifics in diverse solid tumors as well as hematologic malignancies. By combining these costimulatory bispecific with Libtayo or with our CD3 bispecifics, we have the opportunity to create novel therapeutic synergies to address some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers. We look forward to partnering with the oncology community on this ambitious and potentially groundbreaking efforts.\nIn addition to these exciting early data, we anticipate several important oncology milestones in the second half of the year. At the upcoming ESMO conference, we will provide updates on fianlimab, our LAG3 antibody in combination with Libtayo, in a Phase II cohort of metastatic melanoma that will hopefully confirm the encouraging combined efficacy that we previously reported in this setting. In addition, we will present initial data for ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in metastatic ovarian cancer, where I'd like to remind you that we have also combination studies ongoing with both costimulatory bispecifics and Libtayo. We will also report initial data for our METxMET bispecific in advanced MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer as well for Libtayo monotherapy in neoadjuvant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.\nMoving on to our hematology pipeline. Odronextamab has the potential to be the first C20xCD3 bispecific to be approved for both major types of advanced B-cell lymphomas, that is both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Based on interim data from a cohort of patients, goes with our recently modified step-up regimen. We believe odronextamab may have the lowest rates of Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome for this class of bispecifics, in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, while still maintaining the efficacy profile previously reported. We look forward to presenting these updated data and potentially submit a BLA for both indications in the second half of this year, pending feedback from the FDA.\nWe also plan to share updated data for our BCMAxCD3 bispecific study in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma by the end of the year. Pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit for regulatory approval in 2023. An umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating BCMAxCD3 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidate is now open to enrollment, while we plan to initiate an additional study in early lines of multiple myeloma later this year.\nAs you can see, the pace of innovation in our oncology pipeline has been accelerated, building upon Libtayo as a foundation, with data readouts for novel mechanisms for cancer indications that historically have not responded to immunotherapy, including with our Regeneron Genetics' medicines where we in collaborate continue to progress our pipeline and discovery engine. Our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH contains product candidates addressing various targets, including those discovered by the Regeneron Genetics Center. First data in NASH for ALN-HSD are anticipated this fall. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3, into the clinic later this year, and we have recently identified an additional novel promising target for NASH SIP.\nAs we just published in the New England Journal of Medicine, we found unprecedented association of very rare SIP loss of function variants with lower risk of liver disease. In the largest association study examining protection from liver disease ever described, individuals with loss of function SIP bearing had about 53% lower risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and about 54% lower risk of developing non-alcoholic cirrhosis. Regeneron and Alnylam are developing siRNA therapeutic candidate leads to advance to the clinic.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nEVP of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Regeneron's commercial business achieved another strong quarter, demonstrating durable growth across our brands. We're building on the momentum of in-line brands, including EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, and also accelerating the potential across our portfolio from new and anticipated future launches.\nLet me start with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 13% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.5 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales exceeded $1.6 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase driven by prescribing demand with strong demand continuing into the third quarter. EYLEA year-over-year growth significantly outpaced the category, gaining competitive share and further enhancing EYLEA's position as the anti-VEGF agent of choice for retinal disease. We continue to see durable growth based on patient flow and new patient starts, ongoing demographic trends such as the aging population and prevalence of diabetes support anticipated mid to high single-digit category growth for the foreseeable future.\nIn diabetic eye disease, increasing diagnosis rates are also driving strong growth for EYLEA, with more than 55 million injections worldwide since launch and well over 1 million injections in the U.S. alone in the second quarter of 2022. Physicians continue to recognize and prefer EYLEA's differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We are confident in our ability to continue to build on our leadership over the long term.\nPending FDA approvals, there are potential incremental opportunities for EYLEA, including extending the dosing interval up to 16 weeks for diabetic retinopathy and treating in pre-term infants suffering from retinopathy of prematurity. In addition, our aflibercept 8 milligram investigational program garnered significant enthusiasm from the retinal community and has the potential to significantly enhance the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm.\nTurning now to Libtayo. Global net sales in the second quarter grew 25% at constant currency to $141 million with U.S. net sales of $91 million. Libtayo continues to grow across all approved indications, including non-melanoma skin cancers, where Libtayo is the leading immunotherapy treatment. In monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer, we are generating increased utilization across a broader number of prescribers. We are launch-ready for the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which will significantly expand the patient opportunity and physician choice for Libtayo in treating lung cancer.\nRegeneron's full ownership of Libtayo presents many exciting opportunities across our current and future oncology portfolio. Key thought leaders recognize our growing commitment to oncology and of high interest in the potential for Libtayo combinations to meaningfully advance the standard of care in many cancer indications. We are taking a measured approach to expanding our global commercial footprint in key international markets to maximize the impact of our innovations to patients and Regeneron. These capabilities and infrastructure will support Libtayo, and over time, future medicines.\nAnd now turning to Dupixent. In the second quarter global Dupixent's net sales grew 42% year-over-year at constant currency to $2.1 billion. Dupixent's performance was yield by strong uptake across all indications, with recent launches performing well across new diseases, age groups and geographies. In the U.S., Dupixent's net sales grew 38% to $1.58 billion.\nWe continue to expand Dupixent's leadership position as the first line systemic treatment in atopic dermatitis. There's robust demand for Dupixent across the spectrum of moderate and severe disease as well as across age groups. With the recent approval in children as young as 6 months, Dupixent is the first and only biologic medicine approved to treat moderate to severe atopic dermatitis from infancy through adulthood, and the launch in our youngest patients is off to a very strong start based on initiations.\nWe are also preparing for the potential approval next month in prurigo nodularis, a dermatologic condition, where approximately 75,000 U.S. patients have no FDA-approved medicines and are most in need. In asthma, Dupixent is the #1 biologic prescribed by both allergists and pulmonologists. We continue to see strong growth in new patient starts and total prescriptions driven by Dupixent's differentiated profile, unique mechanism of action, ease of prescribing broad label and demonstrated efficacy and safety.\nIn nasal polyps, robust demand continues, with Dupixent capturing the majority of market share and increased prescribing from ENTs. In eosinophilic eosophagitis, our first gastroenterology indication, Dupixent is the only approved medicine for adults and children aged 12 and above. Early launch indicators have been favorable, with encouraging adoption from both allergists and gastroenterologists. In addition, we are expanding our outreach to educate patients and caregivers about Dupixent as a new therapeutic option that provides meaningful symptom relief.\nTurning now to Dupixent in markets outside the U.S. In the second quarter, net sales grew 61% on a constant currency basis to $510 million, driven by robust growth across all indications. Regeneron continues to expand our presence in key international markets to bring Dupixent to patients. In summary, Dupixent is transforming the type 2 inflammatory disease landscape and has significant growth potential ahead, driven by further penetration in existing indications as well as from potential future indications.\nIn conclusion, our commercial execution delivered solid results for the second quarter, bringing our life-changing medicines to even more patients. Our in-line brands continue to perform well, and new launches provide additional opportunities for sustainable long-term growth.\nNow I'll turn the call to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.\nRegeneron's outstanding performance continued in the second quarter as our core business maintained a strong growth trajectory, and we have leveraged our strong financial position to complete 2 business development oncology transactions. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, second quarter total revenues increased 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, demonstrating continued momentum across our business. Second quarter total diluted net income per share was $9.77 on net income of $1.1 billion.\nBeginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Second quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $870 million, up 13% on a constant currency basis versus second quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $358 million, of which $340 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S.\nTotal Sanofi collaboration revenue was $678 million in the second quarter of 2022, improved 55% from the prior year driven by Dupixent.\nFinally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $8 million related to Roche's sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We expect to record additional revenue from this collaboration in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMoving now to our operating expenses. R&D increased 7% year-over-year to $690 million, driven by higher headcount in costs to support our expanding pipeline, partially offset by lower development costs for REGEN-COV. In the second quarter of 2022, acquired IPR&D was $197 million, which includes a previously-disclosed $195 million charge related to our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals. SG&A expense increased 14% (sic) [15%] year-over-year to $418 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our growing organization.\nCost of goods sold decreased 73% year-over-year to $137 million primarily due to sales of REGEN-COV in the prior year that did not reoccur. Finally, the second quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 13.6% compared to 17% in the prior year. The lower rate is partially related to the non-recurrence of REGEN-COV sales.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date in 2022, Regeneron has generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and ended the second quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.3 billion.\nWe continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. Completing our acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, the first acquisition of Regeneron's history and the purchase of Sanofi stake in Libtayo. In addition, we repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares in the second quarter of 2022, bringing our year-to-date total through July to over $1.1 billion. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.\nI will now discuss updates to our full year 2022 guidance driven by the closing of the Libtayo transaction. We are updating full year R&D expense guidance to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.24 billion, an increase of $170 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. Approximately 1/3 of the increase is driven by Regeneron now recording all R&D expense for Libtayo, which was previously shared with Sanofi. The remaining 2/3 reflects the recording of our full 50% share of antibody collaboration spend as incurred beginning in the third quarter of 2022. Previously, our share of antibody collaboration expenses was only partially expensed in the period incurred, with the remaining share added to the antibody collaboration development balance.\nWe are updating full year SG&A expense guidance to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.84 billion. The updated range reflects the inclusion of 100% of Libtayo commercial expenses, which were previously shared with Sanofi net of anticipated synergies.\nWe are also updating full year gross margin guidance to be in the range of 92% to 93%. The more favorable gross margin is due to the removal of the payment of Sanofi's share of U.S. Libtayo gross margin that was previously recorded in this slide. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning.\nLet me conclude by highlighting 4 important financial modeling considerations related to the Libtayo transaction. First, effective July 1, Regeneron will record 100% of the global Libtayo net product sales. We previously recorded only U.S. Libtayo net product sales.\nSecond, the Libtayo up-front payment, milestones and royalties will be recorded as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and amortized through cost of goods sold over the useful life of Libtayo. This amortization expense will be excluded from non-GAAP results.\nThird, as you may recall, we will now pay 20% of our share of antibody profits to reduce the antibody development balance instead of the previous 10% arrangement. The quarterly development balance repayment going forward will be reflected in our P&L as incremental antibody R&D expense I mentioned earlier when discussing revised R&D guidance, with the remainder coming in the form of a reduction to antibody collaboration revenue. Therefore, the reduction of antibody collaboration revenue will be less than 20% of our share of antibody profits. As a result of the development balance repayment step-up, we expect to shorten the period to fully repay the development balance, resulting in an earlier and very significant inflection in collaboration profits in the other years.\nFinally, in the third quarter of 2022, we will record a one-time development balance repayment per the Libtayo transaction agreement of approximately $55 million in addition to our regular quarterly repayments, which we recorded as a deduction within the antibody collaboration revenue line.\nIn conclusion, Regeneron is performing well, and we continue to make investments in our business, supported by our strong financial position to drive sustainable long-term growth.\nWith that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nVP of IR, Myovant Sciences Ltd.\n\nThank you, Bob.\nBella, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A with several callers in the queue. And to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer one question from each caller before moving to the next.\nBella, please go ahead and poll for questions.",

Len?\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan. Welcome to your first earnings call. Hope all of our stakeholders will join me in giving you a warm welcome to the Regeneron team. Thanks to everyone joining the call as well.\nFollowing an exceptional 2021, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2022. Our first quarter results were driven by execution across the entire company as we continue to realize the benefits of our sustained investment in differentiated research and development, along with our focus on commercial performance.\nWe also continue to drive shareholder value through prudent capital allocation, including approximately $350 million of share repurchases in the first 3 months of this year.\nRegarding our financial performance, we delivered strong double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Excluding revenue contributions from our investigation of COVID antibody cocktail, revenues grew 25%, reflecting our increasingly diversified core business, which continues to thrive.\nFor EYLEA, global net sales grew 11% to nearly $2.4 billion in the first quarter, including $1.5 billion of revenues in the United States, up 13% versus last year, which outpaced the U.S. anti-VEGF category growth. In yet another milestone for EYLEA, after more than 10 years, we recently surpassed 50 million EYLEA injections globally, a testament to its well-established efficacy and safety profile.\nWe believe EYLEA continues to represent a significant long-term growth opportunity, primarily driven by an aging population, increasing utilization among a rapidly-growing diabetic population as well as the potential for our investigational aflibercept 8 milligrams to complement and enhance our retinal franchise.\nFor Dupixent, in quarter 1, global revenues for the quarter exceeded $1.8 billion, an increase of 43% to last year as we continue to redefine the treatment of Type 2 inflammatory diseases. A significant opportunity remains to reach even more patients in already-approved indications, and we look forward to potentially launching Dupixent in 7 new indications in the U.S. later this year and in early 2023, including pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. Collectively, approximately 200,000 U.S. patients are suffering from these 3 indications today, but currently have no approved -- no FDA-approved systemic treatment options.\nIn oncology, Libtayo continues to capture significant share in FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications where it is considered the standard of care. Beyond dermato-oncology, we're beginning to generate momentum in monotherapy non-small cell lung cancer in the United States, helping to build a foundation for potential launch of Libtayo plus chemotherapy later this year, which would allow Libtayo to address a much larger population of non-small cell lung cancer patients.\nAs we have said before, we continue to consider Libtayo to be foundational to our immuno-oncology development strategy and expect it to serve as the backbone for our investigational clinical program in combination with various antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics in our pipeline as well as other pipeline candidates, including those from our collaborations.\nIn April, we announced our agreement to acquire CheckMate Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron's first-ever acquisition of the company. Upon closing, we expect CheckMate differentiated Toll receptor 9 agonist, vidutolimod, will add a promising new modality to Regeneron's pipeline of potential approaches for difficult-to-treat cancers.\nLooking ahead, we remain on track for the second half of this year to share data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors, such as ovarian and prostate cancers; to submit a BLA for odronextamab, a potentially best-in-class CD20xCD3 bispecific for refractory B-cell lymphomas; and to advance REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific.\nFinally, regarding our ongoing COVID-19 response, Regeneron remains committed to combating the virus as we head towards the likely endemic stage. We firmly believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an important role, particularly to protect immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines as well as to treat infected patients whom an oral antiviral therapy is not well tolerated or might trigger serious drug-drug interactions. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are designed to be active against multiple variants, including those of Omicron lineage, and initiated a first-in-human study last month.\nConcurrently, as the FDA continues their review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis, we are working closely and collaboratively with them and other global regulatory authorities to establish clinical and regulatory pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal treatment options to patients as quickly as possible.\nIn closing, we are excited about the strong commercial momentum for our in-line portfolio and the progress we have made advancing our pipeline so far this year. For the remainder of 2022, we anticipate up to 8 additional U.S. and EU regulatory approvals, up to 4 additional U.S. or EU regulatory filings, pivotal data for aflibercept at 8 milligrams as well as various other data readouts from other pipeline programs, which George will discuss.\nWe remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business, and our pipeline continues to be highly productive, and we are in a strong financial position, all of which positions Regeneron to deliver sustainable growth and long-term value creation.\nNow, I will turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nScientific Founder, President, Chief Scientific Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Len, and I will start with ophthalmology today.\nAt the recent Angiogenesis meeting, we presented encouraging results for the Phase II CANDELA study of aflibercept 8 milligram in patients with wet AMD. CANDELA met the primary safety endpoints with no new safety signals observed through week 44, and efficacy endpoints numerically favored aflibercept 8 milligram in visual acuity, drying and other anatomical measures through week 44.\nPhase III studies, PHOTON in DME and PULSAR in wet AMD are ongoing. The primary objective of the Phase III study is to determine whether aflibercept 8 milligram dosing can allow for more extended dosing intervals while maintaining efficacy and safety.\nRegarding Phase III design in both PHOTON and the PULSAR studies, patients are randomized at baseline to 3 groups: An every 8-week EYLEA 2-milligram arm; an every 12-week 8-milligram aflibercept arm; and every 16-week 8-milligram aflibercept arm following loading doses. The primary endpoint of both these studies is mean change in best-corrected visual acuity or BCVA at week 48. The primary endpoint will be met if 8-milligram aflibercept is non-inferior to 2-milligram EYLEA, while being dosed less frequently.\nWe anticipate results of both PHOTON and PULSAR in the second half of this year, and if positive, to file for regulatory approvals in the U.S. and EU by early 2023.\nMoving to Dupixent, which had a remarkable quarter in terms of clinical updates and regulatory progress. In January, we announced our second positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis, a disease with high unmet need. At the AAAAI and AAD meeting this year, we presented detailed data from the first positive Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. And we also presented detailed data from our positive Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic spontaneous urticaria or CSU in biologic-naive patients.\nThe second Phase III CSU study in patients refractory to omalizumab did not reach statistical significance at an interim analysis. And as announced in March, we have completed enrollment in the first of the 2 Phase III Dupixent studies in COPD and anticipate data from this first study to read out in the first half of next year.\nIn terms of regulatory progress, we expect an FDA decision for Dupixent in children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis by the new June 9 PDUFA date. We are also excited about an upcoming trial in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases or the NIAID to assess efficacy and safety of Dupixent for asthma in underserved populations, including Black and Hispanic children in the United States.\nAdditionally, we are expecting an FDA decision for our supplementary BLA in eosinophilic esophagitis in patients 12 years and older by August 3, and we completed our regulatory submission for prurigo nodularis indication with FDA acceptance of this application anticipated shortly.\nMoving to Libtayo and oncology. We are excited about the upcoming milestones in our oncology pipeline, including the FDA decision on our Libtayo chemo combo application for non-small cell lung cancer, data readouts and potential regulatory filings for our hematologic bispecifics as well as initial data readouts from our bispecific antibodies for solid tumors.\nIn hematology, odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has the potential for best-in-class efficacy in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and was recently granted Fast Track designation from the FDA for these indications. Detailed results of our first-in-human study were recently published in Lancet Hematology and our registration intent programs in late-stage follicular lymphoma and DLBCL are expected to complete enrollment soon. Based on the safety profile we are observing from an updated step-up dosing regimen, we believe odronextamab has the potential to be administered entirely within the outpatient setting. We look forward to filing with this updated data set later this year pending regulatory feedback from the FDA.\nDevelopment of REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, remains on track. And pending regulatory feedback, we are planning to submit regulatory approval in the first half of 2023. Studies in earlier lines of the disease, as well as an umbrella study in multiple myeloma investigating 5458 in combination with various standard of care products and investigational candidates, will begin enrollment shortly.\nIn the second half of the year, we anticipate initial clinical data disclosures for 3 first-in-class bispecifics. Our MUC16xCD3 monotherapy for late-stage ovarian cancer, our METxMET bispecific antibody for MET-altered non-small cell lung cancer, as well as our PSMAxCD28 co-stim bispecific in combination with Libtayo in late-stage prostate cancers. For these late-stage cancers, patients have limited options and showing any durable response would be a promising early sign to be confirmed with additional clinical studies also involving combinations.\nWe continue to progress our strategic approach to oncology, which starts with Libtayo as our foundational anti-PD-1 therapy and is augmented by logical combinations utilizing our broad oncology pipeline, whether it involves combining Libtayo with a second checkpoint inhibitor, as we are doing with the LAG-3 antibody in melanoma and other settings, with different combinations of bispecifics or with other agents in our portfolio.\nBriefly turning to our antibodies against COVID-19. As we recently announced, the FDA extended its review of our REGEN-COV BLA for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis, with a new action date of July 13. This extension was due to ongoing discussions with additional data provided to the FDA on pre-exposure prophylaxis use of REGEN-COV. As this regulatory process continues, we are advancing next-generation COVID-19 antibodies and initiated a first-in-human trial with a new candidate in April. We continue to believe that a major unmet need for COVID antibodies is in chronic disease prevention for immunocompromised patients, and future development efforts will be addressing this population.\nConcluding with our Regeneron Genetics medicine, where we and collaborators continue to advance our pipeline.\nFor our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, we are very excited about our first-in-class approach to combining siRNA with antibody therapeutics, designed to maximize effect as well as duration of target blockade. The first of these is our C5 siRNA antibody combination, cemdisiran plus pozelimab. Phase III studies of their combination treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, and myasthenia gravis are underway. We will be dosing patients shortly.\nIn PNH, we are planning to test our combo in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. Beyond C5, several edition combination programs are in our pre-clinical pipeline.\nWe continue to work with Alnylam as leaders in the use of siRNA therapeutics to address non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, with several programs addressing novel targets discovered by the Regeneron Genetics Center. First data in NASH patients for ALN-HSD are anticipated mid-2022. We are progressing a second target, PNPLA3 into the clinic later this year, and we have recently identified an additional novel promising target that has been validated by RGC and is awaiting peer review publication.\nWe are also pleased to report a notable milestone that we and Alnylam initiated our first CNS-targeted siRNA clinical program, targeting amyloid precursor protein or APP, in development for both cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease. Showing that this siRNA approach can reduce levels of the target protein in the CNS has the potential to open the door for using this approach in multiple genetically-defined neurodegenerative diseases.\nIn the first quarter, we and Intellia provided an update on our joint CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. Just to remind you, this is the first example of achieving CRISPR-based genomic editing in human beings. Our recent update demonstrated greater than 90% reduction of transthyretin durably achieved for the follow-up observation period in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy as well as acceptable safety observed so far.\nOur genetics medicine portfolio now includes the diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are working on with Alnylam, targeting the diseases of the liver, the brain and the eye as well as our crystal-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our viral-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel addressing congenial forms of hearing loss and other internal programs. While it's still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nEVP of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Our commercial performance in the first quarter reflects strong execution and the competitive strengths of our diversified and growing portfolio.\nStarting with EYLEA. First quarter global net sales grew 11% year-over-year to nearly $2.4 billion. Over the same period, U.S. net product sales grew 13% to $1.52 billion as EYLEA continues to strengthen its leadership position. Across all proved indications, EYLEA is the preferred anti-VEGF treatment based on its differentiated efficacy and safety profile as well as extensive real-world patient and physician experience.\nAs Len mentioned, we are incredibly proud that EYLEA has helped improve or save the vision of patients around the world, with more than 50 million treatments since launch.\nCategory growth in EYLEA market share continued to increase across all approved indications. In diabetic eye disease, we have seen notable increases across the patient continuum from initial patient diagnosis through to receiving ongoing EYLEA treatment. We believe diabetic eye disease will remain an important source of future growth for EYLEA, as unfortunately, most patients remain underdiagnosed and undertreated.\nBeyond EYLEA, our investigational aflibercept 8 milligram clinical program continues to generate excitement and a high level of interest within the retinal community. If supported by Phase III results, aflibercept 8 milligram has the potential to be a major enhancement to the anti-VEGF treatment paradigm.\nIn summary, we are confident in Regeneron's ability to maintain leadership over the long term based on our current EYLEA performance and future potential of aflibercept 8 milligram.\nTurning now to Libtayo, with first quarter global net sales of $125 million. In the U.S., net sales were $79 million based on steadily-improving demand across FDA-approved non-melanoma skin cancer indications. The number of prescribers has increased in our non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy indication based on growing brand awareness, positive prescriber feedback and an increasing number of institutions and networks that have included Libtayo in protocols and pathways. We are working to build on this momentum ahead of the potential chemotherapy combination approval expected later this year that would dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in lung cancer.\nAnd finally, on to Dupixent, which again achieved remarkable growth for the quarter, demonstrated by a 43% increase in global net sales to over $1.8 billion. Our performance is fueled by a robust uptake across all approved indications as well as an expanding geographic footprint and potential future indications, including use in younger patients.\nDupixent is a transformational medicine for patients and prescribers with significant growth potential ahead. In the U.S., net product sales grew 38% to $1.3 billion. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent is the first-line systemic treatment in patients with moderate to severe disease. Health care specialists recognize Dupixent's differentiated profile, which includes dual NT-IL-4 and IL-13 mechanism of action, compelling efficacy, rapid symptom relief and well-established safety profile. More than 430,000 patients worldwide are currently on treatment across all indications, and launch preparations are underway for the June potential label expansion for children as young as 6 months of age with atopic dermatitis. We estimate approximately 75,000 biologic eligible children in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this younger age group.\nWe also look forward to potentially extending Dupixent's label to include additional dermatology conditions, including prurigo nodularis where patients have no currently FDA-approved medicines. Approximately 75,000 U.S. patients with PN are in need of new treatment options and may benefit from Dupixent.\nIn the highly-competitive biologic asthma indication, Dupixent continues to grow based on its compelling differentiation for health care professionals based on its unique dual mechanism of action, ease of administration, demonstrated safety, broad label and use in both steroid-dependent patients and pediatric patients.\nThere are positive prescribing trends from the recent pediatric asthma launch. In nasal polyps, Dupixent remains the preferred choice for both ENTs and allergists, with rapid growth even 3 years after initial launch.\nMany patients with Type 2 or allergic disease suffer from another concomitant Type 2 disease. For example, in our atopic dermatitis clinical program, 40% of patients also had asthma. Dupixent is differentiated not only by its efficacy and safety profile in individual FDA-approved Type 2 indications, but also its potential to simultaneously address multiple Type 2 diseases in the same patient.\nWe look forward to expanding Dupixent into even more Type 2 diseases. Launch preparations are underway for eosinophilic esophagitis, where there are no FDA-approved medicines and significant unmet need.\nImportantly, in our EoE clinical program, approximately 45% of patients also had atopic dermatitis or asthma. If approved in EoE, we estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent in this indication. Key opinion leaders continue to provide positive feedback on our clinical data, especially given the lack of effective approved treatment alternatives for the patients who suffer from multiple EoE symptoms.\nTurning briefly now to Dupixent in markets outside the U.S. In the first quarter, net product sales grew 61% to $485 million. Over the past year, Regeneron has expanded our commercial presence in several key markets outside the United States, and we are encouraged with progress so far integrating our sales efforts with Sanofi.\nIn summary, we see significant potential for Dupixent to continue to change the lives of patients and our families, and we will continue to advance initiatives that bring Dupixent to those in need.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with the performance across our portfolio. We continue to advance our in-line brands and are on track to deliver on future launches, positioning Regeneron for sustained and long-term growth.\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marion. My comments today are on Regeneron's financial results, and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted.\nRegeneron is off to a strong start in 2022, with double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter driven by execution across the business. First quarter total revenues grew 17% year-over-year to $2.97 billion. Excluding global revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 25%, demonstrating continued strength of our core business. First quarter total diluted net income per share grew 16% to $11.49 on net income of $1.3 billion.\nBeginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. First quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $869 million, growing 7% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis versus first quarter of 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $385 million, of which we recorded $338 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.\nTotal Sanofi collaboration revenue was $631 million in the first quarter of 2022 and grew 73% from the prior year, driven by Dupixent. In this quarter, we recognized the $50 million sales milestone upon achieving $2 billion of aggregate ex-U.S. sales for antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis.\nFinally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $216 million related to Roche sales of Ronapreve outside the U.S. We do expect additional revenue from this collaboration primarily in the second half of 2022.\nRegarding REGEN-COV in the U.S. Consistent with our commentary from earlier this year, we did not record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV in the first quarter of 2022. Absent the execution and fulfillment of an additional government contract, we do not expect to record any U.S. sales for REGEN-COV this year.\nOther revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $94 million. This includes a $30 million upfront payment from our collaborator, Ultragenyx to market Evkeeza outside of the U.S.\nMoving now to our operating expenses. R&D increased 12% to $751 million, driven by higher headcount and clinical manufacturing costs, including for next-gen COVID antibodies, partially offset by lower clinical trial costs for REGEN-COV.\nStarting in the first quarter of 2022, we are changing the presentation of our non-GAAP results to include in-process R&D acquired in connection with asset acquisitions as well as upfront and opt-in payments related to license and collaboration agreements. Going forward, we will now include these charges in both GAAP and non-GAAP results as a new line item called acquired in-process research and development.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, acquired IP R&D was $28 million, which includes a $20 million opt-in payment to our collaborator, Adicet. In full year 2021, there were $44 million of aggregate upfront payments excluded from non-GAAP R&D expense, all of which were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nSG&A expense increased 10% year-over-year to $389 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount to support our expanding organization. COCM increased 58% year-over-year to $198 million due to higher sales of Dupixent and an increase in shipments of commercial supplies of Praluent for Sanofi outside the United States.\nFinally, the first quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.6% compared to 10.5% in the prior year.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2022, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow, inclusive of collections from the U.S. government for sales of REGEN-COV recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. It ended the first quarter of 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.4 billion.\nWe continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. Last month, we announced the agreement to acquire CheckMate Pharmaceuticals for a total equity value of approximately $250 million. Earlier this week, we launched the tender offer for CheckMate shares and expect this deal to close in mid-2022, subject to receipt of regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.\nIn addition, we repurchased $352 million of our shares in the first quarter of 2022. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.\nI will conclude with select updates to our full year 2022 guidance and outlook. We were updating full year R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. The increase in guidance is driven by clinical manufacturing costs for next-gen COVID antibodies, most of which were recorded in the first quarter, and advancing programs across our pipeline. We also now expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning.\nIn conclusion, our core business is performing well, and we continue to make investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong financial position, leaving Regeneron well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.\nWith that, I will pass the call back to Ryan.\n\nRyan Crowe\n\nThank you, Bob.\nGigi, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&A. With more than 20 callers in the queue and to ensure we are able to address as many questions as possible, we will answer only one question from each caller before moving to the next.\nGigi, please go ahead.",

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer.\n\nLeonard S. Schleifer\n\nFounder, President, CEO & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone joining today's call.\nThe fourth quarter of 2021 capped off a terrific year for Regeneron. Our performance was driven by strong execution across the organization, despite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19. We're all proud of the incredible work and dedication of our employees who continuously deliver on our mission to bring important medicines and novel medical breakthroughs to patients in need.\nThroughout 2021, we delivered strong top and bottom line growth. Revenues, excluding our COVID antibody cocktail, grew 19%, a testament of our diversified and strengthening core business. Our innovative and world-class pipeline advanced across a wide variety of diseases.\nWe also unveiled initial clinical data and pipeline advancements from our Regeneron Genetics medicines portfolio, which has the potential to unlock significant long-term value.\nAdditionally, we returned substantial cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. In '21, we spent approximately $1.7 billion repurchasing over 3 million shares.\nFor EYLEA, 2021 global sales grew 19% to $9.4 billion. Even after 10 years on the market and millions of injections later, we continue to view EYLEA as an enduring product, with significant future opportunity, despite new market entries.\nIn the second half of the year, we look forward to the results from our Phase III aflibercept 8-milligram high-dose program. If those data continue to support that aflibercept 8 milligrams provides extended dosing duration without compromising on safety and efficacy, aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to complement and enhance our retinal franchise.\nWith Dupixent, we are delivering on a goal of transforming the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. 2021 global sales of Dupixent were $6.2 billion, representing 53% growth for the year. Looking ahead, Dupixent's outlook is bright. There are significant opportunities to increase market penetration rates in approved indications, and we are in the midst of a wave of new data submissions and launches in potential new indications, further fueling Dupixent's growth.\nIn oncology, Libtayo continues to thrive in the approved non-melanoma skin cancers. We look forward to potential Libtayo plus chemotherapy approval later this year in the broader population of non-small cell lung cancer patients.\nOur oncology footprint continues to expand. We have advanced many candidates and combinations into the clinic with a range of antibodies, bispecifics and co-stimulatory bispecifics across many cancer settings. This year, we look forward to sharing what we hope will be groundbreaking data in difficult-to-treat solid tumors, such as prostate cancers and ovarian cancers, both of which are conditions with historically low response rates to immunotherapy.\nWe also remain encouraged in the progress of our maturing CD3 bispecifics. We are confident in the overall safety and efficacy profile for odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific.\nWe are forging ahead with REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, which we believe will play an active role in the treatment of multiple myeloma given its competitive profile.\nLast but not least, we are immensely proud of our rapid response efforts against COVID-19. In 2021, REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail, was administered to millions of people globally, making a major impact during the darkest days of the pandemic. Based on preclinical data, we recently announced that REGEN-COV is highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. Appropriately, the FDA amended the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV, limiting its use in the U.S. in light of the Omicron variant being dominant.\nRegeneron remains committed to helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We are progressing next-generation antibodies that are active against Omicron, Delta and other variants of concern. We are scaling up manufacturing efforts and completing the necessary requirements to begin clinical trials for next-generation candidate in the coming months.\nConcurrently, we are working closely and collaboratively with the FDA and other global regulatory authorities to establish and define clinical pathways to bring additional safe and effective monoclonal antibody treatment options to patients as quickly as possible. As one of the leaders in the fight against COVID-19, our VelociSuite platform of technologies makes us uniquely positioned to promptly develop and deliver potentially life-saving medicines.\nAs the COVID-19 story transforms from pandemic to endemic, we believe there will remain a significant opportunity to use our next-generation monoclonals as a prevention for those immunocompromised individuals who do not respond adequately to COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, monoclonal antibody therapy is likely to play an ongoing role in treatment for infected individuals.\nIn conclusion, 2021 was another high-performance year for Regeneron. With strong commercial results from our in-line marketed products, 30-plus pipeline candidates progressing through clinical trials, our discovery efforts firing on all cylinders, a growing portfolio of highly productive external collaborations and our strong financial position with over $12 billion in cash and marketable securities, Regeneron is extremely well positioned for the future.\nNow I will turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge D. Yancopoulos\n\nScientific Founder, President, Chief Scientific Officer & Director, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Len. I'll start by briefly addressing our novel monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19. As Len mentioned, we are rapidly developing next-generation antibodies that retain potency against Omicron and other variants of concern.\nEarly in 2019, we anticipated that the virus would mutate and, thus, began generating large pools of virus-neutralizing antibody candidates from both human survivors and our VelocImmune mice. We have continually evaluated and refreshed this pool and now have next-generation candidates that, based on preclinical studies, effectively neutralize Omicron and other variants of concern. We're on track to initiate clinical trials with the first of these in the coming months.\nIn addition, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding how to streamline the development program for monoclonal antibodies, considering the unwavering unmet need and demand for these medicines, especially with potential future virus variants in mind. As Len already highlighted, since we believe that monoclonal antibodies will continue to play an especially important role in the treatment of future protection of the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone, we are committed to undertaking a development pathway that will make this possible in the near future.\nMoving on to ophthalmology. At the upcoming Angiogenesis meeting, we will present the final Phase II data from the aflibercept 8-milligram CANDELA study in patients with wet AMD. In this study, aflibercept 8 milligram, given at the same protocol-specified dosing schedule, as currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram met its primary safety endpoint, with measures of drawing numerically favoring the 8-milligram dose over the 2-milligram dose.\nThese 2 -- these Phase II results give us more confidence that the upcoming Phase III readouts has a potential to show that the higher 8-milligram aflibercept dose can at least match the efficacy and safety of EYLEA, but with more convenient dosing.\nMoving on to Dupixent. Building on the outstanding clinical success Dupixent has shown so far across a wide spectrum of allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, the second Phase III study in prurigo nodularis recently met primary and key secondary endpoints, making Dupixent the first and only systemic medicine to demonstrate such success in this indication.\nThese data confirm the results from the first Phase III trial, where 60% of Dupixent patients met the primary endpoint of its reduction compared to 18% of placebo patients at 24 weeks.\nNearly 3x many Dupixent patients experienced reduced skin lesions compared to placebo as well. Prurigo nodularis marks the sixth disease for which Dupixent has demonstrated profound benefit for patients, providing convincing evidence that the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways inhibited by Dupixent are the key drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying all of these diseases.\nWe have to appreciate how remarkable the Dupixent story is in terms of the important benefit it provides for the many patients across this diverse set of clinical conditions, together with its well-established safety profile, and highlights how Dupixent is delivering on its promise of providing a pipeline in a product.\nAt the upcoming AAAAI meeting, in addition to the other important Dupixent updates, we will present pivotal results for the recent top line studies in eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE, and for the first chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU study. EOE is a complex disease, and we are excited to share these data with the scientific community and patients. Our first regulatory submission for EOE in adolescents and adults is underway, with regulatory submissions for prurigo nodularis also starting in the first half of this year.\nAnticipated flow of Dupixent-related clinical data update continues. We are planning on reporting results in an additional Phase III study in CSU this time in omalizumab experienced patients and also for the chronic cold-induced urticaria indication in the second half of this year.\nThese represents more difficult-to-treat patients or condition and present a higher bar for Dupixent. We're looking forward to results of these pivotal studies.\nMoving on to oncology and first Libtayo. Progress in our oncology portfolio includes pivotal readouts and regulatory filings for Libtayo presented an anticipated data readouts for our bispecifics as well as multiple upcoming milestones with novel diversified pipeline entrants. As Len mentioned, the Libtayo chemotherapy combination for patients with non-small cell lung cancer is under review at the FDA with a PDUFA date of September 19, 2022, which could address a larger portion of the patients with lung cancer.\nIn hematology, at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, we presented encouraging data for REGN5458, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, investigated for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with safety data that has shown no grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome to date and strong efficacy data.\nWe believe our investigational agent is promising and has the potential to be competitive in this indication. We are planning on investigating this product for earlier lines of myeloma therapy, in combination with standard of care, and are excited about the combination with an appropriate co-stimulatory bispecific, which could further enhance responses.\nOdronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has the potential for a best-in-class efficacy profile in both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our updated step-up dosing protocol may mitigate safety concerns and decrease the need for hospitalizations to manage cytokine release syndrome.\nIn terms of progress of our bispecifics for solid tumors, as previously disclosed, we are observing early signs of activity for our MUC16xCD3 bispecific monotherapy developed for late-stage ovarian cancer, and we are excited to be sharing these early data later this year.\nIn addition to monotherapy, the MUC16xCD3 bispecific is being investigated in combination with Libtayo and in a first of its kind in a combination trial with a MUC16xCD28 bispecific. These combinations are in early stages that are advancing through dose escalations.\nLater this year, we are hoping to share initial results for a unique biparatopic MET X MET antibody studied in advanced non-small cell cancer patients with MET protein alterations. Early signs of clinical activity we have observed so far with the naked MET X MET bispecific antibody, especially in patients with MET overexpression, bode well for our follow-on agents, the MET X MET bispecific antibody drug conjugate, which is now enrolling patients in a Phase I study.\nWe are also excited about our early-stage EGFRxCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific program for lung and other cancers.\nFor prostate cancer, we are expecting initial readouts from our first co-stimulatory bispecific PSMAxCD28 later this year as well. PSMAxCD28 is progressing through dose escalation in combination with Libtayo.\nWe are excited about the potential of our broad oncology portfolio, which includes multiple Phase I, II and III assets, as many are beginning to believe the future is going to involve the right combination of targeted immunotherapy agents.\nConcluding with our Regeneron Genetic medicines efforts, we and our collaborators have made significant strides in expanding the capabilities and scale of our groundbreaking work in genetics medicines. In terms of our siRNA collaboration with Alnylam, ALN-HSD is progressing through healthy volunteers, and initial data in NASH patients are anticipated by the middle of this year.\nWith the C5 siRNA and the antibody combination, another first of its kind, healthy volunteer data were presented at ASH, demonstrating PK and PD results supportive of the monthly subcutaneous dosing regimen selected for pivotal studies.\nPhase III studies of the combination for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, were also initiated. Recall, in PNH, we are planning to test our combination in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab.\nAlso Alnylam has recently announced submission of the CTA application for ALN-APP, the industry's first-ever investigational RNAi therapeutic for CNS diseases. This agent will be evaluated in both the relatively rare disease driven by amyloid precursor protein, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, as well as in early-onset Alzheimer's disease.\nFinally, later this quarter, we and Intellia will provide our -- an update on our joint TTR CRISPR-based knockout program for transthyretin amyloidosis. This will include additional ascending dose interim clinical data from the polyneuropathy arm of the ongoing Intellia 2001 Phase I study.\nWe have also expanded the study to include patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which we believe will address an even broader patient population.\nWe are very excited by our large and diverse pipeline of siRNA candidates that we are advancing with Alnylam, ranging from targeting the liver, the brain and the eye, as well as our CRISPR-based approaches in collaboration with Intellia and our viral-targeted gene delivery programs, such as with Decibel. While still early, we think these groundbreaking approaches have the potential to change the practice of medicine.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Marion.\n\nMarion E. McCourt\n\nEVP of Commercial, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, George.\nOur fourth quarter business performance demonstrated the strength and resilience of our in-line brands and creates a foundation for commercial success as we prepare for future launches.\nStarting with EYLEA. We recently announced fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.55 billion and $5.79 billion in 2021. This represented 17% year-over-year U.S. growth for the full year, which is noteworthy for a brand 10 years post launch.\nEYLEA reached record share across all approved indications and is the recognized leader in a category that continues to grow due to favorable demographic trends. EYLEA remains physicians' top choice for patients with indicated retinal diseases due to its demonstrated efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and unsurpassed real-world experience, with more than 40 million administered injections worldwide.\nWe are also excited about ongoing strategic initiatives that position our retinal franchise for future growth, such as our educational efforts in place across existing indications where many patients don't receive the treatment they need.\nBeyond EYLEA, we are encouraged by promising early results for high-dose aflibercept 8 milligram, which, if supported by Phase III clinical results, potentially represents next-generation treatment for a range of eye diseases.\nTurning to Libtayo, where global net sales in the fourth quarter were $121 million, in the U.S., net sales reached $81 million. In advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which currently drives majority of performance, Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment, and we saw steady growth as the market continued its post-COVID recovery.\nIn advanced basal cell carcinoma, Libtayo is also rapidly being established as standard of care in patients who have progressed or are inappropriate for hedgehog inhibitors, building on our strength in non-melanoma skin cancers.\nIn advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we are making progress in the launch of our monotherapy indication with a steadily growing prescriber base. There is also significant opportunity in the chemotherapy combination setting. And if proved, Libtayo would be available for a much broader range of first-line lung cancer patients than for monotherapy alone. Our experience is that medical oncologists consider combination treatment first and reserve monotherapy for a much smaller group of patients, which, in part, has limited Libtayo uptake in lung cancer to date.\nBriefly turning to our cardiovascular franchise. Evkeeza, our treatment for patients with HoFH, was successfully launched in 2021 and is already the standard of care. We continue to see initiations in both switch and category naive patients. In 2021, we are focused on employing innovative efforts to identify patients not currently diagnosed with HoFH.\nOn to Dupixent, which grew 51% in global net sales in the fourth quarter year-over-year to $1.77 billion, in the U.S., net sales grew 46% to $1.35 billion. Dupixent is well positioned for ongoing rapid growth based on significant unmet need in existing and potential new disease areas, with anticipated expansion into even younger age groups and new geographies worldwide.\nIn atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate to severe disease. Dupixent is health care specialists' first-line systemic treatment of choice due to several highly differentiating product characteristics, including its dual anti-IL-4 and IL-13 mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and rapid symptom relief, well-established safety profile, with no risk of serious infections due to immunosuppression and clinical data in children as young as 6 months.\nIf approved, we look forward to expanding Dupixent's skin indications to include babies and young children with atopic dermatitis as well as 2 new dermatologic indications. There are no currently approved biologic medicines for prurigo nodularis, where we estimate approximately 75,000 patients may benefit from Dupixent in the U.S. alone. We're also progressing an important opportunity to help chronic spontaneous urticaria patients.\nDupixent is also steadily growing in the highly competitive asthma space. We see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent in moderate to severe disease through its competitive profile, including a broad label that allows use in uncontrolled steroid-dependent patients, regardless of their eosinophil levels, as well as use in patients as young as 6 years of age.\nDupixent is also the preferred treatment of ENTs and allergists in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, regardless of prior surgery and contributes meaningfully to our business.\nWe are also progressing our launch plans for eosinophilic esophagitis, a gastrointestinal disease with substantial unmet need. We estimate at least 50,000 patients in the U.S. could benefit from Dupixent if approved. We've received positive feedback from key opinion leaders on the strength of our data and lack of suitable treatment alternatives for this serious disease.\nIn summary, in 2021, our commercial team delivered strong growth across the portfolio. Our momentum and new launch opportunities position us well for the future growth.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert E. Landry\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable.\nRegeneron's fourth quarter capped off a strong year. In the quarter, we delivered top and bottom line growth driven by strong execution within our core business.\nFourth quarter total revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $5 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total fourth quarter revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, demonstrating continuing strength of our core business.\nFourth quarter total diluted net income per share was $23.72 on net income of $2.7 billion.\nStarting with REGEN-COV. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the remaining 1.1 million doses from our September 2021 U.S. government supply agreement and recognized $2.3 billion of U.S. net sales. In accordance with our global collaboration with Roche, the amount of manufactured products supplied by each party to the global market resulted in the recognition of a true-up payment related to Roche's share of profits. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a $260 million charge in cost of goods sold and recorded no Roche collaboration revenue.\nAs mentioned, we completed all deliveries under the September 2021 U.S. government supply contract in the fourth quarter. With the FDA's recent amendment to REGEN-COV's emergency use authorization, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022.\nI will now move to our collaborations, starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2021 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales as reported to us by Bayer were $934 million, growing 9% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $372 million, of which we recorded $354 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.\nTotal Sanofi collaboration revenue was $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Despite seasonally higher fourth quarter operating expenses, our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $388 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $230 million in the fourth quarter of last year.\nMoving now to fourth quarter 2021 operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $639 million primarily due to lower spending on REGEN-COV development as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nSG&A expense increased 30% year-over-year to $495 million primarily due to cost related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher head count-related costs.\nCost of goods sold were $559 million primarily related to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and, as I mentioned earlier, the recognition of the $260 million true-up payment to Roche for their share of profits related to the COVID antibody cocktail.\nFinally, the fourth quarter 2021 effective tax rate was 12.7%.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the year, Regeneron generated $6.5 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities less debt of $9.8 billion.\nIn the fourth quarter 2021, we exhausted the remaining balance on our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And in November, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Across both, we've repurchased approximately 850 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation.\nNow let me conclude with our initial 2022 outlook and guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we do not expect to record any U.S. REGEN-COV sales in the first half of 2022.\nFor U.S. Praluent throughout 2021, we observed significant category and competitive pressures. We expect these pressures to accelerate throughout 2022.\nAnd now for our 2022 expense guidance. For R&D, we forecast our 2022 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. As we highlighted throughout 2021, critically important development programs are advancing in 2022, including the late-stage randomized studies versus branded comparators for the LAG3 Libtayo combination, BCMAxCD3 and C5 programs in development expenses to advance next-generation antibodies against COVID-19.\nFor SG&A, we forecast our 2022 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.77 billion. Based on our initial plan, we expect SG&A expenses to be spread evenly across the quarters in 2022.\nFor COGS, we forecast 2022 product gross margin on our percentage of net product sales to be between 90% and 92%. We expect cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $750 million to $830 million driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise.\nAnd finally, we anticipate our 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. A complete summary of our full year guidance is available in our press release issued earlier this morning.\nIn conclusion, our core business continues to advance and strengthen. With growth continuing across our existing portfolio and investments in our R&D engine supported by our strong balance sheet, we remain well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.\n\nMark Hudson\n\nIR Executive, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Michelle, that concludes our prepared remarks. We now like to open up the call for Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Please go ahead, Michelle.",

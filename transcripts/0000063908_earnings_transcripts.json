At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star one on their touch-tone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Congbalay, you may begin.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. Now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In Q3, McDonald's delivered global comparable sales growth of more than 3.5%, with growth across all segments. In addition, for the Q2 in a row, McDonald's delivered global system-wide sales growth of more than 6% in constant currency, reflective of the increasing contribution from new unit openings. Our performance is anchored in our Accelerating the Arches business strategy and exceptional execution to provide the value our customers want for the food they love. Our combination of great-tasting menu innovation, exciting marketing, and reliable value and affordability succeeded in a highly challenged consumer environment and drove traffic share gains in a majority of our top markets.\nIn the US, we continue to see a bifurcated consumer base, with QSR traffic from lower-income consumers declining nearly double digits in Q3, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years. In contrast, QSR traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double digits in the quarter. We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the US and our top international markets, and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026. Delivering industry-leading value is part of McDonald's D&A. It's a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back. And especially in today's difficult macro environment, it's more important than ever. On our last earnings call, I previewed the close collaboration with our US franchisees to improve consumers' value perceptions of our core menu offerings.\nWe heard our customers loud and clear on the need to deliver everyday value and affordability across their favorite items on our menu board. In September, we introduced extra value meals, or EVMs, with a nationally advertised $5 Sausage McMuffin with Egg meal and an $8 Big Mac meal. For the month of November, we're back with a $5 Sausage, Egg, and Cheese McGriddles meal and an $8 10-piece Chicken McNuggets meal. As we've said before, we will measure success of our EVM program in two ways. First, by gaining share of lower-income consumer traffic, and second, by improving value and affordability experience scores. I'm pleased with how our EVM program is performing since relaunch. We're still in the early stages of the program and expect that the associated comp sales lift and traffic improvements will continue to build as awareness of the program increases over the coming quarters.\nOutside the US, our performances remain strong, with our large markets continuing to execute disciplined value, menu, and marketing programs. The value platforms we've had in place for several quarters in our IOM markets are resonating with our customers and continuing to improve value and affordability scores. While these programs are working, we're remaining agile and will evolve them along with the needs of our customers. In Australia, for example, we locked in pricing on our McSmart Meal and Loose Change Menu value offerings for 12 months beginning in July, giving customers confidence and consistency in a volatile economic environment while helping us maintain relevance, drive traffic, and gain share. Time and again, we've proven that when we execute well, we outperform. That has also been the case in Japan, where we have had market share gains for Q6 amid consistently strong performance.\nJust a couple of weeks ago, I visited our restaurants in Tokyo, and my firsthand experience confirmed the momentum supported by strong local marketing and innovation. This included several exciting Happy Meal campaigns that drove significant traffic and social engagement, highlighting the power of local relevance and the strength of our brand in connecting with consumers. Along with both value and marketing execution, our new category structure is laying the groundwork to deliver more menu innovation to support long-term growth. We've stood up dedicated teams with deep expertise and focused attention on the high-potential growth categories of chicken, beverages, and beef. At the outset, we promised increased speed of innovation and scale, and we're already introducing new solutions into the system. Let's begin with beverages, a global category of more than $100 billion that's growing much faster than the broader IEO industry.\nIn the US, we launched a beverage test in more than 500 restaurants across Colorado and Wisconsin at the beginning of September. The product mix includes cold coffees, fruity refreshers, crafted sodas, and energy-based drinks. Initial results are exceeding expectations, with strong satisfaction scores across the board, and the new beverage offerings are driving incremental occasions across different day parts as well as higher average check. We're excited to see progress continue with the tests as we deepen our understanding, drive innovation, and evaluate how these offerings could enhance our long-term beverage strategy in the US and abroad. Turning to chicken, a global category that is 2x the size of beef and faster growing, we're driving good progress on our chicken offerings and continue to gain share in our top 10 markets in the quarter.\nIn the US, we brought back Snack Wraps in early July, much to the delight of our most vocal fans, at a nationally advertised price point of $2.99. The strong customer reception to this highly anticipated launch highlights the importance of pairing the right product with the right value proposition. In our IOM markets, innovation standouts like the Chicken Big Mac in the UK and McWings in Australia exceeded expectations in the quarter. We'll continue to go after the broader chicken opportunity by expanding our portfolio and pulsing in limited-time offers to meet evolving consumer tastes. Investing in these high-growth categories to align with consumer trends reinforces our broader strategy to drive guest count-led growth, win in taste and quality, and outperform competitors over the long term. With that, I'll turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, McDonald's continues to deliver solid results by focusing on what we can control: value, menu innovation, and outstanding marketing execution, while also driving consistent operational improvements across nearly all of our top markets. In the Q3, global comparable sales increased 3.6% despite a challenging consumer environment and a difficult QSR industry backdrop. In the US, comp sales increased 2.4% for the quarter, and we delivered another quarter of positive comp sales and guest count gaps to our near-end competitors. We started Q3 with the national launch of Snack Wraps, and the initial four-week window exceeded our expectations. Snack Wraps were the most popular new chicken product launch in the US in recent history, with nearly one in five McDonald's customers purchasing a Snack Wrap during that period.\nAlthough easing somewhat after the exceptional initial launch period, Snack Wraps continued to deliver strong unit performance throughout the quarter, helping us gain share in the US chicken category and drive high levels of customer satisfaction. We're also continuing to see positive results from the McValue platform as we continue to evolve our value offerings. In mid-July, we introduced the Daily Double, a third meal deal as a companion to the McChicken and the McDouble meal deals. Overall, our McValue platform continues to serve distinct needs with little overlap of customers across the meal deal and buy-one-add-one constructs, both of which continue to drive incrementality to the business in the quarter. As Chris described, in early September, we brought Extra Value Meals back to the menu to ensure fans can find everyday affordable pricing across our menu boards.\nGetting the EVM formula right is important because they account for about 30% of our total transactions in the US. So far, results have been in line with our expectations as we build consumer awareness and drive behavior changes. While not a benefit to our Q3 results, in October, we reintroduced Monopoly in the US for the first time in nearly a decade, and we're pleased with the performance. This year's campaign includes digital engagement through our app, similar to what we've done successfully in international markets. Monopoly is one of the biggest digital customer acquisition events we've ever had, driving downloads, registrations, and reinforcing the role of digital in our broader strategy. With about 45 million 90-day active users in the US, we're excited about how Monopoly is helping more customers discover our strong value offerings available through our app.\nTurning to our internationally operated market segment, comp sales were up 4.3%, marking consecutive quarters of growth above 4% despite a challenged industry backdrop. Just like last quarter, each IOM market delivered positive comp sales growth led by strong performances in Germany and Australia. In Germany, we delivered our strongest comp sales results in two years, extending the trend of market share gains to nearly four years. Despite persistent industry traffic declines, McDonald's Germany has consistently outperformed, driven by disciplined execution of our value menu and marketing playbook. A standout in the quarter was the Taste of the World campaign, which showcased the global strength of the McDonald's brand by offering customers a curated selection of international menu favorites at their local German McDonald's restaurant.\nTaste of the World exceeded expectations and was complemented by an optimized mailer and strong local marketing, demonstrating our ability to deliver value and innovation simultaneously. In addition, it provided a campaign blueprint, which we plan to replicate across more international markets in 2026 and which is currently live in the UK. In Australia, we're encouraged by the momentum that the new management team and our franchisees are building across the entire system as we've gained market share for a second straight quarter by executing a full suite of initiatives across value, menu, and marketing. And as Chris noted, we locked in value prices for 12 months starting in July, providing consumers with predictability and confidence.\nThe launch of the Big Arch burger and breakfast McGriddles added excitement to the menu, while the return of Monopoly, now fully digital and available exclusively through the MyMacca's app, drove increased app downloads and registrations and contributed to digital sales growth. In our international developmental license markets, comp sales grew 4.7%, led by Japan, which has delivered consistently positive guest count growth for nearly two years. In China, while near-term performance continues to reflect macroeconomic pressures, we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. We're investing in the future, including adding 1,000 new restaurants this year. We're also updating our Hamburger University in China, which we believe will support talent development and reinforce our commitment to the market. We have the right partner in place and remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth over time.\nTurning to the P&L, adjusted earnings per share was $3.22 for the quarter, which includes a $0.04 benefit from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis declined 1% versus the prior year, primarily due to the impact of a higher effective tax rate more than offsetting an increase in adjusted operating income. Total restaurant margin dollars were over $4 billion, a 4% increase in constant currency, and the Q1 in our history that we've surpassed the $4 billion mark. This performance is a true reflection of the strength of our business model in a pressured consumer and inflationary environment. G&A increased versus the prior year quarter, reflecting $40 million of incremental marketing spend to support the relaunch of Extra Value Meals in the US, higher incentive-based compensation expense, and the timing of investments in our strategic transformation efforts and growth opportunities.\nOur year-to-date adjusted operating margin is 47.2%, up meaningfully from the 46.7% in the prior year period, reflecting top-line growth and strong execution across our system, including portfolio management. Below the operating line, our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 22.8%. We're projecting our full-year effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22%, which is tightening the range from our previous estimate. We currently estimate that the impact of foreign currency translation on adjusted earnings per share for the Q4 will be about a $0.05 tailwind based on current exchange rates. As always, our estimate is directional guidance only, as rates will likely change as the year progresses.\nWe're on track to deliver our financial targets for the year, which include the expected impacts from tariffs currently in place, and remain focused on executing our Accelerating the Arches strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders.\nWith respect to capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. First, we invest in opportunities to grow the business and drive strong returns. Second, we return remaining free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. In line with investing in the business, we believe our development pipeline is healthy, and we're on track to deliver our current-year targets and our 50,000 restaurants globally by the end of 2027. Whether through new restaurant openings, digital innovation, or menu enhancements, we're continuing to build a business that is positioned to win in any operating environment. With respect to capital returns, in October, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, which is our 49th consecutive year of dividend increases. That's a testament to the strength, resilience, and long-term value that McDonald's delivers and expects to continue to deliver to our shareholders.\nOur ability to consistently return capital while investing in the business reflects the durability of our model and the confidence we have in our future. With that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Ian. Each fall, McDonald's celebrates our Founders' Day with reflections on the pride and passion that fuel our system. It's a privilege to recognize the everyday actions of our crew members, franchisees, and teams around the world. This year is particularly special given it's our 70th anniversary. The resilience we've built across generations and geographies reminds us that our strength lies not just in our global scale, but in the local actions we take day in and day out to feed and foster communities everywhere McDonald's operates. Founders' Day is also a time to look ahead to the next chapter of innovation, growth, and impact. From our digital transformation to our commitment to value and affordability, we're building on our legacy in ways that matter most to today's consumer. And we're doing it together as one McDonald's system.\nAs we look to close out the year, our focus remains on executing what we can control. We're committed to delivering for our customers, especially in the challenging environment we navigate today. As is often the case, Ray had great advice for the moment we faced today when he said, \"Adversity can strengthen you if you have the will to grind it out.\" That's exactly what we're doing. With that, we'll take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.\nThank you, everybody. Our first question today is from David Palmer from Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask you about the US business and perhaps the twin goals of improving company restaurant profitability and your system restaurant profitability, but also improving the value perception gap versus your competitors in the US. How can you achieve both? I see some big AUVs for you guys, bigger than your competitors, over 4.5 million for your company restaurants, and trailing restaurant margin is 11.5%. I could imagine higher margins than that or perhaps even more of a value perception gap versus competitors. And I have a feeling you have some ideas about how you're going to grow that value perception gap and probably have your cake and eat it too and improve the restaurant margins over time as well. Love to hear about that. Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, David. Well, I think that the formula for us is pretty well established over time, which is basically if you do what you need to do to delight your customers and serve them well, you're going to attract more people to the business, and ultimately, that's going to drive unit economics. And so I think for us, the focus is always on getting more people through the door, getting them to be buying larger items, and ultimately, that drives AUVs, as you were talking about. I don't think that, related to that, it's at all incompatible that improving value scores actually is also part of improving unit economics. And that's very much our focus right now. As we think about the full year, our US franchisees' cash flow is going to be solid.\nThe cash flow performance is going to be solid at the same time that we're making these investments that we talked about on our last call around EVM. So I think for us, the test of time, just get more people through the door, get them buying more, and everything seems to take care of itself. Hey, David, I just might add a bit to what Chris said and obviously what he said. We've talked about it pretty consistently that we've got to get after guest count-led growth. I think nothing, certainly from my lens, has changed in terms of over time. If we keep driving more volume and more customers through our doors, which is obviously what we're always focused on, nothing fundamentally has changed, I think, in our belief that we can drive margin accretion over time.\nI mean, I think, obviously, as you know well, a bit of the dynamic right now is inflation levels are still elevated from, I think, kind of what we would say are the historical norms. The pricing environment is challenging. So I think in the short term, that continues to put pressure on margins. But again, I think we're focused on what do we need to do to meet the needs of our consumers and the environment. We certainly believe value and affordability is right. If we get that right, that will pay off both in the short and long term, as Chris just talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Director of Research, Baird\n\nHi. Good morning. My question is on the value strategy in the US. I believe, at least in the near term, you're offering some support or co-investing in that strategy with your franchisees. I was wondering, Ian, if you could kind of frame up what the level of that support looks like on an aggregate basis. Then, I guess, Chris, the second part of the question is franchisees at some point will need to decide whether to continue this or not without your support, presumably. Just wondering how you would frame up the thresholds and how the system's thinking about what success looks like from a financial perspective. Do they need to see the traffic growth covering the de facto price investments, or are they more focused on the metrics you mentioned, which is the value scores, etc.?\nSo any thoughts around that would be helpful as well. Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHey, morning, David. It's Ian. Let me kick off, and then I know Chris will jump in and address the second part of your question. I think just from a support standpoint and maybe a bit of the framing, which I touched on in my opening remarks, is you've heard Chris and I talk a fair bit about we felt really good about the value that we were offering both through the McValue platform and then through, I think, the digital value that is available to members of our loyalty program. And if you put those two kind of components or programs together, that addresses about 40% of our total sales in the US business.\nI think the purpose of the EVMs, as we talked about in September, is really that 60% of the menu, which we would call kind of the everyday core part of our menu, the everyday core consumer. We felt we had an opportunity to strengthen value in that part of our mix. EVMs represent about half of that 60% or about 30% of our overall portfolio in the US. We thought that was really important to address that, which was what we targeted with our EVM relaunch in September. I think to kind of support, there's a few elements of support that we're providing. We've talked already about the $40 million of incremental corporate marketing support we provided to support the relaunch of EVMs in September. As you will have seen already, we've got a re-hit of that that Chris talked about in his opening remarks in November.\nThat's being funded through our normal advertising co-op in the US that the franchisees contribute to. So there's no incremental support behind the November activity. But we are providing a co-investment from the launch in September through the end of 2025 at 50% of the kind of effective menu price reduction. And I think before we relaunched EVMs, the average discount level across the US business was about 11%. Obviously, what we've targeted now with our kind of eight core EVM meals is a minimum discount level of 15%. And we're co-investing half of that reduction. That was about $15 million in September of McDonald's support. And we only had about three weeks of activity. And we expect that support in Q4 to be about $75 million. The last piece is Q1 2026, where we are continuing to provide a level of support, but it is different support.\nThat support is basically to address, again, I'll call it a co-investment or 50% of the net negative cash flow impact that's associated with kind of the EVM reintroduction. And that is net of any lift in EVM units in individual restaurants. And because the nature of that support is different, we expect that to be significantly less in Q1 than what we're providing in Q4 this year. And then at the end of Q1, all of our corporate support will stop. And then with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to maybe kind of address part two.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, Ian. So on value, as you know and as Ian just referenced, we put in place McValue. Now it's well over a year ago. And we feel very good about our McValue platform.\nBut what we also talked about was that consumers' value perception, the number one driver of consumers' value perception, is actually what's going on on the menu board. It's not meal deals or offers. It's what's going on on the menu board. And we, along with our US franchisees, recognize that we had an opportunity there and that through kind of a number of things that had happened over time, we had gotten out of whack on EVMs. And that was having a drag on our value perception. And so we went to the US franchisees with a path forward on how we're going to fix EVMs. And the good news is the vast, vast majority, and I'm talking like 98%, 99% of our franchisees recognize that we had an issue with EVMs that we needed to address.\nThe support that we came in with was designed to give them a pathway on how we can get this corrected, but also protect on what was going to be, we knew, in the short term, a drag. I mean, that's the challenge when you do some of the pricing actions that we're doing with EVMs: in the short term, it's going to be a drag until you can get the incrementality. Then thereafter, it becomes more sustaining. So that's exactly what we did. What we expect is going to happen is that by the end of Q1, our system's going to be in a position here where it's actually going to be a better decision to continue with the EVMs than it is to go back to where we were and create the problem all over again.\nSo my expectation is that we're going to see the system continue with this EVM program because we've essentially bridged them through the most difficult part of this. And any move backward would actually, I think, be self-defeating. Maybe just a final hook to that, David. I just would say, I mean, again, when we put this in place in September, you heard us say this wasn't a short-term decision. This was going to take at least a couple of quarters, I think, to kind of get the momentum and the lift and the repetitive activity that you need. I would just say we're obviously still early days in, but we're pleased with the progress, and we're on track to what we would have expected at this point a few weeks post-launch in September.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Dennis Geiger at UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nSenior Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat morning, guys. Kudos on the solid sales momentum in the US in the quarter in a tough backdrop. I was wondering if you could talk a little more about how you're thinking about the US sales trajectory looking out over the coming quarters, given a bunch of the key sales drivers that you identified. And also kind of curious if you think sort of the underlying guest count baseline trends that you've kind of touched on in the past a bit, if you think that that's improving for the business or sort of if those underlying baseline trends are set to improve in '26, if you feel good about the direction of those baseline trends. Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWell, I'm not going to get into trouble with giving any forecasts, so I'm going to let Ian handle that one.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, Dennis. Good question. Thanks. So let me touch on it. I'm sure Chris may want to weigh in here at the end and just build. But I think what we would say is we feel like we've had two kind of consecutive quarters now of solid growth. We certainly feel like we're developing good momentum across each of our three business segments, I think, as we've talked a fair bit about by obviously focusing on what we feel we can control in a continued challenging external environment. We would say we certainly still feel cautious about the consumer. I think, I mean, you've heard from many others, obviously, the conditions still remain challenging in the US. We certainly see that as well in many of our top international markets.\nI think we saw that in the US kind of get a little bit worse through Q3 and into the start of Q4. I'm talking about from an external perspective. But we certainly believe we're positioned to deliver another solid quarter of growth in each of our segments if we look forward to Q4. And I think that's anchored in, and I think Chris talked about this last quarter. In this environment, you really got to be what we call three for three. You can't be just strong on value individually, or you can't just be having a great marketing execution quarter or a great menu news quarter. You've got to get all you've got to get all three of those things to come together. And I think we feel we're doing a better job of really strong execution across the business.\nI think a little specifically, maybe to get into the segments. I think in the US, we actually expect our comp sales growth will accelerate in Q4 versus the 2.4% that we delivered in Q3. And there's some obvious reasons for that. Obviously, we're lapping the food safety incident in last year's Q4. We've had a decent start to the quarter based on Monopoly running in October, as you heard us talk about in our upfront remarks. And we feel we've got a really good quarter of activity, obviously, Monopoly in October. And then, as you heard Chris talk about, the kind of re-hit of our EVM $5 and $8 price points in November.\nWe also expect in the US that we'll see a notable step up in comp sales growth for those reasons in Q4, and expect, I think, our comp sales growth on a two-year stack base will accelerate modestly from the 2.7% that we saw in Q3 on a two-year basis. On the international segments, I would say I think we expect operating conditions across our top markets in Q4 will be pretty similar to what we've seen the last couple of quarters. I think we believe that our Q4 comp sales in each of our international segments may decelerate sequentially, but that's largely a reflection of the lapping of more difficult prior-year comparisons. And so on a two-year stack basis, we expect Q4 comp sales growth for both segments will accelerate meaningfully and sequentially. So that'd be a bit of a texture, I think, on the looking forward.\nI mean, I think the external conditions remain challenging, but I think what we've really done, and you've heard us talk pretty relentlessly about this, just on value and affordability, and then getting the power of great marketing and great menu news to come together is what's driving results. And I think, to your point, what is giving us a positive baseline momentum in a difficult external environment. And I think that's highlighted by some of the markets that we called out, like Germany and Australia, where the external conditions remain challenging, but I think our performance has been really, really strong.\nAll I would add to that is it's still a difficult environment, and inflation's proving to be sticky. I mean, we're expecting to see there's going to be above-average inflation next year. You've heard about others referencing what's going on with beef prices. Certainly, we're seeing very, very high inflation around beef prices versus what we're used to historically. And so I think all of that just keeps putting pressure on the industry. And I referenced it in my opening remarks, but it's very much kind of how we're feeling, which is this is an environment where you've just got to grind it out. I mean, that was an expression that Ray Kroc always loved to talk about. And it kind of feels like that's sort of how we're having to operate, which is just grinding out and getting growth. And fortunately, our system's executing well.\nWe've got good alignment with our franchisees. So I think we're going to continue to do well. But I don't want to minimize some of the pressures as well that exist in the industry today and that we're expecting to continue into next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Greg Francfort over at Guggenheim.\n\nGreg Francfort\n\nManaging Director and Senior Restaurant Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nHey, thanks for the question. I'm wondering if you could maybe just give some more details on the beverage test that you've been running. I think you're running two kind of very different tests in terms of breadth of product, including the energy drink and not including the energy drink, and just what that sales mix looks like and if there's any just consumer behaviors that you can call out. Thanks.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nI'll let Ian start, and then I can add. But as we referenced, we're pleased with it. We're not trying to make too much of an inference around what it's going to do from a comp standpoint. It's more about the operations and, I think, getting a sense of the mix. But I'll let Ian talk about that and then close out anything else.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, Greg. Good morning. Well, look, I mean, we're running that test in a couple of regions in our US business. It's about 500 restaurants. I think there is a very purposeful construct to the different lineup. I mean, there's some overlap between the product portfolio in both regions, but there's also some differences. I mean, I think, as you've heard us talk about before, the beverage test has come out of the learnings we had from the CosMc's standalone restaurants that we stood up last year. That test told us that we could get after the majority of the opportunity without creating an unmanageable level of complexity that would impact our ability to execute in the restaurant. So I think there are a couple of purposes of the test. One is just to gauge the consumer demand, the consumer reaction, and the consumer kind of feedback on the portfolio.\nOne is obviously to test at a little bit greater scale our assumptions on kind of the complexity that those lineups are adding to our business, manageable. I mean, I think we've seen, from a complexity standpoint, what we expected, which is we're able to kind of manage that in the restaurants. Obviously, the purpose of any test is you're learning and adapting. I think we've seen a really positive consumer reaction both in the portfolio and kind of, is it meeting the needs and kind of the on-trend expectations for what consumers are looking for from a beverage standpoint. And so, again, early days. As Chris said, we've got more work to do, but I think we're certainly encouraged by the reaction that we've had to date.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThe only thing I would add is on this test, one of the things that we're also looking at is we're being very thoughtful and purposeful about where we price these products. And we have a variety of different items, but we think the opportunity for us is to be actually able to bring value into this segment as well. And so with our franchisees, we've been very thoughtful about where these products are priced relative to the competitors that would have similar offerings. And I think what we're seeing here is, for us, should we roll this out nationally, being very disciplined on pricing and making sure that we're delivering value on these beverages versus the competitive set is going to be the way that we're successful in this segment.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question is from Sara Senatore from Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. Just maybe two clarifications. The first is just on the high-income traffic being up double digits, is that an acceleration from what you've seen, I guess, trying to figure out if there's kind of evidence of trade down happening now? And then on IDL, I know you mentioned strength across all regions, but that China was still seeing some pressure. Does that mean China, the market was perhaps not positive? I feel like we've seen some signs of improvement being reported from other consumer companies. So I just wanted to understand if China perhaps is an exception in that region. Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHey, morning, Sara. It's Ian. So let me try and touch on those two things. I think high-income consumer, it's certainly not a change in trend. I mean, we've talked pretty consistently for quite a while now about the bifurcated consumer environment in the US. And I would just say that the Q3 data only continued to emphasize and maybe even showed that bifurcation, I would call it extending, because, as we said, low-income consumer was down in terms of visits to QSR, high single-digit, and high-income consumer was up high single-digit. So that just, I think, is kind of accentuating that bifurcation. Obviously, the whole point of what we're trying to do with value and affordability is make sure we're meeting the needs of all of our consumers and continuing, obviously, to be well-positioned on that.\nI think on IDL, I mean, again, I think on China, nothing new, I think, from what we've been talking about for several quarters. I mean, I think the macroeconomic environment continues to remain challenging in the short term. We haven't changed our view on the mid-long-term opportunity and our confidence level. I think, as we said in the note, all of the geographic regions in IDL, and I would include China in that, were positive, at least from a comp sales standpoint.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add on China, we're pleased with how the China business is performing. We're still gaining share there. There's overcapacity in China. And what you're seeing is you're seeing a delivery war that's going on there, which is putting pressure on pricing. Pricing is down in that market because of what's happening between kind of the three different delivery guys all duking it out there. And so I think it's great for consumers. It's putting a pressure on the business. But net-net, as Ian said, we're growing comp sales. We're still on track with where we need to be on new units. It's a more deflationary environment in China than I think we would want to see normally.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from John Ivankoe at JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. I like the way that you framed Australia value as giving consumers in that market predictability and confidence. I did want to put that in the context of the US. Broadening the typical EVM discount from 11% to 15%, does that give consumers price certainty across that EVM platform? Obviously, it's 30% of your sales. It's very important, whether it's local, regional, or national, where consumers can come in and know that they, for example, can get a Big Mac combo meal at a certain price. Do you think having specific price certainty in the US over time to achieve that predictability and confidence is something that perhaps we can migrate the brand to? Obviously, with some exceptions, but move the brand more to kind of a sustainable national pricing type model on the EVM side.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nI think you're exactly right. Part of why we wanted to address the discount on the EVMs is because, through a lot of our work over history, I think we've certainly conditioned the consumer to expect that there's going to be a certain amount of value that you get when you go and you buy an EVM item. And as we've talked about before, we had drifted a little bit away from that. And so the move that we did is very much meant to reestablish. And then to the earlier question around whether we expect it to continue, we would expect it does need to continue because it's what the consumer expects.\nAnd I think once we've kind of gotten through sort of the medicine that you have to take for a couple of quarters to get the incrementality, once you've got that back in place, you don't want to lose it. So I think this was very much meant as an idea to give us that predictable value. And then you're going to have the McValue platform that'll pulse in and out with various deals and offers. And that's going to just sort of be something that goes and evolves over time. But the EVM is that foundation, along with being disciplined on just your regular menu board.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Brian Bittner at Oppenheimer.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you. Chris, you said in your prepared remarks that while you're taking share in the US, the low-end consumer cohort does continue to be down double digits. It's a theme that's been in place for almost two years now. You said you expect this dynamic to linger into 2026. The question is, at this point, what do you think it's going to take to turn this low-end consumer from a headwind to a tailwind? It seems like that's the main unlock for comps to really inflect. You've thrown a lot of industry-leading value at this low-end consumer, yet they remain pressured. Just additional thoughts on what you think it's going to take into 2026. Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. I think if you think about the low-income consumer and you think about the pressures that they face, I mean, right now, you're seeing across the country, rents are at pretty high levels. You're seeing food prices, whether it's in restaurants or grocery, you're seeing food prices are high. You're seeing childcare is high. There's just a lot of things that when you think about non-discretionary spend, there's some significant inflation there that the low-income consumer is having to absorb. And I think that's affecting their outlook, their sentiment, and their spending behavior, not just in QSR, but across a number of other product categories as well. If you're not in that segment and you're higher income, you maybe don't feel it as acutely, but lower income, for sure, you're feeling it acutely.\nAnd I think some of what's going on most recently with SNAP and other things might be additional pressure on that. So what's going to change, I think, is that consumers will need to feel some relief around cost of living and need to feel like real incomes are growing. And how that changes, I think that's more of a macroeconomic question. There's probably a variety of things that need to happen there. But I think so long as that consumer cohort is feeling like real incomes are under pressure, I wouldn't expect to see significant change there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Brian Harbour at Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Yeah. Morning, guys. I guess to that point, though, are you seeing yourselves take share across different income cohorts? I mean, do you think that the value push has sort of worked? And then I guess more at the higher end, do you think some of the digital initiatives, some of the other product stuff that you've done, have you seen that be effective across different income cohorts?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Well, we're gaining share with upper income. And as we referenced, upper income industry traffic is up almost double digits there. And even in that environment, we're gaining share with upper income. And I think there's a variety of things that go into that: digital or marketing programs, the strength of the brand. All of those things are attractive to that consumer. So I think that that's very much continuing. And then how we think about that over time, value certainly has a play. I think sometimes there's this idea that value only matters to low income, but value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, lower income. Feeling like you're getting good value for your dollar is important.\nSo I think for us, continuing to do what we're doing with EVMs, continuing to make sure that our McValue platform is competitive, those are things that benefit not just the low-income consumer, but they also continue to attract that upper-income consumer who is still looking for good value. They just maybe have more discretionary dollars in their pocket to think, \"Go spend.\"\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Lauren Silberman at Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey. Thank you. I have a quick follow-up and then a question. On the high-income side, fast casual has been a weaker segment this year, tends to lean a bit more higher income. Is there any evidence of share shift from fast casual into QSR from that higher-income consumer? And then if you could just talk about what you're seeing across dayparts. I know you guys have talked about breakfast being weaker. Have you seen any pickup with the everyday value meals? Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWell, morning, Lauren. It's Ian. Let me maybe just start with the higher-income consumer, and I can let Chris do the second part there. But look, I think, as I said earlier, we've been talking about the bifurcated consumer in the US for quite a while. And we've been talking, I think, about the strength of the higher-income consumer. So I don't think we've seen any fundamental change in trend with that consumer. As you said, I know a number of others have talked about seeing some weakness there. Certainly, as Chris said, we continue to gain share with that consumer. And so I think as we've talked about a fair bit today, our goal is to make sure we're positioned strongly on value and affordability for all three consumer groups.\nI think we did a really good job on that from the McValue platform standpoint and the loyalty and kind of digital offer component. But as you've heard us talk about, we felt we were missing the strength of value that we needed on that core menu, the 60% EVM being half of that. So that's what we're now trying to address. And as we've talked about before, I think our unique positioning is that we've got the financial strength to make these types of investments when maybe others are going to have to be a bit more defensive. So I think we're doing the right things for the consumer. And as you've heard both Chris and I say, I don't think we see any near-term kind of change in the environment.\nWe just want to make sure we're well-positioned to do as well as we can in a kind of a continued external challenging landscape.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThen on your breakfast question, we have talked about in the past how breakfast tends to be one of the more, well, it tends to be the most economically sensitive daypart. It's an easy daypart to either skip the meal or to eat the meal at home. Breakfast continues to be under pressure as a daypart industry-wide. We're holding share in breakfast. So we're doing okay in that segment. But we are still seeing that daypart is under pressure for the reasons that we've already talked about. And when that changes, I think that goes with the broader macroeconomic things that we've talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jeff Bernstein over at Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just thinking about that value push, maybe from a 30,000-foot view, I know 12 months ago with signs of a US economic slowdown, we assumed fast food broadly and McDonald's specifically would benefit on both ends of the consumer spectrum. Retaining the low income with value and perhaps seeing trade down from middle and upper income, obviously, that didn't transpire for much of this year. But it seems like it's set up well as we look to 2026. Wondering if you believe it's reasonable to assume that we could see this play out, especially as you now have a more compelling value offer to bring back the lower income and you're lapping that weakness now. And on the other end, again, signs of middle and upper income perhaps being a little bit more vulnerable and trading down.\nSo perhaps on a one-year lag, but do you see that scenario playing out where you could actually benefit from both ends kind of converging back on the quick service segment? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWell, I'd love that scenario to play out. I'm not going to predict whether it does play out that way. I think what we've said, and I would reiterate on this call, is McDonald's value is in our D&A. We absolutely are going to make sure that we are protecting our leadership position and value. You've seen us take the actions where we felt like we had some opportunities there. We're not going to lose as a brand. We're not going to lose on value. So what you outlined is maybe one scenario. Again, that would be great if it played out that way. But if there's any opportunities for us, it's not going to be because we were offsides on value. I think we've learned our lesson on that. We're going to make sure that we're set up well for 2026 on that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Andy Barish over at Jefferies.\n\nAndy Barish\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nYes. Hey, guys. I actually wanted to kind of dovetail on that question. I was intrigued by your comments, Chris, on the inflationary environment, which may continue to bring about difficulties in margins. How do you see that kind of playing through to the industry promotional environment in 2026, which has kind of been relentless for the last 18 months or so?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation",
    "content2": "I think it's going to continue to be a kind of, you're trying to thread a needle here because you're trying to be able to push through some pricing to offset the inflationary pressures that are going to continue. At the same time, you've got a consumer, particularly a low-income consumer, who's really resistant to any additional pricing. And so then you've got to try to figure out what is that sort of right combination there where you're able to get some pricing to offset that inflation at the same time that you're delivering a great value message. And there's no easy answer to it. I think everybody in the industry is trying to figure that out. But the worst answer would be to be losing traffic because you're just not getting people through the door. That's not going to be a winning formula.\nSo I think different people will approach it different ways. You've certainly seen an uptick in a lot of digital offers as well. The challenge with that, of course, is that you don't have the majority of your customers on the digital app. And so that can only go so far. So I think different players are going to have different approaches. We've obviously got our plan on how we plan on approaching it. But I do expect you're going to continue to see people are going to need to be having compelling value offers because they're also going to be trying to figure out ways to be capturing some of the pricing due to the inflation.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nI mean, the only thing, Andy, maybe I would just add to what Chris said, and we touched on it on an earlier question, is I do think consumers are looking for a little bit of predictability. And so I think there'll be the tactical price wars or digital offers or kind of short-term efforts by people to kind of win in a difficult environment. If you believe the environment's going to continue to remain challenging for a while, which I think certainly, as good as our crystal ball is, we would say that certainly seems to be what's on up over the next at least several quarters.\nI think the predictability is really important, which gets back to certainly our view, which is why platforms like McValue and having predictable components to that, the EVM, which is, again, a more predictable outcome for consumers, is really important because I think the certainty and the predictability, and I think nothing frustrates consumers more right now when they come in and they don't get what they expect. So as Chris said, we're going to make sure we're positioned to win across all the spectrums of value and try and make sure we do that in a way that has a level of consistency and predictability for our consumers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Jon Tower at Citi.\n\nJon Tower\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Chris, you had mentioned in the prepared remarks the idea that you're thinking about expanding the beverage platform, the CosMc's stuff globally or beyond the US. And I know in the US, you had also commented on the idea of keeping that kind of value-centric price point here in the States. So how are you thinking about expanding it globally? Obviously, still in test now, but I think outside the US, the platform is positioned differently to consumers across different markets. Are you continuing to think about that in the same manner if you were to roll CosMc's globally, or do you think you'll kind of use it as a value platform across the globe?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. So we will be testing what we've got in the US. You're going to see that in some international markets where it'll get tested. It may look a little bit different from what we're doing in the US, but we'll test that and see how that resonates in a few other markets. Let me just be clear. Beverages is an exciting incremental opportunity for us that we like because of its ability to drive incremental traffic. It's check-add-on. It's got a lot of benefits. And to do that, it needs to be also, I think, priced at a competitive value for us to win. We're not seeing it, though, as a value platform per se. And so when we talk about what it's going to be in the US, it's very much designed to drive margin. It's very much designed to drive check.\nBut how we do that is also being mindful about where it's priced vis-à-vis the competitive set. We'll, I think, take that same approach as we test it in some of the international markets. And whether that rolls out beyond the US or not will obviously be dependent on how it performs in some of those other markets.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today is from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Ian, can you tell us more about the US McCafé margin contraction in Q3 and help unpack, as a bigger headwind this quarter, was general inflation for customers seeking lower margin value? And also, if you can just touch on your outlook for beef within that response as well.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Morning, Andrew. Well, look, I think as you've certainly heard me say pretty consistently, I mean, obviously, the kind of fundamental driver of margin growth is strong top-line growth. We need a certain, let's call it, minimum level of top-line growth to drive margin accretion. While we had a good quarter in the US at 2.4%, I would just say it wasn't enough top-line growth in the quarter to offset some of the inflationary pressure we saw in areas like wages, food, and paper costs. So I think, as you've heard both Chris and I talk about, I mean, we have no change in our view that we're going to be able to drive margin accretion and margin growth over time as we drive that top-line growth.\nBut obviously, we continue to operate in an environment where sales have been a little bit more subdued and inflation has been a little higher than what I'll call kind of the historic norm. I think on food and paper in the US, we've said this year we expect kind of our basket of food and paper inflation to be in the low- to mid-single-digit range for the year. Obviously, beef inflation is up a fair bit. I think the strength of our supply chain means our beef costs are, I think, certainly up less than most. They're still elevated. But I think our basket of goods means we still have confidence in that kind of low- to mid-single-digit range. I mean, obviously, what we're trying to focus on, as we've talked a fair bit about today, is how do we make sure we've got that baseline momentum?\nObviously, value and affordability across all parts of the menu is a really important component of that. And so that's, I think, what we're focused on is kind of getting that stronger top-line and growth in place as we look forward. And as we said earlier, certainly, we've had a decent start to Q4. And I think we're getting through things like our EVM relaunch, some of those maybe missing components back firmly in place.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the call today. Thanks for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions or would like to set up a meeting, please send me an email and we'll do so. Thanks again and have a good day.\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question and answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star one on their touchtone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Congbalay, you may begin.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nWith me today on the call are.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any.\nNon-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's.\nCall along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then reenter the queue for any additional questions.\nToday's conference call is being webcast and.\nIs also being recorded for replay via our website. Now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks Dexter and good morning everyone. In Q2, McDonald's delivered global system-wide sales growth of over 6% in constant currency and global comparable sales growth of nearly 4%. This includes driving positive comparable guest counts globally. Despite a challenging backdrop for the industry in this landscape, the power of McDonald's value and affordability platforms, exciting marketing and menu offerings, and world-class execution are working together to drive comparable sales results and guest count growth as we also accelerate new restaurant development.\nOur International Operated Markets segment comp sales increased by 4%, with all markets driving positive comp sales growth. Our International Developmental Licensed Markets delivered comp sales growth of more than 5.5%, led by Japan, and with positive comps across.\nAll geographies.\nThe results speak for themselves. When we get our value proposition right and execute with excellence, good performance follows.\nAs we shared last quarter, all of our big five IOM markets now have both meal bundles and everyday affordable price or EDAP menus in place. Our EDAP menus feature a variety of sandwiches, snacks, and beverages typically priced below £4 or €4.\nValue and affordability scores improved across the majority of our major IOM markets as these offerings, as well as offers available through the McDonald's app, continue to gain traction and awareness with consumers. Despite continued high inflation across most of Europe, our IOM markets are being prudent about pricing actions. Knowing the continued challenging environment for many of our consumers, I recently visited Germany and saw firsthand how the market is executing our playbook and outperforming the competition. McDonald's Germany is defining good value in the market with a clear EDAP menu, McSmart Snacks that just launched a few months ago. They've paired this EDAP menu with compelling meal bundles, giving them a strong 1-2 value punch.\nAt the same time, Germany launched exciting marketing and full margin menu innovations such as the Chicken Big Mac, which hit record high sales in the market during its first full week of launch. As a result, this quarter in Germany we drove positive sales and guest count gaps versus nearest competitors and gained market share despite what continues to be a challenging industry environment. Turning to the US business, comp sales were up 2.5% in the quarter. We outperformed nearest competitors on both comp sales and comp guest counts. Certainly overall QSR traffic in the US remained challenging as visits across the industry by low income consumers once again declined by double digits versus the prior year period. Reengaging the low income consumer is critical as they typically visit our restaurants more frequently than middle and high income consumers.\nThis bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near term health of the US consumer. In this environment, we will continue to remain agile with respect to our value offerings to ensure the US strengthens its leadership in value and affordability.\nOverall, we've made good progress with our value offerings. The $5 Meal Deal continues to resonate with consumers as we recently celebrated the one year anniversary of the program. We've also continued to see incrementality from our McValue platform which also includes our.\nBuy One Add One for $1.\nDeal which launched at the beginning of this year.\nOf course we're excited to welcome Snack Wraps back onto the menu after a nine-year hiatus. We launched Snack Wraps with an attractive $2.99 nationally advertised price point, and early results are encouraging. Our franchisees also recognize the importance of the $2.99 price point, and we're excited to announce that they recently voted to extend this advertising through the end of the year. We recognize that consumers' value perceptions are most influenced by our core menu pricing. We're working closely and collaboratively with our US franchisees on this opportunity, and we're developing ideas for how we might address this as an entire system. In combination with strong value, we're also unlocking growth across our most important menu categories of beef, chicken, and beverages.\nIan will discuss beef and chicken shortly. I'd like to touch on beverages. The work of our beverage category team is rapidly moving forward. As we recently announced, exciting things are brewing with an upcoming test in about 500 restaurants in the US with a beverage lineup that includes a variety of options, from cold coffee and fruity refreshers to crafted soda and energy. We've been able to quickly embed CosMc's key learnings into our McDonald's core business. Demonstrating the speed, scale, system prowess, and efficiency of our cross-functional category teams, we're finding new ways to tap into what customers want and believe. No one is better positioned than McDonald's to deliver more of these moments to our fans.\nFinally, central to our Accelerating the Arches strategy is aligning our greatest assets, our iconic brand, and unmatched size and scale with the power of data and technology. It's happening in three distinct ways. We're reimagining how we improve the restaurant experience, transforming how we engage our most loyal brand fans, and modernizing the employee experience.\nOur progress to digitize the Arches is unleashing the full potential of our size and scale, all while strengthening our foundation, such as increasing the reliability of our systems. As I said during our Investor Update in late 2023 when we first introduced the restaurant consumer and company platforms, we believe they can create a step change in our sales and margin trajectory over time, slowly at first, with increasing speed and impact as we scale like no other brand can. We're excited to see this start coming to life in our restaurant platform. In partnership with Google, we're developing Edge Computing, which extends the cloud to our restaurants. Edge is the digital foundation for the next generation of restaurant innovation that powers AI and Internet of Things enabled restaurants. The expected benefits are many: increased restaurant uptime, enhanced customer and crew experience, improved food quality, and cost savings opportunities.\nWe're currently live with Edge in hundreds of US restaurants and are beginning to deploy it internationally. Running great restaurants is just one component of serving up great customer experience. Our fans want greater personalization, convenience, and value. Bringing millions more consumers into the McDonald's digital universe is how we're ensuring customers feel seen and satisfied with each and every visit. In 2023, we set a goal to reach 250 million 90-day active loyalty users by the end of 2027. As of this quarter, we've reached more than 185 million 90-day active users across 60 loyalty markets in the US alone. On average, the same customer visits 10 and a half times in the year before joining the loyalty program and then 26 times in the year after joining, earning points in the app and using them to unlock exclusive deals.\nThanks to our recent partnership in the US, customers were able to extend rewards to new experiences like the Snapchat plus subscription with premium features. Fans ordering on the app are already saving time with Ready on Arrival. Our geofencing technology can let our restaurants know when to start your order. In the US, restaurants with Ready on Arrival can reduce wait times for food pickup by more than 50%, and in many cases, eliminate them altogether. Ready on Arrival is deploying in restaurants across five of the top six markets, and we're on track to launch in.\nThe last of the top six later this year.\nFinally, we're applying new technology across the company that will change our ways of working. We're moving from hundreds of legacy systems to standardized, modern global platforms to help our employees be more efficient and make data-driven decisions, while increasing the speed of innovation. We took a couple of big steps towards improving processes by going live with a new finance system in the first wave of markets just a few weeks ago, and rolling out a new HR or human capital management system in the second wave of markets this past quarter. We're modernizing McDonald's at a pacethath will enhance not just the customer experience, but provide new capabilities for our system. With that, I'll turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the Q2 shows that customers continue to choose McDonald's as a trusted destination for the food they love, that's delivered with the quality, convenience, and value they expect. Our financial results in the quarter were largely in line with our expectations. Global comparable sales increased 3.8%, with comp sales growth up sequentially from the Q1's low point. Importantly, the sequential improvement was broad based, with comp sales and guest count performance accelerating in each segment. Our ability to adapt within a challenging environment remains a core strength. Execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy and our agility to implement and scale necessary adjustments drove positive results in the quarter, including market share gains across a majority of our larger international markets. For example, in France, we've continued to widen our positive comp guest count gap to near end competitors.\nThis was supported by the successful launch at the end of March of a new EDAP platform, which we paired with compelling meal bundles that are resonating with value-conscious consumers. The EDAP platform includes several a la carte offerings, each under EUR 3. We've seen an increase in take rates for all items, continued increases in customer value and affordability perceptions, and overall customer satisfaction scores. In addition, in early April, we introduced the Big Arch. It was our top-selling large burger in France following its launch, and that trend continued after the media campaign ended. We followed the Big Arch's rollout in France by launching it in the UK in mid-June.\nEarly results are meeting our expectations, fueled by positive response to the marketing campaign and social media buzz, and we're looking to build on Big Arch's success as we continue efforts to improve the UK's overall performance. While we recognize that restoring sustained positive performance in the UK will take time, as we've demonstrated most recently in France and Australia, we have a solid track record of identifying areas of improvement and executing turnaround plans that deliver results.\nIn addition to launching Big Arch in France and the UK, we're working to unlock growth in beef by continuing to implement Best Burger across the globe. Today it's currently in more than 80 markets, and we expect it will be in nearly all markets by the end of 2026.\nChicken also remains a significant opportunity. It's a larger global category than beef and continues to grow at a faster rate. In Q2, we increased chicken market share across our top 10 markets, and we remain on track to grow our global chicken share by 100 basis points by the end of 2026, in line with the target we shared at our investor update in late 2023. Chicken was key to driving sales growth and overall market share gains in Australia in the quarter. The market saw its first share gains in a couple of years, thanks in part to the Hot Honey Chicken campaign featuring both McCrispy and McSpicy options that worked in conjunction with the strong foundation of value and affordability that has now.\nBeen put in place.\nAustralia also introduced McWings in early June as a permanent menu item, with performance to date exceeding our expectations, further strengthening our chicken portfolio.\nChicken also helped to drive our performance in China in the Q2, where we gained market share not only in the category, but in overall QSR as well. While we're pleased with our relative performance in China, the near term macroeconomic environment remains challenging. Despite these headwinds, we remain confident in the long term potential of the China market and remain on track to deliver on our new restaurant opening target there this year.\nIn addition to our commitment to the core menu and exciting innovations, we leveraged a One McDonald's Way approach to creative excellence this quarter. This drove positive comp guest count gaps to near in competitors in the US and across a majority of our major international markets. The centerpiece of this One McDonald's Way approach was the marketing campaign in partnership with a Minecraft Movie, our largest global campaign ever, with participation by more than 100 markets. The consumer response to this campaign was incredibly strong. It boosted guest counts in each of our major markets, most of which sold out of the Minecraft collectibles ahead of the intended promotion window in the US. In addition to leveraging One McDonald's Way to marketing, we're staying agile and will continue to focus on strong execution to drive market share growth.\nWe launched McCrispy Strips in May and saw an initial groundswell of excitement and high levels of customer satisfaction. We followed it with the highly anticipated Snack Wraps in mid-July at a $2.99 nationally advertised price point. We've been encouraged by the positive consumer response so far, which we believe comes from pairing the right product with the right value proposition. We have also recently updated our McValue meal offerings by introducing the Daily Double, a new burger meal that provides customers with more entry-level meal options. McValue now has three meal deal offerings, and customers can continue to find a $5 meal at their local restaurant. The US leadership team and our US franchisees are confident about the calendar for the remainder of the year, which includes exciting news across all levers of our plan: value, menu, and marketing.\nHowever, as Chris noted, US restaurant traffic, especially for the QSR industry, remains challenging. Accordingly, we will leave no stone unturned when exploring ways to drive guest count-led growth and strengthening our value leadership. As Chris mentioned, we're working closely and collaboratively with our US franchisees to evaluate the opportunity to improve upon our core menu offerings. We know what it takes to win, and as a market leader, we plan to leverage our size, scale, and financial strength to deliver for our customers.\nTurning to the P&L, adjusted earnings per share were $3.19 for the quarter, an increase of about 5% versus the prior year quarter in constant currencies. Adjusted operating margin was nearly 47% for the first half of the year, highlighting the durability of our business model. Despite continued pressure on consumer spending, top line results generated nearly $4 billion of restaurant margin for the quarter. That's an increase of about 5% in constant currency, driven primarily by franchise margin performance.\nWith respect to the remainder of the year, the headwinds facing our business and consumers in the US and our top international market remain largely the same, while cost pressures in some markets, most notably in Europe, have become more challenging. Nonetheless, we continue to target a full year adjusted operating margin in the mid to high 40% range, and above the 46.3% adjusted operating margin in 2024. This includes the expected impact from tariffs that are currently in place.\nHowever, we're adjusting our full year margin target for company operated restaurants to be around the 14.8% that we delivered in 2024, which we had previously targeted to increase slightly.\nWe're still targeting G&A as a percentage of systemwide sales to be about 2.2% for the full year. We continue to remain disciplined with investments in our strategic growth priorities, including digital technology and our transformation efforts led by our Global Business Services organization.\nBelow the operating line, we're projecting our full year interest expense to increase by about 4% compared to 2024. That's at the low end of our previous estimate of 4% to 6%, largely due to lower than expected increases in average interest rates. We continue to target a full year effective tax rate of 20% to 22%, with some quarterly volatility.\nWe currently estimate the tailwind from the impact of foreign currency translation on adjusted earnings per share to be about $0.15 based on current exchange rates. That's up from our previous estimate of about a $0.05 tailwind. As always, our updated estimate is directional guidance only, as rates will likely change.\nAs the year progresses.\nFinally, we remain on pace to open approximately 2,200 restaurants globally this year and continue to target about a quarter of these openings to be in our US and IOM segments. We expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IDL markets, including about 1,000 in China. In total, we continue to expect slightly over 4% unit growth from the nearly 1,800 net restaurant additions in 2025. Overall, despite the ongoing industry headwinds, McDonald's is well positioned due to the resiliency of our business and our overall financial strength. We're on track to deliver our financial targets for the year and remain confident in our ability to drive long term profitable growth for the system and to.\nCreate value for our shareholders.\nWe remain confident in our Accelerating the Arches strategy and believe with strong execution it will continue to deliver. As shown in the majority of our IOM and IDL markets in the second quarter, having a solid foundation of value and affordability is critical, and when we get value menu and marketing to work together, consumers increasingly choose McDonald's, and with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Ian. I want to take a moment to reflect on what continues to set McDonald's apart. From 70 years in, we remain one of the most culturally relevant brands in the world. Our recent global Minecraft Movie campaign is just the latest example of the strength of our brand and a reminder that McDonald's isn't just a restaurant. We're a part of people's lives, their routines, and their favorite moments. McDonald's was once again named as the most valuable global restaurant brand by Kantar. It's a testament to the trust that we've built with customers, and the consistency of our brand experience around the world. That legacy is intentional. We recently brought together our top leaders from around the world as part of our routine planning process to shape our plans for 2026 and beyond. One thing was clear throughout our time together.\nWhen we make a commitment to value and affordability, and couple that with world-class marketing and menu innovation, we can drive strong results. Our continued opportunity lies in the ability to execute with discipline at a scale that only McDonald's can deliver.\nWe know that when we focus on what we can control and execute, we win. We're seeing that internationally, and I'm confident that we're taking the right steps to get value and affordability right in the US. Time and again, McDonald's has demonstrated its ability to remain agile to meet the moment by focusing on what we do best, delivering great food, exceptional value, and memorable experiences. With the dedication of our franchisees, the passion of our crew, and the power of our global scale, McDonald's is uniquely positioned to lead the industry we helped define today and into the future. With that, we'll take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and requeue for any additional questions.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur first question today is from David Palmer from Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you, and thanks for all of your comments. Sounds like you're still exploring ways to bolster value perception in the US ahead of anything there. Could you just speak to where you think McDonald's value and affordability scores are today in the US, perhaps before and after Snack Wrap and your recent McValue menu changes? Where is the consumer perception today versus McDonald's in the past and versus nearing competitors, and maybe even fast casual competitors? If there's a difference between the US perception in terms of value versus other key IOM markets, we'd love to hear about that as well. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHi David, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. I think when we talk about value, it's important that we really break it down and get very specific about the different consumer segments. I'll start with our most loyal consumers, and these are the ones who are on our loyalty program. Roughly a quarter of our business in the US is on our loyalty program. What we see is if you are a loyalty member at McDonald's.\nWe.\nHave exceptional value and affordability scores amongst those consumers. Probably that's most evidenced by what I shared in the prepared remarks, which is the uptick that you see in terms of frequency when we have a loyal consumer in our loyalty program, going from roughly 10 visits to 26 visits. I think with our loyalty members, our most ardent McDonald's customers, we're in a really good position as it relates to value and affordability perception. If you move then to the McValue program, McValue is working. If you think about what we have with McValue, we have the $5 Meal Deal, which is the anchor for that, that continues to perform very well for us. We also have the Buy One Add One for $1 program. What's interesting is those two programs are very complementary. If you look at.\nConsumers who are using both, it's only about 8% or so who are actually using both. They're going after two very different occasions, two very different users, but compelling to both. I feel good about the loyalty program, I feel good about where we are with McValue. The issue or the opportunity is if you add those two up, that's, call it, roughly 50% of the business. We know there's the other 50% that today isn't coming into our restaurant, isn't using McValue, isn't using the loyalty program. That's where we have the opportunity, which is around core menu pricing that we talked about in our prepared remarks today. Too often, if you're that consumer, you're driving up to the restaurant and you're seeing combo meals could be priced over $10.\nThat absolutely is shaping value perceptions and is shaping value perceptions in a negative way. We've got to get that fixed. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're having, I think, very active and productive conversations with the franchisees. The single biggest driver of what shapes a consumer's overall perception of McDonald's value is the menu board. It's when they drive up to the restaurant and they see the menu board, that's what's shaping that. That's the number one driver. We've got more work to do on that in the US. I'd say on the IOM side of the business, we're in a better position. Part of it is, as I mentioned in the remarks as well, we have a really strong EDAP program in all of our markets.\nThese are essentially 1, 2, 3, 4, dollar, euro, pound, whatever the currency is. That is proving to be a very strong addition to the value programs in the IOM market. Also, as I mentioned, our operators there have been very prudent, and I think are doing the right things to make sure that our core menu pricing continues to be at leadership levels in the market. I would just note, you know, also on our international side, it's not as competitive a market as it is in the US. There's a lot of different players in the US. We don't face the same breadth of those players or competitors in our international markets. I think it's a little bit easier for us to stand out and represent good value in international. Ian, I don't know if you have anything to add.\nHe's shaking his head no. We'll go to the next question.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Dennis Geiger.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGreat morning.\nThanks, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the US and what sounds like encouraging momentum into the third quarter given the positive response to Snack Wraps. Can you talk a little more about how you think about the US sales trajectory and underlying momentum over the coming quarters, given the exciting value menu and marketing news that you mentioned on the way, but also relative to the challenged industry traffic trends that you noted. Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning Dennis, it's Ian. Yes, let me start that. Chris will certainly weigh in and add some texture at the end. Look, I think as you said, you know, the industry environment certainly remains challenging. I think we saw overall QSR traffic in Q2 negative, which was consistent with what we saw in Q1. I think Chris certainly touched on a little bit the consumer. If you think just about the consumer environment, I mean, we've got lower income consumers that remain under pressure. Their visits to QSR were down double digit again in Q2. I think the middle income consumer was marginally positive in visits in Q2, so a little bit better than Q1. We've got the kind of higher income consumer who continues to kind of grow visits, I think positively and consistently so. I think that is what we touched on up front.\nYou've got a bit of this kind of bifurcated consumer environment. I think we expect those kind of dynamics and headwinds to continue through the rest of the year. I think what we do feel good about is just what is within our control. I think as we talked about up front, we feel very confident about the lineup of marketing and menu activities that we've got planned in the US Business for the rest of the year. I think if you start a little bit with Q2 and just the dynamics of what took place, as you'll remember, we had a really strong activation to start Q2, which was the Global Minecraft activation. We ran out early, but generated some really strong momentum.\nI would say we saw sales moderate through Q2 as I think those headwinds kind of persisted. I think if you think about what we talked about at the beginning of the year, we said up front at the beginning of the year that we thought the back half of the year would be stronger than the front half of the year. I think that remains our belief. If you look at a little bit more texture, we certainly believe Q4 will be stronger in the US business than Q3, simply because we've got that lapping of the food safety event that we worked through in Q3, Q4 last year.\nI think if the dynamic, maybe just to have as context in Q3, is we'll be lapping the start of the $5 Meal Deal, which, as Chris touched on earlier, was a really strong and probably kind of our first significant incremental effort on value and affordability in the US business that worked really well.\nThose are a bit of dynamics.\nI think the headline would be, we certainly feel confident about what's in our control. We've got some opportunity, as Chris touched on, that we're working towards to kind of address that broader value and affordability. I think the kind of consumer headwinds we certainly expect to persist through the remainder of the year.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nAssistant VP, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHi, good morning.\nI was hoping you could unpack the key drivers for the IOM segment this past quarter, and in particular, I guess, what drove the strength. Do you think that this is more structural in nature and something that can be sustained as you look forward, or were there some maybe just successes on the promotion side that might have helped the most recent quarter? Anything you can offer there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, David. Let me start, and then I'm sure Chris will weigh in here. Look, I mean, I think we've talked, as you know, very consistently about this. I think we've done a lot of work over the last 12 to 18 months in IOM to really get what I'll call the solid foundational elements of value and affordability in place, which is that EDAP, or everyday affordable price kind of platform, with those, you know, choices of entry level items in place. We've got that now in place in every one of our large international markets, plus the entry level value meals. It's that foundation on value and affordability. I would say we've seen meaningful improvements in our value and affordability scores across all of those key large IOM markets.\nSo we know that what we've done on value and affordability is resonating in this kind of challenging environment in most of those markets. And then it's when we kind of get that foundation in place, which is helping us, I think, to drive some stronger fundamental momentum and pair that with the great menu and marketing execution. And I think we saw in Q2 some really strong execution on menu and marketing across our key IOM markets. Obviously the quarter started, as we've talked about already, with that Minecraft activation, which was successful in all of our key markets. And then we had some really strong other activities, the Chicken Big Mac in Germany, which kind of set records from a promotional standpoint in the German marketplace. We had the launch of Big Arch in both France and the UK in the quarter.\nAnd then in Australia, as an example, we had this Hot Honey Chicken activation, as well as the introduction of McWings, which is exceeding our expectations. So to me, it's those three fundamental pillars of our Accelerating the Arches strategy that have come together, supported by getting that foundation strongly in place on value and affordability, which is really meeting consumers where they are in, I think, a continued challenging external environment.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, I would just add a couple things. I think Ian touched on this, but we talked about value, menu innovation, and marketing and in this environment you got to go 3 for 3. If you go 1 for 3, if you go 2 for 3, you're not going to be putting up the kind of performance that I think we would all aspire to in terms of being able to really have outsized share gains. And so credit to our international teams that they're going three for three right now. And of course it's on us to continue to execute and make sure that we're doing it. The other thing I would just note is we've had significant inflation in our international markets, particularly in Europe.\nBeef prices, you've probably seen some of the headlines here, but beef prices are up like 20% in Europe for a number of different reasons, but primarily it's a supply issue. In the face of what in most markets is high single digit inflation, our franchisees are being disciplined on pricing. The pricing taken is low single digits. So I think our franchisees recognize that even in the face of continuing high inflation on inputs, continuing inflation around labor, being disciplined and making sure that we're leading on value and affordability is the foundation for what we're seeing in our international business.\nMaybe just one final hook, David, because I think it's always so important because it's th,e essence of what we do. I mean, our operational execution metrics continue to improve. I think the result from that and from the work we've done on value and affordability is that our overall customer satisfaction scores continue to improve across all of those key markets as well. So I think we're doing all these things and we're delivering a better execution for the customer, which is obviously really important when customers, I think, are being more discerning about their choices.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is with Brian Harbour.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, thank you.\nGood morning guys.\nI guess just Chris, you talked a lot about some of the technology initiatives and stuff like that, and I know it's early days on some of those, but how should we sort of gauge?\nThe success of those?\nI mean, are you already seeing some cost benefits, for example, on the corporate side? Do you think that those are driving sales in some markets or do you think that that will be the case as you deploy them? How should we think about the success of those?\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure.\nWell, thanks for the question. I'll kind of address each of the three platforms that we've talked about from a tech standpoint and talk about the benefits that we are seeing, and then the benefits that we anticipate seeing on the consumer platform. We've talked about our goal; our aspiration is to get to that 250 million 90-day active loyalty members. I think we're making really good progress on that. As I've noted a couple times now, we're seeing that that loyalty program drives significant increases in frequency, which, at the end of the day, when 80% to 90% of the population comes to McDonald's, our opportunity is always around frequency. And so getting more and more consumers to be in our loyalty program, that's how we're going to drive this business because it's going to be frequency-led growth. So I feel good about that.\nAnd we've got a whole pipeline of enhancements that we're going to continue to make on the consumer side in the years ahead that I think are only going to deepen consumers experience and relationship with McDonald's. On the restaurant side, I'd say we're still early days on this and we talked about having Ready On Arrival. We're seeing significant speed of service improvements, we're seeing that increased customer satisfaction, we're seeing that that makes the job easier for crew. So we're starting to see benefits attached to that. But some of the other bigger ideas that we're working on, things like automated order taking, things like having Internet of Things so that our shift managers actually know when equipment is in need of service before it actually goes down. Things like what we're calling Boost, which is essentially this shift manager.\nAI-enabled capability. All those things are still very early days for us. Those are going to roll out over the next couple years, and as that happens I think you're going to see kind of this, you know, one plus one equals three benefit which is it's going to improve the restaurant experience for the customer, it's going to improve the restaurant experience for the crew person, and it needs to be able to deliver cost savings, productivity to the franchisee to ultimately enable the investment that goes behind these things.\nLastly, on the company side we've talked about, we've rolled out our finance system, we've rolled out our HR system, we've set up a Global Business Services center in India, we have one that's also up and running in Mexico that's going to give us better capabilities, it's going to mean that we can move faster, and yes, ultimately it's going to deliver cost savings that's going to ultimately show up in our G&A line as a percent of systemwide sales. So all of those things are coming to the fore. I'd say we're probably most advanced on the consumer side. I think you're going to see the restaurant and company platform benefits emerge over the next couple years.\nMaybe just a couple of builds to what Chris said, just maybe as reminders. Because I think as we lay these out, if you remember in the investor event at the end of 2023, what we talked about is these would be tech enabled platforms as Chris has touched on, which means moving away because we've been a very decentralized business as we've grown over history, and so we've become very disaggregated. It's about how do we move from common platforms, standard infrastructure that allows us to scale innovation at speed, get the benefits of our size and scale as I've talked about previously, starting to come to their full advantage because we can start leveraging scale to drive efficiency.\nI think just the reminder on, I think as we've talked about before, 2025 and 2026 and frankly into the beginning of 2027, I'll call the investment years or significant investment years to kind of build the platforms to build the capability. I think it's really as we get beyond that investment period, we'll start to see more of the kind of efficiency benefits, and certainly we can talk more at that point about how those are going to come to life.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore.\nSenatore from Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you. Actually, two quick clarifying questions. The first is I think last quarter you had said that the middle income consumer was seeing declines similar to the low income. Does that persist? I'm just trying to understand if you're still seeing maybe a broader weakness. And then on the loyalty maybe you can help reconcile the sort of going from 10 and a half times to 26 times is more than doubling transactions. And yet I suspect it looks like your transactions in the US were down kind of low single digits. Maybe it's just the loyalty membership, is it big enough yet? I know you combined it with $5 meals and said that was 50%. Or maybe it's just the over indexing to other lower income consumers is offsetting that.\nBut wanted to sort of think about how loyalty, because it's such a huge L, could drive going forward if you expand that loyalty program. So two questions there.\nThank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, hi Sara, it's Chris. Very quickly the middle income has improved in Q2 versus Q1. So we're seeing that that's gone to slightly positive in Q2. And then on your question around loyalty, the short answer is it's just not big enough. It's not at the size yet. And at the same time seeing like Ian mentioned, we're seeing, you know, high, we're seeing double-digit declines with that low income consumer and we and the industry over-index to that low income consumer. So I think for us that's why we're so focused on driving our 90-day active and increasing that number. Because as you get more and more consumers into that you're going to see the frequency benefits. And today as I mentioned in the US it's roughly around a quarter of our consumers are in the loyalty program.\nBut when we look to markets like China, when you can get the number to 90% or something along those lines, that's when you would see some really significant benefits attached to that. So that's the aspiration, but I think it's right now it's just a little bit early to be able to see the benefits, the full benefits that you're asking about.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from John Ivanko from JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Ivanko\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. The industry has been talking about weakness in the consumer base and lower income consumer base really since at least the second half of 2023. So it's been quite some time. So, you know, I'm really hoping for some diagnostics I guess at this point in terms of why that's happening. If I were to take a step back and look at your compression of pricing versus grocery year on year, total employment, gas prices, you know, some of the normal pressures that would be affecting quick service traffic, you know, quite frankly don't exist, I mean, at least from a macro perspective. So can you explain, I guess, what's happening in the US and is US potentially a leading indicator for other major markets or might other major markets in some ways be a leading indicator for the US? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWell, I think if I had an easy quick answer to that, I'd probably be working in the government because I think that is a big question for all of us to try to unpack. But I would just note a few things. With the low income consumer, despite improvements in wage gains, real incomes are down. So real incomes are down. With the low income consumer, that absolutely is going to put pressure on visits into the QSR industry. Second thing is there's a lot of anxiety and unease with that low income consumer. We could all speculate the reasons for that, probably tariffs and the impact that that might have, questions around employment situation. But it's clear from the data that there's also, besides real incomes being down, that sentiment is being down is down.\nThe result of that is you're seeing people either skip occasions, so they're skipping a day part like breakfast, or they're trading down either within our menu or they're trading down to eating at home. Those would be sort of my simple.\nKind of read on what's going on. But I'd say.\nThat's as much conjecture as it is being able to point to specific things. It's a big question for the industry.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAnd I think the only hook to Chris's comments, John, would just be, I mean, internationally I think we're seeing pretty similar dynamics. I think maybe the additional point that we've talked about previously in international is we see families under pressure, families just because they have obviously a larger kind of population within their family to kind of serve. I think they're also very value conscious, and I think under pressure for similar reasons to what Chris articulated. I think the only difference internationally, as Chris talked about a little bit earlier, is probably we have less competitive pressure. So we are the clear choice, and I think are still winning because of what we've done with value and affordability. But as we've talked about a lot, we've got to work even harder to make sure we're attractive for all consumers, including the lower income consumer.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is with Jon Tower from Citi.\n\nJon Tower\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat, thanks.\nMaybe clarification and then a question first on the G&A spend for the balance of the year. I think, based on where it's trending year to date, it implies effectively a nice uptick in spend in the back half relative to system sales. So, maybe you can clarify what's going on there?\nAnd then, secondly, just curious, Chris, you.\nHit on the idea that beverage is a fairly large opportunity. You're investing a lot of time and.\nEnergy in testing it right now.\nCurious how you see that hitting on the menu going forward, assuming much of it runs through the test? Well, is this something that's going to be core to that value platform, specifically?\nThat EDAP, either McValue platform or meal.\nDeal platform, or do you see it kind of playing well across the premium?\nThe everyday value platforms in the US.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHi, Jon. Let me just get the G&A clarification out of the way, and then I'll let Chris touch on your question around beverages. I mean, I think that the kind of natural cycle of G&A spend is back half weighted, and frankly, generally Q4 weighted. I think it's just the reality of a lot of the projects kind of take time to get up to full speed. I think as you've heard us talk a lot about, we've got a lot of activity in regards to areas like transformation and some of the work we're driving in tech and digital. Just that I think is kind of the spending pattern that we anticipate this year, which is pretty typical, but probably a little bit more kind of back half weighted this year than maybe what we've seen in prior years on beverages.\nI would just say obviously what we've talked about in the past is just the big opportunity that we see in beverages. It's a really large market opportunity, it's growing, and it's more profitable than food. So there's a lot of things to like, which is why ums as well as I think a few of our competitors are also excited about this. What we learned through the CosMc's test that we've talked about previously is it's not nearly as complicated as we thought because what we discovered is actually the consumer isn't looking to design the beverage from sort of a blank slate. They actually want to be given a recipe and then they just want to make adjustments around the edges on that.\nAnd so what we've got with our beverage test that we're doing now is we're bringing a much more expanded lineup of beverage offerings into the market to see what resonates with customers. I think on your question on value, certainly there's always going to be parts of the beverage opportunity where we'll have on the value menu, as you've known from the past, coffee has been a great way for us to drive traffic. They've done dollar coffee in Canada for a long period of time. I imagine you're going to continue to see that there will be some beverages that continue to live on the value menu. But I think the bigger opportunity for us is you can actually get a lot of full margin products from these beverage offerings. And so that's what we're getting after.\nI think that's why we're excited with the franchisees, because you're not going to have to discount all of these. Now there's actually for us a benefit because a lot of these are priced.\nWith some of our competitors.\nGives us an area to come underneath that. But relative to what we do from a value menu standpoint, we're not going to have to go all the way to putting everything on the value menu.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Lauren Silberman, Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much. I wanted to follow up on the menu architecture. It seems like it's been a bit more difficult perhaps in recent years to get franchisees to coalesce around national price points, given some of the differences in cost across markets and reading into some of your commentary regarding your current efforts on the core menu. I guess what can actually be done to solve some of those challenges? Is it more about adding items of entry-level price points like Snack Wraps, more national price points? Anything more you can share there would be helpful.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure.\nWell, there's been pricing, there's been inflation pressure in the US, there's been inflation pressure, as I've mentioned in IOM.\nThat certainly has added pressure on the franchisee P&L to be able to take pricing to offset that. And then that also then disrupts the value programs that were in place, which.\nHas led to all the effort that.\nWe've done over the last 18 months to get that fixed. I think there still is absolutely a need and a benefit for having nationally advertised price points. And we know that when you have a nationally advertised price point, it drives significantly more incrementality than if everybody is off sort of doing their own pricing, which is why something like what we're doing with the Snack Wrap, the $2.99, the fact that the franchisees have endorsed that for the balance of the year to stay at that price point, I think we have good alignment with the franchisees on the need and the power of doing nationally advertised price points. At the same time, the wage rates that exist across the US are quite varied.\nAnd so we need to respect that and work with the franchisees on how do we solve for that in a way that works for everybody's P&L. It's not easy, but I think we've shown the ability with, whether it's the $5 Meal Deal, the $2.99, that we can come together and do it. But all of these things take a lot of conversations and collaboration with the franchisees.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is with Christine Cho from Goldman Sachs.\n\nChristine Cho\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs",
    "content2": "Thank you for taking my question. You've reiterated your plans to open 2,200 stores this year on track to growing stores around 4%. But are there any factors that you're closely watching that could impact the development pipeline for 2026 and beyond? Any shift in margin dynamics or store economics your franchisees are seeing that could change the demand for opening new stores? Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHi, good morning, Christine.\nLet me take that.\nWell, look, I think, you know, as we talked about in our upfront remarks, we're really confident about delivering the 2,200 gross openings for this year. I think we've got to really strong and robust pipeline. As you know, we're in the process of kind of accelerating our pace of development. We'll get to basically about 1,000 gross openings a year in our owned markets by 2027. That commitment that we made at the end of 2023, to get to 50,000 restaurants, I mean, at the end of the day, we make our decision based on the returns that we generate. Obviously, we want to make sure we have a really strong starting point. We closely watch kind of the first year. But ultimately what we're also looking for is what do we expect the longer term return to be for those locations.\nI think, as I've touched on previously, we continue to see solid starting points for new restaurants. We continue to see returns that are kind of in line with our expectations. I think obviously, anytime you accelerate, there's always the potential risk that you can have some slippage in the quality. So we're monitoring that very, very closely. And it goes back, I think, as we've talked about before, to I think the volume and the solidity of the work that we did leading up to kind of making that commitment at our Investor Day in 2023 and really getting granular on the opportunity and really precise on where those kind of open trading areas were, which is what our pipeline is addressing. So of course we're going to continue to monitor that. Of course we're going to continue to make sure the quality is delivering.\nBut again, I think we feel really confident about where we are and on pace to kind of deliver to what we've kind of laid out.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThe only thing I would add on that, when we were all together with our leadership, our market leadership in late June, we looked at pipelines for the next few years, and our pipelines are in really good shape. I feel very good about that. And I'd say when you're doing development, the first year or two is maybe a little bit more challenged because, you know, it takes a while to get the pipeline filled. But as we look now to the out years, we're in great shape on our pipeline.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Charles at TD Cowen.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chris. With the upcoming specialty beverage test in the US, what are you monitoring for to decide if this is something you're looking to expand further, and if you could also just touch on the timeline, you know, if this is something that is that you're finding to be successful, you know, could you see the pilot expanded to more stores beyond the initial 500 later in 2025?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure.\nThanks for the question. Well, I'd say with any test, we're looking for the consumer reaction and we're looking for the uptake on buying these products, and then also understanding how that works with the rest of the menu. Is it an add on sort of to get a full read on this? I think, I think as we've talked about, we feel good about the operational elements of this and the tests that we have in place. We think operationally is going to be sound, but ultimately it's going to be able to then give us the confidence about the scale of the opportunity and how aggressively and how quickly we go after it. So in my mind, I don't see us going from 500 restaurants to 1,000. I mean, this is 500 restaurants to then when are we going full market potential.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat, thank you. I want to double click on the comment that you were making earlier, Chris, on consumers being more discerning with their dollars.\nAlso, in the breakfast day part, perhaps consuming coffee at home a little bit more.\nI'm wondering if you can share.\nWhat is the breakfast mix today?\nHow does it compare versus the pre-COVID? The real question is how are you strengthening your foundations in the.\nDay part and how much does that.\nDepend on your kind of results on the new beverage lineup versus strengthening the value for consumers?\nThank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Well, as you note, and I would agree, the breakfast day part is the most economically sensitive day part because it's the easiest day part for a stressed consumer to either skip breakfast or choose to eat breakfast at home. We, as well as the rest of the industry, are seeing that the breakfast day part is absolutely the weakest day part in the day. I think that's confirmation of the economic stress that we've talked about, the weakness overall in the industry in the breakfast day part. That said, I think this is still an area for us where if you've got the right value programs in place, you can drive and get that consumer to come into your restaurant.\nThe US earlier this year, as you know, started going back and advertising breakfast nationally, which is something that we haven't done for a period of time. There's also conversations around what more we might be able to do with breakfast value. For us, breakfast is still a big part of the business. It's one that we think we have a right to win in, and it's one that right now is under pressure because of the economic issues that I've cited. There's work underway to figure out what else we need to do to re-stimulate growth there.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nNext question is from Jeff Bernstein over at Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much, Chris. Franchise sentiment seems like it's critical as they're key to so many of these initiatives, no doubt. I assume their health and volumes and profits are still industry leading, but perhaps down year-over-year. I was wondering, as you mentioned, you're working closely with them to improve the menu offering, the value of the core. How would you describe those discussions with franchisees, especially around value in the US and unit growth outside of the US? It does seem like you're focused on accelerating those growth components and the partnership with franchisees, who's critical. I'm just wondering how those relationships are going relative to past quarters or years.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure.\nWell, as you note, the relationship and our partnership with our franchisee partners is everything because ultimately what gets executed in the restaurant is what's going to drive the business. It's tough to always generalize with franchisees. We have 5,000 franchisees around the world. It's almost a country by country conversation. I'd say broadly.\nWith our franchisees, the same unease that we've talked about with the consumer exists with the franchisees. They're sort of two sides of the same coin. The more the consumer is concerned, the more our franchisees are concerned. At the same time, our franchisees are seeing this cost inflation, most pronounced in Europe, but there's continuing cost and particularly labor inflation in the US. All of that, I'd say, creates unease, let's just say, with franchisees on these things. You asked about development. I think that's another. It depends on the market, really.\nI think in some places where the consumer is perhaps decreasing visits to the industry, it does raise a question around what is the appropriate development pace in that market if traffic is declining. What we talk about in all of this is that McDonald's success has been winning on value and affordability, and that if we're winning on value and affordability with our brand, with our menu innovation, we're absolutely going to be able to take share. In taking share, you're going to be able to grow cash flow. I think that's the conversation we're having with franchisees right now, which is cash flow growth is within our control. If we execute the playbook on the unit development side, a lot of where we're doing unit development is where we don't have penetration.\nThe impacts are maybe not as significant as sometimes our franchisees are concerned or worried about. At this point we're not having any difficulty finding franchisees, and I'm talking globally, we're not having difficulty finding franchisees who are willing to take on these restaurants. To me, that ultimately is showing their underlying confidence in our unit development plans.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP of Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks everyone for joining us today.\nIf you have any follow up questions, please shoot me an email, and we can schedule a call sometime today or in the coming days. Again, thank you, and have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation investor call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question, pressing star one on their touch-tone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Congbalay, you may begin.\n\nDexter Congbalay\n\nVP Investor Relations, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. Now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Dexter, and good morning, everyone. We entered 2025 knowing that it would be a challenging time for the QSR industry due to macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures weighing on the consumer. During Q1, geopolitical tensions added to the economic uncertainty and dampened consumer sentiment more than we expected. We believe McDonald's can weather these difficult conditions better than most, as we have proven time and time again, and expect to outperform our competitors by harnessing the strength of our brand and the power of our global scale. However, we're not immune to the volatility in the industry or the pressures that our consumers are facing.\nOur global comp sales in Q1 declined by 1%, and while we expected global QSR industry traffic would be down in Q1, actual industry traffic fell more than we anticipated in several of our large markets, including the US. In the US, overall QSR industry traffic from the low-income consumer cohort was down nearly double digits versus the prior year quarter. Unlike a few months ago, QSR traffic from middle-income consumers fell nearly as much, a clear indication that the economic pressure on traffic has broadened.\nHowever, traffic growth from the high-income cohort remained solid, illustrating the divided US economy, where low and middle-income consumers in particular are being weighed down by the cumulative impact of inflation and heightened anxiety about the economic outlook. We know that leadership in value and affordability is paramount in an environment like this, and we have been expanding and refining our value proposition to meet the needs of our consumers, especially our low and middle-income cohorts, as well as families internationally.\nBuilding upon the actions we began to take in 2024, we now have everyday affordable price menus, or EDAP, and entry-level meal bundles in each of our Big Five international-operated markets. As we've said before, these are the building blocks of what good value means to us, pairing an EDAP menu with items priced at compelling entry-level price points, with strong meal bundles. In early January in the US, we launched our McValue platform, which is a new branded equity similar to the Saver menu in the UK and the Loose Change menu in Australia, both of which have been in place for over 10 years. In this environment, we remain focused on the factors within our control, including delivering outstanding operational execution.\nWe believe the scaled combination of our value platforms, the introduction of innovative new products, and the execution of world-class promotional and marketing campaigns provide a compelling offering for our customers, not just bringing them in the door, but offering them the feel-good moments they've come to count on from our brand. For example, just a few weeks ago, we launched a marketing campaign in partnership with a Minecraft movie, our largest global campaign yet, with participation by more than 100 markets. As part of this campaign, we've combined exclusive digital in-app and gaming experiences with in-store collectibles for fans young and old through Happy Meals and the core menu-inspired Minecraft movie meal.\nWe're encouraged by the consumer response to the Minecraft movie campaign and by our overall performance in April, which illustrates the benefit of our value platforms working in conjunction with full-margin promotions and outstanding marketing execution. We continue to expect our Guest Count and market share performance will improve from the Q1 low point, driven by our emphasis on strong value and affordability execution that we have been addressing. The introduction of exciting new menu items, such as the nationwide launch of McCrispy Chicken Strips in the US, should contribute to this growth. However, we remain cautious about the overall health of the consumer. Before I hand it over to Ian to discuss segment performance, I also wanted to touch on the creation of McDonald's Global Restaurant Experience Team. It's significant for two reasons.\nFirst, through the new integrated structure, we'll be able to execute faster, which means ideas can start showing up in our restaurants even sooner. We can achieve and scale cross-functional product innovations like Best Burger, Big Arch, and McCrispy faster than ever before, with menu, supply chain, operations, and Speedy Lab teams all in one place. It also increases our ability to develop and scale tech innovation in new ways, such as ready-on-arrival, Internet of Things-enabled restaurant equipment, and Google Cloud connectivity through the eyes of a restaurant general manager to ensure they're all working in coordination with each other. Second, the category structure with dedicated leaders for beef, chicken, and beverages gives us better accountability and a sharper line of sight into what it takes to win in each of these verticals.\nIncreasingly, we're competing against specialists, and so we're bringing a specialist focus into McDonald's. In beverages, for example, we've discovered some interesting learnings through our CosMc's test, which has better informed our understanding of consumers' customization preferences and interests in new emerging beverage categories. Later this year, in partnership with our franchisees, we'll be launching a beverage test in the US in some of our existing McDonald's restaurants that will incorporate new menu items inspired by CosMc's. We'll share more details on this in the coming months as we continue to test, learn, and position ourselves for growth in this space. As Jill McDonald steps up to lead the Restaurant Experience Team, we welcome a new start with his rich market perspective and lifelong understanding of customers' needs to the role of president of our International Operated Markets segment.\nSempels, previously president of the international developmental licensed markets, will now assume responsibility for McDonald's France, which is one of our largest and most important markets globally. Dario Baroni, who previously oversaw our mid-size IOM markets, will backfill Jo as our IDL president. I'm immensely proud to see these proven leaders taking on new opportunities in some of our most important roles, demonstrating the depth of talent we possess within our organization. I'll now turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our Q1 financial results reflect the increasingly challenging industry and consumer pressures that Chris mentioned upfront. Against this backdrop, combined with severe weather conditions primarily in North America and the impact of the leap day last year, our Q1 global comp sales declined 1%. Global comp sales were essentially flat when the leap day impact is excluded. In the US, comp sales declined 3.6%, largely reflecting broad-based consumer challenges, particularly amongst the lower and middle-income cohorts. However, while comparable guest counts also declined versus the prior year, we delivered a positive comp guest count gap to most near-in competitors supported by the launch of our McValue platform, which incorporated the $5 Meal Deal offering, the buy one add one for $1 component, and our in-app exclusive digital offers.\nAs with our value platforms in other markets, we'll remain agile to ensure McValue continues to meet consumer needs and positions us for success in a challenging marketplace. While we may adjust our current McValue offerings over time, for the remainder of 2025, we'll continue to include everyday value meal deals starting at $5, given how the current $5 meal deal in particular has resonated with customers. In Q1, we also launched a national marketing campaign celebrating 50 years of breakfast at McDonald's, with a national Egg McMuffin Day, and expanding the availability of bagel sandwiches nationwide to strengthen our position and drive traffic in this important day part. In addition to delivering exciting menu innovation and world-class marketing efforts, we remain committed to driving operational excellence and running great restaurants.\nOne key measure for how we are performing is the customer's experience when visiting McDonald's. In Q1, we raised our customer satisfaction scores to an all-time high in the US. Now, turning to our international business, in most of our major markets, we're seeing a similar story in regards to the challenging industry environment and softening consumer sentiment. In our international-operated market segment, comp sales declined 1% versus the prior year quarter. Results were mixed across the individual markets, including negative comps in the UK. QSR industry traffic growth was positive in only two of our Big Five markets. However, we drove a positive comp guest count gap to most near-in competitors across the majority of our largest markets, demonstrating the strength of our value platforms and how they're resonating with consumers.\nIn addition, as in the US, we have also raised our customer satisfaction scores to all-time highs in nearly all of the international-operated markets, including the Big Five. In France, we continued to realize the benefits of our turnaround efforts despite a challenging industry environment. For the first time in nearly three years, we delivered positive market share gains in the quarter, driven by the success of our value offerings, including a EUR 4 Happy Meal and a value meal partnership with Ligue 1. At the end of March, we also launched a new EDAP menu featuring a variety of items with price points of under EUR 3. We're complementing these value offerings with strong menu news, such as the recent launch of the Big Arch, with positive results marking another step in the continued expansion of this large, satiating burger.\nIn Germany, QSR industry traffic continued to contract in Q1, but we drove a positive comp guest count gap to near-in competitors and increased market share behind a new comprehensive value offering, McSmart Snacks, which is an EDAP platform. We now have all aspects of good value and affordability effectively integrated in the market and working in conjunction with meal bundles, which will be complemented with exciting menu and marketing news through the year. In Canada, where QSR industry traffic increased in Q1, we delivered both positive comparable sales and guest count performance, driven in part by our $1 coffee offering and our hockey showdown limited-time promotion. As a Canadian, I can tell you that Canadians are extremely enthusiastic hockey fans.\nThis passion was evident in the results, with the hockey showdown promotion being one of the top-performing earned media brand affinity campaigns, with over 50 million impressions and driving a lift to the overall sandwich category. In the UK, where QSR industry traffic declined versus the prior year quarter, we are actively addressing the opportunities that are within our control. We understand what it takes to succeed in the UK market, which continues to build upon their value and affordability foundation, and we remain confident in our ability to revitalize the business by improving our execution and leveraging successful strategies from other markets. Lastly, to round out the Big Five, in Australia, we are making progress despite declining QSR industry traffic. With a new managing director in place, we look forward to seeing our momentum built.\nFinally, in our international developmental licensed markets, comp sales for the quarter were up 3.5%, largely driven by positive results in the Middle East and Japan. In China, our performance remained stable, driven by an increase in delivery share, the success of the Big Vites value meal, and strong performance in chicken. Turning to the P&L, adjusted earnings per share were $2.67 for the quarter, which includes a $0.04 headwind from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 1% compared to the prior year in constant currencies. Despite the challenging market conditions, top-line results generated over $3.3 billion of restaurant margins for the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was about 45.5%, highlighting the durability of our business model. Results for the quarter included lower company-operated margins, reflecting pressured top-line results and commodity inflation, particularly in Europe.\nThis was partially offset by lower G&A spend, which was primarily driven by the timing of investment and the comparison to prior year costs related to our biannual worldwide convention. We remain focused on optimizing our run-the-business spend as we continue to invest in our strategic growth priorities, such as digital and technology, and our transformation efforts led by our global business services organization that will drive long-term efficiency. With respect to the remainder of the year, while we remain cautious about consumer sentiment, we are reaffirming our full year 2025 financial targets that we outlined in February, which include the impact from tariffs that are currently in place. We expect foreign currency translation to be a tailwind to 2025 earnings per share of about $0.05 per share based on current exchange rates.\nThat's a significant change versus our previous estimated headwind of $0.20 to 0.30 per share, reflecting the recent weakening of the US dollar versus major currencies. As always, this is directional guidance only, as rates will likely change as the year progresses. Despite the ongoing industry headwinds, we know that McDonald's is well-positioned to succeed due to the resiliency of our business and our overall financial strength, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth for the system and to create value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Chris. Thanks, Ian. A couple of weeks ago, McDonald's top leaders from around the world gathered in Hyderabad, India, to discuss the path forward on our strategic priorities.\nWe're clear on the enablers of our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy and specifically our commitments to sustaining leadership on value and affordability, capitalizing on our new category teams to strengthen customers' taste perceptions of our food and accelerate menu innovation, ensuring restaurants deliver feel-good experiences where customers keep coming back and employees are excited to work, and continuing to lead with our values as the foundation of how we do business. After meetings like this, I'm always impressed by the strength and resilience of McDonald's three-legged stool. It was yet another reminder of the ways our dedicated franchisees, hardworking crew, and arguably the best global supply chain in the world come together to make sure the Golden Arches shine brightest for our customers, even during challenging times. It's a defining feature of our system.\nOur commitment to serving local communities is not just our mission. It's the essence of our franchisee model. We're a global brand, but an incredibly local business. Thousands of franchisees running our restaurants have a deep connection to the communities they serve and a keen sense of how we can bring the most positive impact and add the most value. In most communities, if not markets where we operate, McDonald's and its franchisees is one of the largest employers. When it comes to providing quality ingredients, we prioritize sourcing from local farmers and suppliers to serve the food our customers love most.\nWhile we anticipate that the economic environment will remain challenging in the near term, I'm confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is fit to drive guest count-led growth and market share gains and maximize our MCD growth pillars for the long term. It's a strategy that's rooted in our customer insights and built on our inherent competitive advantages, and it's the playbook we need to regain form in 2025. Just a couple of weeks ago, we marked McDonald's 70th anniversary. In celebrating longevity, we're actually honoring leadership: 70 years of setting the standard for innovation, pioneering the drive-through, advancing our menu, and embracing digital transformation to build the best restaurant experience. Time and again, we've proven that our foundation is strong, our commitment to customers unwavering, and our ambition to lead unparalleled.\nThis business has demonstrated an innate ability to anticipate and respond to change. Our agility has always been a key strength, now more than ever, and it gives us confidence in the future, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty. We'll stay true to what makes us uniquely McDonald's: great food, exceptional value, and an inclusive environment that welcomes all. Thanks to the strength of our system, McDonald's is well-positioned to seize the opportunities before us and keep shaping the future of our industry. With that, we'll take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur first question is from Dennis Geiger.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nEquity Research, UBS\n\nThank you. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a bit more about the US and what sounds like an encouraging response to the Minecraft marketing campaign and to your value platforms into the Q2. Recognizing the consumer is pressured, but also that select macro headwinds have abated maybe a bit, could you talk a little more about how you're thinking about your recent US sales trajectory, underlying momentum, looking ahead over the coming quarters, given some of the exciting marketing and menu news and the overall execution that you touched on? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHi, Dennis. It's Chris. Yeah, I think the year is evolving as we expect it would. We knew that in Q1 it was about getting our McValue menu embedded, getting consumers aware of that, and then we were going to be introducing marketing news in Q2 that was going to also soon be followed by menu news. So Q1 was, for us, always going to be sort of the toughest quarter in the year, and then we were expecting to see momentum build as the year progressed. As we mentioned in the opening comments, we were really encouraged by our Minecraft promotion globally. In the US, this was planned to be a four-week promotion, and I think we ended up selling out of the Minecraft collectibles within 10 days to 14 days.\nSo the response exceeded certainly what we were planning for. And then we've just started doing the soft sell of our chicken strips, our McCrispy Chicken Strips. Advertising hasn't yet started on that, but we're seeing in the restaurants that are selling strips a nice take rate on that as well. So I think how we sort of expected the year, it's evolving that way. The key for us now for the balance of the year is about execution. And you've got it in an environment where there's a pressured consumer. You've got to simply out-execute your competitors. And that means you've got to out-execute them on your value programs. You've got to out-execute them when it comes to marketing and menu innovation.\nAnd I think we've seen plenty of evidence that when you do that, there's growth out there to be had. But certainly, if your execution isn't sharp in a challenging environment, you're not going to be able to expect growth. And so that's, I think, where we're focused right now, is about making sure we do world-class execution.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from David Palmer from Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks. I'm wondering if you can give us some color about some of your key IOM countries and in what ways are the consumer economic dynamics and McDonald's value perception different today? The challenge is different than what we see in the US. It sounds like so far in this earnings season that the global consumer companies, whether it's the informal eating-out market or the instant consumable guys, are doing a little bit better overseas than you would have thought. It seems to be fairly firm in terms of consumer backdrop. But I don't know how you feel about that for your key markets. Any sort of juxtapositions of the US would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. I think generally, David, that that's a fair characterization. If I were to kind of just do a survey of the world, I think Europe, it's really country by country. As Ian mentioned, there's only two countries that we've actually seen industry growth. But I think generally we feel good about the value programs that we have in place in all of our Big Five markets. And we're seeing that when you pair that with good menu and marketing execution, you can see great performance or very good performance. So I think Europe challenged. But again, if you have the right value and marketing, you can get that. I think the issue in Europe may be a little bit different than the US is just it's a very inflationary environment in Europe, particularly because of beef.\nAnd so you've got high single-digit inflation running through the P&L because of what's going on in Europe, that compares to the US where F&P inflation is low single digits. So it's a more inflationary environment in Europe, which means we just have to be really judicious about how and where we take pricing in that environment. I think as Ian mentioned, in China, we've seen the business stabilize there. We're encouraged by what we're seeing from our China business. Latin America, I think, continues to perform okay. And then if you go to places like Japan, the business is performing solidly there. So I think relative to the US, the US and the pressure on that lower-income consumer is probably the most noteworthy thing.\nSeeing traffic declines of nearly 10% with that low-income consumer, I think, is the defining feature of what we see in the US relative to the rest of the world.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHey, David, it's Ian. I may just add a couple of comments to the context that Chris has outlined. I'll just use our Big Five IOM markets as a bit of the bellwether because obviously it's just building on what Chris laid out. But I mean, I think it's certainly there's still challenge in our industry, obviously, in particular. I think just with lower-income consumers and families, which are a big part, as you know, of our international business, I think there are pressures there. I think what we feel, obviously, as you've heard us talk a lot about, what we're focused on is what's within our control.\nWe feel really good, as you heard us talk about upfront, in the fact that in those Big Five markets, we've now got through the Q1 the essential components of strong value in place in each of those Big Five markets with EDAP programs and then entry-level meal bundles. So I think despite the fact that in three of those five markets, we're continuing to see a contracting industry traffic, we're taking share in the majority of those markets because I think we're starting to see those value platforms work.\nAnd as Chris said, when you combine that, and I'll use France as the example, with kind of new and exciting menu news like the Big Arch launch, which happened in France in early April, and we're seeing some good early results there, you start providing those reasons for consumers to visit. So again, it's certainly not an easy landscape, but we certainly feel like the business is well-positioned on the back of the work that we did through 2024 and into the beginning of this quarter.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nSenior Analyst and Director of Research, Baird\n\nHi. Good morning. My question's on the US McValue platform. I was hoping maybe you can elaborate on how you think the current construct of that value is working in the current environment and whether you think adjustments are needed. I guess the nature of my question is, when you think back to the last kind of major downturn in consumer spending, you had the dollar menu in place, and that worked quite well and allowed for significant share gains. I'm wondering if you need sharper entry-level price points on the value menu in today's environment.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, David. Just as background, so the introduction of McValue, as you'll recall, was about getting a branded platform established that we expect to sustain over time. And the point of that was to allow for flexibility, to allow for us over time to change the individual items within that based on what we were seeing from a competitive set, based on what we were seeing in terms of consumer responsiveness, etc. So it's designed to be agile. As you think about McValue, we feel really good about how the $5 Meal Deal is performing. And Ian talked about in his comments the fact that there's alignment in the US system that that $5 Meal Deal is going to continue through the balance of the year.\nThere may be some additional meal at different price points that get offered on top of that. But at a $5 Meal Deal, there's going to be that continuing for the balance of the year. I think when you look at the Buy One, Add One for $1, I'd say our view on that is it's performing okay, but frankly, it's not driving nearly the amount of incrementality that we're seeing with the Buy One or with the $5 Meal Deal. And at the end of the day, value programs, the ultimate barometer for performance of a value program is its ability to drive incrementality. And we're seeing incrementality for the Meal Deal 10, 13, 12 points higher than what we're seeing with the Buy One, Add One for $1.\nThe Buy One, Add One for $1, certainly there's a strong take rate, but it's not driving as much incrementality. And so I think this is a question for the US team with franchisees: is any value program requires an investment of margin dollars to get that established? And is the buy one, add one for a dollar the best investment of margin dollars? I think there's probably an opportunity to look for greater incrementality, but that's going to be a conversation that happens in the US. And as to any pivots, that I think time will tell on that.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from Brian Harbour of Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes. Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just on that topic, I think you're still running something like mid-single-digit menu pricing in the US. And obviously, I know you don't control that, but I wonder as that kind of continues to go up, but then you talk more about the value platform, and then you maybe put more items on it. I mean, does that sort of the spread between the different sides of the menu become a problem? Do you think there is going to be sort of continued negative mix shift as you talk more about value? I don't know if maybe innovation is a way to solve that because you can sort of introduce items that are at a lower price point.\nI mean, maybe strips kind of fit that mold. But how do you think about that dynamic kind of over the medium to longer term?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Well, it's certainly something that you need to be mindful of. We're always taking a look at it. I think part of what we've described here is you've got to have strong value and affordability programs, but they have to be paired with great full-margin marketing and menu innovation. And that when you do the two of those in combination, you get an outcome or result that is positive for the franchisee P&L, positive for our P&L, etc.\nI think what you're talking about there in terms of trade and how we think about F&P inflation, you have to just be very disciplined on these things. And I think one of the things that we spend a lot of time with our franchisees on is looking at pass-through rates, making sure that we're being judicious about how and where we take pricing.\nI think there's been a lot of good progress on that. Then as you think about other incremental programs that you may need to do, certainly we test those. We'll do different modeling on those to make sure that in total that the P&L works. I think you can't really decompose and take each individual item. You have to look at it in totality and say, \"Does this program work for our franchisees and for the company?\" But Ian, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add to that.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, Brian, morning. Just maybe a couple of things I'd add. I mean, you're right if we use the US as the example that menu pricing, obviously, as you would expect, has been coming down as inflation's been coming down. And I think we were just under mid-single digit in Q1. Most of that, frankly, was carryover from price taken in 2024. So assuming inflation keeps coming down, I would expect the contribution from price to kind of continue to moderate in line with that. As Chris said, I mean, obviously, what we've been doing in the US, and we're kind of in this non-comparable period, is we've obviously responded to the kind of needs of the consumer, and we've put stronger value and affordability in place.\nIf you remember, the $5 meal went in place at the end of June in 2024. There certainly is, until we kind of get more comparable, there is a bit of a mix adjustment. Obviously, the purpose of that mix adjustment, as Chris was talking to, is we want to drive stronger underlying momentum in the business. We want to drive guest count-led growth. And then as you get that guest count-led growth and you start complementing that with things like Minecraft or chicken strips, you get the check growth, the profit growth, which is obviously the kind of total outcome that you're looking for. But I think until we get to Q3 this year, you're going to continue to see a bit of that mix play in check and margin until we get more comparable.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Ian, last quarter, you talked about moderate US same-store sales embedded within your 2025 US McOpco outlook. I'm curious, just following Q1's challenging performance, and your cautious view on the consumer, but couple that with the sharp improvement in April sales. If moderate US same-store sales growth still holds for 2025, where has your embedded assumption changed? And maybe just quickly, if you could also touch on your expectations for 2025 US McOpco margins, that would also be helpful.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Good morning, Andrew. I think what I would say is I think on margins, I think we continue to believe if we use McOpco margins as the example in the US for this year, for the total year on a percentage basis, we expect to be slightly up on a percentage basis versus where we were in 2024. Obviously, as we've talked about a fair bit this morning, there's still a fair bit of uncertainty in the external environment. And as we've talked about, we're obviously focused on what we can control. We feel really good about the lineup of activities that the US business and the US system have got for the rest of the year, including things obviously like Minecraft and chicken strips, which are coming to life over the next few days.\nBut the environment around us is uncertain. As you've heard me say many times before, obviously, margin growth ultimately is going to be driven by strong top-line growth. Obviously, that's what we're working hard in regards to the things that are within our control to deliver over the remainder of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore from Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. I guess maybe one clarification and a question. The clarification was on the UK. I know that's been historically a very strong business for you. I couldn't tell if that was one of the markets where you were taking share and if not, if there was any role of new competition that might be affecting you. Then the question is on the US. Do you have a sense whether those declines in the QSR traffic maybe are coming because people are shifting into other segments? I ask because I think there's a view that maybe the gap between QSR value and other segments, whether it's fast casual or full service, has narrowed. I didn't know if that was just maybe an intra-industry share shift. Thanks.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Hi, Sara. As to the UK, the UK is not yet gaining share. So there's still work for us to do in the UK. I'd say the share losses are to the people that we should be beating. So I don't think that new competitors are the issue that we need to focus on in the UK. It's about our execution and just doing a better job in that market. So that's the UK. As it relates to the US, just the relative size of the QSR industry versus fast casual, for example, or casual dining, the math just doesn't work. I mean, the gains that you might see with a couple of the players in casual dining are dwarfed relative to the size of the QSR industry.\nSo I don't think it's really accurate to say that this is just a shift amongst the different components. I think we are seeing that people are just being more judicious about cutting back on visits. And so what you're seeing is you're seeing a decline in frequency where perhaps morning, which is usually, I think, a bellwether daypart occasion, morning now is a place that you're seeing people are choosing either to skip breakfast or they're choosing to eat at home for breakfast. And I think that's more to explain what's going on in the US versus any kind of segment shift.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHey, Sara and Ian, maybe just a couple of points of texture to build on what Chris has mentioned. I think in the UK, as he said, I mean, I think we clearly believe we've got opportunities that are within our control from an execution standpoint. We've got work to do there. I would just point a little bit to France. I think UK has a much narrower set of opportunities to address. But I think if you think of the complexity of challenge we've had in France, the progress we've made, I think that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to translate the appropriate learnings and get our UK business back to where we expect it to be.\nOn the US, just to kind of emphasize what Chris said, I mean, the big thing is people are just visiting less. That speaks to, I think, the pressure on consumers, consumer sentiment, obviously, the things that we've been talking about for a while now, inflationary pressures, interest rates that are weighing, obviously, particularly on lower consumers, and that's spilling over into middle-income consumers right now. I think when we get value and affordability right, like the $5 meal, as we've talked about before, we know that is bringing consumers back in to visit us. We know when they buy something like the $5 meal, they're visiting us more frequently. So if we know we can get value and affordability right, we can win in the context of what's going on in the marketplace.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from Jon Tower of Citi.\n\nJon Tower\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You'd mentioned, Chris, earlier expanding a beverage test. I was curious if you could dig into that opportunity a little bit more. Perhaps what you're expecting from this over time? Are there investments you're anticipating the franchisees will need to make on an equipment side? Frankly, how you see positioning this platform for the company over time? Do you see this as a full-margin product or perhaps playing on the value front as well? Just maybe sizing up the opportunity and how you see it being communicated to the consumer over time.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Well, I think as we look at the opportunity from a macro perspective, there's a lot of growth that we see in beverages. And the profitability of beverages is very attractive. So when you think about profit pool growth in the industry, we expect beverages is going to be a place where there's significant growth in the profit pool. And frankly, we think there's more that we can be doing to capture our fair share of that. We capture on coffee, for example, we're probably roughly around 10% of the coffee share. We think we can be doing better than that.\nAnd then there's growth in other places where you're seeing energy and some other areas that are also strong growth where we don't participate at all. And so when we think about that, we think there's a lot that we can do. Part of what we've tried to be thinking through is how do we get after that opportunity? And part of the impetus for us to go do CosMc's was a belief that if we try to do it within an existing restaurant, that the complexity may be too great and would impact speed of service and some other things. And so the thought was, do we need to maybe look at quarantining the complexity in a standalone concept like we did with CosMc's?\nAnd one of the things, I think there's two big things that we've learned out of CosMc's, which are informing the next phase of learning here. The first is that while there is some customization, actually 80% of the order, the consumer wants it to be reciped. So this is not sort of give me a blank slate and I'm going to design endless customization.\n80% of it is reciped, and then there's some customization that goes on the end. So the complexity or the risk of complexity, as we've discovered with CosMc's, isn't as great as what we thought it would be. I think the other thing that we've learned on CosMc's is anytime it has a McDonald's brand attached to it, the consumer is going to want to buy food with that. And so versus some others that are largely food or largely beverage-dominated concepts, food is still going to always be an important part of whatever our beverage offering is because that's consumers' expectation for the McDonald's brand. And so all of that is informed now. Let's take that into a McDonald's restaurant and see what an expanded lineup of beverages could look like.\nLet's understand what that means in terms of driving incremental traffic, but also food attachment that goes with that. As to the ultimate investment that's going to be required, I don't think we know because we don't know the answer yet, but we're going to continue to test and learn. What I do know is that we're committed to going after beverages. It's part of why we set up beverages as one of our key three category structures just because of the opportunity that we see there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from John Ivorko from JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. A two-parter if I may. Firstly, it's fairly apparent looking around the country, the amount of core menu pricing difference that you have. Obviously, I understand all the different economic and competitive reasons for that. But the reality is that there's not a lot of price certainty specifically around the core menu. So do you think that that is an opportunity? Is it a risk? I mean, if you were to pull menus in certain places down, so just do talk about core menu price certainty and whether that makes sense to drive that. And secondly, the boneless chicken market has changed actually quite significantly from the last time you had Chicken Selects.\nSo if you can kind of comment on the rate of success that you're expecting from this version of McCrispy maybe versus what you had before when the competitive market was in fact different? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Well, at the end of the day, pricing is an inherently local decision, and it's informed by the trading area that exists around each of our individual restaurants. Our commitment and the focus is we need to make sure that relative to the trading area that we're competing in, that we're offering strong value. That's what shows up on both the menu board, and that also shows up with the promotions and digital offers that we're running. I think about it less as around having predictability across the country around a common menu, and it's more about we need to be competitive within the trading areas that we're competing.\nI think if you look at what's been going on with menu prices right now, because the inflation has come down and we're not nearly seeing as inflationary an environment as we saw certainly last year and in 2023, you're not seeing the big moves on core menu that you saw previously. I would expect that that's going to continue, as I mentioned, F&P inflations, low single digits. So there's not a lot of pressure on that. I think our franchisees also recognize how important it is for us to stay disciplined on this. We look at pass-through rates, as I described earlier, to make sure that we understand the consumer's willingness to accept any pricing. That would be my comment on that as to how the market's changed. Certainly, there's been a ton of growth in that space.\nIt's an area that we're hearing from our customers that they're looking for us to have a great offering there. They're thinking about other ways that we can participate in that market. We've talked about chicken strips is going to be our first sort of re-entry in that. We feel excited about doing it under the McCrispy platform. We think we can get a halo benefit that's associated with that. We've also set up that McCrispy, once you have the strips in, strips is going to allow for us to reintroduce Snack Wraps, which is going to be coming later in the year as well. I think for us, it's just the market continues to show the consumer is interested in this product. We want to make sure that we're meeting our customers' needs on that.\nI think what we've got with both strips and then later with Snack Wraps is going to be a great addition to the menu.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much. I wanted to unpack US comps a bit more. Can you talk about what you're seeing across the low, middle, and high-income consumer? I know you mentioned industry traffic, but, trying to get a better sense of what's going on with market share across cohorts. Are you seeing any increase in value mix as a result of McValue? And then any color on what you're seeing across regions and dayparts would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHey, morning, Lauren and Ian. Well, look, I think I'll kind of just reiterate what we've talked about a fair bit. I mean, I think there's pressure on both low and middle-income consumers in the US. I think as you heard Chris say, low-income consumer was down close to double-digit. Middle-income consumer in the quarter from an industry perspective was down close to that. The high-income consumer is still spending pretty consistently and pretty robustly. And as you've heard us talk about before, I mean, we over-index to low consumers in terms of our mix versus industry mix. And I think to a lower extent, but also over-index to middle-income consumers.\nAnd so obviously, as those consumers are softer, that's already going to put pressure for us, which is where having the strong value and affordability that we've talked about come into play is really important so that we're winning. I think I would just emphasize that in Q1, if you look at our comp guest count gap versus the majority of our near-in competitors, that was positive through Q1. So that obviously tells us that we're winning on a traffic, on a comparable traffic basis versus the broader industry. So again, our work is to continue to make sure we've got the proposition despite I think what's happening with consumers to be winning in the context.\nAs I said, I think we have got a strong value and affordability lineup, and we're starting to see even better momentum as we get into things like Minecraft. And we feel really confident, as Chris was talking about, with the strips launch that's going to happen over the next few days. As we get that combination to come together, we feel pretty good about being able to win against all those consumer groups as we work through the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Greg Francfort from Guggenheim.\n\nGreg Francfort\n\nManaging Director and Senior Restaurant Analyst, Guggenheim\n\nHey, thanks for the question. My question is maybe before this value launch, my understanding was a lot of the value that the customer was using was going through the mobile app. And then part of the value launch was maybe to diversify that message a little bit. I'm curious how that's evolved since the value launch and if the mix of value that's going through the mobile platform is where you want it to be above, below, any thoughts on that?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, it's tough to generalize on that because within the app, there's local value that's being offered. And so there's national value, and then there's local value that goes in combination with that. I do think what we've talked about in previous calls is that until you get to a point where the usage of the app is the majority of your traffic, relying on that as the primary source of value, it just doesn't work because you're not reaching the majority of your consumers. And so for that reason, having a broad platform like we have McValue that's available to everybody.\nI think is an important, it's an imperative that you have that, which is why we've spent the time and energy getting that launched properly. The digital offers are going to continue. They've probably come down a tick on that. It's tough to know how much of that was related to pulling back on digital offers versus just having a stronger McValue proposition out there that maybe is now driving someone to choose McValue as opposed to the digital offer. So I don't think there's anything specific that you should infer from any mix change that we're doing. There's not a purposeful pullback in digital offers to do more on McValue, but I think you're certainly seeing the consumer change as our offers change.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next call is from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein.\n\nDanilo Gargiulo\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat, thank you. There are some rising concerns on international boycotts, generally speaking, as US brands. So I'm wondering if you have seen any signs of weakness attributable to that and how you're expecting that to be evolving. And to the extent that you did, which markets are you seeing under most pressure, and what proactive measures are you contemplating to continue to protect the brand that you have so far? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation",
    "content2": "Sure. Well, we've actually spent some time researching this, and we've done three different surveys, global surveys in all of our top markets to just assess the consumer's perspective. We asked it in the context of three things. How does the consumer feel about America, the country? How does the consumer feel about American brands? And then specifically, how does the consumer feel about McDonald's? The good news from our perspective is there has been no change in how the consumer globally feels about the McDonald's brand. So we're not seeing any American sentiment have any impact on our business.\nWhat we have seen in our survey work is that there has been an increase in people in various markets saying that they are not going to be or they're going to be cutting back their purchase of American brands. We've seen an uptick in anti-American sentiment, call it 8 to 10 points increase in anti-American sentiment. Most pronounced in Northern Europe and Canada, not a big deal in Latin America, not a big change, or nothing that we're seeing in Asia. But again, the key point here is while there has been, I think, an uptick in general in anti-American sentiment, that's had no impact on our business, and consumer sentiment toward the McDonald's brands remains strong.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMaybe just the piece I'd add on the end, Danilo, is just, I mean, I think one of the strengths, as you know, of our business model is that the vast majority of our restaurants are operated by franchisees that kind of live and work and support the communities they do business in. And obviously, we operate in over 100 countries. We're very successful in all those countries that we operate. I think that's because our business and our brand has been able to adapt appropriately to the kind of cultures and communities that we do business in. And I think certainly most of our, the vast majority of consumers understand and appreciate that.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc.\n\nEric Gonzalez\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nThanks. It's clear that McDonald's is at its best when it offers compelling value to draw in guests and has something differentiated or credible for the customer to trade into. We saw this prior to the public health incident with the collector's cups and the Chicken Big Mac. Is it fair to say it's the Q1 lacked in the second half of that equation? And as we moved into the Q2, you had a winner with the Minecraft Meal, but that sort of boost isn't something that's going to last more than a few weeks. So I'm just wondering, do you have enough in the marketing and innovation pipeline on the premium side that's going to drive a more sustainable lift in sales?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWell, I think as I touched on, we're excited about, in the US and in our other markets, the balance of your plans that we have. It's not just relying on one thing. I think as we look at our marketing plans, there's a steady flow of menu innovation that goes from now through the end of the year in a number of our markets. Then there's also marketing programs that we have on top of this. I think part of when you get strong menu news paired with strong marketing, beyond just the benefit that you get in the window, you start to see improvement in baseline.\nThat would be our expectation, as we continue to have more menu innovation, as we continue to have strong marketing programs. It has a positive impact on baseline, which is sort of the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAnd Eric, maybe just to build, I mean, I think you touched on it, but as you remember, we had really strong momentum in our US business pre kind of the food safety incident. Obviously, that was a disruption. As we said in our last call, expected in Q1 this year that the impacts of the food safety incident would be fully behind us. They are. We've fully recovered. But if you just think of the sequence of activities that we've had in the US business, obviously, the disruption of the food safety incident, full focus on an effort on recovery, then we've spent Q1 really getting the McValue brand equity and platform embedded and emphasized. So we really haven't until Minecraft in April had a big kind of consumer resonating menu or marketing-focused activity.\nAnd I think you're right. Those things are obviously moments in time. But as you do those and as you do those consecutively, you kind of continue to add to the momentum that you're building in the business. So you start that momentum, obviously, with the strong value and affordability, and then you build on that with each of these activities. And as we talked about earlier, we certainly feel really confident about the lineup of activities that our US business has, starting with Minecraft and over the remaining course of the year.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\n\nJeffrey Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Actually, perfect follow-up to my question. I feel like you do have a lot of new news coming. Again, you mentioned Minecraft in April, crispy chicken in May, snack wrap to follow. I know in the past there was maybe some caution on too much new news at McDonald's in terms of the impact on speed of service and operations at the restaurant level. So I was wondering how you feel the teams are able to handle that when obviously speed is so important. And it kind of ties into, I think you mentioned that you're competing so much more against specialists now, which I assume are peers focused on one specific line of product.\nI was wondering how your new team can be more effective and better competing against some of those players and the early learnings you have or expectations you have in terms of being able to better compete against those single-line competitors? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, sure. I'll address the specialist question, then I'll let Ian pick up the first part of your question. But one of the things that I think we're seeing is, as I mentioned, that there are more people that are going after specific product verticals, whether that's chicken, whether that's beverages. You're seeing that in salads and some other places. And our menu, and part of what I think is the appeal of McDonald's, is that we have a broad menu. And it's a menu that can attract the whole family because there's something for everybody on our menu. The challenge with that, if you're a managing director running a country, is at the end of the day, you're just focused on in total hitting your comp sales target, hitting your profit target, etc.\nAnd while you pay attention or you're looking at your share within those individual verticals, you're not waking up every single day thinking about, \"Am I gaining share in chicken? Am I gaining share in beef? Am I gaining share in beverages?\" You're thinking about, \"Am I gaining market share in total?\" And so the opportunity for us is to have teams that have that degree of focus, who are waking up every single day looking at our performance across the globe and making sure that we absolutely are winning in chicken, that we're winning in beverages, that we're winning in beef, or continue to win in beef.\nAnd I think part of what we wanted to do with that as well is to win in these categories. It's not just coming up with a marketing idea or coming up with a brand name. It goes to supply chain and sourcing. So what's the type of product that we're sourcing? It goes to the equipment that we're using. It goes to the processes that we're doing in the restaurant. It goes to certainly the menu offering and the menu innovation that goes along with that, and then how we activate that with consumers. Now, with these category teams, we have all of those groups working in combination underneath a category leader who, again, is charged with waking up every single day and focused on winning in their specific vertical.\nSo that, I think, is going to be the power for us. Ultimately, how it gets executed is going to be at the country level. But I think we have sort of a good one-two punch between a focus at the country level, but also keeping an eye toward making sure that we're winning globally in these important categories.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, Jeffrey. Maybe just let me touch on the other part of your question. I think the US is the perfect example to kind of lean into what you've been asking. But if you think of what our US business did, it was obviously through the learnings we had in COVID and just the need during that period to get much clearer and simpler in the menu. The US has done, I think, a phenomenal job as a system on getting really focused on a strong core menu and then building on that core menu over the last several years. So they greatly reduced the complexity from an execution.\nAnd I think the evidence of that is, as we talked about, we hit an all-time high from a customer satisfaction metric result in Q1 this year, which I think speaks to how the US has continued to improve execution and how customers have kind of responded to that. I think if you think about what we're doing with strips and then later in the year with wraps building on that, it goes back to what Chris has talked about a lot previously, which is we're focused on platforms, right? McCrispy is a platform. So the McCrispy sandwich was the first element of that. We're now building on that with strips and then later in the year with wraps, which means we keep investing to build and strengthen the equity behind the product.\nAnd then we're just addressing the needs from consumers that when we do things like menu architecture research, we can really see what are the opportunity areas in chicken and how do we address those behind the equity that we're putting in place and continue to build on that. So we feel really good about where we are, the capacity we have to kind of add the items that are in our plan and not have that have an impact on execution, which, as you know, is always critically important.\n\nOperator 2\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions or would like to call, please contact us and we can set something up. Again, have a good day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question and answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star1 on their touchtone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Meader, Interim Treasurer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Meader, you may begin.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski, and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone.\nThank you for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Obviously our performance in 2024 did not meet our expectations, but I'm still immensely proud of our McDonald's system. It was a busy year, and at times it felt like McDonald's was a part of almost every major news story reflecting the reach and visibility of our brand. Throughout it all, McDonald's people were resilient and responsive. We stayed focused on our customers, acted swiftly when needed, and continue to run our restaurants at a high level to our employees, franchisees, and suppliers. I want to say thank you. In 2024, global comp sales decreased 0.1% for the full year, with comps up 0.4% in the fourth quarter, including positive comps across our IDL and IOM segments. In the US comp sales were down 1.4% for Q4 amidst the impact of the E.\ncoli outbreak linked to slivered onions on our Quarter Pounders. Ian will provide you with more texture on these results in just a minute. As we transition into 2025, several factors give me confidence that our performance will return to proper form over the next several quarters. First, we have the right strategy, Accelerating the Arches. Our MCD Growth Pillars still offer significant growth opportunities, and I'm pleased with the 2025 market plans, particularly their balance of value and full-margin food innovation. Second, the US food safety issue is now largely behind us, and we expect to have fully recovered by the beginning of Q2. At McDonald's, we always say that food safety is our number one priority, and this unfortunate incident is an important reminder of that fact.\nThe strength of our brand depends upon the absolute trust of our customers, and I'm pleased by the positive feedback we've received from so many regarding our rapid and transparent handling of this issue. And third, we'll continue to realize incremental benefits as more markets deploy new solutions from each of our three strategic technology platforms, consumer, restaurant, and company. Later, I'll come back and provide more visibility into our 2025 plans, but for now let's move on to Ian who will discuss Q4 and full year results.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris noted, the QSR industry remained challenged, and our performance in 2024 fell short of our expectations. Pressure on spending persists, in particular with two significant cohorts of our consumer base, low-income and families, particularly in Europe. Still, we're confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy, which is rooted in customer insights and built on our inherent competitive advantages, is right for our business to win in 2025 and beyond. With respect to our Q4 performance, global comp sales growth was slightly positive. In the US, Q4 comp sales were negative, reflecting the impact of the food safety incident. When we met last quarter, we committed to bringing the full resources of McDonald's to bear to reengage the customer, and we did just that. As Chris mentioned, by the beginning of Q2, we expect to have fully recovered.\nThe immediate actions we took to identify the cause allowed us to quickly shift the focus to regaining our customers trust and reigniting their brand affinity. Throughout November and December, we saw sequential improvement in baseline traffic performance, including slightly positive comp guest count growth for the month of December, and had a positive comp guest count gap to most near-end competitors for Q4. These results were driven by our marketing efforts to amplify traffic drivers. This includes additional investment in our national value campaign and always-on digital and media plans to drive momentum in our international operated market segment. Comp sales performance this quarter was slightly positive due to mixed results across the individual markets, including negative comps in the UK.\nWhile QSR industry traffic was positive in only two of our big five markets, we had a positive comp guest count gap to most nearest competitors across the majority of our largest markets. During a difficult time for the industry, we have acted with urgency and remain steadfast in continuing to focus on what's within our control, including refining and providing compelling value propositions, introducing exciting menu innovation, and leaning into our One McDonald's Way approach to marketing by driving brand strength, building cultural relevance, and connecting with our customers and crew in exciting ways. For example, on our value propositions, Canada has paired everyday affordable price or EDAP menus with strong meal bundles through the Canadian McValue Menu, which features the $5.79 meal bundle and a $1 Coffee EDAP offering, which drove coffee share gains in the quarter.\nCanada not only provided great value offers but paired them with full margin promotions that connected with our fans through culturally relevant campaigns. One example is the Grinch Meal which generated nearly 30 million impressions on social media, our highest user generated content ever in Canada. These all helped to drive positive sales and guest count performance in the market, including positive guest count gap to nearest competitors for the entirety of the fourth quarter, and in Germany we've continued to meet customers where they are even with a difficult industry backdrop. While QSR industry traffic in Germany has continued to contract further since the third quarter, we have continued to drive market share gains by expanding upon the already successful McSmart Menu now offering a range of meal bundle options introduced at the end of September.\nWe are seeing incrementality to the business driven by the extended value offerings and by layering on exciting menu news with full margin items such as Der M or the Big Arch, as well as the Big Rösti, which had made its annual return. In other markets such as Spain, we have continued to outperform the competition by driving strong execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, including continuing to focus on value through Menu for You, which is a branded equity that we have been able to capitalize on for over three years, and delivering on digital execution with a month-long Christmas calendar, boosting engagement on the app, and driving an increase in identified users.\nWe also saw success from our One McDonald's Way approach to marketing, combining cultural relevance with global reach through a Friends TV show themed Adult Happy Meal featuring our core menu items including six Friends characters and a themed dipping sauce. The campaign provided a significant lift to our top line with a social media reach expanding well beyond just Spain. All of this contributed to the market's strong comp sales and guest count performance in the quarter as well as share gains for both the quarter and the year. France, a market that we've talked about all year, started to see signs of improvement with positive comp sales and guest count gaps to near in competitors for the fourth quarter.\nThese results were driven by our partnership with Hot Ones providing three fiery sauces to fans, each one spicier than the next, being one of the most talked about campaigns over the last few years. In the market, we've also seen the success of the €4 Happy Meal which has resonated with families, driving an improvement in their brand perceptions around value and affordability, and a lift in the Happy Meal category. We are encouraged by these signs of progress internationally and will continue to build upon the actions taken in 2024 so that we have a strong foundation for growth in 2025. Finally, in our International Developmental Licensed segment, comp sales for the quarter were over 4%, largely driven by positive results in the Middle East and Japan.\nIn the Middle East, the positive sales comp largely reflected lapping the impact of the war that began in October of 2023, and in China we're seeing encouraging signs of stabilization. In short, while the global QSR industry remains challenging, we're confident in our competitive strengths across our MCD growth pillars and our strong execution against the value expectations of our customers. Our ability to continually evolve to stay ahead of the customer positions us for success in any economic environment.\nTurning to the P&L, adjusted earnings per share were $2.83 for the quarter, a 4% decrease compared to the prior year in constant currencies, reflecting the pressure on our top line. Results also reflect higher other operating expense, as well as the comparison to a prior year property sale gain. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was just over 46%, with top line results generating more than $14.5 billion in restaurant margin dollars for the year, providing evidence of the resiliency of our business model. Lastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CapEx spend for the year was just under $2.8 billion. More than half was invested in new restaurant unit expansion across our US and IOM segments, which enabled us to deliver on our openings target for the year.\nOur CapEx spend was slightly above the high end of the range we provided for the year, as we invested more toward our future year development pipeline and setting us up for success as we continue to increase our pace of openings. Our Free Cash Flow conversion for the year was 81% below our expected 90% range due to pressures on top line performance and higher capital spend to accelerate new restaurant growth. We have continued to follow our capital allocation priorities for the year. After investing to support long-term growth of the business, we returned $7.7 billion of cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to returning all excess Free Cash Flow to shareholders over time. I'll talk about our 2025 outlook shortly, but first let me hand it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks Ian. Our ability to stay ahead of customers' changing needs and reimagine the McDonald's experience for tomorrow is the key to achieving our 2025 ambitions. We're moving forward with agility and urgency, getting back to guest count led growth and winning share from our competitors. Our unwavering focus on the MCD growth pillars will continue to unlock executional excellence and drive growth across our business. Our marketing efforts are reclaiming leadership in value and affordability through initiatives like everyday affordable price menus and meal bundles. In the US, the January launch of the McValue platform provides consistent, compelling value with the choice and flexibility our customers want in many of our international markets. We are making further enhancements to our value programs in Q1 to ensure that we are offering industry-leading value and with good value at the foundation.\nWe will overlay a strong pipeline of creative marketing ideas that will delight our fans and will provide full margin check growth. Our core menu remains at the heart of our business. We're excited about the significant opportunity we see within our chicken portfolio and see the potential to add another point of chicken market share by the end of 2026. We continue to roll out McCrispy, which is now in over 70 markets and will be available in nearly all markets by the end of 2025. This year there is incredible energy for the return of Snack Wraps in the US along with a few other markets, and the US will also launch a new chicken strip offering. We'll continue to pulse in the Chicken Big Mac as a limited time only offering over time.\nIn 2024 the Chicken Big Mac helped generate chicken market share growth in France and the US with positive incrementality. Deployment of Best Burger continues. It's currently available in over 80 countries, and we're on track to implement it in nearly all markets by the end of 2026, and we're excited to capture incremental growth with the Big Arch as we roll it out to more international markets this year. Our 4Ds continue to drive growth, and we're actively doubling down on digital and development. For digital, we know loyalty customers spend more than their non digital counterparts.\nWe've made strong progress, and we're on track toward our long-term targets of 250 million 90-day active users and 45 billion in annual system-wide sales by the end of 2027. To date, our 90-day active users totals has reached over 170 million across 60 markets, with system-wide sales to loyalty members totaling approximately 30 billion in 2024. We will also continue to redefine convenience for our customers to Ready On Arrival, with deployment underway in markets across the world for development. We delivered on our 2024 restaurant openings targets across the globe, and we're on track to reach 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027. Finally, our close partnership with our world-class franchisees, including the recent renewal of our Master Franchise agreement with Arcos Dorados, which will be critical to driving our continued growth.\nLet me now turn it back over to Ian for details on our 2025 outlook.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. We're confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth in 2025 and over the longer term, but as we've discussed, there are varying levels of near-term headwinds across markets. Our approach to our 2025 outlook reflects the current environment of soft or declining restaurant industry traffic in the US and many of our larger markets. That said, as Chris noted, regardless of the operating environment, we remain steadfast on the execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the continued rollout of the actions we began to take in 2024 across the system to drive guest count led growth and grow market share by outperforming our competitors. Our financial targets for 2025 reflect the benefit of these initiatives as well as our expectation of gradual stabilization of the macroeconomic and consumer environment, but does not include any impact from potential new tariffs.\nShould the underlying environment improve beyond our initial expectations, especially with respect to lower income consumers, we would expect to benefit disproportionately relative to our competitors. Specifically for 2025, driven by the durability of our business model, we're targeting our full-year operating margin percent to be in the mid- to high-40% range and above the 46.3% adjusted operating margin from 2024, primarily due to franchise margin performance. This includes our expectation that our full-year company-operated margin percent will be slightly higher than the 14.8% we delivered in 2024, driven by top-line growth and partly offset by continued cost pressures. With respect to G&A, our system's financial strength enables us to invest in areas that we expect will drive long-term efficiencies for our people and for our stakeholders.\nEven with the muted top-line growth in 2024, we maintained the right long-term investment mindset as we were able to prioritize our Run the Business spend. We expect 2025 G&A as a percentage of system-wide sales for the full year to be about 2.2%. Our 2025 target reflects continued investments in technology, digital, and Global Business Services or GBS. You heard Chris mentioned the three strategic technology platforms earlier. Through the investments in these platforms, we plan to continue to get more efficient in running the business over time and ultimately free up more resources to continue to drive long-term growth. We still have significant investment years ahead of us before these efficiencies are realized below the operating line.\nWe're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 4% and 6% compared to 2024 due to higher average debt balances and interest rates, and expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22%. Turning to restaurant development and capital expenditures, we expect net restaurant expansion in 2025, along with restaurants we opened in 2024, will contribute slightly over 2% to system-wide sales growth as we continue to accelerate our new unit development. We plan to spend between 3 billion and 3.2 billion this year with the majority invested in new unit openings across our US and IOM segments. This increase in CapEx versus the prior year is in line with our expectation of about 300 to 500 million increases each year through 2027 as we outlined at our December 2023 Investor Day.\nGlobally, we plan to open approximately 2,200 restaurants this year with about a quarter of these openings in our US and IOM segments. We expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IDL segment, including about 1,000 in China. Overall, we anticipate slightly over 4% unit growth from the nearly 1,800 net restaurant additions in 2025. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, to invest in the business to drive growth, including capital expenditures as well as investments in technology, digital, and GBS. Second, to prioritize our dividend, and third, to repurchase shares with remaining free cash flow over time. In 2025, we expect our net income to free cash flow conversion to be in the low to mid 80% range as we continue to step up strategic investments to drive sustainable long-term growth of the business.\nOver the longer term, we continue to target free cash flow conversion in the 90% range, reflecting the resiliency of our business model. However, we do expect that the conversion percentage will be below that longer term target during the peaks in an investment cycle. Lastly, with a strong US dollar that may continue to strengthen into 2025, we expect foreign currency to be a full year headwind to 2025 EPS totaling in the range of $0.20 to 0.30 based on current exchange rates. As always, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the remainder of the year.\nThe resilience of our business and our overall financial strength have put us in a position to succeed in any environment, and I'm confident that the continued execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy sets us up to deliver long-term growth for our system and create value for our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThank you, Ian. This year, McDonald's will celebrate its 70th anniversary. Seventy years of defining what it means to be the leader in our industry. Through generations of ever-changing global economies, technological booms, extraordinary social and political evolution, and resounding connections to the center of culture, we've grown stronger year after year by staying true to what we do best, serving delicious food with unmatched value to our customers while feeding and fostering communities around the world. McDonald's remains uniquely positioned to do just that. By staying true to our golden rule of treating everyone with dignity, fairness, and respect, we continue to build connections that strengthen our brand and and make positive impacts through our 40,000 plus local businesses around the world. Our unwavering commitment to inclusion requires ongoing focus. While we recently evolved our approach, McDonald's commitment to inclusion is steadfast.\nAs I think about the road ahead for 2025, I'm reminded of a quote from our founder Ray Kroc. He said that the two most important requirements for major success are first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it. We believe no one is better positioned than McDonald's to seize on the opportunities ahead, face complexities head on. In the words of Ray, do something about it. We have all the tools we need to focus on what matters most to our communities and customers. As we look to 2025, we won't let up. We're playing to win. We have the right playbook in Accelerating the Arches. We have the right advantages. Our size, our scale, our brand relevance. We have the right mindset and a strong legacy of acting on our biggest and boldest ideas.\nWe have the power of our three-legged stool. Thank you to our remarkable franchisees, suppliers, and employees. Your dedication to our McFamily and the communities you serve is unparalleled. We are grateful for your passion and so very proud of our partnership together. I look forward to making the Arches shine even brighter in 2025 and beyond. With that, we'll take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and requeue for any additional questions.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur first question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning guys. Thank you. Wondering if you could talk a little.\nBit more about the early customer response.\nTo McValue, sort of if any updates?\nTo the latest on customer value perceptions in the US and if any thoughts?\nTo share sort of on the guest.\nCount check and margin impacts from the new platform. Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Good morning, Dennis. So we are, it's obviously early days still with McValue, but we're pleased with how it's getting out of the gates. One of the things that we're looking at is take rates. We look at take rates on the five dollar meal deal, we look at take rates on the buy one, add one for a dollar, and those take rates are very much in line with what our expectations were for that. So we're pleased with how that's getting out of the gate from a perception standpoint as we have increased our focus on value in the US starting last year when we did launch the $5 meal deal and then extending into Q1. I've been pleased to see that we're seeing our improvement in getting back to leadership.\nParticularly on the most recent visit with value and affordability. So I think we're seeing the customers giving us credit for the value programs that we have put in place there. So feel good about that and maybe just.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nDennis, I'll just build on Chris because you were asking about check and margins, and so I think, just talking specifically about the buy one, add one for $1, where I think we're seeing strong kind of check in those transactions. In fact, accretive to our overall check in transactions that have a buy one add one, in good margins obviously. And I think just building on what Chris was talking about, I mean I think consumers really appreciate the flexibility with that offer because it allows them to kind of build an outcome to what they want to get to from a product choice standpoint. I think the other thing I would just highlight is breakfast in particular. We've seen really strong take up of that offer, and breakfast has been a really strong day part for the US business through 2024.\nIt's an area where we're taking share. I think if you think ahead a little bit, this will be the 50th anniversary of breakfast in the US this year. I think there'll be some really kind of interesting and exciting things that the US business does over the next little while around breakfast. More to come on that later.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Just to maybe add one other thing to what Ian was talking about. If you look at the $5 Meal Deal, even though that's compelling value, it's driving other purchases. So the average check on $5 Meal Deal for us in the US is north of $10. So it's doing what we were hoping for when we launch that.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director and the Head of the Restaurants and Food Producers Team, Evercore\n\nThanks. A quick follow-up on that. In Q4, US comp reflected a negative check, slightly positive traffic. Could you give us a sense of price versus mix in the quarter and why? We saw what we saw there, and my main question is really on IOM, any color that you can offer there. A lot of brands, US brands, slowed in the back half of Q4 2023. Did you see an acceleration through Q4 2024? Better exit rate in key IOM markets. And I know you've been doing some tinkering with value relaunches in key IOM markets. Any color on that would be helpful, thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. I'll kind of just hit some high level comments, and then, as always, I'll let Ian give the details. You know, in the US, we were seeing, as you know, in early October, we were seeing strong performance in the US with both good check as well as positive GCs. And then, of course, we had the unfortunate E. coli incident. As you think about how then the quarter started to play out, we kind of hit our nadir in, I'd say, early November. And then we saw sequential improvement through the balance of the quarter, which has now continued into Q1. But what you're seeing is you're seeing that we are driving GCs and stealing share from a GC standpoint.\nBut not surprisingly, particularly now as we're into Q1 and we're launching, launching a broader McValue platform, GCS are running ahead of check and that's very much consistent with our experience. As you're putting in new value programs, you will see check run ahead of GCS. I think Joe or run ahead of check. I think Joe's talked about that in the past. And then as you get that sort of bedded down and you introduce food news and other things on top of that, you get the one, two punch of check plus. So that's what we're expecting in the US from IOM. You're right to acknowledge that we're seeing improving trends there, but it really is almost on a market by market basis there. So we've talked about for basically about a year some of the opportunities that we had in France.\nI've been very pleased to see how that French business has continued to improve their performance. That's continuing into Q1. So we feel good about France, we feel good about Canada, we continue to outperform in Germany, we continue to outperform in Italy. Our opportunities in IOM, the two markets that we are spending the most time thinking about right now are the UK and Australia where, one, it's both a challenged market and, two, frankly we're not performing to our full potential. So I'd say net net, on balance we're seeing IOM. I think you saw that in the results, but there's still work to do in a few of our specific markets.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nDavid, just, I'll just maybe double click on a couple things because Chris's response was pretty comprehensive. I think just maybe the reminder in the US and we talked about this in the Q3 call was pre food safety incident. You know, we were seeing almost kind of a middle single digit comp sale and comp traffic just below that. So I think that just is the reason I highlight that is because when we get kind of value driving momentum and then we start layering in kind of as we've talked about before, the full margin food news like the Chicken Big Mac in that instance or the, you know, the great marketing execution, you start driving volume and really profitable transactions. And that's where we at. We were at obviously the food safety incident had a disruptive impact on the US in the quarter.\nThere were a couple of specific things obviously that happened. First is you had an impact to Quarter Pounder sales which is a high margin, high check driving transaction item, and then obviously to kind of regain momentum, regain trust, obviously we invested a fair bit in value and affordability, and obviously in digital offers to get consumers back. And so that certainly I would call it where kind of time bound impacts on check through the quarter that we certainly would expect to dissipate as we get kind of momentum where we want it to be through Q1 this year on IOM. The only thing I'd add to what Chris said is I mean I think we're certainly, as you heard us in our upfront remarks, continuing to operate in uneven conditions.\nWe're really pleased, while we're really pleased with the progress that we've driven through the actions we've taken, in particular in areas like value and affordability. We're still dealing in a number of markets in our top markets where the industry is contracting. Our momentum is certainly moving in the right direction, as you heard from Chris. But it's still certainly; there's an element of headwind that we're continuing to navigate.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nAnalyst and Associate Director of Research, Baird\n\nHi, good morning. Just a clarification on how you're thinking about the US. I think you mentioned you expected a full recovery from the E. coli incident by the beginning of Q2. I guess, you know, one question is, you know, what's, you know, I guess what does that sort of mean in terms of kind of what type of comp momentum you're thinking, you know, once you get fully recovered and then I guess what's giving you the line of sight that.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, David. So, you know, on the US.\nRecovery from E. coli, I think right now what we're seeing is that the E. coli impact is now just localized to the areas that had the biggest impact. So think about that as sort of the Rocky Mountain Region, that was really the epicenter of the issue and that continues to be.\nDown versus where we were heading into that impact. But very much seeing it, at this point, as just contained to that region, whereas the rest of the US we don't see an impact on that. I think, importantly, what it gives us encouragement is we're looking at the trend in those affected areas, and that's what led to our comment around thinking that we'll have it behind us as we begin in Q2. Your point around what that actually means, it's going to be a function of us executing. So it's not just that we get E. coli behind us, but it goes to. We've got to make sure that we've got McValue off to a good start, and we've got to make sure that we have strong marketing programs along with food innovation that goes with that.\nI think what you see is that when we do that and we do that well, this business has the potential to be putting up both positive GCs as well as positive check, and ultimately that drives comp. So that's our expectation. That's the plan that we've put in place, which is if we execute that, we get this business, as I described in my comments, back to proper form.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAnd David, maybe just a couple of builds to Chris's comments. I mean, I think you heard us in our upfront remarks talk about the fact that we've recovered trust levels at a national basis back to where they were pre-incident level. We still got the isolated impacts that Chris talked about. And I think obviously what we're trying to do is get the US business back to the momentum that we were seeing to start Q4. I mean, we're very encouraged by the fact that as we talked about, we ended the year in December with positive, slightly positive comp guest counts in the US. We know on a Q4 total basis that we were taking comparable traffic share versus the industry still in the US.\nWe've still got, as Chris talked about, just I think a little more work to do to get that momentum kind of fully back to where we think it can be as we work through Q1.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nManaging Director and the Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks. I just wanted to sort of follow up, I guess, on check a little bit, which is you mentioned digital and loyalty growth is very strong. Those checks tend to be higher. But ultimately, I guess, same store sales growth was fairly muted. As you noted, there are lots of puts and takes. Perhaps breakfast has a negative check impact too. But I guess I'm trying to understand as you think about loyalty growth and digital orders, whether you would expect to see that materialize as an inflection in same store sales or how you're thinking about it. Because it does seem like we broadly see higher checks, but not necessarily.\nYou.\nNo, kind of a trajectory change. Then just quickly on the UK, you know, that's a market that has historically, I think, been very strong for McDonald's. So you know, is there anything to note there? Just, you know, it's negative or sort of talking it as a weak point surprised me a little bit.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, why don't I take the UK and then let Ian address the other question that you had, Sara. So I think in the UK if you think about this business, you're right, it's one that historically has performed quite well for us, been one of our strongest performers. I think what we've seen in the UK is certainly the consumer there is under pressure. There's a cost of living issue that exists in the UK that is putting pressure on the low-income consumers, consistent with what we've seen in the US, that's also putting pressure on families. We have a very big family business in the UK that has impacted us as families are looking to economize. That has an impact on us. And you have a very strong local competitor there who's been very aggressive from a value standpoint, particularly on breakfast.\nAnd so you put all those things together, and we're not seeing the UK business perform certainly at a level that we're used to historically. That said, we understand what needs to go in place, and there's been a lot of work with our local franchisees there to do that. It goes to making sure that we have a strong savers platform. That's been something that's been in the market for quite a while. We've introduced a GBP 5 meal deal similar to what we have in the US, and there's also been a focus on the Happy Meal program to reengage that family business. I think paired with that though is we need to have better marketing in the UK. I think we frankly didn't have the level of marketing execution in the back half of last year that we're used to.\nAnd so that's, I think, one of the big priorities for us as we head into 2025 is we've got to get that marketing to be kicking in so that we do have this one, two punch of being competitive on value, which I feel very confident we now have in the UK. But you've got to be able to pair that with strong marketing programs, strong food innovation that can give you that sort of full margin balance. We've run this playbook. Many of the things that I'm describing were the same issues that we faced in France. The progress and the momentum that we're seeing on the French business now is what gives us confidence that we'll be able to get to the same place in the UK, but certainly work to do in the UK.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nJust Sara, to circle back on your.\nNext question, and I'm going to exclude kind of the US, obviously the food safety kind of specific disruptions, which again are kind of temporary and time bound. I think more broadly, I mean obviously you've got a few things going on. I think with check you've got obviously pricing that's continuing to moderate because of the levels of inflation that are coming down. You've got us kind of making what I'll call some structural adjustments on value and affordability to ensure that we're kind of meeting the needs of consumer. That's having kind of a reset on check. But obviously I think when you get kind of past those adjustments, I mean, I think there's, we've got a lot of ability to kind of continue to drive strong check. And obviously we've got to start doing that by getting the right levels of momentum in the business.\nI mean, the US and kind of where we were pre food safety incident is, I think, the best demonstration of that. Again, if you think about where we were for the first three weeks of October with that kind of strong sales and then strong guest count build, obviously kind of building on each other as we've had momentum and then kind of layer in these exciting food or marketing events. France is another example, obviously, as you know from all the conversations we had on France throughout 2024, again, as we've started to see that kind of positive momentum come into effect. And then you look at Q4 where we had the Chicken Big Mac activation; we had this kind of Hot Ones, fiery sauce kind of activation, which were strong food events with great marketing execution.\nAgain, we were able to build both guest count and check volume. I think talking about digital, specifically digital certainly and loyalty in particular are going to be really important ways for us to continue to drive check. As you know, we've talked a lot about the fact that loyalty drives more visits and those customers spend more over time. As we are continuing to build new and incremental capabilities and sources of value for consumers, we know we're going to be able to get those customers to spend more as they visit us. So I think digital will be a really important component of how we drive check and frequency as we look forward.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nA quick one. Just, could you kind of spell out roughly where you'd expect unit growth to be in US vs IOM? I know you kind of gave it together, and then maybe just a broader question. How has new unit performance been? Obviously, you seem to have leaned into that even more so than you spoke about a little over a year ago, and you talked about kind of pulling forward some of that growth. But could you just comment on how you've seen that fared over the last year?\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYes.\nMorning, Brian. Well, I think on unit growth, we said we expect as a system about 2,200 gross openings and about a quarter of that to be in our wholly owned market. I would say of the quarter, about 70% of those openings would be in IOM and the rest roughly in the US. I mean, I think, as you heard us say, we hit our development plans in 2024 and you know, based on what we talked about at Investor Day, that we're kind of stepping up in our wholly owned markets to get to a gross opening rate of 1,000 units a year in 2027. So each year is kind of a continual step up. 2025 is a big step up over 2024. We feel confident about our pipelines.\nWe've done a lot of work, as you've heard us talk about previously, to identify where we need to be. We've done a lot of work to get the resourcing in place to build the pipeline, which obviously you need to do well in advance of kind of actually opening units. We feel good about the health of our pipeline. I think most importantly, obviously the quality of the openings we're seeing are kind of in line with our expectations. We're getting those kind of strong kind of starting year volumes and seeing those kind of first year returns in that low to mid, mid teens area where we expect them to be.\nKnowing that the vast majority of our new unit openings are freestanding drive throughs, we know those sites kind of build to their sweet spot over the first couple of years as they kind of establish their trading areas. So I think, you know, we're on pace. We're confident in getting to our 50,000 target by end of 2027 and obviously the wholly owned openings are really important part of that.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thank you very much. So it sounds like you're optimistic in the US about getting back to prior momentum. Good to hear about the return to positive comps internationally. Can you help level set how you're thinking about comps on a full year basis in the US and IOM, and then any color on progression through the year? What we should expect for Q1 sequential improvement? Thank you very much.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, morning, Lauren.\nLet me maybe give a bit of context there. Look, I think if you think about at least maybe pacing and progression through 25, I can comment a bit on that. I won't get into kind of specific comp numbers, but I think, you know, I think it's certainly reasonable to think of Q1 as kind of a low point quarter for the year. I mean there are some very, I think natural reasons for that. I mean we've got a leap year lapping which is obviously a negative headwind in Q1.\nI think we've certainly seen a sluggish start to the broader US industry in January in the US. I think if you think about everything that Chris and I have been talking about today, you've got our momentum kind of building on the back of the actions that we've put in place through 2024, particularly obviously in regards to value and affordability. Some of those actions I would say still going into place in a couple of markets through Q1. I think as we talked about in our opening remarks, I mean I do think we think the kind of operating conditions get kind of gradually and progressively better as we work through the year. So I think that's a bit of the color I would give you on, maybe texture.\nI mean, obviously, I think most importantly, as always, what we're focused on is what is within our control, which is obviously our Accelerating the Arches plan, the fundamentals around that, and kind of the MCD.\nLevers that underpin our strategic plan. I think we feel confident about the progress we're making and that we're doing everything we need to do to ensure that we're taking share consistently across all of our top markets, despite, I think, some of these more challenging conditions that we continue to navigate.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from John Ivanko with J.P. Morgan.\n\nJohn Ivanko\n\nManaging Director and Senior Restaurant Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thank you. We've been talking about Accelerating the Organization leading into Global Business Services for some time, and I understand the last couple of years there's a lot of work done beneath the surface on GBS specifically. You know, the thought that we would start to see some benefits in 2025 and 2026. It doesn't sound like we're going to see leverage in 2025 and 2026 based on, you know, your earlier comments. So I did just want, you know, you to address maybe reasons why we're not seeing some leverage given some of the restructurings that would happen is kind of the first point. And then secondly, you know, if you can talk about some of the qualitative improvements in the business that have come specifically through GBS that we could see potentially benefit the business into 2025 and 2026. Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHi, John. Well, you're right to acknowledge there's been a lot of work going on in getting this GBS organization set up. I'd say we certainly didn't expect to see us getting any of the benefits of that in 2024 or 2025 because we're very much in an investment phase. I don't think we communicated at all that we expected to see any benefit sort of in the early years of this. But the whole reason why we're doing this is of course because of the capabilities that we think it's going to bring as it comes more fully online in 2026 and then I think probably steady state in 2027. And it's the new capabilities paired with, I think, a much more efficient operating platform where you're going to start to see the benefits of that. So we're very much on track. We're pleased with all the work there.\nAs you, I'm sure, know from other organizations that you cover, setting these things up is a Herculean effort, and there's a lot of people involved in getting this done, but I'm pleased with where we're at. We're very much on track, but I don't expect to see in 2025 that you're going to be getting any material benefits out of this, which is very consistent with how we've built the whole business case on this. Ian, I don't know if you have anything to add.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, John, just maybe a couple of points of texture. You know, I think as Chris touched on, we're kind of in our peak investment years, 2025, 2026, and into frankly part of 2027, as you've heard me talk about before. We've kind of got four key work streams. We've got finance people, indirect sourcing, and then what we call data and analytics. We're pleased with the progress. But as Chris said, these things take time and effort. We certainly believe when we get past these kind of more significant investment years, we'll see substantive kind of efficiencies being driven. And I think maybe just to give you a bit of a kind of a textural example, we put kind of the first deployment of our people system in place.\nIn kind of 2024. It just goes to kind of the ways of working, which, if you remember, that was really about what Accelerating the Organization was about. It was about moving us from vertical to kind of horizontal ways of working across the organization. A small example would be, I think we've reduced the kind of time to hire for restaurant managers in Australia, which was one of the first markets to go live with our new people system by. So there'll be many examples like that just as we get to these kind of common systems and processes, and we remain really enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. But as Chris said, this obviously always takes a bit of time to kind of get to the full, to the full benefit.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add to what Ian just said is if you look at G&A, it's a percent of system-wide sales. We've been able to hold that constant in 2024 even as we're making all of these investments. And we're certainly looking to continue to stay very disciplined on our overall absolute G&A spend, with the potential over time as we bring these on to get further reductions on that as a percent of sales. So stay tuned. More to come on this.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nEric Gonzalez\n\nVice President and Senior Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nH2 2024 was difficult from a capital margin. Perspective into the fourth quarter, particularly challenging.\nWith the E. coli incident in the US and the traffic and check dynamics discussed earlier, I think you said you expect the capital margins to improve year over year in 2025 driven by top line growth beyond that recovery from E. coli. Can you discuss how much of that margin degradation that you saw in the second half is where you expect to get back, given the heavier emphasis on value and the value initiatives that you rolled out at the start of the.\nYear and what the drivers of that improvement will be?\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah, let me take that one, Eric. Well, look, I mean I think as you've heard me say previously, I think we remain really confident in our ability to kind of drive margin improvement over time as we get that stronger top line growth. So certainly nothing fundamentally has changed, I think in that regard. I mean, obviously as you highlighted, 2024 was clearly a year where we didn't get the strong top line growth that we need to kind of drive margin improvement. And I think that combined with kind of some of the inflationary pressure areas like food, paper, and labor, as well as what you highlighted, which is kind of are the mix shifts as we kind of get stronger value and affordability in place, certainly put pressure on margins through the course of the year. And then as you note in the U.S.\nWe had those specific impacts through Q4, which was obviously, as I talked about earlier, the kind of impact, specifically the Quarter Pounder sales, which is a very strong profitable margin item, and then the investments that we made in kind of customer recovery, which had impact. So I think, you know, I think the actions that we've taken across the business to get that really strong guest count momentum back in place combined with, as you always hear us talk about, then adding on kind of the full margin food news and the great marketing execution are what get us back to growing improvement. That's obviously what we're expecting in 2025, which is why we've said we expect margins to be slightly up from where they were in 2024 on a percentage basis.\nI think that's despite obviously the fact that there is kind of continued inflation pressure and more limited pricing ability in the current context. So I think we feel confident about getting momentum back, and it's obviously volume ultimately, and then that pairings for that kind of one-two punch that gives us confidence in our ability to grow margin in 2025 and then certainly beyond as we continue to get that strong top line growth.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nSenior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks, Ian. Just a good segue from the last question. Based on the McOpco disclosure, we're estimating about a 14% decline in US McOpco's 2024 store level cash flows. So I'm curious, first, that's a fair proxy for the owner operators in the past year. And then looking ahead, curious about your confidence in US store level cash flow growth in 2025, just as the industry does not appear to be backing down on value in 2025. Thanks.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, well I won't, Andrew, try and reconcile the numbers.\nI think the team can do that with you in follow-up just in where you're kind of getting your numbers from. But because there are a few things I think that are kind of moving within margin, including some kind of structural changes that I think you can give more texture to. But I think, you know, on a broad basis we feel, I mean there's certainly some pressure points in 2025 when you think about some of the inflationary headwinds, particularly in some of our European markets where there's a little bit more inflationary pressure on 2025 on food and paper, for example, beef prices.\nI think if we look at our plans in total across the majority of our markets, we certainly feel good that we can drive improvement to cash flow, and that will be based on obviously driving that strong top line volume and then obviously taking McOpco margin from a percentage basis up slightly versus where it was in 2024.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add is, certainly, we had a number of things in the US business that we were navigating last year. Inflation, investment in value, we had an E. coli. All that said, our US franchisees still achieved very strong cash flows north of half a million dollars per unit. So those businesses, that business continues to perform well. Franchisee cash flow continues to be strong, and as we get some of those headwinds behind us and hopefully back to stronger momentum, that obviously would work its way through to the bottom line.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from John Tower with Citi.\n\nJon Tower\n\nManaging Director and Senior Restaurant Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just curious, Chris. You outlined a number of the initiatives that you're going after in 2025 with respect to new product news and noticeably absent was any commentary regarding your beverage platform, specifically in the US. I know at your investor day in late 2023, there was a lot of discussion around McCafé and how large of a platform that is globally and the opportunity there to improve consistency across the globe. So I'm just hoping you can provide some color around where you see that platform going over time. And do you see that as a strategic opportunity over the next several years?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, John. Well, certainly we are very bullish on the opportunity in beverages. We think there's a lot of growth potential in beverages, both in coffee, the coffee side, whether it's hot or iced, but also in some of these other beverage areas that you're seeing emerging, like refreshers, like energy drinks, et cetera, et cetera. So a lot of opportunity in beverages, that industry is or that category is growing about 2x the rest of the business with very strong margins. So excited about that. As you noted at Investor Day, we talked about kind of going after it in a couple different ways, looking at how do we do that within the restaurant; that work continues. We also talked about a test that we're doing around this CosMc's brand that we put in Texas and looking at a number of stores there.\nI'd say that the learning with CosMc's continues. So you saw us announce a few months ago we're closing some stores, we're adding some stores. I think what we're learning there is that there's certainly an opportunity in that space. The smaller units tend to perform better. You want to drive through with that. Some of the things that we're closing were sort of end caps with no drive throughs. So I think we're continuing to learn there. And as we kind of further refine our plans, I think you'll hear more from us about how much of that opportunity needs to come through new units with something standalone like CosMc's or how much of the potential do we think we can capture by doing more within the existing restaurant.\nThere's a lot of work going to thinking about what we might be able to do to capture that opportunity in the current restaurant. Our focus is still very much on it, but I don't have a whole lot more new news to share on that at this point.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWe have time for one more question with Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nManaging Director and Senior Restaurant Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just a question on the US commentary that's been made on the call. I think you mentioned at one point seeing sequential improvement in the US comp since the trough with E. coli in November. Yet I know in response to a different question, you said that you'd notice maybe a sluggish start to 2025 for the QSR segments. I was wondering first and foremost whether you can comment on whether or not that sluggish start is really weather led or whether you think there's some maybe change in consumer behavior in recent weeks or the past month or two. And I know separately you mentioned new product news. So I'm just wondering if there's any color you can share on the Snack Wrap relaunch timing. And I think you mentioned something about chicken strips. So any color on those two new products.\nThe future seem like exciting new news would be great. Thank you, Chair Powell.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident, Chairman, and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Jeff, for the question. So I think yes, we were seeing improvement certainly from kind of the trough of where we were with E. coli. I think the important thing to just recognize in the US is broadly both in Q4, but frankly it continues into Q1.\nThe overall market is pretty muted, and a big part of that.\nSort of, I think more mixed consumer is still at that low income consumer. So if you look at the low income consumer in the US, and I'm talking industry numbers right now, but that low income consumer in the US in Q4 was still down double digits. And as you know, that low income consumer is overweighted in the industry relative to the US in total. If you think about middle and higher income, a very robust consumer in those things in those areas. So you know, I think that's the landscape that we're looking to navigate through. It's why it's so important that we make sure that we have a strong value program, which is the focus in Q1 in getting McValue launched.\nAnd then, as you alluded to, we do have, I think, some very exciting food news, food innovation coming in the US, but my US team would kill me if I gave any more details about the when and the exact specifics of how we're going to plan on doing that, but certainly expect that to come online later in the year. Ian, I don't know if you have anything else to add.\n\nIan Borden\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWell, just, I think just double clicking on what Chris already talked about, Jeff, which is sequential improvement, and I think goes back to what we've talked a fair bit about is obviously what we're focused on is what we can control, which is our share performance. Obviously we continue to grow share from a traffic standpoint, but as Chris said, the industry is still seeing a fair bit of headwind, and that's certainly what we were giving an indication of in terms of January. So even though we may continue, we expect to continue to grow share. I think the industry itself has certainly had a sluggish start, and that's certainly, as Chris said, partly due to that lower income consumer, although we continue to do well with lower income consumers.\nIn fact, Q4 was our high point for 2024 in terms of share with that particular consumer group, even though they are under a fair bit of pressure, as you heard from Chris. So that's just a bit of texture.\nMaybe to kind of put the context.\nOf our comments together.\n\nScott Meader\n\nInterim Treasurer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOkay, that concludes our call. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Ian. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation investor call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions.\nPlease limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning last year, we warned of a more discriminating consumer, particularly among lower-income households. As this year progressed, those pressures have deepened and broadened. The QSR sector has meaningfully slowed in the majority of our markets, and industry traffic has declined in major markets like the US, Australia, Canada, and Germany. In several markets, we also continue to be negatively impacted by the war in the Middle East. These external pressures certainly weighed on our performance for the quarter, with declines in comparable sales globally and across each of our segments.\nThere were also factors within our control that contributed to our underperformance, most notably our value execution. For 70 years, McDonald's has defined value in our industry, and we are taking meaningful actions across the world to assert our leadership.\nThe hallmark of a great company is its ability to perform in good times and in bad, and we are resolved to reignite share growth in all our major markets, regardless of the prevailing market conditions. This won't happen overnight, but it will happen. The unique competitive advantages of McDonald's afford us many levers to pull, and we have the financial wherewithal to sustain our investments as needed. One area of strength is our restaurant teams, who continue to execute with excellence to serve our customers and local communities.\nCreating a better customer experience has delivered operational improvements, improved service times, and increased customer satisfaction across most of our major markets. It's this relentless focus on execution that will give customers more reasons to visit our restaurants more frequently. Leaning into the power of our core menu also leads to outstanding execution in our kitchens.\nOur deployment of Best Burger is a great example of this. Now deployed in over 80% of markets, the training and focus on the basics ensures we deliver the gold-standard product our customers expect, which is driving elevated taste and quality perceptions. We remain on track to have Best Burger deployed in nearly all markets by the end of 2026. And as we announced late last year, we continue to innovate across our core menu to address unmet customer needs with a more satiating burger that will provide great value for money.\nThis new burger, which we're piloting across three international markets this year, includes two beef patties perfectly layered with melting cheese, crispy toppings, and a tangy McDonald's sauce. It's a quintessential McDonald's burger with a twist on our iconic familiar flavors.\nNamed the Big Arch, we plan to test and learn through the end of the year to gather learnings before scaling more broadly internationally. We continue to have a significant opportunity for growth in chicken, a category that's twice the size of beef globally and growing at a faster rate. By featuring our beloved icons like McNuggets and McChicken while driving growth in emerging favorites like McCrispy and McSpicy, our chicken sales are now on par with beef sales.\nThe McCrispy chicken sandwich is now offered in more than 55 of our markets around the globe, and through our plans to further expand our McCrispy equity, we will continue to capture chicken market share. As we continue to build on our $17 billion brand across our core menu, our digital penetration also continues to grow.\nLoyalty membership has now reached 166 million members, pacing ahead of expectations as we work towards our ambition of 250 million members, and identified users now represent 25% of system-wide sales. We know that engaged loyalty customers spend more and visit more often, and as a result, we're driving digital market share gains and continuing to build on our understanding of customer preference, personalization, and behaviors. But as I said in my opening, we recognize that in several large markets, including the US, we have an opportunity to improve our value execution.\nConsumers still recognize us as the value leader versus our key competitors, but it's clear that our value leadership gap has recently shrunk.We are working to fix that with pace. Over the last several years, our system has sustained significant inflationary cost increases ranging from 20% to 40%, depending on the market.\nAs we absorb these cost increases in partnership with our franchisees, we look for ways to protect restaurant profitability via productivity efforts and selective price increases. These price increases disrupted long-running value programs and led consumers to reconsider their buying habits. In some markets like Germany, Spain, and Poland, the flexibility of their value programs like McSmart have allowed them to quickly make adjustments that were embraced by consumers and drove market share gains. In other markets like the US, with their Dollar 123 value program, a more comprehensive rethink has been required.\nOur US President, Joe Erlinger, is on the call and will share more about our plans in just a minute. The point is, we know how to do this. We wrote the playbook on value, and we are working with our franchisees to make the necessary adjustments. McDonald's competitive strengths are formidable and growing.\nOur brand is as strong as ever. Yet again, Kantar recognized McDonald's as the world's fifth most valuable brand and the number one most valuable non-tech brand. We're executing with excellence, and our restaurant operations are an area of strength. Our digital footprint within the industry is unmatched and growing as we build one of the world's largest loyalty programs. We're flexing our investment muscle to accelerate new restaurant openings as we also build consumer, restaurant, and company technology platforms that will drive cost efficiencies and accelerate innovation.\nWe do not take these advantages for granted, however, and we are committed to delivering for our customers and shareholders every day. Where our customers tell us we have value opportunities, we will address them.\nListening to customers and staying agile led to the development of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, and I'm confident that it remains the right playbook for our business. Continued focus on gold-standard execution and our growth pillars are the right actions to grow market share and return to restaurant traffic growth. To share more on the US segment, I'll now hand it over to Joe.\n\nJoe Erlinger\n\nPresident of McDonald's USA, McDonald's\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning. It's been a few years since I've participated in a McDonald's earnings call, and I want to start by reflecting a bit about the progress McDonald's USA has achieved since that call back in 2021. Over the past three years, we've significantly moved the needle in several areas, like loyalty, which has grown to over 20% of our US System-wide Sales and over 37 million 90-day active users. We've also improved our chicken market share with the launch of McCrispy.\nAs I said then, it was the accumulation of our decisions, grounded in our values, that continued to keep the McDonald's brand relevant for our customers and meaningful for our people, providing a strong foundation for future growth. That continues to be our approach as we're now focused on raising the bar on our customer experience, considering our customers' current reality.\nSince the very beginning, and Chris touched on this earlier, we've earned our success through excellent QSCV: quality, service, cleanliness, and value. As we've evolved our approach time and again over the years to match the changing expectations of our customers, we continue to deliver an exceptional customer experience today. In this last quarter, McDonald's USA delivered its highest-ever year-to-date customer satisfaction score. While I'll share more about the $5 Meal Deal in a moment, both the Bacon Cajun Ranch McCrispy and Grandma McFlurry promotions drove sales, along with cultural buzz and brand relevance.\nAll said, our business performance reflects industry-wide challenges and the current context, one where customers are making thoughtful choices about when and where they eat. While we always work hard to provide value to our customers, they're telling us that they want to see and experience even more value from McDonald's.\nAnd we're listening as we remain laser-focused on providing great value to our fans this summer and beyond. So we tapped into ideas that already exist within our system. Our restaurants in upstate New York had been running a local $5 Meal Deal that was highly successful, performing well with lower-income customers and driving overall incremental sales. By leveraging learnings from within our own system, we brought this to life for customers across the US.\nWe've seen a lot of enthusiasm, and the number of $5 Meal Deals sold is above expectations. Trial rates of the deal are highest among lower-income consumers, and sentiment towards the brand around value and affordability has begun to shift positively. To date, 93% of our restaurants in the US have committed to extending the offer even further into the summer. And there are other ways customers can experience great value at McDonald's.\nWe continue to provide a steady stream of offers on the mobile app, including nationwide Free Fry Fridays, where you can get a free medium fry every Friday with any $1 purchase on the app. As we work through the important details of a future US value platform, we will continue to make decisions grounded in insights with the customer at the center. At the end of the day, we expect customers will continue to feel the pinch of the economy and a higher cost of living for at least the next several quarters in this very competitive landscape.\nWe believe it's critical for us to consider these factors in order to grow market share and return to sustainable guest count-led growth for the brand. McDonald's is uniquely positioned to succeed in this environment, given our size, scale, and competitive advantages. We have a fully modernized restaurant estate.\nWe have a simplified menu that focuses on our core while never shying away from bringing back fan favorites at the right times or pursuing the right new product innovations. We have built one of the largest loyalty programs in the industry, and we're continuing to lead with a long-term mindset, making decisions that meet our customers where they are and where they need us right now, while also plotting a path for sustained success. Now I'll turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned at the top of the call, despite the very real near-term challenges facing the sector, we remain confident that our long-term strategy, rooted in customer insights and built on our inherent competitive advantages, is right for our business. When we combine deep insights with the power of our brand, we tap into what our customers love most about McDonald's: connecting with them on an emotional level through celebrating the rituals and memories that make our brand so special.\nAt the heart of our brand are our local communities and the customers we serve each and every day. Strong restaurant-level execution against our MCD growth drivers, coupled with compelling value, will be critical to giving customers more reasons to visit McDonald's more often.\nAs you heard from Chris and Joe, we're delivering higher customer satisfaction and improved service times across most of our major markets. Our MCD's are deeply interconnected, and it's at the intersection of our growth drivers that we continue to deepen our relationships with customers and create a consistent and enjoyable restaurant experience while offering the delicious and affordable food they love. As Chris mentioned, we still have an opportunity to strengthen our holistic value proposition across markets, and we recently met with each of our largest markets.\nWe're ensuring that we have a winning value offering that is front and center in every discussion. We're taking a forensic approach to evaluating our offerings and acting with urgency and agility to implement solutions to deliver against customer expectations.\nGermany has continued their holistic approach to value with a 360-degree affordability strategy, including McSmart at the center, and are consistently driving elevated levels of customer awareness. This is a best-in-class example of listening to the customer, designing a program that meets them where they are, and ultimately delivering incremental sales, customer satisfaction, and market share gains. As we scale best practices across the system, markets like France and Australia have adopted their own version of the McSmart platform, and early results have been encouraging.\nIn May, the UK offered smaller, more affordable bundles of their own with their three for three pounds mix-and-match menu that resonated with customers looking for more affordable options.\nTo address an opportunity to offer more compelling value at breakfast, which remains the fastest-growing day part in the market, the Canadian market recently launched a new price-pointed beverage value, offering our customers the coffee they love every day starting at just CAD 1. McDonald's has long been an affordable destination for communities to come together and share a meal, but it's always been about more than just price.\nThis quarter, we continue to elevate the experience, combining our delicious food with unique mobile app and in-restaurant experiences, ultimately delivering value, however, and whenever customers decided to order and enjoy their McDonald's favorites. Germany leaned into the Easter holiday with a fun and interactive calendar promotion where customers enjoyed a daily deal available exclusively in the mobile app.\nFrom discounts on our most iconic menu items like the Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets to unique meal deals, the promotion drove remarkable engagement and significant growth in loyalty sales. Italy drove traffic to our restaurants with Summer Days, a similar seasonal calendar campaign featuring a variety of exciting meal bundles. A local favorite, the Frequent Fryer program, returned to the Canadian market this quarter.\nTo engage loyalty members with a new approach to gamification, the market launched a nationwide scavenger hunt for fry icons, which could then be entered on the mobile app for free loyalty points or free fries. Nearly 3.5 million codes were entered throughout the promotion, driving meaningful lifts to the fry category.\nEven with strong execution against our Accelerating the Arches growth drivers, performance this quarter reflects a pressured industry landscape in the US as well as across many of our largest international markets. Our international operated market comps were negative, reflective of this broad-based pressure where customers continue to be more intentional with the dollars they spend, and performance in France.\nIn our IDL segment, positive comp sales in Latin America and Japan were offset by the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East and a less confident consumer in China. Despite the pressured top-line growth we've discussed this morning, we drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.97 for the quarter, a decrease compared to the prior year of about 5% in constant currencies.\nThis was primarily due to a higher effective tax rate of nearly 21% for the quarter, elevated interest expense as expected, and less other non-operating income due partially to lower interest income. Top-line results generated over $3.5 billion of restaurant margins for the quarter, and a year-to-date adjusted operating margin of over 46%, highlighting the durability of our business model. This was offset by higher G&A due to continued investments in digital and technology, as well as enterprise transformation efforts, and costs associated with our biennial worldwide convention.\nAs we've talked about before, driving long-term growth requires making the right strategic and forward-looking investments, and we are committed to continuing to invest in our platforms and growth drivers while relentlessly prioritizing current-year run-the-business spend. While we expect industry challenges to persist, we believe we are well-positioned with the unique size and scale that only the McDonald's system can provide.\nThere remains significant power in focusing on what's within our control, offering our customers delicious food at unparalleled value and convenience that will drive future market share gains and guest count growth. With this as our North Star, we believe we're poised to deliver long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now, as most of you know, this is Mike's last earnings call with McDonald's. So before I close, I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Mike for his significant contributions to our brand.\nHe served as a trusted advisor to our senior leadership team by playing a key role in developing and communicating our strategy. Mike has been at McDonald's almost as long as I have, and his deep knowledge of our business and ability to foster relationships with stakeholders has been invaluable to me, especially as I've taken on the role as CFO.\nOn behalf of everyone at McDonald's, Mike, thank you. We wish you all the best for the future. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nThanks, Ian. Earlier this month, we brought leaders together to discuss our goals and objectives as we further establish McDonald's as a leading global consumer brand. As a team, we are committed to act with urgency, cementing our value leadership, growing share in areas like chicken, and bolstering loyalty through digital customer acquisition, adoption, and retention on a global scale.\nAnd we are continuing to lean into our three pillars, MCD, as our blueprint and engine for growth while leveraging technology to transform how we operate across all platforms. Even as the world around us continues to change, we know the power of the McDonald's brand will prevail. We're digital forward, values-driven, and culture-led, and we'll continue to reinvent ourselves to meet our customers and restaurant teams where they are today and where they're going tomorrow.\nWith more than 40,000 locations across the globe, we uphold a presence that we believe few in our industry could ever hope to match. We offer the best franchising opportunity in the world, offering a familiar beacon of support for the over 40,000 communities where we live, work, and serve. We're just getting started. We're making progress towards our ambition of 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027. When we combine our strategy with great value and high-level execution, we are confident we will further our leadership position.\nAs I close, I want to extend a sincere thank you to our franchisees, suppliers, and employees around the world for their continued resilience and unwavering commitment to serving our customers and local communities. With that, we'll begin Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur first question is from John Ivankoe with J.P Morgan.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thank you very much. Certainly, McDonald's has access to consumer data, consumer information that almost no corporation in the world does. And when I consider six months ago, 12 months ago, it was fairly well known the restaurant industry would see a fairly wide pricing gap versus grocery, and many consumers would have drawn down their excess savings from COVID, that we would be in an environment where value, quite frankly, would be more necessary.\nSo I just wanted to get a sense of really what changed so significantly from the consumer's perspective relative to your expectations in the last six to 12 months, and if I can, how McDonald's kind of pivots itself from being reactionary from a value perspective, from a consumer trend perspective, to more anticipating changing needs before they happen as opposed to after. Thank you so much.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nHi, John. Thanks for the question. You're right in that last year, you may remember we were talking about there being pressure on the consumer and particularly that low-income consumer. That was notable in a few of our major markets. What has happened in the intervening period of time is that we've seen more markets have this same sort of slowdown. It is certainly most pronounced with that low-income consumer, but we're also seeing an impact with larger groups, particularly around families in Europe, that we're seeing this as people are just looking to economize.\nYou're also right that we're looking at a continued gap between food at home and food away from home inflation. The gap is about 3% right now or 300 basis point gap between the two. So you are seeing consumers being much more discretionary as they treat restaurants.\nYou're seeing that the consumer is eating at home more often. You're seeing more deal-seeking from the consumer. And you're just seeing, I think, a trade-down even within either units per transaction or within mix. All of those things for us are indicators that the consumer across a number of these markets is being very discriminating. And I would point out consumer sentiment in most of our major markets remains low.\nSo your point around how do we make sure that we're anticipating where these customers are going and what the value is required, I think is a fair question. And what we've done is, in a number of places, you've seen us and heard us talk about what we're doing with McSmart, what we're doing with McSaver, some of the things that we've put in place in the US.\nBut I think it's also clear to us that in several markets, in a number of markets, that you need to have a broader value platform and that trying to move the consumer with narrow offerings that are one item or a few items is just not sufficient for the context that we're in. And so what's going on in markets around the world is looking at how do we further broaden what some of the value platform offerings could be as we also perhaps look for other places that we can dial down.\nThat conversation, as you know, with our franchisees takes a moment. It's not something that happens immediately, but I would say that there's good recognition across our franchisee base that we need to be providing value. We need to be providing a broader level of value.\nAnd at the same time, we've got a lot of other levers. So this is not all about value. We've got levers around what we can do from a menu standpoint. We've got some great equities that we need to be driving there. And there's more we need to be doing from a marketing standpoint and stepping up on marketing. So I'd say the changes that we're working on and talking about with our markets, yes, it's around value. It's making sure that as we're facing certainly a more difficult environment than even what we anticipated last year, that we've got that value offering, but we're also using the other things that are at our disposal to get this business back to where we know it should be performing.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nRestaurant and Food Analyst, Evercore\n\nThanks. Congratulations, Mike. Thank you for your help all through the years. As far as my question, I guess I'd like to focus on the IOM countries. How do the challenges in your key markets differ from the US in terms of market share versus the informal eating-out sales trends? In the US, it feels like McDonald's is still in a state of searching and perhaps negotiating to find the right value message ahead of menu news that might happen later.\nAre you at a similar stage of searching and perhaps negotiating with franchisees about value overseas? Where are you in terms of how satisfied you are where you are in terms of the value message? Thanks so much.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. Thanks, David. I'll have Ian start, and then if there's anything I need to add, I'll do that. But Ian, I'll let you start.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Morning, David. Thanks for the question. Look, I mean, I'll just start, I think, with a bit of context, which is, as you heard Chris in his opening remarks talk about, I mean, I think the pressures on the industry and consumers that we're seeing are broad-based in nature. And I think if you look across our IOM markets, which you will know historically, I think we've had a real strength to our system.\nI think that external pressure has heightened, and I think certainly gotten more significant in several of those markets through Q2. And so I think it's still what I'll call an evolving situation. We've talked a lot about value and affordability over the last couple of quarters.\nAs you know, we've kind of highlighted McSmart, which is an entry-level affordable meal option that we put in place in Germany at the beginning of 2023. Germany has been consistently one of our most strongly performing markets, even in a much more difficult context over the last couple of quarters in the marketplace. I think part of it is just the evolution of what's happening with the consumer, what's happening with the industry. I think we have strong alignment engagement with our franchisees across our international markets.\nI think we're working very collaboratively and constructively to get the right programs and platforms in place from a value and affordability standpoint. I think part of it's just been the landscape and the consumer is evolving, and those platforms and offers have needed to be sharpened and I think better positioned to be delivering in the current context.\nAnd so I think we're moving with speed and pace, as you've heard us talk about before. But the environment, I think, has been changing, and context has been evolving. And I think we're just trying to get ahead of that, as we've talked about in kind of our opening remarks. Yeah. What I would just add is if you look at our IOM markets, the good news is if you think about Germany with McSmart, you've got Canada with McPicks, you've got the UK with Saver's Menu, Australia has McSmart and also Loose Change Menu, France has McSmart. We have the value platform established in those markets, and there's good consumer awareness of those value platforms.\nThe work that's underway, and Ian alluded to this, is making sure that underneath those value platforms, that we have the right items at the right price points to reflect where the market's at today. So there are markets like the UK, for example, where they're making changes to the menu in France as well. They're adding a EUR 4 Happy Meal. There's changes that are happening underneath those value menus to make sure that we are appropriately positioned for what we see now as the market context.\nBut the fact that we have those menu platforms established, that there's good awareness on those, I feel like that is a positive versus in the US, where obviously they're starting to do a little bit more work about what the long-term value platform is going to look like.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Brian Harbor with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on digital, right? Because obviously, it's continued to grow. You've continued to add members. And there's actually a lot of really good value available on that platform. But it hasn't really offset some of the sales challenges that you're seeing right now. So I guess, what gives you kind of the confidence that that could change, or what do you think needs to be done differently there? Do you think it's kind of resonating, and is that a place to continue to drive value going forward?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. It's a great question. We feel really good about our digital business, and we're seeing strong performance on the digital business, as I alluded to in the opening. I think the challenge on digital right now is basically only about 25% of our customers are on digital in terms of identified customers. So as you think about what you need to do to drive the overall business, we just don't have digital yet at the size and with the penetration that's needed to move the entire business.\nI think some of what has happened as you sort of look at things is we probably were a little over-rotated on digital versus broad everyday value that we're offering, available to all consumers, those who maybe aren't yet on our digital platform. That's the work that's underway.\nI think in time, certainly, as you know, digital is going to continue to grow for us. We're going to get more and more customers on our digital platform. I think in a couple of years' time, particularly as you get to 250 million users, it's a different conversation about how digital can drive value. Today, we just don't have the penetration where we need it to be to move to 75% of the business that's not on digital. So that's the value work that we just have been talking about.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nSenior Analyst, Baird\n\nHi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions on the US value initiatives. First, I was hoping you could elaborate on the effectiveness of the $5 Meal Deal that you're running and whether you're seeing the sales or traffic inflection you had anticipated from that program. And then secondly, I think, Chris, you mentioned it's necessary to have more of a platform idea in all of your key markets. And I'm just wondering, in the US, how those conversations are going with franchisees and whether franchisees are supportive of a broader national value platform and when that might happen. Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nHey, thanks, David. Appreciate the questions. Relative to the $5 meal deal, it's really performed and done exactly what we wanted it to do. First, we wanted to see a change and improved brand perceptions around value and affordability, and it's done that. We wanted to make sure that it connected with the single user, especially the lower-income consumer. We've seen that through increasing trial rates by that consumer base. Our two lowest-income cohorts, the under-$45,000 cohort and the $45,000 to $75,000 cohort, saw an increasing trial and participation around the $5 meal deal throughout the life of the promotion, which was incredibly encouraging.\nThen lastly, obviously, we wanted to see a shift in guest counts to drive both the short- and long-term health of the business. Ultimately, I believe in guest count-led growth. While it's begun to do that, it hasn't yet translated into sales.\nThe average check, though, has been over $10 for the $5 Meal Deal. So we do feel comfortable about the add-on that's happening as part of that program. Relative to the longer-term platform, obviously, this is a big investment for us and our franchisees. When you think about the Dollar Menu, which existed for over 10 years, and when you think about Dollar Menu $1, $2, 3$, that's been in place now for over six years, we just need to be very thoughtful and considerate as we work through what our national everyday value and affordability platform will be.\nThat work is happening in good partnership with our franchisees. And so we're comfortable that we'll get to the right answer. There's no question that the franchisees see the impact and the importance of a national everyday value and affordability platform. And so we're working through that at pace with them.\nIn the meantime, obviously, we're continuing to offer consumers great value with the $5 Meal Deal extending in 93% of our restaurants into August. And we're working with our franchisees to extend that even longer. We continue to offer great value via the app, which Chris just talked about a bit. And we also continue to have a lot of local deals at what we call our business unit level. So we'll continue to squarely offer our consumers value throughout the summer and into the fall.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the sort of margin implications and, in particular, maybe talk about whether you'll need additional franchisee support for either US or IOM. Specifically, I know we seem to be seeing actually some deflation in some beef trimming and other cuts, which is very different from what we have been seeing. So to the extent that you are offering more value, you'll have a permanent value platform. Is some of that funded by lower input costs, such that maybe there's less margin pressure, or is that something that you'll have to address with franchisees.\nI know in IOM markets, you had given some franchisee support. I'm not sure where that stands now. But is there any contemplation of, again, investing either behind franchisee or perhaps contributing to marketing funds? Anything from McDonald's corporate to help, I guess, lessen the burden? Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nMorning, Sara its Ian. I'll start, and then I think maybe Chris or Joe might jump in at the end. Look, I mean, I think, as you said, from a margin pressure standpoint, I mean, obviously, the top-line performance has been more muted, so that obviously creates a level of pressure. But I think if you use kind of our McOpCo margins as a bit of a proxy, you would have seen that they held up pretty well through the quarter simply because, as you noted, we're certainly seeing much lower levels of inflation in areas like food and paper, which are down at the kind of low single-digit level.\nI mean, obviously, labor inflation, particularly in the US, is a little higher still, especially with some of the minimum wage changes in places like California.\nI think in terms of just kind of maybe kind of trying to answer the broader part of your question, I mean, value and affordability is kind of a fundamental part of our business model. I think our owner-operators understand that and obviously understand that that's something strategically that we always need to have in place. As you would have heard us talk previously about, I mean, we don't subsidize pricing. We want to get to the right outcomes and do that in a way that it's going to be sustainable and profitable for both our operators and for McDonald's.\nI think over time, we know that strong affordability and value is what drives volume-led growth, as you heard Joe touch on. Volume, obviously, is ultimately what drives sustainable profit and cash flow for the business and for the system.\nI think as we get some of these ideas in place, obviously, we want to bring them to life in creative and effective ways. We're going to put all of the resources of our system against making sure that we execute this and put ourselves in a position to win in a difficult environment. But I may just kind of let Joe or Chris weigh in.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. I would just add, I mean, our franchisees in the US are in a very strong financial position. So they have the financial firepower, both in terms of cash flows as well as equity, to make investments. They can make those investments across their P&L. If you actually look at gross margin in the 20 years pre-COVID, we're actually at a high right now versus those 20 years.\nWe feel very good about the ability of our franchisees to invest via their P&L or otherwise. We are working through with them right now a look at the overall profitability of the $5 meal deal. We think they've got the ability to invest. We're comfortable with the position in the US.\n\nJoe Erlinger\n\nPresident of McDonald's USA, McDonald's\n\nYeah. My only add is I just would underline the word that Ian used, which is sustainable. We're only interested in doing things that are sustainable strategies that we can continue. That's going to be our guide as we think about where we need to go on these things. There is a lot of, I think, strength within our system, financial strength within our system to implement the necessary changes, but they have to be sustainable for us.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nEquity Research, UBS\n\nThank you. And thanks, Mike, for all your help. Best of luck. I wanted to focus again on the meal deal. Appreciate all the insights there. Specifically, as it relates to customer awareness in the US of the meal deal and sort of thinking about the marketing message or the marketing intensity, is that something you could help frame up for us where it is right now? Is it something that ramps and kind of related? Just thinking about the timeline generally from a new marketing, a new value platform, or a new bigger value offer to guest count contribution. Is there a way historically in an environment like this to kind of think about how that timeline looks? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. I think what we're learning from this is the power of our national voice at McDonald's. As we exited 2023, we looked at the value that we had at a local level and felt very comfortable that that value was compelling. But what we lacked was obviously a strong national voice. And it took us some time to work with our franchisees to achieve that national voice.\nAnd as we talked about, the $5 Meal Deal is something that already existed in upstate New York. And when you look at when we applied that national voice, what happened in upstate New York, which had already had the deal, trial and participation rates actually doubled in upstate New York. And so you also see then the power of the actual message, the importance of a message actually being price-pointed.\nAs you know, we have a BOGO, a buy one, get one promotion that we've run in January. We saw trial and participation rates for the $5 Meal Deal 70% greater than that January buy one, get one window. So that is the power of national marketing, the awareness that that brings. I won't get into specific numbers around awareness, but certainly, when we launch our new national everyday value and affordability platform, building awareness of that platform will be absolutely critical, just like we've done, obviously, in the past with Dollar Menu $1, $2, 3$, and the Dollar Menu.\n\nJoe Erlinger\n\nPresident of McDonald's USA, McDonald's\n\nMy only add on the pace question is that ultimately is on us. There's nothing externally that drives the pace. It's all an internal thing. So we've seen in some markets like France, for example, where there's strong alignment, we can move very quickly.\nIn other places, it requires more conversations because of the breadth of the changes. But at the end of the day, we've shown the capacity to move quickly. And my hope would be certainly that in a market like the US, I think Joe and the team are having great discussions with franchisees about the importance of getting to that value platform that we've talked about.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just looking outside the US, perhaps, I was hoping to touch on France and China. France, I'm just wondering if you think it's more of a McDonald's-specific issue, which I think is what maybe you referred to in the past, versus a macro issue and how you view the competition there. And then in China, I know you mentioned that consumers are less confident. I'm just wondering if you're seeing anything to give you pause on an otherwise aggressive unit growth outlook or maybe a change in strategy, whether you're seeing any US brand pushback or anything along those lines would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Well, starting with France, certainly what we've seen in France has been a slowdown. But I think you're also accurate in reflecting that the fact is we're losing share in France. And that suggests to me that there is still an opportunity for us to improve our performance. A couple of things for us. One that we've talked about in the past has been it is a very competitive market right now. We're seeing a competitor there who's being aggressive on pricing.\nCertainly, that's one element. And I've talked about some of the things we're doing to enhance our McSmart menu to make sure that we're competitive on pricing. Second, because France has such a meaningful business with families. Families is a key consumer for us over there. That's where they're coming back with the EUR 4 Happy Meal. So that's addressing the family issue.\nAnd then we are also looking at what can we be doing to make sure that we're engaging with customers around where our brand is positioned. France is one of the markets that has a higher Muslim population. And so when you think about the Middle East, the impact that we're seeing in France has been more than maybe in other markets because of that population. So there's a lot that the team is looking at doing on how do we make sure we're telling our story from a marketing standpoint at the local level.\nBut I think it's fair to say that we have an opportunity to get back to share growth in France. The market has slowed down, but the market is still delivering modest, very small growth. And we want to participate more in that.\nIn the case of China, China is a very competitive environment right now. As you've seen from a number of other consumer companies, it is highly promotional. Consumer sentiment in China is quite weak. You're seeing both in our industry and across a broad range of consumer industries, the consumer being very, very much deal-seeking. In fact, we're seeing a lot of switching behavior in terms of just consumers, whatever's the best deal, that's where they end up going. Positively in that environment, one, we're holding share.\nOur business in China is holding share. The second thing that I would say is that we are still seeing good returns on our new unit openings. From our vantage point, a lot of runway around growth on new units. We are laser-focused on the returns that we get from new units.\nIf those were to ever dip below what we would consider to be an acceptable return threshold, we would certainly relook at our opening pace in China. But right now, what we're seeing is that the returns on new openings are holding up. And so from our vantage point, the 1,000 restaurants per year pace that we've been on, we're still working toward that number in 2024.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nJeff, I might just hook on to Chris because I just want to, I know you were asking about France, but I think it is important just to kind of reinforce a little bit of what we touched on earlier, which is, I mean, I think the external trends and pressures that we're seeing on the industry, on the consumer, I think are broad-based across IOM.\nI think consumers are being, as you've heard us say earlier, more discerning about where, when, and what they eat. And I would say we don't expect significant changes in that environment for the next few quarters. So obviously, as you've heard us talk a lot about, we're kind of laser-focused on this forensic review of kind of our value and affordability positioning in each of our key markets. We're going to position ourselves to win. And we're moving, I think, with a sense of urgency, but obviously at the pace to get that right.\nAnd as you've heard us talk a lot about, we've got the system strength and know-how to put us in that winning position. I would just say I think the third quarter has certainly started similarly to how the second quarter ended.\nWe're seeing, I think, negative comp trends across IOM and, frankly, across each of our three operating segments.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\n\nEric Gonzalez\n\nSenior Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I'm just curious about trade down. In the past, McDonald's was thought of as a defensive option because in economic downturns, it would pull share from more expensive categories. So I'm just curious why you think you might not be getting the trade down that you depended on in the past and whether that's a function of value perception or something that can be addressed with a new value construct. Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. Thanks, Eric. Well, I think we are seeing trade down, but what we're seeing is that the loss of the low-income consumer is greater than the trade down benefit. And so you're seeing with that low-income consumer, in many cases, they're dropping out of the market, eating at home, and finding other ways to economize, cutting down on trips. So we are seeing the benefit of trade down, but it's just not enough to offset the pressure that we're seeing on that low-income consumer.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thank you, guys. I wanted to follow up on how you're thinking about comps in the back half of the year. So quarter to date is still running negative. Are you expecting that to, I guess, continue through Q3? When can we start to talk about positive comps in the back half of the year? Is it Q4 as a base case right now? Any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's",
    "content2": "Hi, Lauren. It's Ian. So just maybe to reiterate a few things. I mean, I think, as I said, the pressures are broad-based. We're seeing those pressures, I think, on the industry and on the consumer across almost every one of our large-owned markets globally. And as I said, I don't think we certainly don't profess to have, I think, a crystal ball on how the future will look like, but we don't expect that we're going to see a change in that environment over the next few quarters. I mean, I think that's why we're laser-focused on getting value and affordability right.\nAs you heard Chris just say, I think it's not even so much about consumers moving from us to others. It's about consumers in that low-income category.\nI think families, which are obviously two big cohorts of our consumer base across most of our markets, just eating out less frequently than they have been previously. I think we're confident that if we get our value and affordability propositions right, if we get them into that winning position in each marketplace, that will encourage consumers to come back when they can. I think if you take examples of what some of our markets done, I'll use the UK as a bit of an example that ran a campaign at the end of May, beginning of June, a three for three pound Mix and Match campaign.\nThey also have done a GBP 1.99 Happy Meal offer in the app. When we run compelling affordable options like that, we know we're able to draw consumers back, and we know we are best positioned to be able to do that.\nSo that's certainly what we're focused on. As I said, certainly don't claim that we can predict, I think, when the environment will turn or when the consumer will turn. I think what we're focused on is making sure that we're winning in the current context in each and every one of our markets and that we're positioned to accelerate our momentum as this challenging environment begins to turn in each and one of our markets as we look forward. Yeah. The only thing I'd add is McDonald's at its essence, this is a growth business.\nAnd so we're not accepting negative comps as just sort of the way it is because of the consumer headwinds. We absolutely are committed to getting this business back to growth. Foundation of that is the value platforms that we've talked about, but we need to do more on menu innovation.\nWe've got more levers that we can do on digital and certainly getting our marketing to be more of a contributor as it was last year. I think all of those things need to work in combination to get the business back to where we know its rightful place is.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Good morning. Chris, you said in your prepared remarks that your value leadership gap versus the competition has shrunk. I'm just curious, how are you measuring this gap? What informs you that it has shrunk? Just secondly, what gives you the confidence you can reignite this gap with value at a time when everyone seems to be getting much more aggressive on value? Is it the success you're seeing with the $5 deal, or what else is fueling the confidence that this gap can reignite?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. So there's two ways that we measure value. They're both consumer-based surveys. But one is we get to just the overall brand impression, and we survey consumers around the world for their brand impression of how McDonald's does on both value and affordability, affordability being a more specific thing around typically price points, value being a broader metric that speaks to a number of different things. So it's all survey-based. Like I said, there's part of it which is looking at brand image.\nAnd then we also have a second survey that we do around most recent experience. And that gives us a little bit more of a current snapshot of where we are seeing the consumer. And it's been particularly on the most recent visit that we're seeing our leadership gap is shrinking. Our brand image scores around value and affordability.\nWe still are very strong there, and we're seeing those gaps hold up. But on the more recent visit that we are seeing some of the pressure, some of the decrease, still leading, but that margin may be shrinking a couple of points in a market, for example. In terms of what gives us confidence about our ability to continue to lead on value, it starts with the fact that for 70 years, we've led on value. And for 70 years, we've led on value because it's what the brand stands for. And frankly, we can buy food and paper at a better price than anybody else.\nSo we have an underlying competitive advantage that we can buy at a lower price than anybody else in our industry. I think the other thing is the way that the consumer defines value. Yes, there's a price point component to it.\nBut the other thing that we see in all of our value work is that there are intangibles that consumers think about around how they define good value or not. Things like, for example, how convenient is the restaurant? Things like, for example, how clean the restaurant is? Things like how tasty is the food? Those typically are representing maybe 25% to 30% of consumers' value perception. So it's not just about hitting low price points. It's also the overall experience you can deliver. And as you've heard us talk about in the past, our restaurant estate is in great shape.\nOur restaurants are running strong execution. Service times are improving around the world. CSAT scores are high. So I think we've got a lot of things from the intangibles that are working in our favor.\nAnd as you've heard us talk about on this call, there's other things that we're doing to make sure from a value standpoint, and particularly around value platforms and products and price points, that we're where the consumer expects us to be.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nBrian, I might just do two little hooks on Chris's just on that second bit about why we can win. I mean, I wouldn't underestimate the power of the equity we have in some of our menu items that when we get those items priced at the right price point in the current context for consumers, I think that's unique to us. The scale and level of marketing dollars we have available as a system that we can direct to support these platforms that we get as we get them in place is unmatched. And then I'll just double-click on what Chris touched on on the experience.\nI mean, we've talked the last couple of quarters. I think Joe would talk to the fact that our customer satisfaction scores in the US are at kind of an all-time high for this point in the year.\nWe're seeing that pretty consistently around the world. We're getting faster. We're delivering a better experience. And when you put all that together, that's what kind of defines value for the consumer. And we certainly are adamant and relentless that we're going to get that right in each and every market to be in a winning position.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Jake Bartlett with Truist.\n\nJake Bartlett\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Mine was just really a clarification on your commentary about recent trends. And that's the US. And I think overall, you said that the third quarter is starting as the second quarter ended. I just want to make sure that that's true for the US. And I guess if that's true, and it would, I think, imply below what was reported for the second quarter, if that's true in the commentary that the $5 meal is doing what you hoped, how does that match? It seems like the $5 meal you're happy with, but it doesn't seem to have really driven an improvement. Just want to make sure I understand the commentary there on recent trends and what's driving it.\n\nJoe Erlinger\n\nPresident of McDonald's USA, McDonald's\n\nThat's right, Jake. So we obviously exited the second quarter as we lapped the Grimace Birthday Meal and shake with negative comps. And then we have experienced negative comps here in July. The success, obviously, we've seen is the shift in traffic that we're experiencing. And in my 22 years of experience at McDonald's, traffic and guest counts usually come before sales. And so we've got some exciting promotions upcoming here in the second half of the year. And we think that if we can get the traffic moving, we'll see customers obviously willing to spend more.\nRemember that the customer that's coming in for the $5 Meal Deal, they are buying more than just the $5 Meal Deal because we see that average check up around a little over $10.\nSo that's why we feel strongly about how the $5 Meal Deal is connecting in the marketplace and specifically with that low-income consumer, which has been our opportunity.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman and CEO, McDonald's\n\nWe have time for one more question with John Tower at Citi.\n\nJon Tower\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just similar line of thinking in terms of your expectations for store margins for the balance of the year. Obviously, you've got some good guys with respect to inflation coming off, but I think pricing is also rolling off a little bit. And now it seems like promotional activity is going to be ramping. So how should we anticipate the impact on store margins both in the US business and the IOM segment for the balance of 2024 and perhaps in the early 2025?\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nHi, John. It's Ian. Let me try and get that one. Well, look, I think as you would have seen through the first half, even with more muted top-line growth, restaurant margins have held up pretty well. Obviously, as you noted, we will take or certainly expect to take less pricing through the year, just obviously managing through the current context we're in. We still got a fair bit of carryover pricing from 2023. So that certainly helps a little bit. And as I talked about earlier, certainly inflation on food, paper, and other cost items outside of wages has come down substantially from where it's been over the last couple of years.\nSo that's helpful. The US, obviously, as I talked about, we've got the wage pressures, particularly from California. So that's certainly a headwind that we're working through.\nI think overall, if you think about the year, I think we certainly expect, if I use company-operated margins as a proxy, for those to be down a little bit from where we ended in 2023. But I think pretty good in terms of when you consider the overall context of what we're working through this year. Okay.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nHead of Investor Relations, McDonald's\n\nThat concludes our call. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Ian. Thank you, Joe. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

Hello and welcome to McDonald's Q1 2024 Investor Conference Call. As a request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star one on their touch-tone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I join you today inspired from our recent worldwide convention, a time when McDonald's comes together to celebrate the success of our system. The relevance of our brand, the power of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, and the collective strength of our system were on full display as we welcomed our global McDonald's franchisees, restaurant teams, suppliers, and company employees to Barcelona. For the first time in our nearly 70-year history, we held this biennial reunion outside of North America, a testament to the global power of our brand. We're joined by more than 15,000 attendees from nearly 100 markets to discuss how we're reimagining the future across our three-legged stool.\nIt's clear that McDonald's continues to operate from a position of strength across nearly all areas of the business as we focus on executing the day-to-day at a high level and establishing strong platforms for long-term sustained growth. The Q1 of 2024 marks our 13th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth, with 30% growth over the last four years. This success was built by establishing a strong foundation with a strategic plan based in consumer insights and focus on creating relevant marketing campaigns with our brand connected to culture. At the same time, we're maximizing the strength of our core menu equities and building an industry-leading loyalty base. Combined with our modernized restaurant estate, strong franchisee alignment, engaged restaurant employees, and strong restaurant-level unit economics, McDonald's is well positioned.\nThis winning formula continues to drive results, and our customers visiting our restaurants today can easily see our commitment to providing them with a great experience, evident through our strong customer satisfaction scores. As I reflect on the Q1 of the year, it is clear that broad-based consumer pressures persist around the world. Consumers continue to be even more discriminating with every dollar that they spend as they face elevated prices in their day-to-day spending, which is putting pressure on the QSR industry. It's worth noting that in Q1, industry traffic was flat to declining in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the UK. Across almost all major markets, industry traffic is slowing. In the context of a difficult macro environment for the industry, we know our customers are looking for reliable everyday value now more than ever.\nThat has always been our promise to deliver delicious feel-good moments at an affordable price each and every day. Staying on the side of the consumer and executing against our plan is our model for driving long-term growth regardless of the broader landscape. This was the case nearly 70 years ago when Ray Kroc opened the very first McDonald's, and this remains just as true to this day. As consumer pressures have mounted, we've reacted with agility to proactively meet evolving customer needs. For example, over the past year, we've launched everyday value menus across many of our international markets, including all five of our big IOM markets. Featuring value bundles at various price points, these new offerings provide smaller, more affordable meals to our customers. In Germany, our McSmart menu has continued its strong performance with record units sold during Q1.\nIn other markets like Spain, our everyday value menu features a convenient bundle for every price point, which continues to drive results. I recently spent time with our market team in Poland and experienced firsthand their renewed focus on value in an environment where significant inflation has created challenging consumer dynamics. In light of these challenges, I was impressed by the market's ability to quickly identify an opportunity in their everyday value offerings to implement a new entry-level value platform, which is driving traffic back into our restaurants. In France, a market which I flagged last quarter, I've been impressed by the speed with which our team and franchisees have moved to address their opportunities. The market now has established their own McSmart value menu with high consumer awareness, which is driving encouraging progress in their business trends.\nIt's clear that McDonald's offers delicious food at a great value, and customers continue to tell us this through our survey work. That said, we must be laser-focused on affordability, which means good entry-level price points available every day. In the markets where we're doing this well, the business is outperforming. In some markets, however, it's clear we still have opportunities to strengthen our proposition. As we continue to take a one McDonald's approach to solving problems, the unique size and scale of the McDonald's system gives us the ability to learn from each other. It's examples like our success with the McSmart value menu construct that we will look to replicate further. McDonald's has a long history of being the go-to destination for value, and it's imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers.\nWe literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry. As we've done for the last 70 years, our teams in those markets are working closely with our local franchisees to balance menu pricing decisions with the right affordability strategy in place, and where needed, get more aggressive with our value offerings. Despite the elevated cost environment we've navigated over the past couple of years, average franchisee cash flow and the corresponding margins remain strong. And thanks to the financial strength of our restaurant P&Ls, we have the ability to invest in these traffic-driving initiatives. Despite these ongoing challenges and pressured consumer spending across our segments, we delivered global comparable sales growth of nearly 2% in Q1. And we continue to raise the bar on the customer experience in our restaurants with a focus on strong execution.\nThis is driving improved service times and higher levels of customer satisfaction across our markets. In challenging times, there is significant power in focusing on what's within our control to maximize the impact of our strategic plan, offering our customers delicious food at unparalleled value and convenience. It's exactly this approach that will continue to drive growth. McDonald's is best positioned to win in the industry because when we combine our strong system alignment with our fully modernized estate, a globally recognized brand, delicious food on our core menu, and the highest level of execution across our 4Ds, no competitor can match us. As consumer spending remains pressured and macro headwinds continue, we are laser-focused on maintaining our competitive advantages and growing QSR market share. With that, I'll turn it over to Ian to talk more about our Q1 results.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nThanks and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned just a few minutes ago, strong execution against our strategic plan delivered global comp sales of nearly 2% for Q1, driven by growth across our US and IOM segments. As we've said before, as customers continue to be more intentional with the dollars that they spend in a pressured economic landscape, we expect moderated top-line growth this year. In our IDL segment, positive comp sales in Japan, Europe, and Latin America were offset by the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East. We remain proud of the way our system continues to show up for customers every day, and we continue to work closely with our IDL partners to support local communities in the region.\nIt's during times like this that I'm once again reminded of the resilience of the entire McDonald's system and our ability to deliver delicious feel-good moments to our customers in any environment, which I've seen time and again in my 30 years with McDonald's. We've continued to drive a one McDonald's way approach to our creative excellence this quarter, combining local cultural relevance with global reach to engage a new generation of McDonald's fans. In more than 30 markets around the world, including the US, we tapped into a new global community with a truly unique brand campaign. While McDonald's has long been an enduring brand across communities, in anime, we're known as WcDonald's, a fictional restaurant we brought to life for our fans this quarter.\nBy featuring our Chicken McNuggets alongside a new dipping sauce, theme packaging, and bonus gaming content with a mobile app purchase, we created brand excitement and lifted McNuggets category sales. Our fans' passion for the McDonald's brand and for the WcDonald's universe quickly spread across social media in the US with over 6 billion impressions and nearly 100,000 mentions. Our delicious burgers were also featured across many markets this quarter as we continued to showcase our strength in beef with a consistent approach to improving our fan favorites. Now deployed in over 80% of our restaurants globally, Best Burger was recently introduced in France this quarter, delivering hotter and juicier burgers. Early results were promising with lifts across our core burger categories and improved customer satisfaction in both our taste and quality scores.\nIn the US, where we're now fully deployed across the country, we celebrated the national launch of Best Burger with an iconic character at the center of our advertising. Tapping into the nostalgia of the Hamburglar, the campaign drove a significant lift in the Big Mac category and contributed to record customer satisfaction scores in the market. The progress we've made with our core burgers highlights what McDonald's can achieve when we tap into the full power of our system's size and scale. We'll continue to showcase that small changes can add up to deliver big improvements to both taste and quality by scaling Best Burger to nearly all restaurants by the end of 2026. As we look to further build on our leadership in beef, our team of chefs from around the world have created a larger, satiating burger.\nWe'll be testing this burger in a few markets later this year, ensuring that it has universal appeal before scaling it across the globe. We also celebrated our menu in the mobile app this quarter, combining the strength of our core equities with new and exciting digital experiences for our customers. Across our top markets, digital penetration is growing, as evidenced by our increased loyalty sales and record mobile app orders, leading to greater frequency and increased spend by loyalty customers. We're also growing digital share as we leverage learnings from across markets in areas like gamification. Australia featured McDonald's world-famous fries at the center of a digital campaign and offered customers a chance to win by digitally redeeming their game pieces. Powered by a seamless digital experience, the campaign resulted in incremental customer acquisition and increased the market's loyalty sales.\nThe UK market also drove strong loyalty results with the return of their Winning Sips digital experience, encouraging customers to add a drink to their order with a chance to win on every cup. Customer engagement in the mobile app increased with digitally redeemed game pieces, and we drove record growth in 90-day active users in the market. Because of unique digital experiences like Winning Sips, our loyalty members continue to engage more frequently, with nearly 75% of our total loyalty user base in the UK active during the last quarter. We know the experience we provide, whether through our mobile app or in our restaurants, is a significant driver of how often our customers choose to visit McDonald's. But providing our delicious food at the right price is equally critical, especially in today's environment where consumers all over the world are paying more for everyday goods and services.\nAs Chris mentioned a few minutes ago, a strong value proposition continued to drive results within several of our markets this quarter. This consumer-centric approach to providing our customers with compelling value at affordable price points continued to drive strong results in markets like Germany, Spain, and Poland, and led to QSR market share gains. As we remain agile to meet the needs of our customers around the world, we'll continue to use our size and scale for the greatest impact, sharing what is working to drive consistency and enable speed. Turning to the P&L, our global top-line growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.70 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of about 2% in constant currencies. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was nearly 45%.\nDespite the pressured consumer spending environment we've discussed this morning, top-line results generated nearly $3.5 billion of restaurant margin for the quarter, an increase of about 4% in constant currency. This was partially offset by higher G&A costs as we continue to invest in our strategic transformation efforts and growth opportunities such as digital, as well as costs associated with our biennial worldwide convention that Chris mentioned. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter. As we've talked about before, driving long-term growth requires making the right strategic and forward-looking investments. The resilience of our business and our overall financial strength put us in the ideal position to invest in critical areas that deliver against customer needs as well as unlock efficiencies for our people and our business.\nThis includes new restaurant development as we look to accelerate the pace of openings and grow our footprint to 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027. Development for the year is off to a strong start across markets, including in China, where we recently opened our 6,000th restaurant, and we are pacing on track against our global plan. In addition to restaurant development, we're also investing for long-term growth in areas like digital and technology, as well as our transformation efforts within our global business services organization. By leveraging the full strength of our global scale, we'll build new and modern capabilities and ultimately unlock speed and innovation for our entire McDonald's system. Despite the headwinds that persist, we remain well-positioned with the unique strength and scale that only the McDonald's system can provide.\nAs Chris talked about upfront, we are focused on how we can further leverage this across our consumer, restaurant, and company platforms. With our system aligned on the right strategies moving forward, along with the financial strength of our franchisees, suppliers, and the company, I remain confident that we will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and for our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nThanks, Ian. We like to say that when culture calls, McDonald's answers. With a brand that is renowned throughout the world and marketing that is resonating in culture and with consumers, it's no wonder that we've been recognized yet again as one of the world's most effective marketers by Work in association with Cannes Lions. We're elevating our creative excellence, scaling great ideas globally, and building meaningful relationships with the next generation of consumers. Breakthrough campaigns, a great tasting menu, and personalized experiences will drive customers to McDonald's again and again as they come through the physical doors of our restaurants and the digital door of our mobile app. In this environment, with pressured QSR traffic, we have an opportunity to get the customers who already visit to visit more often.\nAs more customers make purchase decisions based on personalized recommendations on their phones, driving frequency means using our digital capabilities like loyalty to know and serve our customers better than anyone else. With the insights powered by our loyalty members, we will work to deliver the right message at the right time to the right consumer, encouraging those who already love McDonald's to visit even more. When we shift marketing investment from traditional mass media like television, print, and billboard ads to collective investment in modern digital capabilities to personalize the experience, we drive profitability. Successfully delivering personalized experiences depends on transforming our restaurants to deliver what customers want: hot, fresh orders delivered with convenience and accuracy. The future restaurant experience is already underway in markets across the world, whether it's Ready On Arrival, a dedicated drive-thru lane for digital orders in China, or other flexible format concepts.\nBy building the technology infrastructure to support the three long-term platforms we've discussed, we will create a more reliable experience and operate more efficiently. We've talked about the ways best-in-class marketing and our iconic menu fuel the brand, but there's another component. Each and every day, our McDonald's system strives to fulfill our purpose of feeding and fostering communities locally. There's no greater example of our decades-long dedication to driving positive impact than our work with Ronald McDonald House Charities. This year, we're celebrating the 50th anniversary of Ronald McDonald House Charities, providing essential services that remove barriers to healthcare, strengthen families, and promote healing when children need it most. Since that first house opening, the charity's global footprint has expanded significantly, and they've helped tens of millions of families through the hardest of times.\nWith more than 385 programs running across the world, the organization is providing support for families across 90% of the world's leading pediatric hospitals and extending care through more than 2 million overnight family stays each year. Before I close, I'd also like to take a moment to recognize Rick Hernandez for his many contributions to the McDonald's system throughout his 28 years of service on our Board of Directors. As I assume the additional role of Chairman following our annual shareholders meeting next month, I look forward to working alongside our new Lead Independent Director, Miles White, and the rest of the entire Board to continue to deliver strong performance united under an aligned company voice.\nI am confident that the system is focused on the right priorities, with Accelerating the Arches as our playbook, evolving to meet the customer needs of tomorrow, and laying the foundation for future growth. With that, we'll take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and requeue for any additional questions.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur first question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi, good morning. My question is on the comps outlook. I think, Ian, you mentioned on the last call that you had expected comps in the US and IOM to settle to the 3% to 4% range this year. And now I think your commentary suggests you're operating in a tougher climate than when you gave that guidance. So one, I wanted to ask if that range is still in play in both of those markets in your view. And then secondly, for the US specifically, do you think a more concerted or more aggressive value approach is needed to get there in the current environment? Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nMorning, David. Thanks for the question. Let me start, and then I think Chris will probably jump in to kind of build out on whatever I say. But look, what I would start with is, as you know well, we don't typically give comp guidance. I think what we were trying to do as we looked back was to provide a directional perspective on what we felt the industry kind of historical range looked like in more typical years. As you know, we talked about 2024 being a year where we felt top line was going to moderate. I think four months into the year, I think what we can say is clearly 2024 isn't going to be a typical year for the broader industry.\nI say that because we're certainly seeing, as you heard in our upfront remarks, that the macro headwinds have been more significant than I think we even anticipated coming into the year. We continue to see those macro headwinds as we have started Q2 in, frankly, many of our large international markets and the US. I think we expect in the US that we're going to start the quarter roughly flat from a comp sales perspective from what we can see so far. So I think what we're seeing is in many of our largest markets internationally and the US that the industry traffic is either flat or we're certainly seeing declining trends. I think as a result of that, we believe we're going to likely probably be below that historical range that we had indicated.\nI think what's important is clearly we don't control the macro context around us. So what we're focused on as always is listening to the needs of consumers, making sure we're making the appropriate adjustments in our business to deliver against those needs, and of course, as always, ensuring that we can do it better than anyone else. I think affordability is clearly an area where consumer expectations are heightened. I mean, I think consumers are obviously dealing with a lot in the current macro context. Obviously, they're getting hit, I think, across their full basket of goods and services by all the inflationary impacts. I think, importantly, we've got a really long and strong history of being a leader in both value for money and affordability. We've obviously been through these difficult contexts many times over time.\nI say that because I think it's important that we know what we need to do. I think we know how to do it well. The financial strength of our business puts us in a position to be able to do that better than anyone else. I think that's what we're going to make sure we're delivering against, and each of our large markets is positioned for success against those current consumer expectations.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nThen turning to value in the US, I think it's important to first recognize that there is some great value that our system, our franchisees, are offering in the US. 90% of our system in the US is offering meal bundles for $4 or less. If you look at digital value, we've got some great digital offers out there. I just opened my app while I was waiting to jump on this answer.\nAnd we're offering right now a Big Mac for $0.29 when you buy a Big Mac, or you could get 30% off McCrispy. So there's a lot of great value out there. But I think the issue that we have in the US is in an environment where everybody is out there with a value message, there's an opportunity for us to drive better awareness of what our value platform is. And one of the things that's going on in the US right now is the value message that I was talking about, we're doing it in 50 different ways with local value. And what we don't have in the US right now is a national value platform at the same time that our competitors are out there with a national value platform.\nSo the opportunity for us in the US, I think, is to get more aligned as a system around a strong national value proposition that we can then use our media scale to drive high consumer awareness on it. So that's what I know Joe and the team are focused on the US. And as I look at the US compared to other markets where we're having success, you've got to be able to have high awareness. And that's, I think, the big opportunity for us going forward in the US business.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nResearch Analyst of Restaurants, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I guess given kind of the response to that prior question, what's some of the timing on that value plan, especially in the US? Do you think that we'll start to see some improvement in Q2? Do you think it sort of takes longer than that? What else could we think about from a sales driving perspective or maybe a product perspective that will be noticeable US comp drivers as we think about this year?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, I think what we've seen, if I turn to France as an example, France, I was talking about last quarter as having a number of areas of opportunity. And in my prepared remarks, I noted that that system in France came together very quickly around a national value program that they then put significant marketing support against, and they got to north of 80% awareness in a very short period of time that's starting to drive encouraging trends in their business results. I think what that highlights is it's not about how quickly can you see the business impact when you have a strong marketing support against a compelling value platform. It's how quickly can your system move and pivot to getting that in place. And I know that that's something that Joe and the US team are talking with US franchisees on.\nI think, again, there's lots of great value that we have out there at a local level, but it's how do we come together in the US around a stronger national value platform that can compete. How long that takes, I think, is going to be up to individual conversations that happen in the market. But it's clear that once you have that in place, the business can start to respond pretty quickly.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nAnd maybe just the only build I'd add to what Chris said, Brian, is, I mean, I think I know, as Chris said, our US leadership team is working really closely with our owner-operators. I think we have a good understanding of what we need to do, kind of how to do that well. And we're going to move, obviously, as quickly as we can together with owner-operators to kind of address that opportunity. We've seen that work really well in other markets globally, as Chris was talking about.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nNext question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nEquity Research, UBS\n\nThank you. Wondering if you could speak a little bit more to kind of what you're seeing with that US consumer, whether it's by income cohort or spending pattern. And then sort of beyond affordability and aligning the system on a national value plan, can you speak at all to sort of some of the other key levers that maybe can be supportive of US sales growth in the current environment? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, I think one of the things that we noted in our opening is that the consumer is certainly being very discriminating in how they spend their dollar. And the inflation that has occurred over the last couple of years in the US, I think, has certainly created that environment. And while it may be more pronounced with the lower-income consumer, I think it's important to recognize that all income cohorts are seeking value. And so our focus is on making sure, as I said, that we're offering strong value to our customers. And that's going to have benefits not just to low income. That'll have benefits to middle and upper income as well. And so the actions that you take are the same regardless of the income cohort that you're talking about.\nFrom another sales driver standpoint, on that score, I feel really good about where we're at in the US. As I look at, most importantly, how we're running our restaurants, our franchisees in partnership with our US team are doing a really nice job of running strong restaurant operations. We're seeing improvements in speed of service. We're seeing the turnover in our restaurants is down. All of those things in combination are improving customer satisfaction. We're seeing our satisfaction scores increase in the US. And then we will, of course, have menu innovation that happens throughout the year. It's part of what we do. I'm not going to get into detailing exactly what the menu innovation is going to be and when it comes, but certainly you can expect that we will use menu innovation as well to find ways to engage our customers.\nAnd lastly, I would just point out we always have to be finding ways to be driving consumer interest around great marketing plans. And if we're doing great marketing, you can grow the business just with your core menu. And so I know the US team, along with our agency in the US, Wieden+Kennedy, they're continuing to look for what's the next big idea that we have from a marketing standpoint to drive the business. So multiple levers at our disposal.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nDennis, maybe I'll just build on what Chris was saying because I think it's such an important point. I mean, the foundation of our business, the vast majority of our business is in an incredibly strong position. I mean, I think we come into this more challenged macro environment kind of in an advantage position. I think the emphasis would be we have a fully modernized estate, as Chris kind of referred to. We've got, I think, a marketing and brand engine that's best in class, meaning I think the team continues to deliver great creative execution. I think that's resonating with customers in culturally relevant ways. We've got our System financial strength that's at one of its strongest points in our history. So we've got the ability to kind of lean into opportunities together because of all the work we've done over the last couple of years.\nThen if you think of our 3Ds of delivery, drive-thru, and digital, we have a leadership position in each of those areas. We're continuing to invest to drive growth in those areas. Delivery, for example, the US business kind of hit all-time highs in Q1. Delivery, sorry, digital, as you know, we've made a lot of progress in, and we know we continue to drive growth in digital more broadly. So I think we feel really good about the vast majority of our business. We just know the consumer is looking for more on affordability and value, and we're going to lean in and make sure we can meet those needs.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nRestaurant Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. I was wondering what kind of opportunity or maybe need that we have to address core menu pricing in the US. And I speak specifically about things like Quarter Pounder combo pricing or Big Mac combo pricing that can actually be very different across the restaurant base, even within a given market. And obviously, the press will communicate some of the highest pricing in certain stores as you talk about what the direction of pricing has happened to McDonald's across the country, even if it is just certain stores. So is there a need or an opportunity to kind of get back and communicate around core menu pricing to kind of give the perception of value for consumers that maybe even are outside of the value menus of what we did pre-COVID? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, let me start with, I think it's important to recognize that if you look at margins in the US today, restaurant-level margins for franchisees versus where we were in 2019, we've just now rebuilt franchise restaurant-level margins back to where we were in 2019. So the pricing that's been taken over the last several years was all taken as a means to offset what we were seeing around quite high labor inflation and quite high commodity food and paper inflation. So restaurant margins are now back to where we were, again, in 2019 in the US, which then says to me that we do have the ability to be thinking about what we do from a value proposition going forward. And I talked about that in my answer to the earlier question.\nI think the idea of where do we need to stay from a pricing standpoint on core menu. We've done a lot over the last several years building our pricing capabilities. The pricing capabilities that we have happen at the local level. We will go and we will take a look at what are the competitive products around us, what are they priced at, and how do our products match up against that. All of that is then used to inform at the franchisee level, at the restaurant level, what our relative pricing is. I think from where we are, I feel like we are in a decent shape from an overall menu standpoint. Yes, there will be the one-offs that get sensationalized and reported on.\nBut again, our opportunity is we need to speak in a more compelling way with one voice about what are those entry point affordable price points that will be attractive to consumers. And that's what the focus for our US team, I know, is.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nMaybe, John, I'll just build a little bit on what Chris talked to because I think maybe the way to think about it is what do we think good looks like in getting value and affordability right? And I think we would say it's a couple of things. It's making sure, as Chris said, we've got those entry-level items at affordable price points for consumers. It's making sure that we've got an entry-level meal bundle that's at an affordable, compelling affordable price point and doing that generally with products that consumers know and that we've got strong equity behind. And then I think if breakfast is a big part of our business, like it certainly is in the US, making sure we've got compelling value at breakfast as well.\nAnd I think, obviously, from an executional standpoint, we've got to make sure we've got the right products at the right price. And we've got, as you've heard Chris talk about, that consumer awareness at a level of significance so that consumers are aware of the offers and the affordability price points. And that's going to influence their visits as we look forward and they're looking across different options. So again, I think we're working hard to make sure we're delivering against each of those opportunities. And as Chris talked about, in markets where we've done that well, we're seeing really strong performance. And that's the opportunity we're focused on making sure we have in place in each of our top markets.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you. You noted the customer satisfaction scores had been heading higher. That definitely doesn't surprise me given all the improvements to the restaurants, digital, and the core food renovations. But I guess what does surprise me is that the gap to the industry, at least in the US, has eroded, that outperformance gap. I wonder whether it's the surveys or certain consumer trends as you slice it thin, even day parts. What are the insights about why that gap has narrowed? Because it has been surprising. Is it just an entry price point opportunity in the value scores that you're seeing with certain income cohorts? And how does the opportunity for the US differ from maybe some of your other international Big 5 markets? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. I think on our overall satisfaction, again, we look and we're seeing improvement across all of our major markets on satisfaction. As you noted, there's multiple aspects to that. I think where we see the one opportunity, as you sort of then decompose drivers of satisfaction, certainly in some markets, we have seen that our relative superiority on affordability has declined. I think if there's any pressure on overall satisfaction or if there's anything that's closing it, it's probably losing some of that relative superiority on affordability.\nAgain, that's not in all markets, but that's in a few markets. It's important to still note we still are viewed as a superior value proposition, but the degree of gap in a few markets has narrowed. That leads back to all the things that we've been talking about on this call as things that we need to be focused on.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nDavid, just maybe to build because I think experience, as you noted, is encompassing of a number of different factors. I mean, I think we know we're driving better speed of execution consistently across our top markets. We know when we put capabilities in place, as you've heard us talk about previously, like Ready On Arrival, which is in place in the US, that we're delivering hotter, fresher food as customers arrive to our restaurants and delivering an overall better experience. I think the sharp point, and Chris mentioned this, is just we've got that opportunity on affordability, and we're really laser-focused on making sure we can meet the need that consumers are expressing in the current context. But we feel really good about all the other aspects of the experience and how we're delivering against what customers are expecting.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBank.\n\nEric Gonzalez\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHi. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. And thanks for the question.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nGood morning.\n\nEric Gonzalez\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nOn the pricing discussion. Good morning. On the pricing discussion, and I appreciate the point that your store-level margins are back to 2019 levels, but perhaps you could speak to the current level of year-over-year pricing and your current inflation expectations for food and labor this year, and then just maybe whether you've seen any changes in the flow through of that pricing or any elasticity changes.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, my guess is your question's focused on the US because obviously, I could give a different answer depending on where you are in the world. But if I focus just on the US, most of the pricing that you see now in the US is carryover pricing. It's not new pricing per se. Most of it, again, is carryover pricing. That said, we do continue to see there's certainly labor inflation. Much of that is coming out of what happened in California. And on a national level, you could probably see we're expecting high single-digit labor inflation. Again, much of that from the bleedover of what California introduced. And then on food and paper inflation, I think that's gone down to much more historical levels. So we're back at more historical levels on what we see from food and paper inflation going forward.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nMaybe just to build, Eric, to what Chris said. I mean, the food and paper, low single digits. So I think we have seen kind of favorable movement in this year, although we've still got a fair bit of carryover effect from 2023 inflation, certainly into the first part of 2024 from both food and paper, and labor. I think what's important to note on pricing is I think our business, including our owner-operators, understand that the consumer is price-weary. And I think we certainly are going to be prudent and thoughtful about any further price increases that we're looking at for the rest of 2024 on that backdrop and keep working on the opportunity that we've talked about a fair bit already on the affordability and getting that in place to kind of address the consumer need.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst of Restaurants, Bank of America\n\nOh, thank you. I guess I want clarification and then a question. You mentioned that the QSR industry traffic is flat to declining because I always think of this as an industry where traffic is kind of at best flat. So I'm just trying to understand, given you usually have better data than I do, whether that's an inflection point or the sort of traffic trends have been more consistent, which is what it sort of sounds like. And then the question I have is you mentioned margins are right back to where they are. I think franchisee cash flow is also back to pre-COVID, not COVID peaks. But I guess as you think about maybe investing in value, do you contemplate doing anything to support franchisees?\nI don't know if it's sort of fee abatements like digital fees, or we've seen some other restaurants kind of pull back on those when franchisees are making investments, whether they be capital investments or in other operating expenses. So just is supporting franchisees something that you can do if you really need to reinvest in value? Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nMorning, Sara Senatore. Let me take the clarification, and then I'll let Chris address your question. So what I said earlier was that industry traffic, and I was talking about across many of our top markets, is flat or we're seeing declining trends. If I talked specifically about the US in Q1, industry comparable traffic was negative, and we expected to be negative for the full year. I think that's the context that's important just to give the context to the more challenging macro environment.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. And then turning to franchisees and your question about how we support franchisees, you're right that our US franchisees, and I could go through other markets as well, but they're in a strong position. When you look at franchisee cash flow, we are, I think, our second highest levels ever, 2021 being the peak, but we're at very strong franchisee cash flows. We're going to see franchisee cash flows increase in Q1. If you think about the balance sheet for our franchisees, the modernization that we did on our restaurants in the US many years ago now was all done in a period of super low interest rates. So any debt that's being carried on the books for our franchisees is at significantly lower interest rates than what we're seeing in the market right now. So our franchisees are in a strong position.\nAs you know, they control pricing. We don't step in and subsidize pricing. But I think the opportunity here is what I mentioned earlier. We have a lot of great value out there in the market. We're just doing it in a very fragmented way. And so the opportunity for us is how do you maybe pull back a little bit on all the local value that we're offering, which frankly, we don't have very high awareness on, and how do you coalesce and drive awareness around a national value proposition? So I think there's a smart way to do this that can end up being net neutral to a franchisee P&L, but just using the size and scale of our marketing engine and the amount of media that we spend. I think that's going to be the opportunity for us going forward.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nCertainly, we're in a good position from a system financial health standpoint to go do that. Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. I had a follow-up on the value question. You mentioned you're offering value 50 different ways. Can you just talk about what a future national value platform could look like given how different the cost environment looks like across the US? I imagine price point value could be difficult. And then when you look at what type of value consumers are most looking for, is it price point, lower entry points, and bundle deals? Are you seeing an uptick in the value mix? Thanks.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. I'll maybe start, and then I'll hand off to Ian. But I think Ian outlined in general a construct that we see as sort of being our successful playbook, which is you need to have good entry-level price points. You need to have a meal deal. And then there needs to be something that if you have a big breakfast business, you need to be offering value that's specific to breakfast. And in a number of markets around the world, we're doing that very successfully. Certainly in the US, we see that there's different cost environments. But then again, our competitors have those same differences between high-cost markets, low-cost markets, etc. And that exists in other markets as well. If you were to go to France, it's much different if you were to go to Paris than what it would be somewhere outside of Paris.\nSo those differences exist in many markets around the world. I think what our system has historically shown an ability to do is working with our franchisees. How do you think about it from a portfolio standpoint? And ultimately, in this business, if you're driving transactions, if you're driving guest counts, that ends up being a good thing for everybody. So we have a history of being able to do this. We've done this, as I mentioned in our opening. We've been doing this for 70-some-odd years. So I think we understand what it takes, but it happens through a conversation with our franchisees to get aligned around what that national value proposition looks like.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Restaurants, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Good morning. As it relates to the operating margin guidance, mid to high 40s range is still a very wide range, Ian. I fully understand there's a lot of moving pieces in the financial model, but I'm curious, with a quarter in the books, if there's an opportunity to perhaps tighten the expectations around that range. As we look towards last year's 47%, is that kind of a good base case target for operating margins this year, or should we anticipate declines similar to what we saw in the Q1?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. Morning, Brian. Thanks for the question. Look, I mean, you hit on it. It's obviously in the context we're working through in 2024. There are a lot of variables at play. And I think the macro context means it's difficult for us to kind of predict the forward look in terms of what's the duration of the macro headwinds we're seeing and the depth. So I think that obviously is impacting performance. And as always, our op margin leverage is going to be dependent on our strength and level of sales growth. Look, I think I remain really confident in our ability to drive leverage in op margin over time as we're able to kind of continue to drive strong top-line growth.\nAnd I think we're confident as we work to kind of address the affordability opportunities we've got that's going to be helpful in getting sales growth back to the direction we want. And over time, that'll certainly be helpful in continuing to drive leverage in op margin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nRestaurant Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Chris, looking to learn more about how this national value platform will be different from years past. So if I think historically, back in 2018, for instance, the $1 $2 $3 was launched, looked like it was a negative traffic year for the US business just in that original approach to value has been more successful, the brand, despite what you said about competitors that are pursuing more national value. So I'm curious what you think is going to make this time different that'll lead national value to be more successful as you think about the constructs of what that'll look like going forward.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's",
    "content2": "Sure. Well, stating the obvious. It's up to the US team in partnership with our owner-operators to define what does a national value proposition look like in the US. As you note, with D123, it took a minute for that program to gain traction, but it then drove very strong results. I think certainly if you look at the US performance over the last many years under D123, I think we're now in year six or seven of D123. That was a very successful platform for us in driving performance across the US business. The point about how quickly does it actually impact transactions and turn that around, it goes back to how quickly you can drive awareness with the consumer on that. And the faster that you can drive awareness, the faster you start to see that driving incrementality on the business.\nSo I think first it's getting the platform defined, making sure that it's compelling with customers, and then making sure that you support it properly to drive the awareness that you need to ultimately impact transactions on the business.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Greg Francfort with Guggenheim.\n\nGreg Francfort\n\nRestaurants Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHey, thanks for the question. My question is just on the international business. I'm curious what you're seeing. I don't know if it's maybe from a protest standpoint or just if the business has continued to weaken there into the Q2 in the same way that it's done in the US business and what you might be doing from a support perspective through the IDL royalty rate or anything like that. Thanks.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. I think if you look at the impact of some of the boycotts in a few of our markets, I wouldn't say things are getting any worse there. And I think in some cases, you might be able to look and say perhaps it's getting slightly better in some places. So no big change on that. I think it's also just worth it, it's interesting to note that in many of those markets, our delivery business is holding up quite well, which is kind of an interesting dynamic there. So maybe marginally better in some markets. But as I referenced on an earlier call, we're not expecting to see any meaningful improvement in the impacts on that until the war is over. And we continue to have that outlook on what the Middle East conflict is going to do to our trends. Ian, I'll pass it over to you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nYeah. Maybe just one kind of build on the headwinds. I mean, I think what I said upfront was that the macro headwinds that we were seeing were more significant across a number of our large international markets, and that's continued into the start of Q2. I think on support for kind of the IDL, look, I mean, you've heard me talk about this before. I mean, I think when there are external factors that are kind of beyond the control of our franchisees that are impacting the business, and those franchisees are doing everything right and continue to do everything right for the McDonald's business, providing support in situations that warrant it is kind of part of what I'll call our fundamental business model. I mean, if and when we make decisions to provide support, it's always targeted and temporary.\nIt's always designed to go to our franchisees who are most in need. I think we've talked previously that we have provided some support for some markets that have been impacted in the region. Obviously, we're continuing to look at the facts and circumstances, and continue to work incredibly closely with our DL partners. I would just say that the level of support that's been provided so far has not gotten to what I'll call a significant level. But obviously, we're continuing to stay close and work very closely with our DL partners in the region.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler.\n\nBrian Mullan\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Just a question on CosMc's. I wonder if you could just talk about what some of the early learnings are in your tests in both Illinois and Texas. And then related to that, can you just talk about how you might plan to approach it from here in terms of how you evaluate the stores, what that decision process looks like if you ever wanted to ultimately build more of them next year or beyond? Any color would be great.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, I'm going to disappoint you, Brian, in telling that there's not a lot to report. I think what we're still seeing is there's a lot of interest in CosMc's that's sort of curiosity-driven. And as a result of that, it's tough to get a sense of sort of what are the true kind of underlying performance expectations. As we've referenced in our investor day, what we're looking at for the ultimate success on this business is we've got to have a business that's driving comparable or stronger ROIC to a traditional McDonald's. There'd be no reason to be putting any capital against CosMc's unless it was neutral to accretive to building a traditional McDonald's.\nThat's going to then be a function of what we see around both the absolute unit volumes in that concept, the margins associated with that, and our ability to build these smaller footprint restaurants at a lower cost than what we're expecting. So all of those things are things that we're going to be assessing in our test market. As I've referenced previously, we plan on opening 10 restaurants, and it'll be a function of unit volumes. It'll be a function of margins, and it'll be a function of what's the capital that we need to spend to get these things built. All of that will drive our overall assessment of what the ROIC potential is.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nWe have time for one more question from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just following up on the US comps, I know you guys have mentioned the lower-income households and the weakness seen there, and maybe some trading into food at home. Just wondering if you can maybe compare that to past slowdowns. I feel like the message has always been the benefit of the quick service segment. Maybe you lose some on the low end, but importantly, you inherit some who trade down from above, like you said, if everyone's looking for value. And when that is the context, I think you mentioned that the system franchisees, that the buy-in is there for the incremental value push. I just want to make sure I heard that right, whether there's any sentiment from the biennial in terms of franchisee sentiment, especially with the most recent fundamental easing. Thanks very much.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, so I think it's tough to go back and compare the day-to-day versus our last time that there was an economic slowdown. I think the dynamic that you described is what we do typically see in the business. I think, as you also know, Jeff, that our business over-indexes with lower-income consumer. So there's that consideration. But I would just go back to we recognize that we're in an environment where the consumer is being price-discriminating. And again, that's not just something that's low-income. I think all consumers are looking for good value for good affordability. And so we're focused on that action.\nIn terms of franchisee buy-in, that's a process that we work through in every single market to get alignment with our franchisees on what a national value program would look like or if it's about launching a new menu item, what that timing of that would look like. That's work that the US team is doing in a system that has 2,000 franchisees in the US. I think there are going to be different people in different places on that. That getting to alignment ultimately comes through conversation. Like I said, we've been doing this for 70 years. We know how to get it done, but it comes through a lot of conversations with US franchisees as it would in any other market.\n\nIan Borden\n\nEVP and CFO, McDonald's\n\nJeff, maybe just two quick hooks to what Chris said. I think across markets, I think what our leadership teams are spending time on talking to the business, talking to our franchisees about is what I'll call making sure we've got a street-fighting mentality in the current context. I mean, clearly, the macro is more difficult. Clearly, everybody's fighting for fewer consumers or consumers that are certainly visiting less frequently. We've got to make sure we've got that street-fighting mentality to win irregardless of the context around us. As I think we've talked a lot today about, our system is positioned with the strength and capability. There's no reason why we shouldn't have the most compelling value and affordability positioning from the focus of a consumer. Ultimately, we're going to measure our progress through are we taking share.\nI think we are, Chris, Mike and I, and certainly the leadership teams, are laser-focused on that. That's the opportunity ahead, and we're very focused on that.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nSVP, Treasurer, and Investor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nThat concludes our call today. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call. You may now disconnect."

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star one on their touchtone telephone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nGood morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions.\nPlease limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. Now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone. When we gathered at this time last year, we shared that despite a challenging operating environment, McDonald's continued to deliver historically high levels of growth. While macroeconomic pressures persisted throughout 2023, the resilience and power of our system was on full display, and we are heading into the new year in a position of strength.\nIn 2023, we achieved global comp sales growth of 9%, delivered comp guest count performance of nearly 3% globally with positive traffic across each of our segments, and maintained our leading market share across most of our major markets. These results are a credit to the tireless dedication of the entire McDonald's system. The over two million talented people working in our restaurants, the industry's best franchisees, and our world-class network of suppliers around the world, all executing with excellence and with an unwavering commitment to serving our customers and local communities and in our restaurant.\nFocusing on the fundamentals of creating an exceptional customer experience has delivered operational improvements, improved service times, and increased customer satisfaction across almost all of our major markets. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, fueling over 30% comparable sales growth since 2019, and our MCD growth pillars enable us to remain agile in response to changing customer needs. For example, we've expanded loyalty to 50 markets around the world and reached over $20 billion in annual loyalty systemwide sales in 2023.\nOur user base continues to grow with over 150 million users that have been active in the last 90 days, making us one of the largest loyalty programs in the world. Over the last three years we've also delivered tremendous growth in chicken by developing the McCrispy, a globally consistent high-quality chicken sandwich with a goal of solving this unmet customer need across the system. It was developed and tested in a few markets first and has quickly scaled to a billion-dollar brand across more than 30 markets worldwide.\nOur chicken category now represents $25 billion in annual systemwide sales on par with beef, and about a year ago we formed a new business ventures team designed to operate as an entrepreneurial startup within McDonald's. The team quickly identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across our top six markets that comprise of beverage-led occasions where our core McDonald's business under-indexes. In a little less than a year, the team opened a pilot CosMc's restaurant and the buzz has been electric.\nNow let me say this again, we're only talking about a 10-store test, but more than that, we are excited about what this says about our potential to test, learn, and innovate quickly. Each of these examples illustrate our ability to identify opportunities and adopt new ways to surprise and delight our customers. It gives us an incredible amount of resilience as a system, no matter where the customer goes next or what the macroeconomic landscape may bring. In the last year we also implemented Accelerating the Organization, an effort to modernize the way we work so that we're faster, more innovative, and more efficient.\nOver the past year, as I've had the opportunity to visit markets around the world, I've witnessed how the principles of ATO have empowered our teams to take the right risks, lead in innovation, and reduce complexity in decision making. Some of the senior leadership team and I recently visited Salt Lake City, and I witnessed firsthand how knowledge sharing across the system is unlocking speed and driving customer lifetime value. The business unit is part of our Denver field office, which as a whole has embraced the power of digital, maximizing our platform to drive frequency and engagement with customers.\nThis means that the restaurants can take full advantage of Ready on Arrival in addition to a national average 60-second reduction in wait times for customers that pick up curbside in our restaurant or higher customer satisfaction in these transactions. Ready on Arrival benefits the crew by giving the right information to the right person in the restaurant to deliver food faster and hotter. As a result, we've reduced complexity and stress in restaurants, and Salt Lake franchisees are driving higher levels of guest count growth and franchisee cash flow.\nBy removing layers between our people in the restaurants and implementing a one McDonald's way approach, collaborating across the organization is much more intuitive, and teams bring the full breadth of McDonald's resources, skills, and experiences to the forefront when making decisions. As critical as this power of global scale is to our competitive advantage, at our core, we are a global business that is run by local small business owners that employ thousands within their communities. Since the beginning of our brand's history, McDonald's and our franchisees have been steadfast in the support of our communities in the most challenging times.\nWhether it was the recent earthquake in Japan, the tragedies that struck Morocco and Hawaii last year, or the war in the Middle East, our focus is on creating a positive impact in the communities we serve. Across the more than 75 markets in our IDL segment, McDonald's is a major employer of local citizens, creating valuable career opportunities for more than 780,000 local employees in both restaurant and office jobs and at more than 1,000 locally owned suppliers. We're proud to grow that footprint. In 2023, the IDL segment opened an average of four new restaurants every single day, creating new jobs for nearly 50,000 people this year alone.\nBy removing barriers for children who need health care, Ronald McDonald House Charities help to provide essential services for over 870,000 families across this segment. For the over 130,000 workers in our Europe, Middle East, and Africa business, our number one priority is keeping our people safe. We recognize that families and their communities in the region continue to be tragically impacted by the war and our thoughts are with them at this time. McDonald's has always been a beacon in our communities around the world, led by local franchisees who work tirelessly to serve and support.\nThe ongoing impact of the war on these franchisees' local businesses is disheartening and ill-founded. As our values state. McDonald's will always proudly open our doors to everyone. Thinking back on 2023, I can't help but feel tremendous pride in the entire McDonald's system. As we think about our ambitions and the potential that lies ahead, there's never been a better time to be part of brand McDonald's. As I will continue to say, we believe there's still significant runway in our Accelerating the Arches strategy and we're setting our sights even higher. I'll speak more on the year ahead in a few minutes, but first I'll turn it over to Ian to talk through our Q4 results.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nThanks and good morning everyone. As Chris mentioned just a few minutes ago, core to Accelerating the Arches strategy is putting the customer at the center of every decision we make, acting with agility in any environment to deliver delicious feel good moments at an affordable price each and every day. Our Q4 comp sales performance of over 4% in both the US and IOM segments, and over 3% globally remains a direct result of exceptional execution against this strategy, making it clear once again that our business is resilient despite ongoing macro pressures and challenges.\nAs a system, we've navigated countless challenging environments since we first opened our doors in 1955. This past quarter was no exception and our thoughts remain with the families and communities impacted by the war in the Middle East. As Chris and I have both mentioned before, the war has meaningfully impacted our IDL segment performance resulting in Q4 comp sales of less than 1%. Despite this, our business model provides stability in our P and L from the negative sales impact in the region. Among the many strategic advantages of McDonald's are our size, scale, and geographic diversity, translating to incredible resilience as a system.\nWe will continue to stay focused on supporting our people and the local communities in which we operate as we work closely with our DL partners in the region. We are extremely proud of the way our system continues to consistently show up for customers in every corner of the world, highlighting time and time again the strength of the McDonald's brand when our system comes together. Providing our customers with affordable options has always been core to our brand, and it's even more important as consumers feel pressure on their spending, particularly the lower income consumer.\nWe continue to listen to our customers by evolving our value offerings, maintaining strong perceptions in value for money and affordability. Canada, for example, maintained their McMuffin and hot coffee pairing this quarter for providing an affordable bundle during a critical day part and helping to drive market share gains in breakfast. The UK followed a similar playbook by expanding their Saver Meal Deals to offer smaller bundles during the morning day part for just a few pounds. Only available through our mobile app, this further cemented McDonald's UK as a destination for great food at great value while contributing to increased loyalty sales.\nThe UK also combined the strength of the McDonald's brand with its proven history of connecting with customers through successful holiday marketing to create Festive Wins, an elevated in-app experience that leaned into the holiday spirit with a fun and interactive calendar promotion through a combination of daily deals, compelling prizes, and exclusive merchandise. Festive Wins boosted digital engagement to an all-time high for the market and generated four million active monthly customers.\nAnd in Australia, the market brought back its 30 Days 30 Deals promotion where customers enjoyed a daily deal available exclusively in the MyMaccas app. From discounts on our most iconic menu items like the Big Mac, Cheeseburger, or our world-famous French fries to unique meal deals, the promotion drove remarkable engagement and contributed to a record number of active loyalty members in the market. Beyond maintaining an affordable price point, we're constantly elevating the McDonald's experience, enhancing the overall value proposition of the brand.\nThis was evident as many markets offered Monopoly this quarter, leveraging learnings from across the globe to create highly interactive campaigns and once again igniting our fans love for McDonald's. The Canadian market tapped into global best practices by offering Monopoly with a double-peel option for the first time this year. By giving customers a second chance to win in the app, the market continued to amplify the digital experience while maintaining those core qualities of the game that our customers love.\nThe customer excitement was on full display and the market achieved record-setting results, generating nearly 700,000 new app customers in just five weeks and driving significant lifts in mobile app sales. In fact, more than 43 million Monopoly codes were digitally redeemed during the promotion. That's more than the entire population of Canada. Germany also experienced record-breaking registrations with their Monopoly program by combining iconic peel-off game pieces with the ability to scan to win prizes in the mobile app. For the first time, Germany offered loyalty points as prizes, rewarding our customers and driving additional digital customer frequency.\nIn France, Monopoly drove additional loyalty sales with an interactive redemption experience for our customers. We continue to navigate a difficult operating environment in the market where results have softened and comp sales were negative for the quarter. Moving forward, we're confident that we have the right leadership team in place with the right experience to reset with our franchisees who I know are committed to restoring our strong foundation. We are acting with a sense of urgency to address our opportunities and maintaining a growth mindset in critical areas like value, core menu, and delivery.\nOur One McDonald's way approach to marketing extends beyond Monopoly as we continue to drive brand strength, building cultural relevance and connecting with our customers and crew in new and exciting ways. This quarter we once again tapped into the nostalgic McDonald's experience of enjoying a Happy Meal as a kid and recreated it for our adult fans featuring our core menu favorites at the center. Originally launched in the US in 2022, we brought back the campaign to the market in December, partnering with artist and creator Kerwin Frost and scaling it to 15 additional markets, including Canada.\nThe excitement for the return of this event was evident, driving a significant social media engagement across many of our channels and by encouraging our customers to trade up with a full margin promotion, we fueled top line growth with a strong average checklist. In an environment where our customers are looking to familiar favorites, those core menu items have never been more relevant or beloved. At the center of our core menu are an iconic portfolio of brands, $17 billion brands in their own right, including four different chicken equities that are each billion-dollar brands.\nWe continued to stay aggressive on chicken this quarter, making further progress towards our ambition of developing a reputation for great chicken. Germany re-hit the McCrispy chicken sandwich with strong results, driving a lift in chicken sandwich sales and building additional customer affinity for the product, and the UK built on its market leadership in chicken by extending the McCrispy brand with a limited time offering, the McCrispy Smokehouse, combining new and exciting flavors and ingredients with our core chicken offerings.\nIn China, with slowing macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence near record lows, the market continued to build brand equity by combining our delicious food with culture and community through a collaboration with local streetwear designer Verdy. The campaign not only featured access to exclusive merchandise, but put our delicious chicken at the center and drove incremental traffic into our restaurants by offering customers a discount on a second order.\nTurning to our P&L, our top line growth drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.95 for the quarter. This is an increase over the prior year of 11% in constant currencies, excluding current year charges of almost $140 million for write-offs of impaired software no longer in use and charges related to our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy. Foreign currency translation positively impacted Q4 results by $0.07 per share for the full year. Adjusted operating margin was just over 47%, reflecting higher restaurant margin dollars across all segments.\nDespite the significant P&L pressures that we've discussed throughout the year, top line results generated $14 billion of restaurant margin for the year, an increase of about 10% in constant currency. Lastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CapEx spend for the year was approximately $2.4 billion, with more than half invested in new unit development across our US and IOM segments. After reinvesting in the business, our free cash flow conversion was in the 90% range for the year, and with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nThanks, Ian. As we look to 2024 with elevated absolute prices and muted consumer confidence, we believe that consumers will continue to be more discriminating with their dollars. But we expect our focus on our MCDs will continue to drive growth across our business. And from a historical perspective, we know our resilience is rooted in our ability to adapt in any environment. McDonald's is one of the world's most recognized and most beloved brands, providing delicious meals at an affordable price and showing up when and where customers need us.\nBy building a One McDonald's way approach to marketing and creative excellence, we will continue to scale the best ideas globally through common tools and processes that help us maximize return on investment and that shine a light on what people love about McDonald's. We're creating an environment that embraces bold, creative, and we're remaining connected to culture by tapping into the moments, memories, rituals, and behaviors that people have with our brand. McDonald's position on value is a competitive advantage. With a strategy rooted in customer behaviors and insights, we are optimizing price while limiting customer resistance.\nAs we continue to attract millions of new loyalty members, we can get even smarter with our pricing methodology and tailor our digital offers to our fans, making them even more personalized. Looking ahead, we'll also continue to make our core menu even more enticing. With initiatives like Best Burger, we've made small changes that are adding up to big differences that our customers are really noticing. Best Burger is now deployed across more than 70 markets, including the US, and we're excited about the potential for growth as it deploys to nearly all markets by 2026.\nAs we look to build on our leadership in beef, we're addressing an unmet customer need across markets for larger, high-quality burgers. We're working horizontally across the system to innovate. As we test and learn, we'll be working to understand how the new offering will complement our already established burgers like the Double QPC or the Big Tasty. We're also excited to further build on our success in chicken by continuing to invest in beloved icons like McNuggets and McChicken while further scaling emerging favorites like McCrispy and McSpicy.\nThese four equities are the building blocks of our growing chicken business and we see the potential to add another point of chicken share by 2026, in part through an expansion of our McCrispy platform into wraps and tenders. We've made incredible progress across our 4Ds by taking the things our customers love about McDonald's from convenience to personal connections with our brand and making them even better. For example, Ready on Arrival will expand across our top six markets by the end of 2025. While we built one of the largest loyalty programs in the world in just a few years, over 150 million active users today represents only a fraction of our total customers.\nWe aim to reach 250 million active users and 45 billion in annual loyalty systemwide sales by the end of 2027. As you heard during our investor update, the world's largest restaurant company is planning to grow even faster over the next four years. We know our ambition to reach 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027 is a compelling opportunity, and we've done our homework. We've identified key areas with high population growth and lower store density across both our IOM and US segments, and that's where we're starting.\nThese opportunities before us in the near term are compelling, but as we plan for long-term growth and solidifying McDonald's leadership position, we've introduced three new platforms that will become part of Accelerating the Arches to build on our competitive advantages, cement our place in culture, and stay one step ahead of the next generation of digital customers.\nThis includes building one of the largest consumer platforms in the world to attract and retain highly valuable digital and loyalty customers. The easiest and most efficient restaurant operating platform that puts intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams and drives a better experience for both our customers and our crew, and a company platform that unlocks speed and innovation. We believe our biggest opportunity to advance and acquire new customers and build more meaningful customer relationships that result in greater frequency and spending is continuing to aggressively invest in digital and technology as a three-legged stool.\nFor our customers we will better leverage the data we have across our loyalty programs to provide targeted offers and personalized experiences, building relationships with the customers that we serve every single day and ensuring that they enjoy a more familiar, consistent experience no matter where they go or how they order. For restaurants, it's investing to put the most intuitive technology in the hands of our restaurant teams that makes their jobs easier and empowers them to provide amazing hospitality while serving hot and accurate orders to customers even faster.\nFor the company, it is building the systems, processes, and tools that will enable our people to be more efficient and innovate with speed and agility. As I've said before, these are bold plans, but our success tomorrow has always depended on our ability to stay ahead of our customers' changing needs while reimagining what a restaurant can be. We're building the engine that will power McDonald's ability to unleash the full strength of our global scale where it counts. I'll now turn it back over to Ian to talk through our 2024 financial outlook.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nThanks Chris. As we've discussed, we continue to operate in a challenging environment with varying levels of headwinds across our markets. Looking ahead to this year, we anticipate these headwinds will continue as the current macro dynamics continue to weigh on both our consumers and our business results, along with the war in the Middle East. As we navigate these ongoing challenges, continuing to execute at the highest level with a laser focus towards growing market share will be critical. It's clear that we've had exceptional success over the last four years with strong broad based momentum and global comp sales of over 30% when compared to 2019.\nIt's truly remarkable, but as we've mentioned before, we anticipate 2024 comp sales growth will continue to moderate as we return to a more normalized level of growth with expectations closer to historical averages of between 3% and 4% in our US and IOM segments. And in IDL, we do not expect to see meaningful improvement until there is a resolution in the Middle East. We expect our net restaurant expansion in 2024 along with restaurants we opened in 2023 will contribute nearly 2% to systemwide sales growth as we begin to accelerate our new unit development and make progress against our target of 50,000 restaurants by 2027.\nWith expectations of moderating sales growth and ongoing inflationary headwinds, we expect our company-operated margin percent will remain pressured in the near term, and we expect the full year 2024 company-operated margin percent will be relatively in line with 2023. Turning to G&A, the financial strength of our system enables us to invest in areas that will drive long-term efficiencies for our people and for our stakeholders. We expect 2024 G&A as a percentage of systemwide sales to be about 2.2%, which reflects elevated investments in technology, digital, and Global Business Services or GBS.\nThrough these investments we'll look to run the business more efficiently over time and ultimately free up more resource to continue to drive long-term growth. Despite headwinds throughout the P&L, we anticipate an operating margin of mid- to high 40% in 2024 driven primarily by top line growth and franchise margin performance. We're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 9% and 11% compared to 2023 due to higher average debt balances and interest rates, and we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%.\nTransitioning to capital expenditures, we plan to spend between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion this year, more than half of which will be dedicated to new unit openings across our US and IOM segments globally. We plan to open more than 2,100 restaurants this year with about 500 of these openings in our US and IOM segments where we continue to see strong returns.\nWe also expect to open more than 1,600 restaurants in our IDL segment this year, including about 1,000 in China where we recently completed the acquisition of Carlyle's 28% stake in McDonald's China. We're excited to have increased our minority ownership to 48% in our second largest and fastest growing market and believe it will enable us to further benefit from the market's long-term potential. Overall, we anticipate about 4% unit growth driven by more than 1,600 net restaurant additions in 2024. And finally, we expect to generate strong cash flow in 2024 with free cash flow conversion in the 90% range.\nGoing forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, investing in the business to drive growth. This includes both capital expenditures as well as increased cash investments in technology, digital, and GBS. Second, returning all remaining free cash flow through dividends and share buybacks over time. While the macro environment remains challenging, we believe that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is the right playbook and we continue to maximize our M, C, and D growth pillars to drive strong results.\nWe have confidence that our competitive strengths and our ability to continue to evolve to stay ahead of the customer positions us to succeed in any economic environment, delivering long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Chris to close.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nFor nearly 70 years, the McDonald's story has been one of growth, a first job for millions, the best franchising opportunity in the world, and a familiar beacon of support for the over 40,000 communities we serve. In fact, our US business generated 1.4 million jobs and contributed $108 billion to the US GDP in the last year alone. Even as the world around us continues to change, the power of our brand has stood the test of time. That's because McDonald's continues to reinvent itself and stay one step ahead of our customers.\nWhile our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, we will only keep growing when we're continuing to take smart risks and operating with the long-term mindset. Ray Kroc said it best. The only way we can advance is by going forward individually and collectively in the spirit of the pioneer, in the pride of accomplishment. Even with all that we've accomplished since the launch of Accelerating the Arches, I am confident that there is so much more that we can achieve. I look forward to coming together with all three legs of our stool at our upcoming worldwide convention this April to share how we will reimagine our future together.\nThank you to our franchisees, suppliers, and employees whose passion and dedication is central to bringing the McDonald's experience to life for our customers each and every day. With that, we'll take questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur first question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThanks. Probably just a two-parter. Quickly, do you think that there's any impact from boycotts to IOM results anywhere, even if they're slight? And then separately, the multiyear trends this year have been stable for a lot of the year. Basically since Q2. I'm really thinking the US. Very strong comps, very strong multi-year trends. So there's no shame in these remaining stable. I'm just wondering if you think that there is a reason for those trends to re-accelerate or there's a lesson in that.\nMaybe your best play because obviously we're dealing through some very noisy months here with weather and whatnot over Q4 and here in January. So, I'm wondering how you're viewing that with the goal perhaps being that multi-year trend can re-accelerate into 2024 and your best play to make that happen. Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nHey David, it's Chris. Thanks for the questions. First, on your question about the Middle East, obviously the place that we're seeing the most pronounced impact is in the Middle East. We are seeing some impact in other Muslim countries like Malaysia, Indonesia. Then as far as IOM impact, it depends on the country. So in a country, for example like France that has a larger Muslim population, we are seeing some impact. In France it depends very much on where the restaurant is located and if it's in a Muslim area. But we are seeing some impact there. Then in other countries like Spain, like in Italy, we're seeing no impact. So it really depends very much on the country.\nBut as I said, the most pronounced impact that we're seeing is in the Middle East and in Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. Also, as we said in our prepared remarks, our outlook is, you know, so long as this conflict, this war is going on, we're not making any plans. We're not expecting to see any significant improvement in this. It's a human tragedy what's going on, and I think that that does weigh on brands like ours.\nBack to your other question about, you know, potentially a re-acceleration. As we also said in the remarks and we also talked about it Investor Day, we're expecting 2024 to be normalizing comp sales growth in that kind of 3% to 4% range, which is where we've been more historically. So we certainly had great performance over whether you look at it on a two-year horizon, a four-year horizon, 30%+ on a four-year horizon, call it 14% or so on a two-year horizon. So feel great about that. But I think we are moving into a 2024 that's going to look more like what you would have considered a typical year prior to COVID and all the things that have gone on.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan\n\nThe question is on France, and France has obviously been a leading market for McDonald's in a lot of ways for a couple of decades now. In some cases, that has actually been a leading indicator of positive performance in other markets, of things that were done in France that were then copied by others quite successfully implemented by others quite successfully. So it's, it did sound like you had some self help in France value, core menu, and delivery. I mean, did you find yourself, I guess, kind of catching up from behind in some of those metrics. I wanted to understand a little bit more, maybe what you could have done differently in Q4 to improve results.\nDo you think possibly there could be some leading indicators in France that are happening now within the market, of course, excluding the Middle East sentiment, you know, that maybe we can apply to other markets to ensure those markets don't dip negative in the near term?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. You're right in pointing out, France for us has been historically one of our best markets. We have some of our highest customer satisfaction in that market. We have some of our highest franchisee cash flows in that market. We're not happy with our performance in France right now. If I were to isolate two areas that we are focused on to improve in France, the first is we did get offsides on value there. The team has done a very nice job in pivoting and just put in place a new value program there that we're seeing great early success with that. But certainly, you know, that was a reaction and we don't want to see that.\nThen second, we continue to have operations opportunities in France, and that's something that we've been having a lot of engagement on with our franchisees. So as I think about IOM, you know, certainly lessons there, but on the positive side, France is certainly our most pressured market right now in France or in IOM. But I also feel very good that we're going to get that business back on track and continue to have the performance that we've become accustomed to in that market over many, many years.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nMaybe, John, I'll just build a bit on Chris' comments. I mean, I think two things. One is, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've got almost an entirely new leadership team in place in the market, a team that has a tremendous amount of McDonald's business experience. And we have a lot of confidence in that team and the experience they bring, I think, to drive the right catalyst. I think when you have a market that maybe is a little bit off track, what you look to have, you got the right people with the right experience to drive change, and then do you feel like you have clarity of sight to the kind of underlying issues that you need to address.\nI think on both of those fronts we feel good. Obviously, as Chris spoke about, it's going to kind of take a moment to get momentum going back in the right direction. But I know together with our franchisees in France, we're going to be aggressive to kind of go after the opportunities that exist. I think we're very, very aligned in how we're approaching that with them.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. First question, as we think about 2024. First, I just wanted to clarify. I think you mentioned 3% to 4% comps in the US and IOM. I'm not used to seeing such specific guidance, so that's encouraging. But I'm wondering if you could share any thoughts on the components of that between pricing, which we get the sense is easing, versus traffic, and then just more broadly the operating margin guidance from mid to high-40% range. That's a fairly wide, I guess, 500 basis points or so range. I'm just wondering if you can help narrow or perhaps talk about what would lead margins to be at the upper versus lower end of that wide range. Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nMorning, Jeff, it's Ian. So let me take that. You know, I think as we talked about on the comps in our opening remarks, you know, I think and we've been talking about it as, you know, pretty consistently over the last couple of quarters as inflation levels have come down and obviously our pricing broadly is coming down in line with kind of inflation, getting back to what I'll call more normal levels. I think that's why we talk about comps kind of getting back to more of that historical norm range of 3% to 4% in both the US and IOM this year. I mean, I think that the only texture I'd give you there is we had a slower start to the year. I think there are a couple of important reasons for that.\nFirstly, we had a really strong start to 2023, so obviously we're, we're lapping against that. And then I think you'll remember a year ago we talked about just the abnormally mild weather that we were dealing with as a tailwind benefit in beginning of 2023 in both North America and Europe. And so we're obviously working against that as well. I think if I was to think about the year, I'd think about the back half of the year probably being slightly stronger, slightly stronger than probably the front half. Just again, we had an incredibly strong first two quarters of 2023 that we're working against.\nAnd I think some of the macro you know, factors that were going to impact us in 2024 could, I think, be slightly easing towards the back half of this year versus the front half. On op margin. Look, I mean, if you go back to 2019, I think we've had a pretty strong demonstration of what we will continue to talk about, which is over time, we certainly believe we continue to be able to drive leverage and op margin as we get the strong top line growth. If you go back to 2019, we were kind of in that 44%-ish range. We ended last year at just over 47%. I think that's a pretty strong proof point of our ability to continue to grow margins as we look forward on a percentage basis.\nI think obviously, as Chris talked about 2024, we've got some headwinds to work through, but feel really confident about our ability to continue to grow margins over time.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nHi, good morning. My question's on the impacts you're seeing in the Middle East. I guess two questions. One, could you help to quantify your estimate on how much that impacted your sales in Q4? And then secondly, could you comment on the health of your franchisees in the areas that have been most impacted, and whether you think some temporary assistance will be needed as you move through 2024?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nHey, David, it's Chris. Just, I'll do a couple things and then let Ian clean up whatever I missed. But we're not going to get into specific numbers on the Middle East. Suffice to say, as you see in our IDL results, you can infer that the impact is meaningful. As I said also in our employee note at the beginning of this year. Then in terms of health of the franchisees, we're really fortunate in that we have some very strong, very well capitalized franchisees in the Middle East. But as we have historically done, as we work through challenges around the world, you know, you've seen us in partnership with franchisees do things to support them during difficult periods.\nThat sometimes can be deferrals, sometimes it can be other forms of support. So those are ongoing conversations that we'll have with our franchisees. We believe that working in partnership with our franchisees and doing things together through good times and bad is the way that we've been successful over time. So it's going to be very much a situation by situation approach that we have in the Middle East, but certainly the impact right now is significant. And, Ian, I'll pass it off to you for anything else you want to add.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris. Maybe just a couple of builds to that. I mean, David, you know that as I've talked about before, I think, you know, we've got an incredibly resilient business model. Obviously, if you look back over the last several years, we've had to work through a number of different external challenges. I think the geographic breadth, the size and scale of our business, and our financial strength means we're in a position of strength to kind of work through any of these challenges, including the one that we're currently facing in the Middle East with the war that's going on in regards to kind of support for franchisees or DL partners.\nYou know, as I've talked about before, I mean, providing support is part of our business model. It's obviously how we work together with our franchisees when conditions outside of their control warrant support. But when we do that, it's always, as you know, targeted and temporary and designed obviously to go to owner operators or partners who are most in need. I think, as Chris said, we've got some incredibly strong partners in the Middle East. The majority of those partners have been with us for 20 years or more.\nWe've worked through a variety of challenges over the years, and I think we'll continue to be focused on supporting our team members in the region, working with the communities that we do business in, and working closely with the DL partners to get through this together. And I'm very, very confident that we'll do that.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\n\nEric Gonzalez\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc\n\nHi, thanks for the question. I'm wondering maybe if you could comment on China specifically. I know it's not a huge part of your profit today, but you do have some big growth aspirations in that country. So if you could comment on some of the macro challenges that you're seeing, how they're impacting results in that country, and maybe talk about how the brand is positioned to gain share of that market? Thanks.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, overall, we had a very good 2023 in China. We were happy with how our business performed in China. We're seeing strong growth there. We also built 1,000 restaurants in China. So we're very much on track from our development aspirations, and we would expect to do something similar in 2024 from that standpoint. So overall, the headline is feel good about what we're seeing in China and the progress and growth. Certainly in China, as you've read about and seen with a number of other companies, consumer sentiment in the country is a little bit more under pressure right now, and that is leading to, in Q4 in particular, we saw the environment get more promotional.\nWe didn't necessarily follow that, but certainly the environment's getting more promotional. And you know, our focus is on making sure that we remain competitive. So we're going to do what we need to do to maintain our competitiveness in that market. But if you think about the overall macro trend in China, I talked about this at Investor Day, we certainly think that we're going to continue to see good comp performance in that market as consumer wealth and GDP continue to grow mid-single digits.\nWe think there's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to build out development and penetration in that market to many places where we don't really have McDonald's presence. So overall outlook on China for us continues to be very robust, which is why we increased our stake as Ian mentioned.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nI might just add on a couple of things to Chris. I mean, first I would just acknowledge the team, our team in China. We opened just over 1,000 restaurants in 2023, which was an all-time high for us. And as Chris mentioned, as we talked about in our remarks, we completed the acquisition of the additional 28% to take our stake to 48% at the end of January. And I think we continue to remain really optimistic about the long-term opportunity there and our ability to have an increased stake in that long-term opportunity with that additional stake acquisition and we're looking forward to getting that market to 10,000 restaurants by end of 2028, which is, I think, a really important milestone as we look forward.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, thank you. Good morning. Maybe I'll just ask about the US. Are you willing to say kind of where pricing was in Q4 and also into Q1, and also, you know, any color you can provide by daypart? I think we've heard some other companies talking more about late night or if you perhaps have any comments on breakfast recently.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, I'll kind of just give some macro comments. Again, have Ian pick any details. But certainly, you know, we've continued to work through pricing in the US as we were looking to offset inflation. We saw what I would describe as mid- to high-single-digit price increases last year. Depends a little bit on where you were in the country. But mid to high-single-digit pricing we are seeing, as I talked about on prior calls, that particularly among the low-income consumer, there's some transaction size reduction that we're seeing. We're also seeing some trade-down there. So that offset a little bit of the pricing, the absolute pricing that we took.\nBut I think, you know, as you think about 2024, certainly inflation is going to be less, probably in the low single-digit inflation in 2024, and that will be consistent with where we end up on pricing from a daypart standpoint. You know, I'd say pretty balanced there. But breakfast continues to be a competitive area. A lot of activity going on in breakfast. Our business as you know, is dominated around particularly lunch. That's our single biggest day part and that day part continues to do well. So nothing particularly noteworthy that I would say on dayparts. But Ian, maybe you have any other insights to shed there?\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nYes, I think covered all the bases, Chris, but maybe just a couple of fills. I mean, I think we did see overall pricing for the year just around 10%. But as Chris noted in Q4, that level of pricing came down obviously in line with inflation and was in that high single digit range. I mean, I think we're continuing to see pretty consistent flow through with pricing, which I think is really important because it goes back to what I've spoken about before and just the tools and capabilities that we've put in place to make sure that when we are taking pricing, you know, we're doing that in the most effective way possible. Obviously as we head into 2024, knowing inflation's come down a fair bit from its peak.\nI think as I said earlier, I think our pricing we certainly expect will come down roughly in line with that as we work through the year. We certainly know consumers are more wary or weary of pricing and we're going to continue to be consumer led in our pricing decisions. As we kind of look forward to 2024 and knowing that the environment will continue to be competitive, we'll be thoughtful together with our franchisees obviously who make those decisions in their own restaurants as we look forward.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you. Chris, wanted to just follow up on some of the color you just gave on the US consumer and some of that lower income consumer, I think, managing the check a little bit. Just curious if you could elaborate anything more there on the consumer in the US and has that check management largely been consistent with what you've seen in recent quarters or are you seeing any of the incidence or intensity there picking up some. And ultimately what does that mean as you kind of think about promotions and the evolving value options that you talk about in the US this year? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nSure. I think consistent with what we talked about on the prior call where you see the pressure with the US consumer is that low income consumer, so call it 45,000 and under. That consumer is pressured from an industry standpoint. We actually saw that cohort decrease in the most recent quarter, particularly I think as eating at home has become more affordable. There's been much less pricing that's been taken more recently on packaged food. So you're seeing that eating at home is becoming more affordable. That I think is putting some pressure from a IEO standpoint on that low income consumer.\nIf you think about middle income, high income, we're not seeing any real change in behavior with those. We continue to gain share with those groups. But the battleground is certainly with that low-income consumer. I think what you're going to see as you head into 2024 is probably more attention to what I would describe as affordability. So think about that as being absolute price point, being probably more important for that consumer in a lower absolute price point to get them into the restaurants than maybe a value message which is a two for six or something like that.\nThose probably are going to resonate a little bit less within 2024, particularly we think at the front half with the consumer than maybe something that's lower absolute price point. So that's, we are set up well to be able to go after that. We have our D123 platform as you know. I think you're going to see probably some activity there in the US at the local level to make sure we continue to provide good value for that low-income consumer.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Thank you. I wanted to ask about G&A and you know it came in actually just below the 2.2% of systemwide sales you guided to, which is true despite the fact that I, you know, I suspect that the systemwide sales were lower than you might have expected in the Q4 given, you know, given the implications in the Middle East. And so I was just curious to what extent are you able to flex your G&A? I know you usually guide to percentage of systemwide sales, but trying to understand whether sort of internally you actually forecast more along the timelines of dollar spend and are you seeing any of the, any improvements perhaps because of Accelerating the Arches? I'm curious to what extent you have flex there.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nHi Sara, it's Ian. Let me take that one. Well, look, I think you've heard me talked about this before, but you know, the way we think about G&A is kind of in two broad buckets. I mean, firstly, we want to continue to work to run our business as efficiently as we can. We know we've got some opportunities in that area. It's why I talked about in our upfront remarks that we're going to continue to invest in the areas where we think we have strategic opportunities to drive greater efficiency.\nA lot of that work is going to be led by the Global Business Services organization that we stood up and is driving these transformation efforts in areas like HR, Finance, Tech, and getting after spend opportunities in areas like indirect sourcing. So part of what we're focused on is continuing to make those strategic investments so that we can continue to drive greater efficiency in how we operate. Which if you go back to the principles of kind of accelerating the organization, which was really what that whole initiative was designed around, was how do we get faster, how do we get more innovative, and how do we get more efficient in how we're running the business?\nThe second kind of broad area of G&A spend is obviously investing in the areas that we feel like we've got opportunity to drive growth and strong returns for the business. Part of running the business more efficiently is to make sure we have the resources available to invest behind the opportunities that we believe exist and we continue to believe we've got significant opportunities. I think we've talked previously to the examples of kind of our tech platforms and digital capabilities where we continue to make significant investment.\nThose, I think, are really strong examples of the type of growth, when you look at the growth mix, that are coming from those investments and obviously continuing to drive strong returns for us. We're going to continue obviously to invest behind those growth opportunity areas that we have. So I think that's over time as you kind of look forward. I do believe we'll continue to be able to gain leverage in G&A as a percentage of sales. But I think certainly in the short term our focus is going to be in those areas that I highlighted.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOur next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.\n\nChris Carril\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning. So just on McOpCo margins, I believe you mentioned you expect them to be relatively in line this year versus 2023. So can you expand maybe on some of the puts and takes around this outlook, maybe any detail on US vs IOM, your cost inflation outlook, and maybe finally if and where you see opportunity for company margin upside? Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's\n\nMorning, Chris. Well, let me take that. Yeah, you're right. I think as you said in our opening comments, we talked about the fact that we think our 2024 company-operated margin percent will be roughly in line with where we ended for 2023. I mean, I think there are a few things that are going on. So I'll kind of talk about it, US and then international. I mean, I think in the US if you look at kind of commodity inflation for 2024, we think that'll be in the low single digit range. I think wage inflation probably in the mid to higher single digit range.\nPart of that is because of the impact of what we're going to have to work through in California, which I know you'll be aware of, and the significant wage increases that come into effect there at the beginning of April. I think internationally on the commodity side, again I think we expect commodity inflation to be in that low single-digit range, wage inflation probably in the low to mid single-digit range. So obviously we've still got kind of the current inflationary effects, and at the same time we've got obviously carryover from much higher kind of inflation levels that we experienced as we work through 2023.\nSo those are a bit of maybe kind of the kind of pressures. Obviously you've heard us talk about what we think from a sales perspective. So obviously we're going to get a lift as we continue to grow sales through 2024, landing kind of where I said. I, you know, I think we remain really confident that we can continue to drive leverage in margins as we look forward, as some of these inflationary pressures begin to settle on a more consistent basis, and we're able to continue to grow sales, which we're obviously really, really confident in our ability to do that with the plans and strategies that we've got in place.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nWe have time for one more question from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Just follow up. Given the modest pricing in 2024 in the US, do you expect positive traffic then? And then my actual question on the digital side, can you talk about any changes related to your approach specifically to value offers as you look ahead in 2024 in the US? Have a lot of promotions on the app, but also driving higher ticket frequency. So just to what extent is digital marketing accretive to franchisees? And just any thoughts there? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nCEO and President, McDonald's\n\nSure. Well, as you know, we don't give traffic guidance so we won't get into kind of a specific what do we expect to see in traffic. But I think it's fair to say that the success in this industry is always about having balance. You need to have both traffic growth and you need to have price growth. That's the long term formula for success. That's kind of what we use as our North Star. I think we're set up really well to have that kind of balance. As I look at our business around the world, our brand's in great shape. We are seeing some of our highest customer satisfaction scores around the world.\nWe're seeing our operations in almost every single country around the world get better as we execute our performance and customer excellence program, or PACE as you know it. I think globally in Q4 we saw service times improve by 10 seconds and we've got very good alignment with our franchisees in most of our big markets. We're seeing, you know, healthy franchisee cash flows. In the US franchisee cash flows were up roughly $35,000 last year despite all the price headwinds. So I think we're set up well as a business to have that balance right as part of our long term focus.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's\n\nOkay, thank you, Chris. Thanks Ian. Thanks everyone for joining. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation investor call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star one on their touch-tone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Ceplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Ceplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and re-enter the queue for additional questions. Just one other piece of housekeeping today before I turn it over to Chris.\nAs many of you are aware, we'll host an investor update at our McDonald's headquarters on Wednesday, 6 December, where Chris and Ian will be joined by members of our senior leadership team to provide an update on our strategic priorities, followed by a Q&A session. I ask that you please be mindful of this with your questions on the call today, and focus questions on our quarterly results in the current year. We'll spend more time on 2024 and our strategic priorities in December, with plenty of time for Q&A on that day. Details for the event and how to tune in can be found on the Investor Events section of our website. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning. Over the past quarter, we've seen yet again the broad-based momentum across the McDonald's business despite continued headwinds and a challenging macro environment. Around the world, we're operating from a position of strength as the industry's market share leader. In Q3, we achieved comparable global sales of nearly 9%. As we expect and as we mentioned in prior earnings calls, our top-line growth, while strong across each of our segments and at an elevated level versus historical norms, has continued to moderate.\nHowever, we continue to outpace our competitors thanks to our system's outstanding execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy. Over the past year, we've been more intentional about sharing and scaling world-class ideas that drive impact globally. Central to our continued strength is how we maximize our marketing to stay relevant to customers.\nIn August, we launched As Featured In in over 100 markets, making it our largest global campaign to date. The campaign celebrates the most memorable McDonald's references across the world of entertainment, with over 20 McDonald's integrations that span across Hollywood, Bollywood, anime, and independent film. It's also another proof point of the impact and power that a One McDonald's Way approach to marketing can have to drive engagement, allowing our markets to remain globally consistent but locally relevant. Celebrating our core equities, As Featured In demonstrates that McDonald's and our iconic menu is a cultural touchstone that immediately connects fans to characters and stories, with over 85% positive consumer sentiment and in the top 30% of campaigns for customer engagement.\nAs I recently visited Australia and New Zealand, I was energized to see other examples of One McDonald's Way in action, or one Maccas way, as our friends down under call it. It was clear that our continued menu discipline and reduced restaurant complexity across these markets is driving operational improvements. By creating a one Maccas way approach to the crew experience by utilizing consistent, comprehensive resources, we're creating a better customer experience as a result. Speaking of One McDonald's Way, Australia was our first market to launch Best Burger, and with resounding success. Great tasting burger perceptions continue to grow, and the Maccas team has reached an all-time high in beef burger share. And now, Best Burger has been scaled to over 70 markets around the world, building on learnings from the original launch in Australia.\nAustralia is also a good example of a market that has room to grow through new restaurant openings. We expand our footprint in the market from a position of strength. We're also enhancing existing restaurant capacity by introducing delivery rooms and integrated McCafe beverage cells that will allow us to better drive growth against our MCDs. We'll share more details on our plans related to the fourth D development in December at our investor update. McDonald's reliability, value, and feel-good experiences continue to play a key role in connecting to our customers, not just in Australia, but across all our markets, offering delicious food at an affordable price and at the convenience our customers have come to expect. It's promising that our markets continue to grow share despite the cost of living pressures.\nAs we had expected early in the year and have talked about on prior earnings calls, it's clear that consumers continue to be more discriminating about what and where they spend. Between inflation remaining high, the elevated cost of fuel, interest rates, housing affordability pressures, and more, consumers all over the world are having to pay more and more for everyday goods and services. Proven time and time again in difficult economic times, the McDonald's brand and our positioning on value is an opportunity for us. Take Germany, for example. The team has delivered remarkable results with the launch of the McSmart menu earlier this year, offering smaller, more affordable meals. It's an incredible example of remaining agile and listening to our customers.\nOur German team heard from customers that they were craving these options, and McSmart made our menu more accessible to them, contributing to outperformance and value perceptions when compared to the rest of the industry. It was an important driver of delivering Germany's 10th quarter of double-digit sales growth. We're always pushing ourselves to stay one step ahead of the customer, as we have throughout our history, by innovating and reinventing ourselves, even as we're operating from a position of strength.\nMcDonald's is one of those consumer brands that has the permission and power to be part of people's everyday lives. One of the great things about McDonald's is that we don't rest on our laurels. We continue to find new ways to earn customer visits, and we believe the actions we've taken over the last several years have laid the foundation for our continued success.\nThis starts with strong local leadership and franchisee alignment. When we combine that with a fully modernized estate, a globally recognized brand, delicious food on our core menu, and a high level of execution across our 4Ds, our competitive strength is on full display. And while the macro environment will remain uncertain, we believe our brand and our business are well positioned to win.\nThis powerful combination of brand, physical advantages, and digital penetration has positioned us as an industry leader. And as we continue to keep a constant pulse on what's top of mind for our customers, we believe that we'll maintain our leadership position and continue to connect our brand to consumers in a way that drives growth and momentum for the business. I remain confident in our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the enduring strength of the McDonald's brand. I'll now turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning. Our Q3 results yet again demonstrate strong restaurant-level execution across our Accelerating the Arches growth pillars, with significant increases in customer satisfaction across most of our major markets. Our restaurants are offering customers an affordable destination every day for delicious food and great service, driving nearly 9% global comp sales for the quarter.\nThanks to the tireless efforts of our entire McDonald's system, the McDonald's brand remains stronger than ever. The resilience of our business is rooted in our ability to adapt to any environment. As expected, challenging macro dynamics continued this quarter, and consumer spending remained pressured. While top-line growth has continued to moderate in line with our expectations, we're outperforming the industry, and we remain the leader in value and affordability perception across most of our largest markets. Providing affordable options for our customers has always been core to McDonald's success.\nAnd continuing to evolve these options as customer needs change remains critical. As Chris mentioned a few minutes ago, it's clear that our customers continue to seek reasonably priced meals as rising costs persist and our markets around the world continue to respond. Germany delivered its highest-ever monthly sales performance by focusing on the evolving needs of our customers amid increasing macro pressures. The market launched a Your Remix, Your Deal promotion exclusively in the app, allowing customers to build their own small bundles. Beyond affordability, this promotion offered the personalization our customers are looking for and significantly increased customer engagement, which was evident in an additional 1,090,000 active loyalty members in Q3.\nThis approach of smaller, more affordable bundles featuring our core menu favorites was first highlighted earlier this year in Germany and the UK, with the launch of new permanent value offerings, and has since been adapted locally in other markets. In Canada, a highly competitive breakfast market, the team offered customers a more affordable option with a McMuffin and hot coffee pairing. By simply featuring our core products at a compelling price point during a critical day part, we drove market share gains in both breakfast and coffee, demonstrating how providing customers what they want at great value always resonates. The D123 Everyday Value Menu in the US takes a similar approach to affordable bundles, with nationally promoted products at locally relevant price points. The platform features products such as the McDouble or 4-piece McNuggets.\nWith a bundle offered at each day part, customers can visit McDonald's for an affordable meal no matter the time of day. While prices have evolved over time, the featured products have remained the same, providing customers with their familiar favorites from our core menu. This consistency in our value offerings means customers know exactly what to expect every time they visit us, driving our strong position as the affordability leader in the market. In China, with slowing macroeconomic conditions and historically low consumer sentiment, the market relaunched a campaign with small price-pointed bundles featuring our hot delicious burgers. Designed to engage our Gen Z consumers, this promotion drove meaningful customer demand and increased beef share in the market. Beyond the price of our food, we're continuing to provide customers with new experiences, further elevating their value perceptions.\nMany markets are using our digital app to drive engagement and increase loyalty participation with our fans through exclusive activations. This was on display through recent Monopoly campaigns in several markets. Starting with Australia, where Monopoly contributed to record digital sales in the market for the quarter, fueled by higher app registrations and increased GamePiece redemptions. In the UK, Monopoly returned for the 17th consecutive year, featuring a double peel option, encouraging customers to scan their GamePieces into the app.\nMonopoly once again ignited our fans' love of the brand and delivered higher levels of app engagement than ever before. Spain had similar success with their Monopoly promotion over the summer. Now leveraging the same app features as the UK, the promotion delivered significant increases in both app downloads and registrations. This is another great example of sharing best bets across our system to fuel our digital growth ambitions.\nIn fact, in our top six markets, digital sales represented more than 40% of system-wide sales, or nearly $9 billion for Q3. We now have over 57 million 90-day active members across these top markets, and our relationship with them continues to grow. We're learning when they visit, how they visit, and what they buy, with more and more of our sales coming through identified channels than ever before.\nBy continuing to elevate the McDonald's digital experience, our customers feel more connected to the brand, driving those incremental visits that we believe would otherwise go uncaptured. And it gives us more ways to reunite with customers who haven't visited us in a while. Beyond Monopoly, the brand was at the center of our marketing yet again this quarter, as we leveraged a One McDonald's Way approach to celebrating the FIFA Women's World Cup in July.\nWith record-breaking viewership and fan engagement, our brand was part of a cultural moment, and we continued to elevate our creative excellence through a scalable, culturally relevant campaign. This came to life through global activations across 28 markets, tapping into local fan excitement, and was supported by a fully integrated social, digital, streaming, and content strategy. Even more exciting, we celebrated our restaurant teams by sending crew members who go above and beyond to attend the live matches.\nAcross the As Featured In campaign, Monopoly activation, and the FIFA Women's World Cup, I can't think of another time when we better utilized our scale to leverage great marketing ideas across our system, which is a tangible demonstration of our Accelerating the Organization principles in practice. Our food is at the heart of our customers' relationship with the brand.\nThis is why we're also taking a One McDonald's Way approach to our menu, further fueling our chicken ambition by scaling core chicken equities. Our McCrispy chicken sandwich continues to be an important driver of chicken share growth, having first launched in 2022 and now a billion-dollar brand across multiple markets. McCrispy was the most recently launched in Australia this quarter, where early results indicate a lift to chicken category sales while bringing a renewed focus to our chicken portfolio. The UK continued to drive excitement in chicken by creating fresh takes on our new global favorites. This past quarter, the market featured a new line extension, the McCrispy Deluxe, offered alongside the McCrispy and the McSpicy in the market.\nBy combining strong execution of our core menu offerings with new flavor news and limited additional complexity, we continued to strengthen our chicken credibility with customers and maintain our market share leadership in the chicken category. Across each of our Accelerating the Arches growth pillars, it is clear that our playbook is working. Thanks to the resilience of our system and the strong execution across the M, Cs, and Ds, we're staying relevant to our customers as their needs continue to change.\nTurning to the P&L, our strong top-line performance drove adjusted earnings per share of $3.19 for the quarter. This is an increase over the prior year of 16% in constant currencies, excluding current year charges primarily related to Accelerating the Organization restructuring costs. Our company-operated margin performance remains pressured by continued cost inflation, in line with our expectations.\nWe expect these macro headwinds will continue in the Q4. Strong franchise sales performance continues to be partially offset by targeted and temporary franchisee assistance provided mainly to our European franchisees where elevated costs continue to pressure restaurant cash flows. We're still anticipating that these efforts will have an impact of $100 to 150 million on our full-year results.\nTotal restaurant margin dollars grew by about $335 million in constant currencies, or about 10% for the quarter. G&A for the quarter increased 1% in constant currency, and our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was nearly 21%. Adjusted year-to-date operating margin is 47.5%, driven by our strong top-line growth. For the full-year, we now expect adjusted operating margin to be about 47%, including an expected property gain in other operating income in the Q4, and G&A of about 2.2% of system-wide sales.\nForeign currency translation positively impacted Q3 results by about $0.08 per share, with a slight tailwind expected for the full-year. As I wrap up, I want to touch on the recent dividend increase approved by our board of directors in early October. This marks our second consecutive annual increase of 10%, and we're extremely proud of our track record of delivering meaningful cash return to shareholders, marked by our 47th consecutive dividend increase. This demonstrates our confidence in the Accelerating the Arches strategy and our commitment to a long-term growth for the system and our shareholders. I look forward to sharing more with you at our investor update in December. And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Ian. As we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment, what remains unwavering is our commitment to creating an environment where the entire McDonald's system thrives together. Through our Accelerating the Arches strategy, we've acquired an industry-leading digital loyalty base that complements our restaurant footprint. We're retaining top talent who are passionate about the McDonald's brand. Our restaurant teams are executing at a high level, customer satisfaction is increasing, and we continue to attract the best franchisees in the world as a franchisor of choice.\nDespite ongoing legislative and regulatory headwinds, we are committed to mobilizing our system to protect franchisee decision-making at a local level and on building a long-term presence in civic spaces to advocate for policies that benefit local restaurant owners and the communities they serve. We're also fulfilling our purpose of feeding and fostering community.\nIn September, we hosted our second Global Volunteer Month, where over 6,400 volunteers across 12 markets spent an estimated 26,000 hours giving back to local communities. At the beginning of October, McDonald's was named to Fast Company's list of brands that matter for a company whose work is moving the needle on critical issues and that display the highest level of commitment to their purpose and values. While our strategy is working, our customers continue to expect even more of us, and we're prepared to meet that challenge. What Ray Kroc said in 1967 still stands true today. We are living in a rapidly changing world, so McDonald's will change with it. Change is our only constant.\nAs was the case for those who came before us, who built McDonald's into the global leader it is today, we will earn our success, and together as a system, we will lay the foundation for our future. On Wednesday, 6 December, I hope you'll join us to hear more at our investor update as we look to the growth potential that lies ahead and share our plans for the future. It makes me excited to think about what the next five to 10 years will bring for McDonald's.\nWe believe that because we're operating from a position of strength with a strategy that continues to deliver, we now have the opportunity, the ability, and the obligation to reimagine our brand for the future. I look forward to seeing you in Chicago this December, and now I'll hand it over to Mike for Q&A. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur first question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nRestaurant Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. Hi. Thank you very much. Obviously, value is a big focus on this call. And I wanted to ask, I guess, the focus on value in the context of recent average ticket increases for you and really across the sector, much of which is driven by premiumization, customization, larger sizes, what have you. In other words, price increases in average ticket beyond just that of price. So as we talk about value, what does that mean to future price increases?\nIs there an intention to do value, in particular bundle value, to where the average ticket can be protected, or would you sacrifice some average ticket in order to get future market share gains and presumably transaction gains? Thank you.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, John. And on value, I think it's always a focus at McDonald's. I mean, we're a business built on value and convenience with great tasting food. So we're always keen to focus on value. I think certainly given the inflation that the market has experienced, that we've experienced over the last year, really more than a year, we've tried to be very choiceful and disciplined on how we have executed those price increases. And the good news is we continue to lead on affordability. We continue to lead on value for money. We've seen no deterioration in our advantages there. We are holding those up.\nHow we do it varies by market, so I wouldn't give you a generalized statement about how we approach value. It's up to each individual market to think about how they continue to deliver the customer-grade value. But I can tell you on every single major market that we look at, the teams are doing a great job on value. They're delivering against it. And we're seeing really no change at all in terms of customer acceptance pass-through on pricing, which to me is also an indication that the teams are striking a right balance. All right. Next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks. Yeah. And thanks for the color and the marketing initiatives in the IOM countries. And it does sound like there's a bit more focus on value, but I'd love to hear how trends might be settling out in these big IOM countries, the big five, so to speak, in the post-COVID mobility recovery world. In other words, maybe back to school might be a good way to look at that as you get past the tourism boost of the summer. Maybe you're getting a sense of what type of comps we should be expecting for these IOM markets. So any color about the type of consumer environment you're seeing in these markets, how same-store sales trends really exited the quarter would be very helpful.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks, David. I'll start at a high level and then hand it over to Ian to give you any more texture on that.But at a high level, we continue to be very pleased with how our IOM business is performing. We're seeing whether you look on the quarter, the year, or a four-year stack, this business is continuing to perform very well overall. We're also seeing that there's great execution. We're seeing customer satisfaction scores increasing in almost all of our major IOM markets.\nSo overall, we feel good. In Europe in particular, we've certainly seen more inflation in Europe, and so the team there has had to be probably even more laser-focused on making sure that we deliver great value. But the business overall, not seeing any big change quarter-to-quarter in terms of how it's performing, but I'll give it over to Ian to give you some more texture.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, David. Yeah. Just maybe a couple of builds to what Chris mentioned. I mean, again, I think if you look at the comps for the quarter across IOM at 8.3%, that's a pretty strong indication of the consistency and fundamental underlying momentum that we've got in the segment. We had positive traffic growth in the segment, which I think is an indication of how that momentum is obviously from a sales and traffic perspective. And we're continuing to grow market share across the majority of those large markets, which tells us, despite as Chris talked to some of the different macro or consumer environments in those markets, which are obviously varied, obviously some of those markets, there's a fair bit of pressure from a macro headwind or consumer headwind.\nWe're continuing to do well versus the landscapes around us. I mean, I think we have spoken, and you heard it in our opening remarks around the expectation that we're going to continue to see moderation in that top line as inflation levels continue to come down, and obviously pricing comes down in line with that. But I think we're in a really good spot, and I think that just speaks to how our strategic plan around Accelerating the Arches continues to resonate with consumers consistently across the business.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAll right. Next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi. Good morning. My question's on the cost side. I think you lowered your SG&A outlook, at least as a percentage of system sales versus what you had given us last time. And I was just wondering, what changed in that outlook? Is it a matter of some of the savings and accelerating the organization's coming through, or delays in investment spending? I guess any context you could give us on that front would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, David. Ian, obviously. So let me try and give you some color there. I mean, I think as we said in our guidance at the beginning of the year, we expected G&A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 2.2% to 2.3%. And obviously, we've updated that to say more about 2.2%, so it's come down marginally. I think obviously we've had some really strong top-line results this year, so obviously that's a partial element of the benefits. And I think the other part is just timing of spend. I mean, we are kind of a back-half-weighted spend cycle within the business.\nI think Q4 more pronounced from a quarterly standpoint, so we do expect a higher level of spending as we get into Q4. But I think just there's a timing element of just kind of how the investments that we're making. I talked about kind of two areas on our last quarterly call where we continue to invest. One is behind technology and digital, which we believe continue to provide strong opportunities for growth, and we're going to continue to invest when we have those opportunities. I think we've got a pretty strong track record in how those investments are delivering for the business. The other area is around our Global Business Service organization, which we stood up earlier this year as part of Accelerating the Organization.\nWe spent a lot of time over the last six months or so looking at what we believe the opportunities are for the business there. I think we've got good line of sight into some things that we think can drive kind of sustainable efficiencies from an operational perspective as we go forward, and we're certainly investing now behind some of those areas of opportunity. So I would call it a little bit more of kind of the timing of spend around those initiatives and more of a focus in the first half of the year on kind of bringing our ATO organizational changes to life. All right. Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just focused on the US consumer. I'm just wondering if you'd talk about any change in behavior, whether there was a change in trend through the quarter or more recently into the Q4. I just wonder if there's pressure in some areas, maybe benefit from trade down in others. But otherwise, you mentioned in the release, I think that the US comp was driven by strategic menu pricing, no mention of the traffic. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a breakdown of that US comp components, whether the lack of traffic growth is a concern looking at 2024, how you think about those components within that US comp. Thank you.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Jeff. I'll answer, and then if Ian has anything else he wants to pick up on this. But specific to the US, we've been talking about how the consumer is more discriminating because of all the price pressures that they're facing, as well as interest rates, things like that. What you end up seeing is that the pressure is felt more on the lower-income consumer. And so one of the things that we saw industry-wide is that that low-income consumer, which we would say is $45,000 and under, was negative from an industry standpoint.\nIf you zoom out and you think about our performance relative to that, we continue to have on the full-year basis traffic growth. We had a slight dip in traffic. We went slightly negative in Q3. We expected that because of what we were lapping. But if you look at us on a two-year stack in the quarter, our traffic is up strongly.\nSo I think we're just going to need to continue to keep a close eye on that 45,000 and under consumer because of the pressure that they're feeling there and make sure that we're offering value, but hopefully the industry stays disciplined as well on pricing. Maybe just I'll just add a bit of a build to Chris's commentary, which certainly has hit the headlines, but just maybe because I think the texture is really important in the quarter.\nI mean, I think the headline would be on an overall basis that we maintained our QSR traffic market share in the quarter. And I think we continue to see really strong share gains in both beef and chicken being the kind of two key elements of the category. We continued to gain share with both the middle and higher-income consumers.\nAnd that speaks a little bit, Jeff, to what you called out, which is that we're certainly partly benefiting from the trade down from more expensive alternatives within those kind of income or segment levels. We held share with the lower-income consumer in a pretty competitive marketplace. But I think the headline is that the comparable, as Chris talked about, industry traffic was down in the quarter as it has been for the last couple of quarters. And so our comparable traffic was marginally down as a result of that. And I would want to highlight, I think, the strength of our top-line performance overall through our comp sales, which remain industry-leading, as you've seen in what we've announced for this quarter.\nAnd I think that's a combination of our strategic strengths coming together, which we've been working on over the last couple of years. We've got a fully modernized estate. We've got a digital platform that's coming to life and scale that's allowing us to really interact with our consumers on a much more individual basis. Our marketing execution, which I think has really been elevated and is resonating in a more culturally relevant way with our consumers. And then I would just call out, I think, and this is really specific to the US business, the outstanding execution our whole system is delivering.\nWe know we're delivering a better experience for customers. We know we're better staffed. And as Chris talked about earlier, we know we've got a leading position on value for money and affordability. I think as a result of all of that, we certainly believe we continue to be in an advantaged position as we continue to kind of lean into these macro headwinds that we're obviously having to navigate. All right. Next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\n\nEric Gonzales\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHey. Thanks for the comment on traffic. I'm wondering if you could expand on the pricing discussion. I think last quarter you said you expected pricing to be in the double digits for the year. So maybe you can comment on what that might imply for the Q4. Perhaps you can give us an early look on what we should expect for 2024, whether that would be that you expect price to be a little bit more normalized than what we've seen in the last few years. Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, Eric. It's Ian. Let me talk a little bit about pricing. Obviously, this is specific to the US because obviously pricing varies across markets depending on the context in the individual marketplace. I think as I talked about last quarter, certainly continue to believe that our average pricing level in the US business for the full-year will be just over 10%. I think what we did see in Q3, and this is the first time now in a number of quarters, is that our average pricing level has started to come down in terms of the rate of increase. I think that speaks to the fact, as we've spoken to before, that inflation is starting to come down. Of course, we expect pricing to come down kind of in line with how inflation's coming down.\nI think as we've talked about before, our US business has been really disciplined in how they have continued to take pricing. We've put a lot of effort in over the last couple of years to, I think, the data and analytical capability that comes from our third-party advisors who obviously make pricing recommendations to our business, including our franchisees who obviously make their own pricing decisions.\nI think the fact that we continue to maintain that leadership position in both value for money and affordability speaks to the fact that even though we've obviously had elevated pricing levels on the back of elevated cost and inflationary pressures, that we have been able to execute that in a way that has minimized the resistance from the customer and maximized the flow-through that we're getting as a result of those price increases. I would say our flow-through continues to kind of be in line with historical norms, which I think speaks to the capability and the position that we've been able to deliver with pricing. So again, I think we've talked about moderation. I think part of that will be pricing if inflation continues to kind of come down as we look forward.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nEquity Research, UBS\n\nGreat.Thank you. I wanted to just ask a bit more on how you're thinking about maintaining that underlying momentum and share gains in the US. As you think about some of the key drivers in place across the three Ds, the operational execution that you're speaking to, value, the Ready On Arrival, Best Burger, etc., Chris, can you sort of unpack latest thoughts on some of these most impactful traffic and sales opportunities into next year and even beyond?\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThank you. Great. Well, thanks for the question. I guess I'd start with, I look forward to seeing you at 6 December because we'll get into a lot more in that about how we see the outlook for next year and some of the specific things that we've got planned to continue to drive the business. But I would say broadly, we think our strategy, our Accelerating the Arches strategy, still has a lot of runway in it.\nEach of the growth pillars, the marketing, core menu, and four Ds, we think that there's still a lot more that we can do underneath each of those. Again, we'll be more specific about what that is on 6 December. And then if you think about more broadly, what's happening right now is this business is starting to amass on the digital side some pretty significant scale.\nAnd the scale that we're building on the digital side opens up a lot of opportunities that we think, quite honestly, are going to be difficult for our competitors to match. And so when you take our physical presence, having more restaurants in the US than anyone else, our digital presence, which is bigger than anybody else in the US, along with great execution, which we're seeing with strong consumer satisfaction scores, our service times are down roughly nine seconds in the quarter. They're down slightly less than that, but still down, I think, about seven seconds on the full-year. We're in a really strong position in the US to continue the growth that we've got.\nMaybe one just small build, Dennis, and I'll be a bit of a broken record on this, but I wouldn't underestimate some of those things that we've done over the last couple of years, like the fully modernized estate. I mean, imagine, and this is the situation that some of our competitors are in today, that you're trying to do that today in an environment of pressured cash flows and higher interest rates. I mean, we've got a fully modernized estate, as Chris talked about. We've got a modernized digital platform that continues to grow. And I think that's fundamentally some of these significant investments that we've made have been critically important as we head into this more kind of macro headwind and volatility. Yeah.\nJust one thing Ian said that triggered as well a thought, which is, being able to drive the business, we need our franchisees to be in a strong position. And franchisee cash flow in the US is up this year. We're up in the quarter. So I think that just goes to sentiment. It's much more challenging, as you would imagine, to continue to drive the business if the franchisees are not seeing it flow through. And fortunately for us, we're seeing good flow-through for our franchisees despite having to absorb quite a bit of inflation, both on the food and paper side as well as on the labor side. So that's another thing that gives us confidence as we head into the new year. Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLauren Silberman\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Appreciate it. So I just want to follow up on the commentary regarding the competitive environment. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the promotional environment, any uptick in discounting across the industry, and how might your approach to value change if the consumer gets weaker? And then I guess related, any color on same-store sales across different day parts or any greater competitive activity in certain day parts? Thank you.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll take the overall terms of the competitive landscape and let Ian speak specifically to the day-part question. But overall, I think what you're seeing there is everybody is looking to make sure that they are competitive from a value standpoint with the consumer.\nParticularly, I talked about earlier that low-income consumer, which I would say is, let's call that in this particular instance, 45,000 and under, that part of the business we're seeing traffic in the quarter was down. There is a step up that we're seeing in some promotional activity by some of our competitors, but nothing alarming on that, nothing that I'd say is looking to be what we would say is beyond prudent. So we're going to just continue to monitor it. We are focused on maintaining our value leadership, and we're going to do what we need to do to maintain our value leadership. But I think we've also got lots of things that go into value. It goes beyond just price. It incorporates delivering a better customer experience, which we're doing through faster service times, improved hospitality.\nIt goes to doing that through a modernized estate, which we've got that is not something true across the rest of the industry. We're seeing great execution, which means consumers are getting hotter, faster, better-tasting food. So all those things go into value perception, which is why we're seeing our value perception hold up in the industry despite some of these pressures. So I don't foresee any big changes there, but certainly everybody is paying attention to that. For the specific day parts, I'll let Ian talk about that a little bit more.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Morning, Lauren. Maybe building on the day parts, and again, I'm using the US as the specific context, we've had pretty strong and consistent performance across all the day parts in the business. So I don't think there's one day part that I would call out where we aren't seeing strong performance.\nI do think, as we've seen kind of, I'll call it a bit of a more return to work and return to office routine, there's probably a little bit more pressure in the breakfast day part just as some of those competitors who've been further behind in recovery are kind of coming to life in that category. But again, we're continuing to see good performance there. And maybe the only other build, and this is a bit with an international lens on value, is you've heard us speak to some of the, I would call it, adjustments that some of our international markets have made to value.\nMaybe one I would just call out is in Canada where the team there put a morning offer in place, which was a McMuffin and coffee pairing. Breakfast in Canada is a pretty important day part. Coffee is a pretty important part of that day part. And so I think our markets are going to continue to front-foot it and proactively make sure that we're adjusting value so it's relevant to what our consumers are looking for as the context continues to evolve. And value, as Chris talked about, is a strategic part of our fundamental business model, but we are obviously going to continue to listen to our customers and make sure we're delivering what they need and what they expect from us.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAll right. Next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Good morning. As it relates to the US company-owned restaurant margins, they expanded this quarter for the first time in two years, albeit modestly, but a good indication of maybe your franchise store-level margins as well. What was the biggest driver of this? Was it simply easing food cost inflation against still strong pricing, or was there anything else to point to? And could this be a potential turning point for restaurant margin stabilization in the US or maybe even perhaps some expansion moving forward?\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, Brian. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, I think what I would say on company-operated restaurant margins: we've been pretty consistent in if you look at the full-year 2023, we expect company-operated margin percent both in the US and IOM to be in line roughly with where we landed in Q4 2022. I think that view hasn't changed. Obviously, we've had really strong sales performance this year, which is helping.\nI think as you've heard me talk about before, the only way you sustainably work through periods of higher inflation in the business is obviously to continue to grow the top line and deliver strong performance. That's what we're focused on. We're obviously very confident as we're able to continue to do that that we're going to be able to kind of see improved restaurant margin from a percentage basis performance, in addition, obviously, to the really strong dollar growth that we're seeing on the back of those strong top-line sales. I think no change to what we expect for the full-year this year, but I think we feel like we're in really good position with the momentum we've got across the business.\nThe other thing that I would just add on the McOpCo side, but it's also something that we've seen with franchisees, is they're experiencing these gains even though roster sizes are growing. I think part of the benefit that we're seeing is turnover is down. So even as we're expanding roster sizes in our McOpCo restaurants, the team has done a really nice job, and we're seeing turnover levels down pretty significantly from prior year. All of that has benefits associated with it. Of course, you have less training, but you also have improved execution. I think that's one thing that we're seeing. That also, as you extend out to franchisees, franchisees' roster sizes are up versus last year. Applications are up significantly.\nSo, I do think, to this question about is something turning on the labor side in the US, we're definitely seeing a turn there to the positive, in terms of having our restaurants fully staffed and having lower turnover as a result of that. All right. Next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Harbour\n\nEquity Analyst and Executive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thank you. Good morning. You commented sort of on the US side, but just within IOM and IDL, same-store sales, wondering if you had any comments on kind of the check versus traffic component. And then also just within the US, I was curious if you had a sense for roughly how much your California franchisees will be seeing wages go up and how much pricing they might presumably take to offset that.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll cover just the California question, and then Ian can cover the rest of what you laid out specifically around IOM. But as you mentioned and noted, California, with the passage of the recent legislation there around what that's going to do to wages, there is going to be a wage impact for our California franchisees. I don't think at this point we can say exactly how much of that is going to work its way in through pricing.\nCertainly, there's going to be some element of that that does need to be worked through with higher pricing. There's also going to be things that I know that the franchisees and our teams there are going to be looking around productivity. How all of that plays out, there will certainly be a hit in the short term to franchisee cash flow in California.\nTough to know exactly what that hit will be because of some of the mitigation efforts, but there will be a hit. Longer term, what we've been talking about with our franchisees is this is an opportunity for us to gain share because this is an impact that's going to hit all of our competitors. We're in a better position. We believe we're in a better position than our competitors to weather this. And so let's use this as an opportunity to actually accelerate our growth in California and accelerating our growth along with some mitigation. The two of those in combination is the best way to minimize any impact long-term on franchisee cash flow. With that on California, let me have Ian just cover the rest of your questions on international.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. Morning, Brian. So let me try and give you a bit of texture on kind of IOM and IDL. I mean, I think you've obviously seen the headline comp numbers for the quarter, which I think are obviously really strong. I would say the consistency is the broad-based, and I think consistency of the momentum we're seeing, which just goes back to what we've talked about earlier today, which is our Accelerating the Arches strategy continues to really deliver pretty consistent results across the business. I mean, of course, when there are 100-plus markets, there are always a couple of markets that are maybe dealing with more kind of headwinds than others. I mean, I think in IOM, France would certainly be one of those markets.\nWe spoke a little bit about that on the Q2 call, but I think if you look at the QSR sector in France, still hasn't recovered back to where it was in 2019. I mean, we have generally been taking share in the marketplace, but I think the consumer sentiment with everything that's going on, which is consistent obviously across all markets, higher inflation, higher interest rates.\nThen I think in France, as we worked through the summer, you saw a level of social unrest. You saw some kind of violent activity coming out of that social unrest. I think that's all kind of dampened consumer demand. So I think our team in France is really, really focused on having good clarity on what we need to continue to do, and we're going to continue to deliver even in that more difficult environment. But broadly speaking, consistently really strong and consistent performance across the business that we're very, very pleased with.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAll right. Next question is from John Tower with Citi.\n\nJon Tower\n\nUS Restaurant Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. First clarification and then a question. Ian, could you provide potential range of the size of the property gain in Q4? And then second, I'm just curious to gain your thoughts on the recent NLRB ruling that's set to be implemented, I believe, in December, and how you think this might influence your own business or that of the industry in the years ahead.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation",
    "content2": "John and Ian, let me take the first one, and then I'll turn it over to Chris on the NLRB. On the property gain, which is in our IOM segment, we expect that to be about $60 million. I think you've probably heard us talk before. We get these kind of high-value individual properties that sometimes the highest and best use is different than what we're using it for today. This is an example of that. I don't think we certainly expect these are going to be occurring very often, but this is a case where that was just a good business decision to make, and that's what we're expecting in Q4 on that.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. And on the NLRB ruling, I mean, as you would expect, we strongly object to last week's NLRB ruling. We think it's going to undermine small business ownership in the US. If you think about it, the franchise business model, it's really a great American innovation. It's created wealth for thousands, particularly underrepresented minorities and women. And this is something we think that needs to be supported, not attacked.\nAnd so in our mind, this is yet another example of agency overreach coming out of DC. We expect it's going to be contested. It's going to be contested in the courts. It's going to be contested in Congress. In fact, you may have seen already that the Senate has indicated they're going to seek to pass a continuing resolution, which is in opposition to this ruling. So McDonald's certainly opposes it.\nWe're going to support others who oppose it. How it all plays out in time, I think it's tough to say, but this is something that's going to affect everybody. And as we've shown throughout time, so long as there's a level playing field and McDonald's is on the same level as everybody else, we tend to win. Even if this NLRB ruling were to pass, it's going to affect the industry at large, and we think we're better positioned than anybody else to withstand it.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAll right. Next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies.\n\nAndy Barish\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Just shifting gears to IOM for a moment. Can you give us roughly how much of the $100 to 150 million in subsidies has shown up so far? And then on the company-owned margin question, but related to IOM, I mean, this used to be a 20% margin business, obviously more pricing in the business today. Any thoughts longer term about kind of realizing back to 20% restaurant-level margins in this segment?\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, Andy. It's Ian. So I think on the subsidies, I guess the headline would be we expect to spend in line with what we've said consistently for the year, $100 to 150 million. And so, I think we're tracking in line with that, where you'd expect us to be at this point in the year, is what I would say on that. I think in terms of longer-term margins, I mean, if you go back over our 60-year history, I mean, we've had obviously many periods of higher inflation that we've had to work through over time.\nWe've always been able to kind of get margins back as we're able to continue to drive strong top-line growth. And I certainly don't see any reason why that would be different this time. I mean, I think we're going to make sure, as you've heard us talk about today, that we stay really disciplined in how we're pricing to the consumer. We feel we've got a lot of capability data and analytical capability that's allowing us to do that better than most.\nAnd we also have industry-leading momentum as you continue to see in our results. And if you are able to have industry-leading momentum, and as you heard Chris talk about, you continue to invest in those structural advantages, whether that's the fully modernized estate, digital platforms at scale, obviously, you're going to be in an advantage position versus others in how you can kind of continue to let that flow through the business. And I think that's certainly what we expect as we look forward on margins and the ability to kind of build those as we continue.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nWe have time for one more question. Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler.\n\nBrian Mullan\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey, thank you. Just a question on development specific to the US. Could you perhaps comment on the takeaway-only location in Texas? Any early learnings you've had thus far? I imagine we might hear more about this at the investor day, but just high level, do you expect new formats have the potential to play a more meaningful role in future US unit growth?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah. So you're right. We will talk a little bit more about this, actually a lot more about this when we get together on 6 December. We're continuing to follow and assess the test that we have down in Texas. I think you can say that certainly there's going to be an opportunity for us to have restaurants that are smaller footprint that don't have a dining room.\nYou will see some of those, but I think from a development standpoint, the vast majority of the development opportunity that we see is for our traditional restaurants. We think that there's still quite a bit of opportunity for traditional restaurants. That will be the bulk of it. You might see again something around the edges, which is some of these smaller formats. But the big idea is traditional restaurants that we'll talk more about on 6 December.\n\nMike Ceplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOkay. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Ian. That completes our call today. Thanks, everyone, for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. At that time, investors only may ask a question by pressing star one on their touch-tone phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and then re-enter the queue for any additional questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning. Last quarter, I talked about consistency. Consistency in our numbers, consistency in the drivers of our business, and consistency in the excitement across the system about the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the theme is, well, if I'm being honest, the theme was Grimace. I mean, Grimace has been everywhere the past few months. All over the news and more than 3 billion views on TikTok. Not bad for a 52nd birthday. This viral phenomenon is yet another proof point of the power of marketing at McDonald's today. Aside from Grimace, what really stood out about this past quarter was our continued consistency. In Q2, we delivered yet another quarter of strong performance, achieving global comparable sales of 11.7% with double-digit comparable sales across each of our segments.\nWe're operating from a position of strength and continuing to gain share in most of our major markets despite headwinds and a challenging macro environment. The reason for this continued consistency is simple. Our Accelerating the Arches playbook is working to help create a better customer experience. Renewed focus on the fundamentals, in part fueled by the reintroduction of the PACE program, has led to operational improvements and continued increases in customer satisfaction across most of our major markets. To further strengthen our foundation of running great restaurants, we recently created a Chief Restaurant Officer role in markets to keep our market teams focused on driving our strategic plan, execution, and performance. Market CROs will also help ensure that innovative ideas generated in local restaurants can be leveraged in markets across the globe. Our success is fueling even greater ambitions.\nWe're continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while evolving our strategy through Accelerating the Organization to stay front-footed with an eye towards the future. As we've previously shared, Accelerating the Organization is an initiative to reimagine how we work to bring the full breadth of McDonald's skills and experiences together to come up with the best solutions that can be scaled. We're bringing this to life through One McDonald's Way, horizontal ways of working, and digitizing the organization. While we're just beginning to change our ways of working, we're already seeing early benefits. I've often said that the next great solution will come from our markets and in our restaurants. As I recently visited markets like China, Italy, and Germany, I continue to be inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of our system and how market teams are embracing these principles even more consistently.\nVisiting China truly brought to life the power of a highly digitized economy and our potential for global growth moving forward. With about 90% of our business currently coming through digital channels in that market, it was remarkable to see how the market has forged digital relationships with customers. China is also making tremendous progress in running the restaurants more efficiently, all with the use of data and technology. This will provide great learnings for the rest of our system. Our Canadian team is implementing a rigorous initiative review process to relentlessly prioritize work, to actively stop projects that are less important, and focus on solving the most meaningful problems for our customers. Using a new framework, the team has already cut their number of key business projects in half. We intend to learn from and scale this process to other markets as well.\nAdditionally, our UK and Ireland team recently traveled to Germany to learn best practices from the market's Best Burger rollout. This is a prime example of the agile scaling of solutions and horizontal ways of working. Finally, last November, we launched our largest globally unified marketing campaign ever. Want to go to McDonald's to celebrate the FIFA Men's World Cup? We're thrilled to extend this award-winning brand platform with the FIFA Women's World Cup and write a new chapter in the story to meet this iconic cultural moment. This campaign will be brought to life in 28 markets through fully integrated social, digital, streaming, and content strategies that tap into local fan excitement. These are just a few examples of how a One McDonald's Way approach to common challenges will drive greater connectivity and efficiency worldwide.\nKey to enabling the company's scale solutions with speed and agility is the work of our new Global Business Services Business Unit, or GBS. GBS will unlock further efficiencies and capabilities of our people and resources. We will do this by developing digital tools for the organization, making data and insights more accessible across the system, and growing our future talent pipeline. We'll continue to keep you updated on how our ongoing investment in this area will benefit the enterprise in the years to come. In addition to our Accelerating the Organization efforts, we're also focused on evolving our approach to capturing incremental customer visits. Central to that is restaurant development, also known as our fourth D. Our strong performance and strength of our brand has earned us the right to begin accelerating the pace of restaurant openings in our major markets over the next several years.\nWhile our primary focus is on opening traditional units, we're always testing and learning new ways to meet the needs of our customers. One example is the takeaway-only restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, that opened in 2022. The restaurant site is considerably smaller than a traditional restaurant, and as the way customers order and receive their food has changed dramatically over the past few years, it is geared toward customers based on their needs state wherever they are. Another recent example of innovation I was able to see firsthand during my visit to China is the use of food lockers at busy locations with high in-store traffic. Upon arrival, delivery couriers can quickly unlock the designated locker and grab the customer's order without even entering the restaurant, removing friction for both the kitchen and the courier.\nOur new business ventures team is in the process of developing a new concept we will call CosMc's, which we will test in a small handful of sites in a limited geography beginning early next year. CosMc's is a small-format concept with all the DNA of McDonald's but its own unique personality. We look forward to providing you with more information about our development plans and new format innovations at our investor day at the end of the year. Finally, before I hand it to Ian, I want to recognize our teams and business partners in France who have handled the unrest in the market with remarkable strength and grace. It has been extremely disruptive to the business on top of an already challenging operating environment.\nThanks to everyone connected to McDonald's France for your dedication and commitment to the business, as well as your efforts to keep everyone safe during this volatile time. I'll now turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, the Q2 was yet another demonstration of consistently strong performance guided by our Accelerating the Arches strategy and fueled by our outstanding execution. We're delivering delicious feel-good moments to our customers in new and exciting ways by doubling down on our creative excellence and highlighting our core menu, all with the value and convenience our customers expect. Our performance speaks for itself and is a testament to the passion and dedication of our entire McDonald's system. With global comparable sales of 11.7% and consistent performance across our segments, it's clear that the McDonald's brand has never been stronger. In fact, the brand was at the center this quarter as we engaged with customers in authentic and culturally relevant ways with campaigns rooted in consumer insights.\nAs Chris touched on a few minutes ago, we took the nostalgic experience of celebrating birthdays at McDonald's and repackaged it for a new generation with none other than Grimace at the center. It quickly became one of our most socially engaging campaigns of all time, with millions of reactions on our social media posts, a true demonstration of how the power of our brand emerges in organic and creative ways in our fans. It contributed to the strong double-digit comparable sales growth for the quarter in the US. The passion for the brand was also evident in Italy with the launch of a truly unique creative platform.\nIt celebrated the most loved and best-selling beef burger in the market by asking customers, \"What would you do for a Crispy McBacon?\" The answer came in the form of customers getting tattoos of their favorite McDonald's sandwich, driving brand affinity and elevating share gains. I've certainly seen a lot in my 30 years at McDonald's, but this was a new one for me. Truly remarkable. As I've mentioned before, our chicken equities remain at the core of our growth strategy. The UK celebrated the 40th anniversary of another fan favorite, the Chicken McNuggets, by offering limited-time sauces to reconnect with the Gen Z consumer. This was coupled with compelling media that showcased the fan truth that sharing your nuggets isn't guaranteed, even if you're best friends. China also highlighted the Chicken McNuggets anniversary in a creative way with an integrated marketing campaign.\nFeaturing our 20-piece nuggets, it quickly went viral on social media and generated significant positive buzz among consumers. Spicy McNuggets, one of our most popular line extensions, were offered across various markets this quarter, including Australia and Germany. It is yet another example of how we modernize our core menu, adapt it to meet changing customer taste profiles, and scale these new ideas across the globe. Both markets achieved significant lifts to the McNuggets line as a result, and spicy McNugget sales reached an all-time high in Australia. Our ambition on chicken includes further scaling emerging equities across markets. The McCrispy chicken sandwich, for example, has now scaled to over 10 of our largest markets, including Spain, just this past quarter. The sandwich is already resonating with our customers, bringing attention to our chicken portfolio and driving significant chicken share gains.\nA recent addition to our portfolio of billion-dollar brands, the McCrispy continues to be an important catalyst of chicken growth for many of our markets. The UK, for example, has achieved market share leadership in chicken, a remarkable growth over the past few years with the launch of both the McCrispy and the McSpicy chicken sandwiches. We look forward to further scaling these new global favorites to customers around the world. A challenging macro environment, including rising interest rates and elevated costs, continues to create volatile consumer confidence levels and put pressure on consumer spending. Providing customers with an affordable option has always been core to McDonald's. But in these challenging times, it is even more important for us to remain agile, proactively meeting the needs of our customers. Germany continued the success of its McSmart Menu.\nInitially introduced last quarter to provide entry-level affordable meals, it's contributed to our best sales quarter ever in the market and lifted value perceptions with consumers. The UK unveiled a similar offering with its new Saver Meal Deals in June, and the early results are encouraging. A permanent addition to the menu, it aims to provide consistent everyday affordability and ensure customers can still enjoy their favorite treats like the Double Cheeseburger despite the rising cost environment. Maintaining our leadership position and value is crucial to future success, and McDonald's holds the number one position in good value for money and affordability across most of our major markets. This shows that even in the most challenging of environments, our customers know that they can rely on McDonald's to provide an affordable destination for the food that they love.\nBut we know that customers' perceptions on value are made up of more than just the price of our food. It's also about the experience that we provide. We've continued to enhance the customer experience, providing the seamless and memorable interactions our customers have come to expect. Last quarter, we introduced an enhanced ordering process through our app in the US with the goal of delivering a faster and more enjoyable experience for the customer. While we're still learning from this deployment, early results have been extremely positive, with elevated sales initiated through the app, increased customer satisfaction, and improved service times. Canada also introduced new experiences in the app with the launch of the Frequent Fryer program. Tapping into Canadians' passion for travel, the digital campaign celebrated McDonald's fries and the opportunity to taste them in other countries.\nThis creative approach to re-engage with our loyalty members resulted in lifts to both digital acquisition and digital customer frequency during the campaign. Now, in over 50 markets across the globe, we're continuing to build stronger relationships with our loyalty customers and fueling growth of our digital sales in the process. In our top six markets, digital sales represent nearly 40% of system-wide sales, and our loyalty members remain highly engaged with over 52 million 90-day active members across our top six markets. As our relationships with these customers continue to grow, we will unlock additional customer needs and explore investments for continued digital innovation at a scale that only McDonald's can achieve. Strong execution across all elements of Accelerating the Arches is creating additional customer demand and share gains across most of our major markets.\nBut we recognize that we're operating in a challenging macro environment where costs remain elevated, customer discretionary spending is limited, and industry traffic is pressured. In line with industry trends and as inflation begins to normalize later in the year, we expect top-line growth to moderate. Turning to the P&L, our strong top-line performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $3.17 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of 25% in constant currencies, excluding other charges and gains in both periods, as well as a prior year tax settlement. Our company-operated margin performance for the first half of 2023 is in line with our expectations and remains hampered by continued cost pressures. As we look to the remainder of the year, we expect macro headwinds will continue.\nTotal restaurant margin dollars grew by nearly $450 million in constant currencies, or nearly 14% for the quarter. Strong franchise sales performance continues to be offset by targeted and temporary franchisee assistance provided mainly to our European franchisees, where elevated costs continue to pressure restaurant cash flows. We're still anticipating that these efforts will have an impact of $100 to 150 million for the year. G&A for the quarter decreased 6% in constant currency, primarily driven by prior year costs incurred for our worldwide convention last April and timing of anticipated current year spend. We are pleased with our strong adjusted operating margin of just over 47% for the first half of the year. This was driven by the continued strong top-line growth that I mentioned and timing within our G&A spend.\nFor the full year, we now expect adjusted operating margin to be about 46%, reflecting heavier G&A spend in the back half of the year, along with an expected property gain in other operating income in Q4. Our adjusted effective tax rate was just over 18% for the quarter. With that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Ian. As I've said before, McDonald's Corporation is in the business of selling a brand. Our investments through Accelerating the Arches to create cultural conversations and develop industry-leading innovations have increased the value of our brand and kept us relevant. In June, McDonald's earned an impressive 18 Lions across 10 markets at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Additionally, our team in the UK and Ireland was awarded the prestigious Marketing Society's Grand Prix, which recognizes the best marketer in the country. The McDonald's brand also rose to the number five spot in the 2023 Kantar BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands report, behind only the leading tech industry brands. As we've upped our marketing game, it's also been interesting to see how our food quality scores with customers have continued to increase. The more customers love our brand, the more they love our food.\nBeyond the great brand stories created by our marketing teams and agency partners are the thousands of franchisees around the world who create real-life brand stories every day in the restaurants with our customers. Our franchisees and crew bring the McDonald's brand to life with great hospitality, convenience, and service. The best brand in the industry, backed by the best franchisees, has been our value creation formula for decades. We're always looking ahead to what is next and asking ourselves, how do we continue to create the world's greatest franchising opportunity for the world's greatest franchisees for generations to come? This requires making decisions for the long term to earn our success rather than expecting it or assuming it. Our Accelerating the Arches strategy is focused on just that, setting up the company and our franchisees to continue to prosper.\nLaying the foundation for the future also involves strongly defending the franchise system and independent ownership rights, a position echoed by the National Franchise Leadership Alliance, the elected representative voice of McDonald's franchise organizations across the US. I'm confident that the system is focused on the right priorities and is well-positioned to meet the customer needs of tomorrow. Thank you to the over 2 million talented people working in our restaurants, our thousands of franchisees, and our entire network of suppliers around the world who bring the McDonald's experience to life each day. I'll now turn it over to Mike for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you are an investor and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue for any additional questions.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\n\nEric Gonzalez\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHey, thanks for the question and good morning. My question is about your expectations for the US consumer. I think last quarter there was some discussion about your base case that the US would experience a mild recession. I think you called out that you were starting to see some evidence of trade down in our check management at that time. I'm wondering, has there been any change in your current thinking and whether those consumer behaviors have intensified or moderated in the last quarter?\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Eric, for the question. I'd say overall, there hasn't been dramatic change in the US consumer sentiment. It's actually improving a little bit, but we're certainly still far off of where we were back in 2019. As we look at our spend by different sort of economic cohorts, we are gaining share if you look at incomes under 100,000, we're actually doing quite well there, which suggests that we're getting some benefit from trade down from things like full-service dining, casual dine, etc. And then even if you go to incomes of 45,000 and less, our business is performing well there. What we're seeing with that group is we are seeing a little bit of a decrease in order size, but it's being offset by very strong or continued strength in traffic.\nSo I think net-net, when you look at all of it, there is certainly concern with the US consumer that shows up in their sentiment. But our business, and particularly I think our value positioning in the market, has put us into a good position to be able to weather that and continue to drive the share gains that you're seeing.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHi, Eric. It's Ian. I just may add a little bit to Chris's comments. I think we've talked, if I just focus on the US over the last couple of quarters, about kind of these two broad areas of probably consumer adjustment that we've seen. I would say the first one is we are seeing some consumers that are kind of trading down from those more premium or higher-priced items in the menu to more core and value.\nAnd then I think, as Chris said, we have consumers that continue to visit but probably are just buying a little less, so their basket sizes are a little bit smaller than what they've been previously. I think the context is those two factors, though, have been really, while they've been in play for a number of quarters now, have been very consistent. So we're not seeing any further kind of deterioration, I think, which is encouraging. And as Chris touched on, I think speaks to our leading value for money and affordable positioning in the US business, which we know is industry-leading and where we rate maintain a really strong gap to the competitive set.\nI mean, I think the consumer still remains under pressure, obviously, with the macro context, with all of the inflationary impacts that they're seeing on their kind of basket of goods, and obviously with rising interest rates. But we know we had obviously positive traffic growth in the quarter in the US business. We know that on a comp basis, we continue to outperform the broader sector. And I think as Chris touched on in his opening remarks, we continue to focus on the experience. And we know, based on the feedback that we're seeing from our customers, that we're delivering an improved experience. I think that's a credit to the US business and all of our franchisees and the really strong focus they've got on executing and make sure we deliver for the customer when they do choose us.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.\n\nDavid Tarantino\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHi, good morning. Ian, I wanted to follow up on your comments about sales moderating as the year goes on, which is understandable given the starting point here. But specifically, I was hoping you could perhaps break down the guest count growth versus the check growth in the US and if you have it in IOM as well for Q2. Then how do you expect the check growth component to moderate as kind of the inflation environment gets a little bit more moderate? I guess if you could just frame that up for us, that would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, David. Well, look, what I'll do is I think kind of give you the broad brush factors that I think we consider when we talk to kind of our expectation of a moderation in our top line as we kind of work through the back half of the year. I think there are three things there that I'd call out. The first is just we certainly believe from a kind of COVID comparability that the substantive kind of tailwinds are fully behind us as we move into the back half of the year. So I think that's the first piece. The second piece is just as we've talked to in our opening remarks, I mean, we certainly are seeing inflation start to gradually come down. I think that's been the case in the US business probably starting at the end of last year.\nIt's obviously still elevated, but I think we are seeing that gradual kind of decline. I think in the majority of our international markets, we started to see. I think, as we head into the back half of the year, the gradual decline begin there as well. So I think as inflation begins to come down, I would certainly expect our pricing levels to also start to come down. So that's the second factor. I think then the third factor would just be, as Chris touched on previously, I mean, I think there are a number of our top markets where we know the macroeconomic conditions are challenging. We know there continues to be a lot of pressure on consumers. We know consumer sentiment continues to be impacted.\nAnd so we do expect the broader sector to kind of begin to kind of decline in those markets as we go through the back half of the year. And so I think that's kind of the third broad kind of trend that we think about when we talk about moderation. So if I spoke specifically to the US, I think we're obviously looking at kind of a one-year comparable, but also kind of comparing back to 2019. I think that moderation is probably more pronounced in the back half of the second half than the front half. But I think if you step back and you look at the Q2 results, we had positive traffic across each of the three operating segments.\nWe are laser-focused on what we certainly feel is the most important metric, which is that we are continuing to gain market share in the majority of our top markets. We know we continue to outperform the competitive set. That's certainly what we're laser-focused on. We feel really confident about how our Accelerating the Arches strategy continues to resonate across all of the markets we do business with and the strength of our underlying momentum.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Just looking at the guidance that you've provided, I think you mentioned that operating margins you're now expecting at 46% for this full year ex the restructuring charges seemingly raised from the 45% prior. Just wondering if you can maybe offer some color as to what you believe are the primary drivers of that. Just as importantly, how should we think about that operating margin looking out one, two, three years? Is that reasonable to assume that that continues to grind higher, or is there a certain level where you'd expect that would top out whether just naturally or whether based on reinvestment that you might want to make? I'm just wondering how you think about that operating margin, especially in the current environment. Thank you.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, Jeff. Well, let me start with that one. Thanks for the question. So let me start, I think, with 2023. And as you touched on, I think we started the year with an op margin guidance of about 45%. We've updated that now to say about 46%. We're really pleased with our performance in the first half of the year where we were about 47% from an op margin standpoint. And I think that connects to what we've talked about pretty consistently, which is we do believe that over time, as we continue to drive top-line growth, that we can continue to get leverage in our op margin line. I think we saw that in the first half. As we head into the second half, I think there are a couple of things that kind of are specific to the guidance for the full year.\nFirstly, I think the inflationary pressures and margin pressures we certainly believe will continue. I just talked about kind of the moderation of the top line as we kind of work through the rest of the year. Also expect, as I touched on in my opening remarks, that our G&A spend for the year will be more back half than front half weighted. So that's a factor.\nAnd the other callout, and I kind of touched on this again in my opening remarks, was we do expect, and this is in the guidance, that we will have a one-time property gain in Q4. I think as we look forward, again, I would just reiterate that we certainly believe, as we're continuing to be able to drive that top-line growth, that we can continue to gain leverage in the op margin line. I think it's something we'll certainly talk about further in the analyst day at the end of the year.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks. I would love to hear more detail about the IOM trends and insights from those countries. Where are you seeing relative strength and weakness, and what do you ascribe those trends to? I mean, I ask partly because we're still dealing with post-COVID dynamics in some of those markets that are perhaps greater than the US with some back-to-travel, back-to-work in center cities. But I'd also be interested to hear about macro headwinds you're already seeing in the business. You mentioned the value menu launches in Germany and the UK. So wondering if you were doing those as proactive launches or perhaps reactionary. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHey, David, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. Well, as you've seen the results, overall, our IOM business put up very strong performance. So we're very pleased with that. It's a credit to the team and how they're executing against that. Also, as you probably know, our IOM, particularly our European markets, are facing even more significant inflationary pressures, UK in particular, than in the US. The teams there have done a really nice job of putting in the pricing that they need to ensure that we're protecting margins, franchisee margins, but at the same time that we are maintaining our affordability and value-for-money leadership in those markets. Our measures there continue to hold up quite well. I think the other thing that's going well for us is just the execution that we're seeing in our IOM markets. They continue to make progress on service times.\nCustomer satisfaction scores are continuing to increase. So there's been really strong performance from an operations standpoint over in Europe. Where you do see, and every country has obviously got a little bit of a different nuance, but certainly the unrest that I mentioned in my opening comments in France has put some challenge from a macro standpoint on that business. We've also had a number of restaurants that have actually been impacted through some of the protests there that we've had to take offline, and they're going to need to go and get rebuilt. So there is pressure that we've seen from a macro standpoint in France. In the UK, UK is dealing with probably the worst or close to the worst consumer sentiment in Europe, and that's putting some pressure on the business. But overall, our UK business is performing well.\nAnd I think each market has its own approach to value, but we're seeing, I think, that probably being a little bit more of an orientation in those markets just to make sure that as we build our second-half plan, that we've got a strong value message as part of that. So overall, very pleased with how our IOM and, in particular, our European markets are performing. And I wouldn't say there's anything in one particular that's the reason for that. It's the whole playbook of value. It's a focus on core menu. They've had great chicken growth. And then, of course, we're seeing all the benefits of digital.\nOne of the things that is maybe not fully appreciated, but with 52 million people in our top six markets now in our loyalty program, we do typically see about a 15% increase in frequency when we get members into loyalty. We're still seeing high single-digit growth rates in our loyalty programs in terms of sign-up. That continues to be a tailwind for us in the business.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.\n\nJohn Ivankoe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, thank you. Actually, my question is in the context of value. It's a perfect follow-up to that. So you discussed some of the success of the McSmart value menu, the Saver menu. And obviously, I'm hearing a lot about global solutions. As we kind of think about ways to drive traffic, drive sales, maybe to some extent at the expense of margins, does it make sense to consider the return of a dollar-style menu in the US, Canada, France, Australia, what have you? I mean, is a value menu, at least in some construct, part of what you see the big six or big seven offerings to consumers to be? Is that something that is on the front burner? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nYeah, I'll take that. So I think the starting point is to just emphasize we're winning on value. So the programs that we have in place are working and delivering for us. And it shows up not just in our overall performance, the fact that we're driving both check and we're driving guest counts, but it shows in our consumer sentiment scores where we are maintaining our leadership in affordability and value for money. So there's nothing broken from a value standpoint that, from my vantage point, you would need to change. I think we feel really good that the value programs that we have in place are actually driving the success.\nThe probably only thing that teams would be looking at is, as they think about marketing communication in the back half of the year, do they maybe emphasize a little bit more of driving awareness of the value programs that already exist in the market? That may be something that some markets consider doing. We feel great about the value programs that we have in place in each of our markets today. I wouldn't expect to see any changes from the programs that we have.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMaybe just a little appeal to Chris. I think just one of the things that we feel really good about in the business is just how our teams are continuing to be proactive and agile in kind of obviously a volatile set of external circumstances.\nI think that's the example in both the UK and Germany of what the teams have introduced. There is a great example of learning from each other because there's a lot of consistency in those programs, but bringing them to life in ways that are relevant, and doing that while we're in a position of strength as we are in both markets. Germany, as an example, in Q2 had an all-time sales record for their business. I think this is us staying close to our consumers, making sure we're leaning into the needs of our consumers as they work through the broader macroeconomic challenges. I think really continuing to make sure that such an important strategic element of our business continues to resonate in consumers in a way that's relevant in the context of each individual market.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\n\nBrian Bittner\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about store-level margins. Clearly, your same-store sales were very impressive in Q2, over 10% comps in the United States. But store-level margins in the US were still down about 70 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. So can you talk more specifically about what is causing the drag on margins despite such strong top line? And as the top line potentially slows moving forward, as you talked about, is there a scenario where store-level margins can start to show improvements, or is this a situation where you anticipate store-level margins to feel more pressure for longer?\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nMorning, Brian. Ian, thanks for the question. Well, look, I would start with the headline. I mean, our belief is that the best way to drive sustainable margin improvement is for us to focus on driving strong momentum in the business. And I think the US business is the perfect example of that. While certainly, as you work through these kind of rapid and accelerated periods of inflation, there's pressure from a percentage basis, and we've clearly seen that in the US business. I mean, I think the example would be that the strength of our momentum in the US actually means that our owner-operator cash flow is up year-over-year, obviously in a continued challenging environment.\nAnd that's what we're focused on, is how do we drive sustainable margin dollar cash flow growth for ourselves and for our franchisees. I think from a percentage basis, you're right. I mean, I think we continue to see pressure, obviously, from food and paper inflation, labor inflation. I think where we talked about earlier in the year remains in place. We said this, and I think we are consistent with that in the sense that we thought our McOpCo margin in the US business would be kind of roughly in line in terms of 2023 with where we were at Q4 2022. But we have a lot of confidence that as we continue to drive that strong top-line momentum as we go forward, that we'll continue to be able to drive both margin dollar and overall margin percentage growth within the business.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nI would just add, as I mentioned in my opening comments, I've been to a number of markets. I've had a chance to talk to franchisees in a number of markets. I've been very impressed and pleased with how they're thinking about working through the current scenario right now, which is they're playing the long game, and they recognize the importance of us continuing to make sure we have leadership in value and affordability as they also think about how do they rebuild margins back to kind of where we were during this pre-inflationary spike.\nSo in many cases, the conversations we're having with franchisees are about more of exiting the year and where do we want to see margins when we exit the year, but recognize that there may be some short-term impacts on this as we continue to balance our need for margin, but also our need to maintain our leadership with customers. So it's hats off to the franchisees who I think are taking the exact right perspective on this. It's what shows up in our performance and the reason why we're taking share in almost all of our major markets.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\n\nDennis Geiger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. I wanted to just ask a little bit more on how you're thinking about maintaining some of the underlying momentum and the share gains that you've seen for quite some time now in the US. As you think about some of the key drivers in place across the 3Ds, the operational execution, newer sort of Ready On Arrival stuff, etc., can you just sort of unpack how you think about the most impactful traffic and sales opportunities in the next year, maybe even over the coming years? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nIt all goes back to the strategy of Accelerating the Arches. When we laid out Accelerating the Arches, we talked about our MCD framework. It's about great marketing. It's about focusing on core menu. It's about 3Ds, now the 4Ds. And so one of the things that I and then underlying all of that is about great execution. I think one of the things that for me gives me confidence about the strength and resiliency of our business, not just in the US, but around the world, is that it's broad-based. It's not being folks-driven by a one-off promotion. It's not being driven by kind of just silver bullets. You're seeing it because of consistent execution across the entire strategy. So you're seeing evidence of where we continue, I think, to up our game from a marketing standpoint. That's driving strength around our brand scores.\nOur brand has never been in a better place than it's been. Our focus on core menu and things like Best Burger, the focus that we have on chicken, we're gaining share in both chicken and beef, which off of core menu, which has a lot of benefits. And then we continue to do a great job of executing against our 3Ds and will against our 4Ds. Digital for us is something that is actually, I think, a virtuous loop where you're seeing the stronger our digital business becomes, the more that it's driving customer engagement in digital, our app downloads. And when you compare us to anybody else in the industry, it's orders of magnitude difference. And that creates some economies of scale that become self-perpetuating over time.\nSo as I look out for the business, for us, it's going to be about continuing to do all the things that we're doing on that. And underneath that is the execution that we're seeing in our restaurants. And with the PACE program that we put in place last year, it was in most of our major markets. This year, we added the US. But you're seeing service times come down across the board in our major markets. You're seeing CSAT or customer satisfaction scores go up in all of our restaurants.\nSo I wouldn't attribute our success to any one thing. It's the fact that we're executing across the entire Accelerating the Arches playbook that gives me confidence. And listen, this is a momentum business. When you've got momentum, it helps, and it can be self-perpetuating. Now, you don't want to get complacent on that. But the fact that we have momentum, I think, is driving an ambition. It continues to drive our operators' willingness to invest because they do see that as we play this out, we've got a long runway, or we certainly believe we have a long runway here at McDonald's.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Chris Carril at RBC.\n\nChris Carril\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of Restaurants, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning. Chris, I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks, and you plan to share more at the investor day, but could you maybe expand a bit more on the development outlook as we think about the second half of this year as well as beyond 2023? You've seen strong top-line momentum, improving margins, and you've made organizational changes to help support development. What are the key unlocks here or next steps going forward to accelerate new restaurant openings? Thank you.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nSure. Well, we will share much more detail about this at the Analyst day at the end of the year. So I won't get into the specifics, but I will talk about the activities that we're doing right now, which is one of the starting point is just looking at our opportunity with traditional restaurants. If you think about over the last several years, our focus has been largely globally around reinvestment. In the US, we haven't grown units going all the way back to 2014. If you go to a number of our large IOM markets, the growth there from a unit standpoint has been pretty anemic compared to what we think is the opportunity.\nWe are doing a very detailed both top-down and bottoms-up look to say what is the development opportunity that exists in each of those markets and how do we go and exploit that. Use the US as one example. I think the other thing that we look at is think about the US restaurant estate today. The US restaurant estate today reflects probably what the demographic profile or the population profile looked like 20 or 30 years ago. Imagine the amount of shifts that have happened, people moving to the south, to the southeast. That isn't reflected on our footprint. Our footprint reflects what the population looked like probably 20 or 30 years ago. You end up finding there's a number of places around the US where we are significantly underdeveloped relative to where the population exists today.\nThat opens up for us a whole bunch of development opportunities for us to go after. The other thing that we're overlaying on top of this is we are, as I mentioned in my opening comments, thinking about small format and how do we bring new concepts that open up real estate opportunities that under a traditional model would not necessarily be available to us. A big reason that we can now look at those is because of the growth that's happened with the digital and delivery where you don't necessarily need the big dining rooms that you needed in our traditional restaurants. So you're now able to look at real estate sites that previously would have been sort of off-limits to us. Those become opportunities.\nSo we're taking all of those things together and rolling that up to get a perspective of what we think the new unit potential is going to be over the next four or five years. As you would imagine, it's a longer lead item. So this isn't going to be something that shows up in 2024 and even in 2025, but you can start to with focus on it, get some real benefits in 2026 and beyond. And that's what we'll share at Analyst day.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen.\n\nAndrew Charles\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the reiterated $100 to 150 million of targeted and temporary rent relief in Europe. Recognizing the numerous macro challenges in the market, the brand is certainly successfully navigating these with impressive top-line strength in front half of 2023. So when you combine this with better than expected IOM and McOpCo margins in Q2, just in that cost pressure, perhaps may not have been as severe a surge as anticipated. What do you need to see to reduce the outlook for relief? Just a quick follow-up to that, can you help level set how much of that $100 to 150 million has been spent so far in 2023? Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nHi, morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So let me just kind of touch on a few things. Look, I think as we've talked about before, providing support to our franchisees is kind of normal course of business for us. Obviously, the difference this year is just the kind of the pace, the scale, and the breadth of the pressures, as you highlighted, obviously, probably most centered in Europe. So I think on the backdrop of all of that, we decided towards the back end of last year to kind of provide some more extensive support. As we talk about always, it's always targeted and temporary. It's always fact-based support, so that support goes to franchisees that need support.\nI think, as you've heard me talk a little bit in some of the other questions this morning, that inflation is kind of coming to play the way we predicted it. So I don't think there's been a difference versus our expectations, which is why we've reiterated that we continue to expect that we will spend between $100 to 150 million for the year this year. I think the other thing I just want to go back to because it's so important, and it's certainly something I strongly believe in. I've given you these examples before of, as we worked through COVID and we provided support at particular moments as we worked through that with our franchisees. I think that was fundamental to the exit velocity and momentum that our business had.\nI think what you can see now, if you look at our IOM segment, and Chris talked about this earlier, is the strength of our underlying momentum, the consistency of our momentum. I believe that's fundamentally connected to decisions like this because they keep our system fully aligned. They keep our system front-footed and focused on the opportunities that we have to continue to drive growth in our business. I believe that's a significant strategic advantage that we have. I think it's been a key contributor to why we continue to outperform even in markets that may be more difficult from a macroeconomic context.\n\nChris Kempczinski\n\nPresident and CEO, McDonald's Corporation",
    "content2": "I would just add, again, back to my market visits that I've done in the last couple of months. In some of those conversations that I've had with franchisees, I typically do dinners every time I visit the market with a group of franchisees. Many of them in our IOM market specifically have thanked us for the support that we're giving and attributed their willingness and ability to focus on the long term to not necessarily just be chasing pricing in the short term because they understand we're in this together. We're both making investments to ensure that the success of our business is long-term focused. So I think Ian hit it exactly right.\nWhen we make the decisions and do the right things for the long term, the benefits time and again were proven right on that. I feel very good about the program that we've got in place. It is temporary and targeted as it appropriately should be.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOur next question is from Sara Senatore with B of A.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I guess a couple of questions around the margins, please. First, on the G&A, could you just talk a bit about what the back half spending might be on? You sort of come in pretty decently below the full-year guide. So I'm just trying to understand what the step-up might be and how to think about that G&A, the percentage of system sales, maybe even going forward. And then could you just give us some color on pricing and commodity basket inflation for the US and the IOM markets? I'm sorry if I missed it, but just how much price is on the menu and what the baskets look like? Thanks.\n\nIan Borden\n\nCFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Sara. Well, let me start with G&A. I mean, I think a bit of a headline there. I mean, I think our normal, let's call it cycle of spend in the business is probably always a little bit more back half than front half weighted. I think this year that's a little bit more pronounced. I think there are kind of a couple of probably more substantive factors for that. I think the first one is around our continued investment in technology and digital. I mean, I think you've heard us talk and me in particular previously that we have the capacity and the capability, and we will continue to invest in areas in the business where we believe there's a significant opportunity to drive growth and generate a return.\nI think our digital and technology investments have been a clear, strong example and continue to be one of our key growth drivers. I think, as Chris touched on previously, we continue to believe we've got significant opportunity as we go forward to unlock further capabilities around our digital and technology platforms. So we're continuing to accelerate investment in those areas. I think the second one is back to our Global Business Services organization. As you know, as part of our ATO changes earlier this year, we stood up a Global Business Services organization at an enterprise level because we felt there was a relatively significant opportunity to look at how we can digitize, I'll call it the operational part of our business, and drive sustainable efficiencies as we go forward.\nSo we're doing a fair bit of work and investing right now and looking at that opportunity to understand how big is it?, what's it going to take to get after it?, how should we think about sequencing and prioritizing the investments. Obviously, once you go into those sorts of journeys, there are multi-year journeys and commitments to kind of deliver that sustainable end benefit. But if we think of the kind of the broader environment today, the ability to kind of drive sustainable efficiency, the ability to get at data and analytics in a sustainable way, I think is becoming more important. And we think there's a significant opportunity there that we're looking at. So I think our guidance remains intact as we stated at the beginning of the year, which is we expect our G&A to be in that 2.2% to 2.3% of sales range.\nI would say I think I certainly expect that we'll be closer to the higher end versus the lower end of that range. But that's a bit of texture on G&A. I think on pricing, I mean, obviously, pricing varies significantly based on the context in the individual markets. So maybe what I can do is just give you a little, I mean, obviously, pricing remains elevated as inflation more broadly remains elevated in the majority of our markets. Maybe a little texture on the US, which is, I think, if you look at Q2, we were kind of on average at a low double-digit level of pricing in the business. I think as we work through the rest of the year, we'll probably end the year in that kind of low double-digit range.\nA lot of the pricing in Q2 is kind of carryover from 2022 in the US business as we work through that kind of peak inflationary period. Obviously, as I talked about earlier, we're kind of getting those two offsets to the pricing we're taking, which is kind of the trade down and consumers that are kind of continuing to visit, but buying a little bit less. Again, those two offsets have been very consistent. As Chris and I have both talked to, we continue to see traffic growth in our US business. We continue to see market share gains. We continue to see this kind of strong leading value for money and affordability positioning.\nSo I think what I've talked about before, which I think is really important, is the work we've done in the couple of years before we've kind of got into this more challenging macroeconomic environment around our capabilities that we've put in place with our third-party advisors that we work with and who make recommendations to our business, including our franchisees, on how we price. Obviously, our franchisees make those decisions. I think we've had a significant improvement in our capability. I think as Chris has talked about, we've had pretty good discipline from our system in the pricing that we've taken to really kind of get the balance of working through the short-term challenge with a long-term focus on continuing to make sure we're driving momentum. And we feel pretty good about how we've been able to navigate, obviously, a complex environment.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nInvestor Relations Officer, McDonald's Corporation\n\nOkay. We're at the bottom of the hour. That completes our call. Thank you, Chris. Thanks, Ian. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Call. You may now disconnect and have a great day."

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nCorporate Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden.\nAs a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call along with their corresponding GAAP measures.\nFollowing prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Ordinarily, in a global business like ours, for a quarterly earnings call, you're prepping to memorize all the different sets of numbers. What's notable about this earnings call is McDonald's consistency, consistency in the strength of our numbers, consistency in the powerful drivers of our business and consistency in the excitement that exists across the system about the opportunities that lie in front of us.\nLet's start with the numbers. At the top line, you only need to know one number, 12.6%. U.S. comparable sales, 12.6%. IOM comparable sales, 12.6%. IDL comparable sales, 12.6%. And global comparable sales, you guessed it, 12.6%. These results reflect strong consumer demand for McDonald's that we are seeing around the world despite a challenging operating environment and historically low consumer sentiment in many markets.\nIt is clear that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working, and we are operating from a position of strength. Each of our MCD growth pillars is contributing to our strong, balanced performance. And importantly, while we've talked in the past about the noise associated with the guest count metric, it is encouraging to see guest counts grow in every segment.\nIn just the last few months, I have visited with our McDonald's teams in France, Japan, the Philippines, UAE and Israel. It's been inspiring to see the dedication of all 3 legs of the stool. Our teams are proud of what they've accomplished and are performing at a high level.\nFor me, it's been energizing to hear their ideas for how we can do even more to take care of our customers. That's what I love most about the McDonald's system: our restless ambition. While we feel good about our current strategy, our success is driving us to do even more to lay a foundation for the future.\nBack in January, we announced the evolution of Accelerating the Arches. We're continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while advancing 2 new initiatives. The first is accelerating restaurant development. Our strong performance has earned us the right to open new restaurants at a faster rate than we have historically. We're focused this year on determining the best path forward to meet customer demand and look forward to sharing more at our Investor Day later this year.\nThe second newer element of our strategy is fundamentally rethinking how we, as a company, can work better together to become faster, more innovative and more efficient. We're calling this Accelerating the Organization.\nIn March, we convened our Annual Leadership Summit with top leaders from across the globe. As part of this meeting, we discussed 3 changes to our ways of working that will enable us to leverage our scale more effectively to meet the needs of our system and customers and unlock significant growth potential.\nThe first is implementing horizontal ways of working. For years, our organization, like many others, was too siloed whether that be geographically siloed or functionally siloed. And yet, our biggest challenges and opportunities are rarely limited to just one market.\nThey can't be solved by only one function. It require collaborating across the organization to bring the full breadth of McDonald's skills and experiences to devise the best system solution that can be scaled globally. In other words, they need to be solved horizontally.\nWith Accelerating the Organization, we're now structured to work much more seamlessly in a horizontal fashion to solve these problems once and then scale solutions across markets. For example is our app offering a seamless and personalized user experience. We're continuing to increase our speed of service. Those are opportunities across every single market and require the expertise of multiple functions.\nTo support our ambition to scale innovations with greater agility and collaborate more effectively, our second key shift is adopting one McDonald's way to standardize the common processes we use to drive consistency and enable speed. We're an innovative, entrepreneurial organization. But once a part of our system somewhere has solved the problem or developed a novel idea, we need to stop the work elsewhere. We don't need every market to invent its own light bulb, so to speak.\nThis approach allows us to use our size and scale for the greatest impact. For example, we're already seeing success in how our marketing teams are implementing common processes to quickly scale great creative such as the Raise Your Arches campaign, which Ian will talk more about.\nFinally, we're making strategic investments in digitizing our organization and implementing new tools and platforms that make it easier for employees to access information to gain insights and drive performance. Ultimately, this will allow our market teams to spend more time in the restaurants, understanding the needs of customers, franchisees and crew.\nKey to operationalizing all 3 areas of our internal transformation is our enterprise global business services organization, also known as GBS. In 2023, GBS will focus on building a long-term strategy that ultimately provides a better experience for all 3 legs of the stool. GBS will be a key enabler to digitizing our organization, driving efficiency and providing value back to the business for our people, our franchisees and our suppliers. Harnessing the power of our scale, our ability to strategically invest and the versatility of our system is the secret sauce that will empower us to provide even more memorable customer experiences for generations to come.\nTo expand further on how we are optimizing the business and our growth strategy, I will now turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nPresident of International, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. The first quarter of 2023 was yet another demonstration of McDonald's at its best. We entered the year with global momentum and remain laser-focused on executing against our strategic growth pillars. Though challenging macro dynamics are still evident across many parts of the world, each of our segments and our global comp sales grew nearly 13% for the quarter. This demonstrates that no matter the operating environment, our customers continue to rely on McDonald's as an affordable destination for the delicious food they love delivered with the great service that they expect.\nThroughout the quarter, we showcased our iconic core menu equities while further scaling emerging equities across markets. I'll share a couple of examples of this in our chicken portfolio, where we continue to expand and grow market share in an area where there is strong opportunity for growth.\nThe U.S. leveraged learnings from the U.K., Canada and Germany by relaunching its crispy chicken sandwich under the McCrispy global equity umbrella. While there was no change to the core product, compelling creative along with a new flavor offering supported demand and helped drive double-digit sales growth in the market. In fact, we now offer the McCrispy in 10 of our largest markets around the world, adding to our portfolio of billion-dollar brands.\nAnother example was in China, where in March, we featured the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich through a creative campaign that included a partnership with a popular streetwear brand tapping into local cultural relevance. The campaign generated significant social buzz and increased brand relevancy with a younger generation.\nIt's worth noting that China and Hong Kong originally introduced customers to McSpicy nearly 20 years ago. And it's now part of our core menu in 17 markets, reflecting consumers' growing preference for spicy across the globe.\nAnd while I'm on the topic of China, I want to point out that we saw a steady recovery in the market with China posting positive comp sales growth for the quarter. Chicken was also critical to Canada's strong results with the successful execution of the Chicken Big Mac promotion, a popular limited offering that had significant success in the U.K. last year.\nBy creating these fresh takes on our classic menu items, we've continued to build affinity and have consistently gained share across our top markets in the growing chicken category over the last 2 years. In parallel, we continue to maintain our market share leadership in beef, making our core menu offerings even better through enhanced cooking procedures and other slight changes such as improved buns.\nNow in over 50 markets around the globe, these improvements are resulting in hotter, juicier and tastier burgers. We're seeing improved taste perception scores across markets, giving customers yet another reason to eat at McDonald's. We recently began to introduce these changes to our U.S. customers through a rolling deployment, and the initial reaction has been positive.\nThe Big Mac was also prominently featured across many markets this quarter with strong activations in both Canada and France. While each campaign came to life in its own way, the resulting lift in beef sales across both markets shows that this iconic menu item, which became popular more than 50 years ago, still resonates with consumers today.\nAs I've mentioned before, rising costs continue to pressure consumer spending across markets. Our ability to meet customer needs in challenging times makes McDonald's value proposition even more important to highlight.\nIn Germany, for example, the launch of the new McSmart menu refreshed our everyday value bundles, providing smaller, more affordable meals to our consumers and contributing to Germany's eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp sales growth. Our marketing excellence was also on full display during the quarter, demonstrating our position as an affordable destination with iconic equities and strong execution.\nThe Raise Your Arches campaign in the U.K. was a prime example of our marketing excellence in action, bringing to life the true power of the McDonald's brand in a new and unique way. This campaign did not feature our food or our restaurants, yet by illustrating a simple gesture, the raising of eyebrows, our customers instantly recognized the semblance of the Golden Arches, and the engagement was remarkable.\nIn fact, within the first weekend alone, Raise Your Arches reached millions of people, and our customers reacted on social media more than 30,000 times. As the campaign quickly scaled to more than 30 markets across the globe, Raise Your Arches drove brand affinity around the world and once again proved the true power of the McDonald's brand. This is an example of how one singular idea can drive impact when shared across our markets. This is the one McDonald's way that Chris mentioned earlier.\nMy McDonald's Rewards is yet another example of how we've tapped into our marketing engine to deploy our loyalty platform throughout the system. Now in 50 markets, loyalty is building even stronger relationships with our customers, and the results continue to shine.\nIn our top 6 markets, digital sales now represent almost 40% of systemwide sales or nearly $7.5 billion, growth of more than 30% over the last year. We have nearly 50 million 90-day active members across these top markets, and our relationship with them continues to grow. We're learning when they visit, how they visit and what they buy with more and more of our sales coming through identified channels than ever before.\nWe're also continuing to improve our customers' mobile app experience with new initiatives that provide a more seamless interaction. The U.S. market, for example, is piloting a new way of ordering through our app. Using existing location data, it allows our crew to start assembling a customer's order prior to their arrival at the restaurant, ultimately delivering hot, fresh food when customers arrive to pick up their order.\nWhile it's still early days deploying this new digital enhancement, initial results are already pointing to improved service times and elevated customer satisfaction scores. Australia and Canada enhanced the digital customer experience by officially integrating the ability to order and pay for McDelivery, all within the McDonald's app.\nThis not only brings added choice and convenience for our customers, but also allows them to earn loyalty points while they enjoy McDelivery at their doorstep and ensures that we maintain that direct connection. Across our digital and marketing initiatives, McDonald's continues to put the customer at the center of our strategy, driving top line growth and further strengthening the brand.\nTurning to the P&L. Strong sales performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.63 for the quarter, an increase over the prior year of nearly 20% in constant currencies. This excludes restructuring charges of about $180 million primarily consisting of employee termination benefits and lease termination costs as we look to become faster, more innovative and more efficient as part of Accelerating the Organization.\nOur company-operated margins remained hampered this quarter by continued pressure from elevated commodities and wages. As we look to the remainder of the year, consistent with the expectations we communicated in January, we expect macro headwinds will continue with the potential for a recessionary environment across both the U.S. and Europe.\nTotal restaurant margin dollars grew by over $375 million in constant currencies or more than 10% for the quarter driven by higher franchise margin dollars. One of the benefits of our franchise business model is the predictability and stability of our franchise margins particularly in a strong comp sales environment.\nAs expected, strong franchise sales performance across our markets was offset by increased franchisee assistance as elevated cost inflation continued to put significant pressure on restaurant cash flows, particularly for our European franchisees. As I've mentioned before, we're providing targeted and temporary support, investing proactively to maintain focus on driving long-term growth during this challenging time.\nWe still anticipate these efforts will have an impact of between $100 million to $150 million for the year.\nG&A for the quarter decreased slightly primarily driven by prior year costs incurred for our worldwide convention last April, and our adjusted effective tax rate was nearly 21% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 46% for the first quarter, a reflection of the strong top line growth.\nAs we've said before, we expect to gain leverage on operating margin over time. And while this will not necessarily be linear based on a strong start to the year, we're pleased with our operating efficiency in quarter 1.\nBased on current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to reduce both the second quarter and full year earnings per share by about $0.03 to $0.05. As always, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year.\nDespite the economic uncertainty that may persist, we are well positioned with the unique strength and scale that only the McDonald's system can provide. As Chris talked about upfront, we are focused on how we can even further leverage this advantage in the future. With our strong underlying momentum and aligned focus on the right strategies moving forward, I remain confident that we will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Ian. Our brand has never been more relevant than it is today, a testament to our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the over 2 million people in our system who bring it to life with our franchisees in the restaurants every single day.\nAs part of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, we've been particularly focused on revving up our world-class marketing engine with our agency partners and internal teams. We have expectations of what creative excellence should look like, and we're certainly proud of the progress we've made.\nOthers are echoing this sentiment, and the industry is taking notice. Recently, McDonald's topped the work effective 100 for the fourth year running, a ranking of the world's most awarded campaigns and companies for effectiveness. This is in addition to earning the #2 spot on Fast Company's World's Most Innovative Companies list of 2023.\nWhile we are pleased with where our brand is today, we know there is still more opportunity ahead, particularly as we change our ways of working through Accelerating the Organization, which I discussed at the outset. As I've said before, as goes our brands, so goes the economic health of the company and our nearly 5,000 franchisees globally.\nAs Ray Kroc once famously said, we're not in the hamburger business, we're in show business. This showcases the importance of marketing our brand, which is more than just the food that we serve.\nThe McDonald's franchise business model has provided a significant on-ramp for so many to work hard and prosper. And we want to ensure that the opportunity exists for generations to come. In fact, our franchisees are generating significant returns over the life of their 20-year agreements, far exceeding their cost of capital and relevant benchmarks.\nAt its core, Accelerating the Arches is about us continuing to set up the company and our franchisees to prosper in the long term. To that end, we'll continue to marshal the weight of the company's resources so that the business model endures.\nRay Kroc would often say that we cannot grow without trying new things or without taking risks. Together as a system, we have an extraordinary opportunity to lay the foundation for our future to maintain an unwavering bond with customers. We'll achieve this through continuous innovation, building digital relationships and delivering personalized experiences with ease, no matter how our customers choose to enjoy McDonald's.\nAs I told our internal teams earlier this month, as we adapt to our new organization and new ways of working, the most important thing we can do is to keep taking care of our customers, our system and each other. As we face a dynamic operating environment and changing customer demand, I'm confident that Accelerating the Arches is the right playbook, combined with the actions we're taking to accelerate the organization to keep McDonald's best positioned to be there for our customers and navigate the next chapter of our growth.\nI want to acknowledge that the path to continuously improving how we innovate for customers in the system involves difficult decisions, and saying goodbye to valued colleagues is never easy. What gives me confidence in our path forward is how the people in our system time and again have shown up for each other to realize the full potential of the opportunity ahead.\nThanks again to our incredible employees, franchisees and suppliers for your continued dedication and commitment.\nWith that, I'll now turn to Mike for Q&A.",

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nCorporate SVP, Treasurer & IR, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden.\nAs a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures.\nFollowing prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. When we gathered at this time last year, we expected 2022 to be a year of recovery from the pandemic, particularly in Europe. Little did we know that it would be another challenging year, and nobody could have predicted the extent to which the war in Europe would disrupt businesses around the world and the macroeconomic impact that would follow.\nDespite continued volatility in nearly every corner of the globe, McDonald's delivered exceptional growth throughout 2022. We achieved full year comp sales growth of 10.9%, delivered strong comp -- guest count performance with 5% growth globally and saw our momentum strengthen as the year progressed with double-digit comp sales growth across all segments in Q4. These results are a testament to the resilience of the McDonald's system and demonstrate that our Accelerating the Arches strategy, which we unveiled in the early days of the pandemic, is working. This strategy is anchored by 3 growth pillars also known as our M, C and Ds: maximize our marketing, commit to the core menu and double down on the 3Ds. Our 2022 performance demonstrated the continued potential of each growth pillar.\nYou've heard me say, McDonald's is one of the world's greatest brands. In the last year, we've unlocked even more ways to elevate our marketing through creative excellence. Our scalable insights are helping us tap into our fans' love for McDonald's and create culturally relevant campaigns that resonate across markets and drive growth. That momentum continued into Q4. In October, our collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market in the U.S. brought together our adult fans' love and nostalgia for the Happy Meal with one of the most on-trend brand and culture. Customer excitement was palpable, and it's fair to say the program exceeded expectations. This program drove the highest weekly digital transactions ever seen in the U.S.\nTo celebrate the FIFA World Cup, we launched our largest global marketing campaign ever with more than 75 markets participating worldwide. Want to go to McDonald's brought to life yet another fan truth. Whatever the culture or language and whatever the outcome of the game, we can all unite under the Golden Arches. Our aim was to support fans that were watching the FIFA World Cup at home through relevant and meaningful McDelivery promotions regardless of the time zone that their team was playing in. During this campaign, we saw double-digit increases in delivery sales across our top 10 markets.\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago, the U.K. launched their Raise Your Arches campaign, which has generated significant excitement with our customers. Even though the campaign never shows our food, never shows our restaurant and never mentions our brand name, it's nonetheless instantly recognizable as only McDonald's. Imagine that, a brand so powerful it requires no introduction. The campaign has been quickly picked up by over 30 other markets, demonstrating our system's ability to quickly scale compelling ideas across the globe.\nThroughout 2022, some of our most successful campaign platforms brought our customers closer to the core menu items they love. The strength of our brand goes beyond the Golden Arches themselves and includes our iconic products such as our world-famous french fries, the Big Mac or Chicken McNuggets and the McFlurry. Each of these products are billion-dollar brands. And in total, McDonald's possesses 10 of these billion-brand equities.\nIn an environment where our customers are looking for the simple and familiar, our core menu items have never been more relevant or beloved. Throughout the year, we continue to step up our game on the favorites that build our heritage. We're delivering hotter, juicier, more delicious burgers and building on the success of emerging equities like the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich. As a result, we are gaining market share in both chicken and beef.\nWhen customers want to enjoy our classic favorites, they are increasingly looking for even more personalized and convenient ways to get their meals. Through our focus on digital, we are transforming from a brand that serve billions and billions all the same way to one that serves each of our billions of customers uniquely as individuals with customized products, offers and experiences. By doing this, we strengthen our customers' love and loyalty for McDonald's.\nThese investments are paying off. In the fourth quarter, digital represented over 35% of system-wide sales in our top 6 markets. In 2022, the McDonald's app was downloaded over 40 million times in the U.S., greater than the total downloads of the second, third and fourth brands combined.\nThrough our loyalty program, which we've expanded to over 50 markets and counting, customers are feeling more connected to McDonald's, which in turn increases visits and frequency. As we closed the year, we had almost 50 million active loyalty users in our top 6 markets.\nThe success of Accelerating the Arches has put McDonald's in an advantaged position. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown system-wide sales nearly $20 billion despite closing over 800 restaurants in Russia. Our brand is clearly in the strongest position it's been in years, attributable in part to our best-in-class marketing engine. And service times and customer satisfaction are both improving, a testament to the dedication of our restaurant teams.\nOur success is fueling even greater ambitions. While we feel good about our strategy and the growth potential in each of our MCD pillars, we've been asking ourselves 2 questions: is there anything we should add to Accelerating the Arches? And is there anything that could get in the way of the success of Accelerating the Arches?\nThe answers to these 2 questions led us to evolve our Accelerating the Arches strategy, which we announced a few weeks ago. We'll continue to double down on our MCDs while adding a fourth D, restaurant development, to our 3Ds growth pillar. Our strong comp and brand performance has given us the right to build new units at a faster rate than we have historically. We also announced accelerating the organization, an effort to modernize the way we work so that we're faster, more innovative and more efficient. Work is now underway to further build out these initiatives and quantify their contribution to our long-term financial algorithm. We'll share more details with all of you at an investor update in Chicago sometime in late 2023.\nTo expand further on how Accelerating the Arches drove success in 2022, I'll now turn it over to Ian.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. By putting our customers at the center of Accelerating the Arches, we're driving top line momentum and broad-based global strength for our brand. Global comparable sales were up double digits for the fourth quarter, and we continue to gain share across most of our major markets. Our performance is a direct result of executing against our strategy, making it clear that we're operating from a position of strength and proving once again that our business remains resilient despite the dynamic macro environment.\nIn our International Operated Markets, we leveraged our digital channels and highlighted our core menu, delivering comp sales growth of nearly 13% for the quarter. As our big 5 International Operated Markets continued to recover from COVID throughout the year, we consistently created delicious feel-good moments for our customers, achieving strong performance across each of these markets.\nThe U.K. continued their focus on chicken with an early fourth quarter launch of the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich. This emerging global equity builds on iconic core favorites like Chicken McNuggets and drove a meaningful lift to the chicken category. The U.K. market also leaned into the power of our brand with the popular Reindeer Ready holiday campaign returning for the sixth consecutive year. The fourth quarter also brought the return of McDonald's Monopoly to the Canadian market, but this time utilizing our app to elevate the experience. We leveraged learnings from recent U.K. and Australia activations where we combined the nostalgic peel-off game pieces with the option to digitally scan and track progress on our app, which helped accelerate top line momentum and sales through our digital channels.\nFueling digital growth was also central to Germany's strong performance with the market's first MyMcDonald's-branded affordability campaign. This promotion featured daily offers alongside mobile order messaging to drive full digital platform engagement. It was followed by the launch of digital Monopoly in the market, which helped grow digital to over 60% of total sales. It's examples like this that once again highlight the power of the McDonald's system, allowing us to tap into proven successes in one market and then scale those ideas.\nIn Australia, we continued to leverage the strength of our McCafé brand with an iced coffee promotion in the summer months. This campaign built upon our coffee leadership in the market as we continued to drive share gains. And we maintained our market leadership in France with always-on family messaging and a fully integrated chicken campaign, highlighting our iconic Chicken McNuggets paired with unique and trendy sauces.\nMoving to the U.S. Comp sales were up over 10% for the quarter, a testament to our work together with franchisees over the last several years, which has created a strong foundation. The collective decisions to put brand at the center of our marketing, along with simplifying our menus, strengthening our digital business and recommitting to our core, have resonated with consumers and are continuing to drive growth. Strategic calendar planning from marketing to restaurant execution has enabled our teams to stay laser-focused on what truly matters most for our customers.\nHigher average check supported by strategic price increases as well as positive guest counts contributed to our performance this quarter. Memorable marketing campaigns, including our collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market, Boo Buckets and McRib brought nostalgia to our customers, fueling top line momentum with limited added complexity in our restaurants.\nTurning to our International Developmental Licensed Markets. Comp sales were up over 16% for the quarter with strong sales growth across all geographies in the segment. Japan achieved an impressive 29th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales with continued strength at the dinner daypart. A focus on driving digital affordability helped increase the frequency of our most loyal digital customers.\nRecovery in China, however, remained challenging as COVID-related government restrictions were still in place for a majority of the fourth quarter, resulting in some temporary closures and limited operations. While comp sales in China were negative, we focused on showcasing our strength in beef with the Big Mac best burger launch and continued to gain traffic share in a shrinking QSR market. And despite the ongoing operating challenges, we opened over 700 new restaurants last year, which is an all-time high.\nTurning to our P&L. Company-operated margins were just over 15% for the quarter, reflecting the continued pressure from elevated commodities, wages as well as higher energy costs. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.16 per share with earnings per share of $2.59 for the quarter.\nFor the full year, adjusted operating margin was nearly 45%, reflecting higher restaurant margin dollars across all segments. Despite the significant P&L pressures that we've discussed, top line results generated restaurant margin dollars of over $13 billion for the year, an increase of nearly $1.5 billion in constant currency. Franchise restaurants, which now represent 95% of our global portfolio, contributed nearly 90% of our total restaurant margins, reflecting the stability of our business model.\nLastly, before I hand it back over to Chris, I want to touch briefly on our capital expenditures and free cash flow profile. Our CapEx spend for the year was approximately $1.9 billion, which included remaining reinvestment to substantially complete our Experience of the Future efforts in the U.S. market. Over the last few years, we've invested billions of dollars in modernizing our estate, and it's clear in our results that these investments are paying off. After reinvesting in the business, our free cash flow conversion was nearly 90% for the year.\nAnd with that, let me pass it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Ian. As we look ahead to 2023, macroeconomic uncertainties will persist, and we expect to continue to face headwinds. Our base case for a mild to moderate recession in the U.S., and one that will be a little deeper and longer in Europe, is unchanged from what we shared on our Q3 earnings call. We also expect inflationary costs to continue to pressure our margins, which Ian will discuss in greater detail.\nIn this environment, we must maintain our disciplined approach to pricing. We need to balance passing through our pricing on our menus while maintaining our strong position on value with our customers. Our positive guest count performance in 2022 demonstrates our success so far in balancing these competing demands, and we need to remain judicious with pricing actions.\nOngoing communication with our franchisees regarding the magnitude and pace of pricing will remain essential. Our franchisees are focused on the long term. And time and again, that approach has been rewarded. As long as we continue to do the right things for the customer, we can always work through short-term challenges.\nMcDonald's understands that customers' perception on value is made up of more than just the price of our food. It's also about the experience we provide. Our modernization efforts have had a significant impact on improving our customers' experience, and this is also improving how our customers think of our brand. Now that we are nearly fully modernized, our attention has turned to being laser-focused on our operations and running great restaurants.\nIn 2022, we have reengaged most of our system on maintaining operational excellence in our restaurants through our Performance and Customer Excellence program, also known as PACE. This restaurant assessment and consulting tool, which is currently deployed in 30 markets, was suspended during COVID. Along with providing new tools, this represents a new way of working for our field teams that helps markets target organizational and restaurant support for key growth drivers. This renewed focus will help protect McDonald's brand standards for an outstanding customer experience every single day.\nRestarting PACE in 2022 led to strong operational improvements in several key markets as a result of a more dedicated consulting and coaching time to support lower-performing restaurants. For example, the U.K. saw improved customer satisfaction, speed of service and overall experience for these restaurants. In Spain, restaurants that had the lowest customer satisfaction scores in the drive-thru improved to be at the same level as top-performing restaurants by the end of 2022. Additionally, as a result of this program, France saw increases of 30% in customer satisfaction scores at locations with the lowest scores.\nPACE clearly drives operational improvements, which provides a better customer experience that in turn drives business performance. This month, the U.S. also restarted PACE, and we expect to see similar operational benefits in our largest market in 2023.\nI'll now turn it back to Ian to talk in more detail about our 2023 outlook.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAs Chris just discussed and as I talked about last quarter, we continue to operate in an extremely dynamic environment. Looking ahead to this year, we anticipate macro-related pressures will continue to weigh on both our consumers and our business. With significant inflationary headwinds across commodities, labor and utilities, our company-operated margin percent will be hampered in the near term, and we expect full year 2023 company-operated margin percent will be slightly lower than our quarter 4 results.\nThis elevated cost environment is also impacting restaurant cash flow for our franchisees, particularly in our European markets. As we've previously mentioned, our financial strength and scale gives us the ability to provide temporary and targeted support, ultimately keeping our entire system aligned on proactively investing to drive long-term growth. We estimate that these efforts will have an impact of between $100 million to $150 million in 2023.\nTurning to G&A. The digital and technology investments that we've made over the past few years have been strong contributors to our top line growth. Moving forward, focusing on our evolution of Accelerating the Arches and, in particular, accelerating the organization will enable us to work more efficiently and effectively, harnessing our scale and reallocating resources to drive growth in the future. In 2023, we expect G&A to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of system-wide sales.\nDespite the cost pressures throughout the P&L in 2023, we anticipate an operating margin of about 45% driven primarily by strong top line growth and franchise margin performance. We're projecting interest expense this year to increase between 10% and 12% compared to 2022, primarily due to higher average rates on our debt balances. And we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%. We anticipate currency translation will negatively impact earnings per share between $0.07 and $0.09 in the first quarter. As of now, we expect currency translation to be a slight tailwind for the full year. But as you have seen, currency rates have been fluctuating quite a bit recently. So we'll continue to keep you posted on the anticipated impact to our results.\nTransitioning to capital expenditures. We plan to spend between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion this year, about half of which will be dedicated to new unit openings. Globally, we plan to open about 1,900 restaurants with more than 400 of these openings in our U.S. and IOM segments, where we continue to see strong returns. The remaining 1,500-or-so new restaurants, including about 900 in China, will be across our IDL markets. As a reminder, our strategic partners provide the capital for these restaurant openings. Overall, we anticipate almost 4% unit growth from the about 1,500 net restaurant additions in 2023. We expect this will contribute, along with restaurants opened in 2022, nearly 1.5% to system-wide sales growth.\nAs Chris mentioned, work is underway on our fourth D, restaurant development, within Accelerating the Arches. We'll have more details to share later this year, but we're excited about the opportunity to accelerate the pace of our new unit openings moving forward.\nAnd finally, we expect to generate strong cash flow in 2023, enabling us once again to convert more than 90% of our net income to free cash flow. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to invest in new units and opportunities to grow the business, along with reinvesting in existing restaurants; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to repurchase shares.\nIt's times like these that highlight the strength and scale of our McDonald's system. Although 2023 will bring short-term pressures, I'm confident that the resilience of our business and our strategy will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and our shareholders. Now let me turn it back over to Chris to close.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThe McDonald's global system is executing at a high level, and I'm optimistic that our Accelerating the Arches strategy offers us a long runway of growth despite the headwinds that we've discussed on this call. The McDonald's brand is in great shape, and yet there's so much more we can do.\nIn my travels throughout our global system, I sometimes like to ask our people, what exactly does McDonald's Corporation sell? As you might imagine, this usually prompts a lot of puzzled looks, and a brave soul or 2 will raise their hand and say, \"Well, we sell great-tasting food or we sell burgers and fries.\" Of course, that's technically true. But as a largely franchised business, ultimately, McDonald's Corporation is in the business of selling a brand so that others can sell burgers and fries. And while some may see it as a trivial distinction, I see it as fundamental. As goes the McDonald's brand, so goes the health and economic value of our company and system.\nOur Accelerating the Arches strategy is designed to build our brand to make McDonald's more relevant to more people more often. Our MCD growth pillars are driving system-wide sales, and the recently announced Accelerating the Organization initiative will help us unlock further growth by enabling our system to be even faster, more innovative and more efficient. Through Accelerating the Organization, we'll sharpen our priorities and increase our investments against our biggest opportunities.\nI want to congratulate the McDonald's system on a terrific 2022 and thank all 3 legs of the stool, our franchisees, our suppliers and our company employees, for their dedication and passion for our business. A global pandemic, record-breaking inflation, a war in Europe, the McDonald's system continues to execute and deliver no matter the challenge, and I'm excited to continue our success into 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mike to begin the Q&A.",

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded.\n(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nCorporate SVP, Treasurer & IR, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden.\nAs a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following our prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning. I'm proud to report that our Q3 performance demonstrated our broad-based business momentum against an evolving macroeconomic backdrop. McDonald's unmatched scale and operational resilience powered by our 3-legged stool has enabled us to deliver strong results this quarter. Global comp sales were up nearly 10%, and most of our major markets are growing share, which gives us confidence that we are operating from a position of strength even during difficult times.\nAs the macroeconomic landscape continues to evolve and uncertainties persist, we continue to consider a wider range of scenarios as we look ahead. As I've said before, our base case scenario going forward is that we expect to experience a mild to moderate recession in the U.S. and one that will be potentially a little deeper and longer in Europe. That said, we operate in more than 100 countries around the world in varying economic environments. This has provided our team's valuable experience as McDonald's has proven to be successful in just about any business environment. I remain confident in our accelerating the Arches strategy as our teams around the world continue to execute at a high level.\nAnd thanks to the resilience of the system and our continued investments at scale, we're laser focused on meeting the changing needs of our customers.\nBefore we get into those details, I want to introduce Ian Borden on his first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. Ian brings a wealth of experience to this role, having spent the past several years as a member of our global senior leadership team. He first joined our system in Canada in 1994 and from there, went on a bit of a McDonald's World Tour. Over the past 30 years, he has served as CFO for Asia Pac, Middle East and Africa region and CFO for Russia and Eastern Europe. He's also held several leadership roles across our markets and regions most recently as President of McDonald's International. I'm thrilled for Ian to be stepping into this new role, and I'll now turn it over to him to share more on our Q3 results.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and great to be with everyone this morning for my first earnings call. So let me start with a few headlines on our overall performance. Our global comp sales of 9.5% for the quarter are a testament to the continued resilience of our business. It goes without saying that we are seeing global macroeconomic challenges that haven't been experienced in many years. inflationary pressures and related interest rate increases taken by central banks are combining to put significant pressure on the consumer and our industry.\nDespite the challenging backdrop, our systems focus on accelerating the Arches that I have seen at work across more than 100 countries gives me confidence in our ability to navigate these challenges.\nThe power of our strategy is brought to life through our actions against our M, C and D framework, working together with the customer at the center.\nIn the third quarter, we remain focused on delivering delicious and affordable food with the convenience McDonald's is known for, which is now more important than ever to our customers. This continued to drive our market leadership and strong underlying sales growth across all segments of our business.\nIn our International Operated Markets, comp sales grew 8.5% for the quarter, with positive comps across all markets. This demonstrates the underlying strength of the IOM segment, where we continue to gain market share.\nIn France, we're operating from a position of market share strength, particularly with families as French consumers have resumed more normal routines. And we continue to grow loyalty in the market with a record mix of our transactions coming through our mobile app. By utilizing global mobile app offers in combination with traditional value offerings, Germany further highlighted our affordability and accelerated loyalty adoption at the same time. This drove strong growth in digital sales, which now represent more than 50% of system-wide sales in the market.\nAustralia showcased our beef equities with a Winter Together and Loving it Campaign. Tapping into the role McDonald's plays in making everyday moments special. The campaign featured both the Angus and Quarter Pounder sandwiches and resulted in a meaningful lift in beef sales.\nAnd with the U.K. launch of My McDonald's Rewards in July, we now have loyalty programs in place across all of our top 6 global markets. The U.K. built on the successful rollout driving additional adoption with exclusive app offers throughout the quarter. And with the MONOPOLY promotion in September, the team developed an innovative incentive that allowed customers to virtually fill their game board pieces right in the app. The focus on driving digital engagement paid off as our active loyalty members grew to over $3 million in just the first 3 months.\nWhile the expiration of VAT benefits impacted our quarterly comp sales in the market, we continue to grow QSR market share. Although our business performance has remained resilient, as I mentioned earlier, we recognize that this is a challenging environment. The inflationary impact on costs is putting pressure on restaurant cash flows for our franchisees, particularly in our European markets.\nSimilar to actions that we took during COVID, our financial strength puts us in a position to be there for franchisees that may need temporary and targeted support to ensure our system is financially healthy and aligned on continuing to drive growth.\nMoving to the U.S., the efforts and investments by our franchisees, employees, restaurant teams and suppliers over the last several years are paying off. The modernization of our estate, combined with strong discipline and execution across our core menu and backed by award-winning marketing is connecting with customers and driving results.\nIn the U.S., third quarter comp sales were up more than 6%, marking our ninth consecutive quarter of growth and achieving positive comp sales in 22 of the last 23 quarters. Higher average check supported by strategic price increases and positive guest counts contributed to performance.\nLoyalty remained a significant growth driver for the quarter, in part fueled by the Camp McDonald's promotion. A year after the launch of My McDonald's Rewards in the U.S., we continue to increase digital customer frequency quarter after quarter. Of the customers that have engaged with the app over the last year, about 2/3 have been active in the last 90 days.\nTurning to the international developmental license markets. Comp sales were up nearly 17% for the quarter, with strong sales growth across all geographies in the segment. Japan delivered strong growth at the dinner day part with popular returning limited time offerings across both chicken and beef.\nWe also highlighted our off-premise channels, further elevating customer convenience with an emphasis on McDelivery. It continues to be a challenging operating environment in China, with ongoing COVID resurgences and government restrictions, consumer confidence remains low. While comps for the quarter were slightly negative, the market continued to grow share, leaning into the strength of our delivery and digital business with the team on track to open about 800 restaurants this year, an all-time high.\nAnd now let me turn it back over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThank you, Ian. Over the last few months, I've visited markets around the world, hearing from employees, franchisees and restaurant teams about how the challenges we face globally impact our restaurants locally. Three themes came through loud and clear. There is increasing uncertainty and unease about the economic environment, the resilience of the McFamily alongside our scale and efforts to build a more connected and convenient McDonald's set us apart. Our franchisees remain confident that we have the right business plans to work together and drive growth as a system.\nWe see this in real time. Even as U.K. customers grapple with cost of living and energy impacts, our customers are coming back to McDonald's because of the value we offer. And in Germany, as customers deal with the highest inflation on record, our teams continue to focus on branded affordability. No matter the issues our customers face, we are dedicated to meeting their needs.\nRay Kroc said it best, \"When we look after our customers, the business will look after itself.\" And I'm proud that our business can be there to provide a warm space and a hot meal for families when they need it most.\nAccelerating the Arches of our playbook that is guiding our business and driving growth. By focusing on executing our strategy, I am confident that McDonald's will continue to show up for our customers across our M, C and Ds. Our foresight to double down on digital and delivery to execute culturally relevant marketing campaigns across the world to highlight our core menu capabilities and to invest in our asset base is really paying off. Our size, scale and financial results put us in an advantaged position as we head into more volatile times, and we will lean into the strengths of the system.\nDigital is a primary driver to improve the customer experience, reduce complexity and drive profitability. In our top 6 markets, it now represents over 1/3 of system-wide sales, fueled by over 43 million active customers on our app in the third quarter.\nIn the U.S., our digital business is powered by over 25 million active customers driven through my McDonald's rewards. Our loyalty program is driving growth and exceeding expectations. Delivery also remains a key driver of our business to enhance convenience, we're integrating a new feature where customers can earn loyalty points order and pay for delivery within the McDonald's app. The streamlined and more rewarding experience is available to customers in the U.K. and is currently being rolled out in the U.S. Further implementation of this solution will only enhance our strong performance as the third quarter was one of our highest delivery sales quarters ever in the U.S.\nEach reward a customer redeems and each preference of customer shares on our app helps power our personal touch. We are using this deeper understanding of our customers to create relevant content and offers through the channels they prefer. By tailoring messages, our customers feel more connected to McDonald's, ultimately driving engagement and increasing frequency.\nIt also gives us more ways to reunite with customers who haven't visited in a while. Our markets are also using digital to drive engagement with our fans through exclusive activations. In Australia, the success of their digitally exclusive Monopoly program speaks to the endurance of our marketing platforms and our ability to adapt existing equities to meet our customers where they are. The team incorporated loyalty into the Monopoly promotion in order to make it even more rewarding for consumers and the promotion drove significant incremental sales for the market. Marketing has been an important growth driver for us. Our creative excellence is making our brand not just more recognizable, but more relevant to our fans. I can confidently say that the McDonald's marketing team is truly firing on all cylinders.\nEarlier this month, through a collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market in the U.S., we tapped in one of the most nostalgic McDonald's experiences, enjoying a happy meal as a kid and repackaged it to make it relevant for adult fans.\nThis promotion reengaged our fans to our core food, including Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets. It's fair to say that this sentimental experience was a success as 50% of our supply of collectibles was sold in the first 4 days of the promotion. These increased visits also drove the highest weekly digital transactions ever in the U.S. business, and we expect October comp sales in the U.S. to be in the low double digits. The heart of this marketing idea taps into emotional connections with our fans, adding the fun of collectibles with a relevant artist.\nAll of these campaigns featured our core menu items and built upon our successful marketing platforms, which kept operations simple and brought our customers closer to the iconic menu items they love.\nSpeaking of our food, as we come up with fresh spins in our classics, we're creating new craveable moments for a new generation of McDonald's fans. In Italy, we drove strong comps for the quarter as we highlighted simple yet compelling core menu items paired alongside great marketing with a Big Mac event featuring a Chicken Big Mac and a Bacon Big Mac.\nWe're also focused on growing our business through chicken by leaning into the strength of core icons like Chicken McNuggets. At the same time, we are very confident in new global favorites like the McCrispy Chicken Sandwich, and we will look to bring a select number of these new equities to scale. Canada and Germany launched the McCrispy in Q3, and it launched in our most recent market the U.K. just last week.\nAustralia recently promoted a spice event featuring Spicy McNuggets and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. Spain promoted McSpicy in July and is planning future spicy events to bring relevant taste and flavors to their customers.\nChicken is a strong growth driver of comp sales in the quarter across our major markets and will remain a focus for us as we continue to grow our global market share in this important category. Our success wouldn't be possible without the incredible dedication of our restaurant teams that I saw in action and heard from directly during my travels. The people that bring the McDonald's experience to life in our restaurants are truly the face of our brand. That's the promise of a new advertising campaign for Best Burger in Belgium that highlights the individuals making our delicious food versus just the juicy burgers themselves. The people in our restaurants are truly our secret sauce and the ingredient we are most proud of. Thanks to the resilience of the system and our continued investment at scale in the M, Cs, and Ds, we're staying relevant to our customers as their needs continue to change.\nNow I'll turn it back to Ian to finish walking through the financials.\n\nIan Frederick Borden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. Our strong performance during the third quarter resulted in earnings per share of $2.68. This reflects an adjusted increase of 4% in constant currencies after excluding the prior year gain for the partial divestiture of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. Company-operated margins remain pressured by significant commodity and wage inflation as well as elevated energy costs. We believe these pressures will continue to impact margins for the next several quarters. G&A costs increased about 7% in constant currencies for the quarter, driven by a combination of continued investment in growth-driving initiatives such as restaurant technology and inflationary pressures on costs.\nFor the full year, we now expect G&A to be between 2.3% and 2.4% of system-wide sales. This is primarily due to the inflationary pressures I just mentioned as well as a stronger U.S. dollar having a greater impact on sales, which are predominantly outside of the U.S., whereas most of our G&A expense is U.S. dollar based. However, despite these headwinds, our year-to-date adjusted operating margin percentage has grown and is now in the mid-40s. Our effective tax rate was 21.9% for the quarter.\nThe strong U.S. dollar I just mentioned, created a foreign currency headwind to quarter 3 earnings per share of $0.19. And based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to impact fourth quarter earnings per share by between $0.14 to $0.16, but the full year headwind totaling about $0.50. As always, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the remainder of the year.\nAnd transitioning to capital expenditures, we now anticipate spending about $2 billion, an adjustment from our previous guidance due to foreign exchange rates and slightly lower spend.\nA few weeks ago, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 10%, the company's 46th consecutive annual increase. As we've talked about today, the Accelerating the Arches plan is driving strong financial results and cash flow.\nAs we continue to execute against this plan, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver sustained long-term profitability for our system, all of which is reflected in the recent dividend increase.\nBefore I close and hand it back to Chris, I just want to take the opportunity to personally congratulate Kevin on his successful tenure as McDonald's CFO. He's been a great partner to me as I've transitioned into this role, and I look forward to building on the strong foundations that he has put in place. It was a pleasure to meet so many of you last month. As I mentioned then, I expect that you'll find a great deal of consistency between Kevin and myself particularly when it comes to the financial priorities of our business.\nWhile the environment remains dynamic and challenging times may lie ahead, I remain incredibly confident in our strategy, our business momentum and our system. I look forward to meeting and working with all of you.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back over to Chris to close.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThank you, Ian. Before we close and head into the Q&A portion, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that next week marks my third year as CEO of McDonald's. And therefore, my third year of discussions with many of you in this capacity.\nIn some of our first conversations in late 2019, I highlighted 3 areas that I expected to focus on as CEO. The need to elevate our marketing with programs that are culturally relevant and accretive to our business, the need to develop a digital strategy to drive frequency, retention and engagement at scale and the need to ensure that McDonald's attracts and retains the best talent in the world.\nYou saw much of this come to life in our Accelerating the Arches growth strategy, which provided a road map to focus the system across our M, Cs and Ds. Since our conversations first began and in the many we've had over the last 3 years, I'm proud of what McDonald's has accomplished on these fronts, all while navigating an increasingly complicated world. Our investments in digital are keeping us relevant to customers and creating business momentum.\nIn addition to what Ian shared, I'll just emphasize that delivery now is in over 100 countries and our loyalty program is now in over 50 markets around the world, driving growth and exceeding expectations. Our marketing programs have enabled us to recapture the imagination of our customers, bringing new joy and excitement to their interactions with our brand. With fresh approaches, we are staying relevant to the fans we serve across generations who are driving meaningful contributions to our business.\nAnd when you look at the leadership team that the global segment and market levels, I am proud to have welcomed and promoted leaders who infuse new energy, new perspective, deep values and strong capabilities to the McDonald's system.\nLooking forward, my focus and responsibility is to ensure that McDonald's uses its position of strength that we find ourselves in today to create even more value for our stakeholders. We will do this by continuing to work even more collaboratively and effectively in a world that is only moving faster. We will do this by building on our inherent strengths, harnessing our competitive advantages and investing in innovation that allows us to deliver on our brand promise to consumers. And we will do this by focusing collectively on solving the needs of our customers. That is ultimately how we will ensure that we are unleashing the full potential of McDonald's to those we serve. I'd like to extend a whole heart of thanks to the McDonald's system for these collective successes and everything that we will continue to deliver in the future, and thanks to all of you for the discussions that we've had up to this point.\nNow we'll begin Q&A.",

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr.Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nCorporate SVP, Treasurer & IR, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan.\nAs a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions)\nToday's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud to report that our Q2 performance was yet another demonstration of our broad-based business momentum with global comp sales up nearly 10% and most of our major markets continuing to grow market share. One thing is clear: The world continues to move in fast and often unforeseen ways. As it does, the McDonald's brand endures.\nBut before we get into details of the past quarter, I want to offer up a few words about Kevin Ozan, who is joining today's call for the final time as McDonald's Chief Financial Officer. According to, Kevin, this is his 30th earnings call as CFO, but who's counting? To say that Kevin has had a profound impact on McDonald's is an understatement, and I should note that this impact isn't coming to an end just yet. But as he transitions from his duties as CFO, it's a perfect time to reflect on what he has done in the seat.\nWhen Kevin first took the reins as CFO in Q1 2015, comparable sales and guest counts were declining globally and across each geographic segment. And there were real questions about the growth outlook for the company. Rising customer and investor expectations demanded a clear vision and voice, which Kevin ably provided. Kevin has been a constant in shepherding McDonald's through unprecedented change again and again. From leading the company's financial turnaround in 2015 and helping create our last 2 strategic growth plans to navigating through a global pandemic and exiting a major market, Kevin has seen it all.\nDuring his time as CFO, the company increased system-wide sales by over 25% to more than $100 billion, increased the number of restaurants worldwide by more than 10% to nearly 40,000 restaurants and returned over $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As just one barometer of Kevin's impact, McDonald's stock has appreciated 150% during his tenure. Anyone who's worked with Kevin knows his leadership is as much about what he does as how he does it. His insightful strategic approach to the business is matched by his ability to make human connections at all levels and with all stakeholders across our system. It's safe to say that Kevin is one of the most beloved senior leaders in our organization.\nBut like I said, Kevin is not going anywhere just yet. He's been promoted to a new elevated role as our Senior Executive Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, where he'll work closely with me until his retirement next year. I'll look to his counsel as we execute against our Accelerating the Arches strategy and identify areas where we can continue to evolve this strategy to meet the needs of customers long into the future. I expect we'll be sharing more down the road with all of you. Kevin, this isn't goodbye, not by a long shot. But on behalf of the entire McDonald's system, it's an opportune time to say thank you.\nNow on to the business operating environment. As we entered the year, we knew we were facing rising inflation, a surge in COVID-19 cases and the return of government restrictions in many markets exacerbating labor shortages and supply chain challenges. Over the last 6 months, the macro uncertainty has only increased. We now face war in Europe, inflation is running at its highest levels in 40 years, interest rates are rising to levels we haven't seen in years. All of this is contributing to weak consumer sentiment around the world and the possibility of a global recession.\nWe're mindful of these risks, and we're planning for a wider range of scenarios. And while our McDonald's business continues to perform well, this is a very challenging environment for our McFamily, from restaurant teams, to franchisees, to suppliers. But we're united in our purpose to feed and foster the communities in which we operate to provide an affordable destination for a delicious meal. Now more than ever, that is what our customers are seeking, which is why we feel so well positioned and confident in our continued success. Our global system is aligned behind a comprehensive strategy that is centered on the customer. This is strengthening our brand, which is driving broad-based market share gains.\nI mentioned during our last quarter that we would provide an update on the state of our business in Russia. It became increasingly clear the Russian war against Ukraine meant that McDonald's wouldn't be able to continue to operate in Russia in a way that would be accretive to our business objectives or aligned with our values. That's why in May, we announced that we would exit the market and sell our restaurants to a Russian buyer to be operated under a different identity. While the Golden Arches no longer shine in Russia, we are continuing to support our people in Ukraine and remain ever hopeful for a resolution of this conflict.\nNow for more on our Q2 numbers, let me turn it over to Kevin so he can give his 30th and final quarterly earnings readout. Kevin?\n\nKevin M. Ozan\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris, and thank you for the kind words. As Chris mentioned, global comp sales were up nearly 10% in the second quarter, demonstrating the continued resilience of our business despite the challenging environment. In fact, when we look at our 3-year comp growth with the U.S. over 19% and our IOM and IDL segments both more than 15%, we see that our business around the world has been extremely resilient through the tumultuous last few years. Our quarterly results reflect strong underlying sales growth across all segments, a direct result of remaining customer focused and executing against our strategy.\nIn our International Operated Markets, we continued to gain QSR traffic share as markets showcased our iconic core equities and further capitalized on our digital channels. This fueled comp sales growth of 13% for the segment with positive comps across all markets. Recovery in Germany and France continued as remaining government restrictions eased early in the quarter. Germany built on their successful launch of loyalty at the end of last year and ran a Big Mac celebration campaign using mobile app offers to further drive digital adoption. In France, we highlighted our core burgers with strong marketing behind our triple cheeseburger, helping grow QSR market share to another record-high level.\nCanada continued to prioritize convenience as the market accelerated digital momentum with always-on loyalty messaging. We also featured a summer drink days promotion, highlighting our strong value proposition across all dayparts. Australia built on their first quarter launch of loyalty and accelerated digital engagement across the market with a strong lineup of mobile app offers. And we partnered with Australian pop star, The Kid LAROI , whose famous order was available exclusively through our mobile app and McDelivery.\nIn the U.K., the return of the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich and Big Tasty promotion drove significant incremental sales. A daily digital sales calendar also helped build our digital customer base, leading up to the recent launch of loyalty. While the expiration of VAT benefits impacted our quarterly comp sales in the market, we continue to grow QSR market share.\nMoving to the U.S. We posted positive comps across all dayparts in the second quarter, led by breakfast. Overall comp sales were up nearly 4% due to higher average check, supported by strategic price increases. We continue to focus on everyday affordability that customers are looking for across both our everyday value menu and digital offerings.\nTurning to the International Developmental Licensed Markets. Comp sales were up 16% in the quarter, largely driven by strong comps in Japan and Latin America. Japan achieved an impressive 27th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales with strength across our delivery and digital channels, and our growth at the dinner daypart continued with popular limited-time offerings across both chicken and beef.\nRecovery in China remains challenged with negative double-digit comp sales in the second quarter due to ongoing COVID resurgences and related lockdowns across key cities. This resulted in temporary restaurant closures throughout the country for most of the quarter. While operating conditions are challenging, restaurants remained focused on the consumer, offering core menu favorites and targeted digital coupons.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. McDonald's is one of the most recognized and beloved brands on earth. Today, our opportunity is building on this recognition to keep up with customers and communities around the world and on every platform, whether it's our global mobile app or social media. I'm proud of McDonald's industry-leading digital and marketing initiatives that allow us to connect with even more customers in entirely new and creative ways so we can strengthen our relationships, better connect to culture and meet customers where they are.\nThe investments we're making in digital, one of our biggest opportunities for growth, are beginning to bear fruit. In our top 6 markets, digital sales, which include mobile app, kiosk and delivery, represented over $6 billion or nearly 1/3 of system-wide sales in the second quarter. With the launch of MyMcDonald's Rewards in the U.K. this month, we now have loyalty programs in nearly 50 markets, including all of our top 6 markets.\nEnrollment and participation continue to grow, and our loyal customers are highly engaged with us. Nearly 22 million of U.S. loyalty members have been active in the last 90 days. MyMcDonald's Rewards has consistently driven more frequent visits and incremental sales in each of the markets as we've launched.\nEach reward a customer redeems and each preference a customer shares helps us power our personal touch. We can use this deeper understanding of our customers to create content and offers relevant to them through the channels they prefer. By tailoring messages, our customers feel more connected to McDonald's, ultimately driving engagement that increases both spend and frequency. It even means we can reunite with customers who haven't visited us in a while.\nWe're also strengthening our iconic core menu. As I've mentioned before, in markets around the world, we're taking our leading burgers and making them even better by implementing enhanced cooking procedures and new buns, resulting in hotter, juicier and tastier burgers. Spain was the latest market to launch these taste and quality improvements, driving incremental sales and giving our customers yet another reason to keep coming back for more.\nWe'll also keep coming up with fresh spins on our classics, creating craveable moments for a new generation of McDonald's fans. In Germany, strong marketing and core menu campaigns, including the Big Mac celebration featuring double Big Mac drove strong comps for the quarter. In Australia, we leveraged the strength of our McCafe brand with the launch of the Australiano coffee in the second quarter and continue to grow our share in coffee.\nOf course, there's no better example of combining classic with modern relevance than our transformational marketing. And that's not just my opinion, it's the consensus of the marketing industry. McDonald's was repeatedly recognized this quarter for advertising that captures both hearts and minds. At Cannes Lion last month, McDonald's and its marketing partners received multiple awards while simultaneously being named the most effective brand on the WARC Effective 100 for the third year running. We swept the global Effie Awards and were recognized as the #1 most effective brand and marketer in the U.S.\nOver the past few months, we've continued to turn cultural moments into creative pedestals for the Golden Arches. In May, McDonald's commemorated Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee by recording a new version of our world-famous I'm Lovin' It jingle, making headlines and history. As Kevin mentioned, Australia launched our latest famous order with pop phenom The Kid LAROI. And we created a significant brand moment in Canada with our annual McHappy Day campaign, raising nearly $6 million for Ronald McDonald House Charities and lifting sales and brand perceptions in the process. Our creative excellence has expanded our reach and made McDonald's not just more recognizable but more relevant, and it's this customer connection that is continuing to drive our business in new and exciting ways.\nNow to talk more about our second quarter financial performance, I'll hand it back to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Ozan\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. Our strong top line performance resulted in adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $2.55, an increase of 15% in constant currencies. This adjusted EPS excludes $1.2 billion of charges related to our exit from Russia and a gain of $270 million from the sale of Dynamic Yield.\nAdjusted EPS was hurt by $0.16 of currency as the dollar strengthened significantly in the second quarter. That was double the amount we estimated in our first quarter earnings call based on exchange rates at that time. Our G&A costs increased 10% in constant currencies for the quarter, reflecting higher investments in restaurant technology and incremental expenses related to our worldwide convention and proxy contests.\nAs expected, company-operated margins were hampered by significant commodity and wage inflation as well as rising energy costs. Given macroeconomic conditions, we expect these inflationary pressures will continue to impact margins for the remainder of the year. Our company-operated margin dollars for the quarter were also negatively impacted by our exit from Russia, which was a heavily company-owned market. Even with these cost headwinds and our exit from Russia, our strong system-wide sales growth contributed to healthy flow-through to operating income. Total restaurant margin dollars grew $270 million in constant currency as a result of sales-driven growth in franchise margins, which now make up nearly 90% of restaurant margin dollars. This resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 45% for the quarter.\nLastly, based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to reduce third quarter EPS by about $0.14 to $0.16 and full year EPS by roughly $0.40 to $0.50, again, double the impact that we estimated on our first quarter call. As we certainly saw last quarter, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely fluctuate as we move through the year.\nBefore I pass it back to Chris, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It's been an absolute privilege to serve as CFO of this iconic brand for over 7 years. During this time, I've met many people who are on the call this morning, from analysts who follow our industry to investors in our company. I've had a lot of thought-provoking conversations with many of you. You offered your opinions and challenged me, and my interactions with you over the years helped make me a better CFO and helped make McDonald's a better company.\nI'm extremely grateful for your engagement through the years and for the confidence you placed on us with your investments. I look forward to passing the baton to Ian Borden who I worked closely with on our senior leadership team for many years. We will continue to work together to ensure a smooth transition.\nThank you again. And now back to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin. As we reflect on these results for the second quarter, I feel tremendous pride in the entire McDonald's system. I believe there has never been a better time to be part of the McDonald's brand. We have the right leadership and the right strategy at exactly the right time to take this iconic brand to even greater heights.\nAs we announced over the past few weeks, we continue to assemble the right members of our global senior leadership team to help lead the next chapter for brand McDonald's, building on the successes made because of the outstanding contributions of former leaders. Because of McDonald's ability to provide a variety of opportunities and experiences as one of the world's most recognized and respected brands, our ability to recruit top talent and develop a deep bench is unparalleled in our industry. This only builds our confidence in executing on our strategic plan for the long term.\nAs Kevin mentioned, stepping into the CFO role next is 30-year McDonald's veteran Ian Borden. Currently President of International, Ian has worked literally around the world for McDonald's in a variety of capacities. He brings a great mix of financial and field experience into the CFO role, and it will be great to have him now based in our Chicago headquarters.\nAdditionally, Jill McDonald will be returning to McDonald's as President of our International Operated Market. Jill began her career as a marketer, eventually leading global marketing at British Airways. Jill then joined McDonald's as Chief Marketing Officer for our U.K. business and Northern Europe and later became the Managing Director for our U.K. business and President of Northern Europe. Jill is a seasoned veteran of the consumer industry, having served most recently as CEO of Costa Coffee. Her strong customer focus, passion for creative excellence and commitment to innovation align well with my priorities, and I'm confident Jill will help accelerate the next phase of the IOM segment's growth.\nI'm also happy to share that Jo Sempels will continue to lead our International Developmental Licensed Markets as President of IDL. Jo's responsibilities will now include our large fast-growing China business, which currently reports to Ian in his capacity as President of International.\nMeanwhile, Francesca Debiase will be retiring as Global Chief Supply Chain Officer after more than 3 decades at McDonald's and over 7 years in this role. I'm especially grateful to Francesca for stewarding our world-class supply chain through unprecedented disruptions and for spearheading sustainable solutions that are now standard practice throughout our system. While we'll miss Francesca, we're happy that Marion Gross will now be stepping into this role. Marion has been with McDonald's for 29 years, most recently as Chief Supply Chain Officer of McDonald's North America.\nI'm lucky to be surrounded by such great leaders who are also such good people. That's what McDonald's is all about, which is why we call ourselves the McFamily. With that, let's begin Q&A.",

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.\n\nMike Cieplak\n\nCorporate SVP, Treasurer & IR, McDonald's Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan.\nAs a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. (Operator Instructions)\nToday's call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of welcoming more than 13,000 members of global McDonald's family, franchisees, restaurant teams, suppliers and company employees to our first in-person worldwide convention in 4 years. The sense of optimism and pride in our brand, coupled with excitement for our future, was overwhelming.\nWe celebrated how far we've come together and united around how much further we can go together in the years ahead. Through it all, the message has been singular and clear, there has never been a better time to be part of brand McDonald's. This was reaffirmed on our road to convention as our senior leadership team participated in a series of market visits to meet with and hear from restaurant teams in person. I look forward to continuing to visit more teams around the world in the coming months to see how they are bringing our strategy to life in our restaurants.\nMcDonald's entered 2022 from a position of strength, and I'm proud to share that we built on that momentum in Q1. Though we continue to monitor the latest developments on the pandemic, we've been pleased to see strong recovery in international markets in the first quarter. In fact, in an increasingly complex and unpredictable external environment, the past few years have demonstrated the resiliency of the McDonald's brand and our ability to drive historic growth.\nWe believe we're positioned to weather unprecedented macro pressures, like inflation, supply chain issues, labor availability and COVID resurgences. There is power in dialing up our execution and focusing on what's within our control during challenging times to maximize the impact of our strategic plan. Staying on the side of the consumer and executing our plan is and has always been our model for driving growth, regardless of the macro backdrop.\nEqually as important is our ongoing commitment to invest in our people. It starts with building a culture of care. The more we show restaurant teams we care, the more they show the same care for our customers. By creating the type of environment where people want to work, whether they're looking to develop skills that they can take to future jobs or planning to build a career with us, McDonald's provides a holistic employee value proposition.\nIn turn, our people enable us to deliver an unequaled customer experience, backed by the power of our brand. This is our winning formula. It's a formula we will continue to protect, especially as we work to raise our ambition and create the next great chapter of this legendary brand together.\nBefore I turn it over to Kevin, I do want to acknowledge that our hearts and minds are with the Ukrainian people and all who have been impacted by this historic crisis that has brought new elements of uncertainty to communities around the world. Our restaurants in Ukraine and in Russia remain closed.\nIn both countries, we have continued to pay employees and provide additional support to them and others in need. But it's clear that this crisis is far from over. With an ever-evolving situation, we are analyzing our options and expect to provide clear direction to investors and other stakeholders no later than the end of the second quarter.\nNow over to Kevin to walk us through our Q1 performance.\n\nKevin M. Ozan\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. Global comp sales were up nearly 12% in the first quarter, reflecting strong underlying performance across all segments. In most of our major markets, we sustained QSR traffic share gains by elevating our brand, accelerating digital channels and showcasing our core equities of chicken and beef.\nWe entered 2022, expecting it to be a year of continued recovery in our international-operated markets as several markets were still experiencing COVID-related stops and starts throughout 2021. In the first quarter, comp sales in our IOM segment increased over 20% and average unit volumes have now surpassed pre-pandemic levels across the segment.\nThe U.K. continues to be one of our strongest performing markets. In the first quarter, performance in the U.K. was fueled by sustained digital momentum and strong menu initiatives, like the national rollout of McPlant and the extremely successful Chicken Big Mac promotion.\nIn Australia, the Welcome to My World convenience campaign showcased how we make consumers' lives easier and helped drive significant share gains in delivery. And the launch of MyMcDonald's Rewards in March has already increased app adoption among consumers.\nCanada also experienced strong digital growth, building on their successful fourth quarter launch of loyalty. Over the past couple of years, consumer mobility was particularly challenged in France and Germany, but we saw great improvement in both markets throughout the quarter. We highlighted our core menu in both markets, with a successful QPC campaign in France and the launch of our new premium beef platform, McDonald's Supreme, in Germany.\nAs Chris mentioned, the quarter also brought more macroeconomic challenges, including rising inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, all of which were elevated by the crisis in Ukraine. All of our restaurants in Ukraine were closed at the end of February. And in early March, we made the decision to suspend operations in Russia. While these markets represented about 2% of system-wide sales in 2021, the closures had a negligible impact on consolidated sales results for the first quarter this year.\nIn the U.S., comp sales were 3.5% for the first quarter. Higher average check, driven by strategic price increases, continued to be a significant growth driver and strong marketing campaigns across loyalty, value bundles and our Crispy Chicken Sandwich delivered incremental sales and continued to drive digital adoption.\nTurning to the international developmental license markets. Comp sales were up nearly 15% for the quarter, largely driven by positive comps in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. In Japan, we focused on off-premise channels as a result of elevated COVID levels, meeting shifting consumer needs and continuing to grow market share.\nWe also delivered strong growth at the dinner daypart, with limited time offerings like the re-hit of the Samurai Mac and the launch of Spicy Chicken Nuggets. And in China, a surge in COVID cases and renewed government restrictions created challenging operating conditions in the quarter, resulting in temporary restaurant closures throughout the country that continue today. While comps were negative for the quarter, we expanded our app engagement with digital-only promotions, including delivery offers and subscription cards.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin. Back in 2020, we took a hard look at changing customer needs we were seeing emerging through the pandemic. Those insights led us to our Accelerating the Arches strategic plan and a focus on the MCDs, maximizing our marketing, committing to our core menu and doubling down on the 3Ds, digital, delivery and drive-thru.\nThe power of the MCDs are when they work together, with the customer at the center. By doubling down on our 3Ds, digital, delivery and drive-thru, we continue to find new ways to reach our customers where they are and make their experience more seamless and personalized.\nDigital, in particular, is a tremendous opportunity for us. After all, in a world where the store front of McDonald's restaurant can be the screen of a smartphone, we're building stronger relationships with our customers. Knowing what they like, how they like it, when they want it, it's all a critical piece of our digital strategy, and the results of our efforts speak for themselves.\nIn our top 6 markets, digital sales, which include mobile app, kiosks and delivery, made up more than 30% of system-wide sales in the first quarter. This equates to nearly 60% growth over the past year.\nWe did over $2 billion of digital sales in the U.S. alone in the first quarter. One of the biggest drivers of our digital adoption is our global loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards. It's helping us better meet our customers' needs as we build more authentic and personal relationships.\nComing into this year, we had introduced MyMcDonald's Rewards in over 40 markets, including France, the U.S., Germany and Canada. Australia just launched in March, and the U.K. will go live later this year.\nEnrollment and participation are exceeding expectations. After just 9 months in the U.S., for instance, there are more than 26 million loyalty members earning rewards. We're also seeing more frequent visits from loyalty customers, many of whom were very loyal to begin with. Some of our largest markets have seen record customer visit frequency, driven by loyalty usage, coupled with app exclusive promotions. Those are the kind of results that make us eager to continue bringing MyMcDonald's Rewards to even more markets.\nAnd as customers return to our dining rooms, kiosk usage is coming back as a key order channel for customers. In Q1, kiosk sales made up more than half of in-restaurant sales in Australia, Germany, France and the U.K. At the same time, McDelivery has become the largest QSR delivery program in the world.\nWe recently announced a global partnership with Just Eat Takeaway, Europe's largest online restaurant ordering service. This is in addition to the Uber Eats and DoorDash global partnerships we announced last year. These global partnerships support growth of the McDelivery business and allow us to continue expanding our delivery capabilities so our customers can get the food they crave and the convenience they become accustomed to.\nIn the U.K., our customers can now order delivery directly on the McDonald's app. We plan to expand that capability to the U.S., Canada and Australia later this year. This will let us better control the delivery experience for our most loyal customers and to learn from the data they share, ultimately about how we create more seamless, memorable and personalized experiences.\nFinally, the competitive strength of our 25,000-plus drive-thru locations around the world continue to provide unparalleled convenience to our customers as routines are reestablished with further opportunities to innovate. And because of our iconic brand, we're building customer affinity by elevating our creative risk-taking and social media to enhance our already strong connections to customers.\nFan Truth unlocked this powerful connection. It created a common dialogue, tapping into what our fans already love about us, celebrating the rituals and memories that make our brand so special to them.\nThe U.S. first brought this to life with Famous Orders, which harnessed the simple truth that everyone has their go-to order. This quarter, the menu hacks promotion and our Super Bowl commercial were prime examples of how we can find and identify Fan Truth and transform something people already love, our food, into cultural moments to drive conversation and connection. And because these promotions feature existing core menu items, there's no added complexity to restaurant operations.\nThe concept of Fan Truth is coming to life all over the world. This quarter, China successfully activated the Famous Orders platform with their own local celebrity, featuring the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. And Australia plans to launch their own Famous Order in the second quarter.\nOur food is at the heart of customers' relationship with our brand. In fact, our core menu accounts for the large majority of our business and our growth. That's why we continue to be innovative with our classics.\nThis quarter, we featured a new blend of McCafe Ice Coffee in Australia with great results, and we continue to celebrate our core, while keeping things simple through innovative line extensions. In 2021 alone, we ran more than 100 core line extensions across the globe, and these drove significant sales growth.\nThis quarter, the U.K. introduced the Chicken Big Mac as a limited time offer, and it quickly became the market's most successful food promotion ever, selling millions of sandwiches in the first 2 weeks. Australia and Sweden saw meaningful lifts in total Big Mac sold as they feature the Bacon Big Mac as a limited time offer.\nThese core line extensions offer fresh news on our beloved Big Mac and drive top line growth, reminds customers of why they love our core items like Big Mac. And it reminds us of a simple truth, our menu should only consist of products that deserve to be there, nothing more, nothing less.\nOf course, we've also introduced new menu innovations to satisfy changing customer taste and preferences, which is exactly what's happening now with McPlant. After a successful pilot in the U.K., beginning in January, we made it available across all restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland. As I've said before, when customers are ready for McPlant, we'll be ready for them.\nWe're excited by the progress we've made this past quarter and are even more confident in our future. When we leverage our systems collective ingenuity, curiosity and collaboration and service of getting better together, there is no limit to what we can achieve together.\nNow I'll turn it back to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Ozan\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks. Our strong performance for the quarter resisted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.28, an increase of over 20% in constant currencies. This excludes about $125 million of costs for employees, landlords and suppliers in Russia and Ukraine, while our restaurants are closed. It also excludes $500 million of nonoperating expense to reserve for a potential settlement related to an international tax matter.\nAdjusted operating margin for the quarter was 43.1%, reflecting improved sales performance, partially offset by higher G&A costs. Total restaurant margin dollars grew by over $450 million in constant currencies or 17% for the quarter, primarily driven by improvement in franchise margins. Our franchise margin in the IOM segment showed significant recovery over the prior year, reflecting strong sales performance across markets.\nAs expected, our company operating margins were hampered by significant commodity and labor inflation. Given macroeconomic conditions, we expect these elevated inflationary pressures to continue throughout this year. G&A for the quarter was up about 20% in constant currencies, due to costs incurred for our worldwide convention earlier this month, higher long-term performance-based compensation and higher depreciation related to investments in restaurant technology. And our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter.\nBased on current exchange rates, we expect FX to reduce second quarter EPS by about $0.08 to $0.10 and full year EPS by $0.22 to $0.24. As always, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Chris to close.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nAt our convention, we featured franchisee after franchisee leaving a legacy in their communities. They're doing more than serving delicious food to busy people, they're employers of choice, favorite destinations for local customers and a local force for good. There are restaurants are places where people can bring their whole selves to work and put their whole hearts into treating their customers well.\nWe know where that magic begins. We have the most valuable brand in the industry because we have the best people in the world. The belief that people come first is so fundamental to who we are as a brand that it's our very first core value. How we treat our people directly shapes how they treat our customers.\nIt's no secret that an industry after industry, including ours, COVID-19 has transformed how people think about life and how they weigh these seemingly endless choices in front of them, including career choices. So at convention, we reaffirmed our commitment to create a McDonald's that is as well-known for its employee experience as it is for our Golden Arches.\nWe've made a lot of progress in the past few years from raising wages at company-owned restaurants in the U.S. to our progress on closing global pay gaps, including gender equity, to the deep bench of talent we have that is allowing us to make strides and increased representation and leadership among women and historically underrepresented groups.\nAnd as we announced last year, we started 2022 by implementing our global brand standards, which were designed to create a culture of physical and psychological safety for both employees and customers in McDonald's restaurants around the world.\nLast week in the U.S., we announced a new initiative called, Thank You Crew, building off the concept we had created to support first responders and teachers throughout the pandemic. Now we're turning the tables to support our restaurant teams who keep the Arches shining.\nWe're inviting customers to participate as well, asking them to submit instances for crew and managers who go above and beyond their typical duties. The work of attracting, developing and retaining the best people has always been central to McDonald's success, but has never been harder or more mission-critical than it is today.\nFred Turner used to say that where other see challenges, McDonald's sees opportunities. As we work to raise our ambition and accelerate the Arches, we will continue to shape this opportunity in ways that help people and McDonald's achieve their full potential.\nAnd with that, we'll begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. A little more than a year ago, I said that we were witnessing the beginning of the next great chapter at McDonald's, and it's clear that there has never been a better time to be part of brand McDonald's than right now.\nThe past 12 months continue to demonstrate what makes McDonald's different, the strength of our people, the might of our scale and supply chain, the agility of our system, the importance of local ownership operating in the communities we serve and the power of the McDonald's brand. Despite the many disruptions caused by COVID, it's clear from our performance that when the going gets tough, McDonald's gets going and our system's inherent strengths become even more apparent.\n2021 was a record-setting year for McDonald's on many dimensions, and we use this momentum to lean into our competitive strengths and build further advantage. Guided by our strategic plan Accelerating the Arches, we made significant investments behind our brand purpose to feed and foster communities while envisioning new ways for us to serve our customers, leveraging our growing digital capabilities. As a system, we are laser-focused on our MCD growth pillars.\nIn the first full year of the Accelerating the Arches strategy, we made great strides as we maximized our marketing, committed to our core menu, and double down on the 3Ds of digital, drive-thru and delivery to create seamless, memorable experiences for our customers. Our focus on the MCDs has driven broad-based growth in 2021. While we expect that 2022 will be a year of continued progress, we also anticipate that many of the challenges we experienced in 2021 will endure.\nA surge in COVID-19 cases and a return of restrictions in many of our markets are creating uncertainty around the world, exacerbating labor shortages and supply chain delays. Additionally, rising consumer inflation levels are putting pressure on restaurant economics. Focusing on our foundational operations, expanding our growing digital advantages and continuing to put the health and safety of our customers and crew first will remain critical to executing on Accelerating the Arches this year.\nAnd with strong average unit volumes and restaurant cash flows, the company and our franchisees are well positioned to withstand the pressures ahead. In fact, franchisee cash flows hit all-time highs in most of our top markets, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and Japan. I've said it repeatedly over the past 2 years, and I'll say it again. I have never been more proud of the commitment and leadership of our restaurant managers and crews, through even the most difficult moments, they have continued to be strong, keeping our restaurants running while providing hope and inspiration and extraordinary service to our customers and our communities every hour of every day.\nBecause of our unparalleled scale and dedication of our entire system, our employees, franchisees and suppliers, 2021 was a banner year for McDonald's despite the continued disruptions caused by COVID. In addition to the franchisee cash flow performance I mentioned, we hit all-time highs for global system-wide sales of $112 billion; comparable sales growth in the U.S. of 13.8%, which represents over $5 billion of system-wide sales growth; and operating income of more than $10 billion.\nTo expand on how Accelerating the Arches drove success, let me pass it over to Kevin.\n\nKevin M. Ozan\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Chris. As we've talked about before, the customer-focused actions we've taken over the past couple of years continue to drive strong top line momentum. Our global comp sales were up over 12% in the fourth quarter or nearly 11% on a 2-year basis. As a result of these actions, we've gained QSR traffic share across most of our major markets since 2019. This is particularly evident within the International Operated Markets, where off-premise channels remain a significant competitive advantage in this fluid COVID environment.\nOur IOM comp sales for the fourth quarter were nearly 17% or just over 8% on a 2-year basis, with strong 2-year double-digit growth in the U.K. and Canada and high single-digit growth in Australia. Later in the quarter, we had stops and starts in markets like Germany and France, where elevated COVID trends and heightened government restrictions interrupted recovery.\nOur U.K. performance was driven by continued growth in our delivery business and strong marketing featuring core menu items such as the Double Big Mac. Canada also saw increased delivery momentum, with October being the strongest month of delivery sales to date. And a highly successful launch of MyMcDonald's Reward loyalty program drove significant digital engagement. Australian consumers began to emerge from state home restrictions throughout the quarter. Our 30 days, 30 deals value platform was a strong contributor to comp growth for the quarter and drove app usage as we prepare for our loyalty launch in the first half of this year. As I mentioned, there are still challenging operating conditions in Germany and France, but we remain confident about our market share opportunities.\nGermany continued to benefit from a strong third quarter rollout of loyalty as well as a digital advent calendar in December, accelerating both app adoption, and digital sales in the market. And in France, we highlighted our core menu with the launch of our new premium chicken line, featuring wraps and the Chicken Mac Bag Out.\nIn the U.S., we finished the year strong with comp sales up 7.5% for the quarter and over 13% on a 2-year basis. We saw positive comps across all dayparts, which are still benefiting from average check growth, driven primarily by strategic menu price increases. Our MCD pillars continue to drive U.S. comps as strong marketing efforts behind McRib and the Crispy Chicken Sandwich were complemented with digital adoption by our customers. Digital growth remains a key driver of success in the U.S. Our loyalty program continues to build with digital sales growing month over month. Chris will share additional headlines on our digital strategy and success in a few minutes.\nAll of this top line growth has also fueled franchisee cash flows to record highs in the U.S. with average growth in 2021 of around $125,000 per restaurant, putting our franchisees in a strong position to weather the inflationary pressures Chris talked about earlier.\nTurning to the International Developmental License segment. Momentum accelerated in Q4 with comp sales up over 14% or 10% on a 2-year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. Japan achieved its 25th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with strength across our delivery and digital channels, while our dinner daypart benefited from compelling value programs and the introduction of new menu items. Recovery in China, however, continues to be impacted by COVID-related government restrictions, which significantly disrupted the restaurant industry in the fourth quarter. While comps were negative for the quarter, we expanded our digital presence with a successful year-end festival for app members, and we opened over 650 restaurants for the year.\nTurning to the P&L. Company-operated margins, particularly in the U.S., were pressured for the quarter as a result of higher labor and commodity costs. G&A for the quarter increased 9% in constant currencies. As I've mentioned before, the increase was primarily driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense as a result of company performance significantly exceeding our plan for the year.\nForeign currency translation negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.03 per share. And after a tax rate of over 22%, which included some onetime items, adjusted earnings per share was $2.23 for the quarter.\nFor the full year, adjusted operating margin was 43.4%, reflecting higher restaurant margins across all segments and higher other operating income. Despite some of the P&L pressures I mentioned, top line results generated restaurant margins of over $12 billion for the year, an increase of over $2.5 billion.\nBefore I hand it back to Chris, I want to touch on CapEx and our free cash flow profile. Our overall capital spend for 2021 was a little over $2 billion, slightly lower than our original expectations, primarily due to the timing of projects. With the improvements we've made to our business model over the last several years and the consistent strength of our global business, our free cash flow grew to $7.1 billion in 2021, an increase of nearly 25% over 2019. And free cash flow conversion was 94% for the year.\nWith that, I'll pass it back to Chris.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin. At McDonald's, we've long prided ourselves on the relationships we build with our customers. For decades, they relied on us to provide hot, delicious food with service that's fast, friendly and reliable. That promise is what keeps them coming back, and it's why we see every guest interaction as an opportunity to drive customer loyalty, whether through digital channels like our app, in person at our restaurants and drive-thrus or off-premise through delivery.\nWhile each pillar of our Accelerating the Arches strategy is formidable on its own, the real power is when the M, C and D come together in combination with the customer at the center. That's what's enabling us to continue to make customer recognized progress as we did once again this quarter.\nFor starters, McDonald's continues to set a new standard for marketing in our industry. We're focused on taste, affordability, family and brand trust. And we've raised the bar on creative excellence with one of the most talented marketing teams in the world. Behind our marketing success is McDonald's iconic core menu. This quarter, we saw a strong performance that resulted in market share gains for both beef and chicken.\nOur core classics aren't just the heart of our business. They're also a central part of our growth strategy. Iconic favorites like the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets and our world-famous french fries drive almost 60% of our total business and about 75% of our food business, and we continue to make them better. We've implemented enhanced cooking procedures and new buns in over 20 markets, including Australia, Canada and Russia, that result in hotter, fresher-tasting burgers. Customers have told us that they've noticed improved taste and quality, and we're excited to deploy these standards in most markets across the globe over the next couple of years.\nTo complement our leadership in beef, we're also focusing on growing our market share in chicken by leaning into the strength of core equities like Chicken McNuggets as well as creating the core classics of tomorrow. We've begun to make progress with new chicken sandwiches in the U.S. in many of our international markets. We've gained IEO market share in chicken in every single 1 of our top 11 markets since 2019.\nAnd after a successful pilot of McPlant in 250 restaurants in the U.K., we're excited that McPlant is now available across all of our restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland. Of course, being customer-driven is about more than just menu items. Our investments in technology and digital are paying off as our digital engine continues to make the customer experience more seamless and fuels growth in the process. Our top 6 markets saw more than 1/4 of their system-wide sales or $18 billion come from digital channels in 2021, a 60% increase over 2020. We now have loyalty programs in more than 40 markets, including the U.S., Germany and Canada, each of which launched in 2021. And in the first half of 2022, we're excited to bring MyMcDonald's Reward to consumers in the U.K. and Australia. We're well on our way to building the world's largest loyalty program.\nLoyalty is the single biggest driver of digital adoption, and MyMcDonald's Reward has exceeded expectations in terms of enrollment and participation. After just 6 months in the U.S., there are over 30 million loyalty members enrolled and 21 million active members earning rewards. I mentioned earlier the importance of customer relationships. With loyalty, we're building on a strong legacy of meaningful customer relationships and driving greater customer engagement and reengagement. And in the first few months of our loyalty launch, we're seeing an increase in digital customer frequency of over 10%.\nMoreover, strategic partnerships have been fundamental to our digital growth strategy. Dynamic Yield has been instrumental in bringing our drive-thrus and self-order kiosks into a new era for customer engagement. Last month, we announced that Mastercard will acquire Dynamic Yield. As part of our broader strategy to better scale our assets, our collaboration with Mastercard will help us expedite and integrate capabilities across ordering channels and across the globe to continue providing an even more personalized customer experience.\nDelivery is a bet we made long before COVID and continues to be a staple for consumers. Our delivery footprint has expanded to more than 33,000 restaurants in 100 countries. And in the fourth quarter, our momentum continued with double-digit comps over strong growth in 2020. We've entered into new long-term strategic partnerships with 2 of our largest global delivery providers, Uber Eats and DoorDash. These multiyear deals are mutually beneficial and unlock tremendous value for our customers and franchisees, helping to ensure the long-term profitable growth of delivery. And as we integrate Mc Delivery into our app, will enable an even more seamless and personal customer experience.\nEven as our digital and delivery engagement rises, the drive-thrus remain an essential channel, especially as customers seek safe, contactless access to McDonald's. We continue to see a higher percentage of sales in the drive-thru compared to pre-pandemic levels. While average drive-thru service times have improved since 2019 across our top markets, service times slowed in 2021 in the U.S. and many markets compared to 2020. With industry-wide labor availability challenges, our market teams are focused on the foundational elements to maximize throughput from staffing and positioning to new technology. Collectively, the investments we've made in our MCDs paid off in 2021, and we're confident they will drive even greater growth across the system in 2022 and beyond.\nI'll turn it back over to Kevin to talk about our 2022 outlook. Kevin?\n\nKevin M. Ozan\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, McDonald's Corporation\n\nThanks. Looking ahead this year, as Chris said, we're confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth against an uncertain macro backdrop. We expect that our 2021 net new restaurant openings of about 2%, along with planned expansion in 2022, will contribute about 1.5% to our system-wide sales growth in constant currencies this year. We're focused on increasing our overall operating margin over the long term, as it serves as the most comprehensive gauge of operating performance.\nIn 2022, we anticipate our operating margin percent will continue to be in the low to mid-40s range as strong top line momentum and minimal other operating income will be hampered by significant commodity and labor inflation in the near term. We've seen our digital and technology investments over the past few years drive top line growth. As we continue to strategically invest in digital and technology, we're also carefully managing our G&A. In 2022, we expect G&A to be about 2.2% to 2.3% of systemwide sales. Beyond 2022, we expect to gain leverage on both G&A and operating margin through continued sales growth.\nBased on current interest in foreign currency exchange rates, we're projecting interest expense this year to be relatively flat compared to 2021. And under current tax legislation, we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be between 20% and 22%.\nFinally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS between $0.05 and $0.07 in the first quarter and between $0.18 and $0.20 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.\nTransitioning to capital expenditures. We anticipate spending between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion this year. About 40% of this will be allocated to our U.S. business, where we expect to have net restaurant unit growth for the first time in a few years. Most of the U.S. spend will go towards reinvestment, including the completion of our restaurant modernization efforts. About half of our total capital spend will be dedicated to new unit openings. Globally, we plan to open over 1,800 restaurants, with more than 500 of these openings in the U.S. and IOM segments. The remaining 1,300 new restaurants, including roughly 800 in China, will be across the IDL markets, where our strategic partners provide the capital for restaurant openings. We anticipate net new restaurant growth of about 3.5% for the year.\nWe also expect our strong cash flow growth to continue in 2022. And after the CapEx spend I just talked about, we'll continue to convert more than 90% of our net income to free cash flow as we have the last few years. Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to invest in new units and opportunities to grow the business, along with reinvesting in existing restaurants; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to repurchase shares. It's during times like this that the strength of the McDonald's system and scale are more beneficial than ever. And I remain confident that our strategy will continue to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for our system and shareholders.\nNow I'll turn it back to Chris to close.\n\nChristopher J. Kempczinski\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, McDonald's Corporation\n\nRay Kroc built McDonald's as both the most independent and interdependent brand on the planet. From the beginning, Ray wanted the McDonald's franchise model to be a two-way street. In doing so, he unleashed the creative power of franchisees who had ownership in their businesses. Together, we have built a brand that is second to none. We see the power of that brand every single day. We see the power of the brand reflected as part of the cultural fabric and communities around the world. We see the power of the brand in the value of restaurant ownership and the strong cash flows that our franchisees are experiencing. Most of all, we see the power of the brand in the ways our thoughtful decisions and investments have resulted in our collective strength today. It enabled us to build an unrivaled customer experience where modern restaurants and innovative digital technology serve more than 65 million customers every single day.\nNow as we prepare to come together with our franchisees in April for the first time in 4 years at our worldwide convention in Orlando, we will celebrate the McDonald's brand and talk about how this generation of system leaders will put their own shine on the Arches. The answer will certainly be rooted in how we create a more seamless customer experience that connects the physical restaurant to our digital channels. But it will also be based on one of our founding principles in the model: building a business that is representative of our customers and communities, where equity opportunity is central to our business.\nWe cannot let economic or other barriers stand in the way of bringing the best talent into the system as part of our brand's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and we're demonstrating this commitment in various ways throughout our system, including a mutual DEI pledge for suppliers, incorporating human capital metrics into annual compensation for senior leaders and a commitment to equal pay for employees.\nLast month, we were proud to announce a franchisee recruitment initiative focused in 3 areas: recruitment, financing and ongoing learning and development. Our goal is to create opportunities and increase the number of new franchisees from all backgrounds, including women and historically underrepresented groups, in McDonald's operated markets around the world. I'm excited and optimistic about the months and years to come. Together as a system, we will continue to bring Ray Kroc's vision for collaboration of life while providing customers the food they crave, the experience they treasure and the brand they love. It's this commitment that will accelerate the Arches while helping us feed and foster communities everywhere.\nThank you. And with that, we'll take questions.",

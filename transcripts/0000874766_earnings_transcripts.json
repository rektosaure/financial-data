We will now take your questions. Operator, please repeat the instructions for asking a question.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nI will now turn the call back to Kate.\nIn summary, we are pleased with our outstanding performance for the third quarter and first 9 months of the year. We believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns and enhance value for all stakeholders.\nTurning to capital management. As Chris mentioned, we increased our common quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.60 per share, payable on January 5, 2026. Over the past decade, we have delivered dividend increases averaging approximately 11% per year. The step-up in our dividend demonstrates our confidence in the sustained earnings power and capital generation of the organization. Holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion at quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the fourth quarter. As of September 30th, we had $1.95 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026.\nTurning to investments. Our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. Net investment income of $759 million increased $100 million from third quarter 2024 due to income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, a higher level of invested assets and reinvesting at higher interest rates, partially offset by a lower yield on variable rate securities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.6% before tax, consistent with the second quarter. We continue to strategically manage the portfolio, balancing risk while pursuing accretive trading opportunities. In the quarter, we reinvested at 50 basis points above the sales and maturity yield reflecting increased call and paydown activity on higher-yielding corporate bonds and certain structured securities. We remain focused on our ability to reinvest above the current portfolio yield. As expected, our third quarter annualized LP returns of 6.7% before tax were higher than the first half of the year, reflecting increased returns from our private equity portfolio. While still early, we anticipate fourth quarter results to be in a similar range to third quarter.\nMoving to Employee Benefits. Core earnings of $149 million and a core earnings margin of 8.3% reflect excellent group life and strong disability performance. The group life loss ratio of 74.2, improved 3.3 points, reflecting lower mortality across both term and accidental life products. The group disability loss ratio of 70.6% increased 2.7 points from the prior year. Last year included a benefit of 2.2 points related to the long-term disability recovery rate assumption update, while current year long-term disability trends were slightly higher as expected. This was partially offset by pricing increases earning into our paid family and medical leave products. The employee benefits expense ratio of 26.7% increased 1.4 points, primarily driven by higher staffing costs, including increased incentive compensation and benefits, increased investments in technology and a higher commission ratio due to premium mix.\nWith respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year losses were $70 million before tax for 1.6 combined ratio points, which included $37 million of favorable prior quarter development. Through September 30th, we have reached the $750 million attachment point for our aggregate property catastrophe treaty, which means that CAT losses of up to $200 million in the fourth quarter would be covered by the treaty. As a reminder, the aggregate cover does not include losses from the global reinsurance business, which purchases its own retrocessional coverage. Total P&C net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $95 million before tax, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation and personal auto liability and physical damage. We recorded $8 million of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which has now been fully amortized. As a reminder, the A&E ADC cover was exhausted in 2024, so any development from the fourth quarter A&E study will impact core earnings.\nIn Personal Insurance, core earnings were $143 million with an underlying combined ratio of 90%. Homeowners delivered an underlying combined ratio of 74.4%, a 1-point improvement over the prior year. Auto underlying results improved by 3.6 points in the quarter and remain in line with expectations, reflecting typical seasonality as the year progresses. The Personal Insurance third quarter expense ratio of 25.8% was relatively flat from the 2024 period. Written premium in Personal Insurance increased 2% in the third quarter. We achieved written pricing increases of 11.3% in auto and 12.6% in homeowners.\nGlobal Specialties third quarter was solid with written premium growth of 5% and an underlying combined ratio of 85.8%. The business insurance expense ratio of 31.1% was relatively flat from the 2024 period, however, increased sequentially as the impact of earned premium leverage was offset by higher incentive compensation and benefit costs.\nCore earnings for the quarter were $1.77 billion or $3.78 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 18.4%. In Business Insurance, core earnings were $723 million with written premium growth of 9% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.4%. Small business continues to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 11% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.8%. Middle and Large business had another strong quarter with written premium growth of 10% and an underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.\nThank you, Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\nIn closing, as we enter the final quarter of 2025, our financial strength disciplined execution and strategic investments position the company to sustain strong results by leveraging industry-leading tools, underwriting expertise and advanced data science, we are confident in our ability to continue to navigate a dynamic market cycle and deliver superior returns for our shareholders.\nIn terms of capital management, yesterday, we announced a 15% increase in the common quarterly dividend, continuing a track record of annual dividend increases supported by earnings power and strong capital generation. In addition, we are pleased that both S&P and Moody's upgraded the debt and financial strength ratings of the Hartford. Commentary from the agencies highlighted our effective risk selection and sophisticated pricing strategies, which have positively impacted underwriting performance across business cycles, with expectations for continued strength, supported by well-diversified revenues and earnings.\nMoving on to employee benefits. The core earnings margin of 8.3% was driven by excellent life and strong disability results. Persistency remained strong in the low 90s, while fully insured premium and sales were flat year-over-year, reflecting a competitive market and lower large case sales in 2025. Quote activity and known sales for 2026 are trending very favorably as recent investments in technology and customer-facing tools gain traction in the marketplace.\nEarlier this month, the Hartford senior leadership team attended the CIAB Insurance Leadership Forum, a premier property and casualty industry event. We met with more than 50 key distributors and reinforced our commitment to consistent execution and strategic alignment. Brokers and agents recognize our industry-leading digital capabilities, as clear differentiators. We left the forum with increased confidence in the strength of our independent distribution relationships, positioning us to capture additional market share over time.\nTurning to Personal Insurance. Results continued to improve over prior year. Homeowners had a strong quarter, highlighted by 10% written premium growth in mid-70s underlying combined ratio. Renewal written pricing remained flat to the second quarter at 12.6%, driven by net rate and insured value increases. Auto underlying results improved by 3.6 points in the quarter with a year-to-date underlying combined ratio in the mid-90s. While personal insurance underlying margins are at targeted levels, total PIF growth continues to be impacted by a highly competitive market. We are pleased with growth in Agency, where policies in force grew 17% over prior year, including 4% in auto. In the third quarter, we introduced prevail to retail distribution, bringing new product, technology and experiences to our agency partners. We are now live in 6 states, and we'll continue to roll out Prevail Agency over time with 30 state launches planned by early 2027. Initial results are positive, with agents excited about our improved performance in competitive positioning with preferred market customers. Prevail represents a meaningful investment in our businesses, now benefiting both direct and retail channels.\nMoving to pricing. Business Insurance renewal written pricing excluding workers' compensation was 7.3%, above overall loss trend. Pricing execution remains highly disciplined. General liability remained firm and above loss trend, supported by rate increases and proactive underwriting actions focused on segmentation, limits management and geographic optimization. Excess and umbrella lines delivered double-digit pricing increases and primary lines moderated slightly, while still in the high single digits. Despite modest easing this quarter, auto pricing remained near 11%, while workers' compensation pricing was slightly up from the second quarter. Across business insurance, property written premium grew 11% to $800 million with expectations for full year premium to reach $3.3 billion over the past 3 years through the team's thoughtful and disciplined strategy, including CAT management, the business insurance property book grew 50%. In small business, property pricing within the package product remained strong, achieving 12% renewal written price increases. In general industries, property pricing was relatively consistent with the second quarter and above loss trend. Other property lines, primarily EMS and large representing approximately 20% of the property book, achieved renewal pricing increases of 1.2%, up nearly 2 points from the second quarter.\nThrough our One Hartford approach, agents and customers can seamlessly quote and bind comprehensive coverages in a single unified experience. For example, this approach is resonating with small and midsized business customers who require professional and management liability coverage, not addressed by the standard package product. We remain focused on helping all business customers succeed by using digital capabilities, leveraging our broad distribution network and offering a comprehensive product suite that meets more of their needs.\nShifting to Global Specialty. Results were excellent with another quarter of underlying margins in the mid-80s. This performance reflects targeted growth strategies alongside strong risk and pricing fundamentals. Net written premium grew by 5% driven by U.S. financial lines, bond and across international, partially offset by a 3% dip in wholesale, primarily due to a decline in new construction projects. Within Global Specialty, we are taking advantage of innovative solutions that combine our specialized underwriting expertise with advanced technology and broad distribution of our small business franchise.\nTurning to middle and large business. Growth was outstanding with solid underlying margins. Written premium increased 10%, underscoring the strength of our diversified portfolio. This performance was fueled by robust new business generation, strong retention levels and solid pricing execution across the lines. Our underwriting approach continues to guide us towards opportunities that deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns while ensuring we remain selective and disciplined.\nLet's take a closer look at third quarter performance. In Business Insurance, third quarter results reflect excellent growth with strong underlying margins, sustaining momentum from the first half of the year. Our small business franchise continues to set the standard for growth and profitability in the industry, delivering record-breaking new business premium with strong underlying combined ratios. Written premium growth of 11% was fueled by double-digit increases in our industry-leading package product and auto. E&S binding also delivered exceptional results with written premium up 47%, reaching over $100 million in the quarter. These results reflect the power of our underwriting expertise, AI-driven capabilities and strong digital platforms built on years of strategic investments. Written premium is expected to exceed $6 billion in 2025, representing 10% growth over prior year.\nHighlights in the quarter include written premium growth in Business Insurance of 9% with an underlying combined ratio of 89.4%. In Personal Insurance, an underlying combined ratio of 90%, a 3.7 point improvement over prior year and employee benefits, an outstanding core earnings margin of 8.3% and continued solid performance in the investment portfolio. All these items contributed to an outstanding trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 18.4%.\nThe Hartford delivered outstanding third quarter results with core earnings of $1.1 billion or $3.78 per diluted share, both records for the company. These results reflect the strength of our franchise and disciplined execution of our strategy. We continue to grow top line while maintaining strong margins in a dynamic environment, supported by investments that advance our underwriting discipline, while deepening relationships with customers and distribution partners.\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today.\n\nKate Jorens\n\nSVP, Treasurer & Head of Investor Relations\n\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nNow I’d like to introduce our speakers: Christopher Swift, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer.

My name is Lacy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2025, The Hartford Insurance Group Financial Results Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Kate Jorens, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. You may go ahead.\n\nKate Jorens\n\nSVP, Treasurer & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2025 earnings call and webcast. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all earnings-related materials on our website.\nBefore we begin, please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees of future performance and may differ materially from actual results.

The Hartford second quarter results were outstanding, with core earnings reaching nearly $1 billion. This performance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy and consistency of execution that drives our momentum. We are expanding our market presence and growing with purpose. Our strategic investments are advancing innovation across the organization to benefit customers and distribution partners. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance as we have successfully capitalized on market opportunities while maintaining strong margins.\nWith that, let's take a closer look at second quarter performance. Highlights include top line growth in Business Insurance of 8%, with an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 88%. In Personal Insurance, an underlying combined ratio of 88%, with 8.7 points of improvement over prior year, an exceptional core earnings margin of 9.2% in Employee Benefits and continued solid performance in our Investment Portfolio. All these items contributed to an outstanding trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17%.\nTurning to Business Insurance. Results were excellent, driven by industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise and data science advancements. Small business delivered an excellent underlying combined ratio with record breaking quarterly net new business premium. Strong written premium growth was fueled in part by double-digit increases in auto and in our industry-leading packaged product as well as a 35% increase in E&S binding premium. We are on a clear trajectory to exceed $6 billion in annual written premium in 2025.\nGrowth in small is fueled by technology and data science advancements, which provides significant and unrivaled competitive advantages. For example, our best-in-class quoting platform is powered by intelligent automation, real-time decisioning and proprietary pricing models, differentiated by our rich historical data.\nOver the years, we have streamlined the submission process with intuitive workflows and advanced prefill of customer data. Our AI-driven underwriting logic suggests coverages based on business type and reflects the judgment of our most experienced underwriters. All of this delivers a seamless and efficient experience, allowing 75% of all quotes across all admitted lines of business to be bound within minutes. This provides a durable competitive advantage for us with our distribution partners. As we continue to invest in AI, we expect [ bindability ] to increase further, driving enhanced efficiency, greater scalability and sustained profitable growth.\nTurning to middle and large business. Underlying results were excellent with solid growth. We are focused on maintaining margins and making appropriate risk decisions using enhanced underwriting tools. Middle and large continues to advance the vision of an automated AI-driven underwriting process to enhance productivity and accelerate speed to market. Our strategic investments leverage strength in small business and extend those advantages to middle market. Over time, we believe this positions us well to capture additional market share in this space.\nShifting to Global Specialty. Results were outstanding with sustained underlying margins in the mid-80s and record quarterly gross written premium of $1.3 billion. Our strong competitive position, broad product portfolio and disciplined renewal pricing drove this performance. Gross written premium in the wholesale business grew 8%, supported by growth in casualty, auto and inland marine. Global reinsurance gross written premium grew 15%, driven by strong growth in both U.S. property and specialty casualty lines. With a diverse product portfolio and a constructive pricing environment, we remain confident in the growth potential of Global Specialty.\nAs for pricing, business insurance renewal pricing, excluding workers' compensation, is strong at 8.1% and is still comfortably above the overall loss trend. Pricing execution remains highly disciplined with low double-digit increases in auto and general liability, including mid-teens increases in umbrella and excess lines. In workers' compensation, although pricing is modestly down from the first quarter, it remains within expectations.\nAcross Business Insurance, focused expansion in property has driven 12% growth with written premium of $1 billion in the quarter. In small business, property pricing within our package product remained strong as we achieved 15% renewal written price increases. In general industries property, pricing is solid and above loss trends. Large property and wholesale pricing declined from the first quarter by 4 and 8 points, respectively. However, both of these lines have adequate margins and account for less than 10% of total business insurance property. As we continue to grow the property book, we are maintaining a consistent catastrophe risk appetite and in another active CAT quarter, our CAT losses remain below our market share.\nTurning to Personal Insurance. Results improved significantly over prior year. Homeowners had an outstanding quarter, highlighted by 17% written premium growth in low 70s underlying combined ratio. Renewal written pricing of 12.7%, driven by net rate and insured value increases continue to support healthy margins and reinforces a strong position in the market. Auto underlying results improved by 9.7 points to a mid-90s underlying combined ratio.\nWe are now well positioned to profitably grow in both auto and home. This month, we introduced our [ prevail ] offering, inclusive of auto, home and umbrella to the agency channel, unlocking additional opportunities with preferred market customers. We expect to be in 6 states by the end of the year and an additional 15 to 20 states next year. Agents are energized by the enhanced efficiency of prevail, and have expressed strong commitment to promoting these improved offerings as new states come online. More broadly, agents and brokers at our annual summit in May conveyed a clear eagerness to deepen their partnership with us across the enterprise. They continue to recognize our ability to deliver fast, accurate solutions as a key differentiator in the market. With our ongoing investments in AI, digital tools, in overall ease of doing business, we are well positioned to grow alongside our distribution partners and strengthen our collaborative success.\nMoving on to Employee Benefits. Core earnings margin of 9.2% was exceptional, driven by excellent life and disability results. Persistency remained strong in the low 90s, while fully insured premium growth was flat, reflecting a competitive market.\nLooking ahead, we are particularly excited about our recent partnership with Nayya, which brings AI-powered personalization through benefits enrollment. This collaboration enhances digital capabilities and simplifies the benefits experience for employees through seamless integration with leading HR platforms. Improving benefit utilization enhances employee satisfaction and in turn, helps employers retain their workers. This is another example of how we are advancing our innovation strategy and delivering meaningful value to both employers and their employees.\nIn summary, second quarter results reflect the strength of our businesses and the impact of ongoing strategic investments. It is an exciting time at The Hartford as we advance our innovation agenda. We are prioritizing practical, high-impact AI applications that augment human talent and drive productivity to better serve customers and distribution partners. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to capture additional market share, deliver profitable growth and capitalize on the opportunities ahead.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $981 million or $3.41 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17%. In Business Insurance, core earnings were $697 million with written premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 88%. Small business continues to deliver industry-leading results with written premium growth of 9% and an underlying combined ratio of 89%. Middle and large business had another quarter of strong profitability with an underlying combined ratio of 89.1% and written premium growth of 5%.\nGlobal Specialties second quarter was outstanding with an underlying combined ratio of 84.8% and written premium growth of 9%. The Business Insurance expense ratio of 30.6 improved 0.5 points from second quarter 2024, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium.\nIn Personal Insurance, core earnings for the quarter were $94 million with an underlying combined ratio of 88%. The auto underlying combined ratio of 95.2% improved 9.7 points from the 2024 period, and homeowners produced an excellent underlying combined ratio of 72.7%, which improved 5.1 points. Written premium in Personal Insurance increased 7% in the second quarter, in part driven by steady and successful rate actions. We achieved written pricing increases of 14% in auto and 12.7% in homeowners. Additionally, new business growth continues to be robust in homeowners at 47% over the prior year.\nHomeowners policy count continued to grow, while auto decreased as expected. We continue to expect that auto policy count will pivot to growth in 2026. The Personal Insurance second quarter expense ratio of 25.1 improved from the prior year by 1.3 points, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by a higher commission ratio due to business mix.\nWith respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year losses were $212 million before tax or 4.9 combined ratio points, primarily related to tornado, wind and hail events largely concentrated in the South and Midwest regions. As a reminder, we have a $200 million aggregate catastrophe cover, which attaches when the subject losses and expenses exceed $750 million. Through June 30, losses subject to the treaty were approximately $690 million, leaving $60 million before we reach the attachment point. The aggregate cover does not include losses from the global reinsurance business, which purchases its own retrocessional coverage.\nTotal P&C net favorable prior [ accident ] year development within core earnings was $163 million before tax, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, bond, commercial property and across personal insurance. We recorded $24 million before tax of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. We expect the remaining balance of $8 million to be amortized in the third quarter.\nMoving to Employee Benefits. We achieved core earnings of $163 million for the quarter. The core earnings margin of 9.2% reflects excellent group life and disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 68.5% increased 1.4 points from the prior year, driven by short-term disability and a slight increase in long-term disability incidents partially offset by strong claim recoveries. However, long-term disability incidence rates continue to remain favorable to historical averages and to our expectations.\nThe group life loss ratio of 74.3% for the quarter improved 0.6 points, reflecting lower mortality, primarily driven by the accidental death product. The employee benefits expense ratio of 25.7 increased 1.3 points compared with 24.4 in second quarter 2024, primarily due to higher technology costs and higher staffing costs. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $107 million increased from $101 million in second quarter 2024, reflecting higher group disability sales.\nTurning to investments. Net investment income of $664 million increased from second quarter 2024, primarily driven by a higher level of invested assets and reinvesting at higher interest rates, partially offset by a lower yield on variable rate securities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.6% before tax, 20 basis points above first quarter 2025. We continue to strategically manage the portfolio, balancing risk while pursuing accretive trading opportunities, and in the quarter, we invested at 130 basis points above the sales and maturity yield.\nOur second quarter annualized LP returns of 1% before tax were down from first quarter. Returns have been muted due to market uncertainty stemming from a combination of interest rates and tariff policy, which has limited valuation and sale activity in our private equity and real estate portfolios. However, with stronger public equity performance in the second quarter, we expect limited partnership returns to improve in the second half of the year, with full year 2025 returns modestly exceeding 2024.\nTurning to capital management. Holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion at quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the third quarter. As of June 30, we had $2.35 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our outstanding performance for the second quarter and believe we are well positioned to continue to enhance value for our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call back to Kate.\n\nKate Jorens\n\nSVP, Treasurer & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Beth. We will now take your questions. Operator, please repeat the instructions for asking a question."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2025 earnings call and webcast. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all earnings related materials on our website. Before we begin, please note that our presentation includes forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees of future performance and may differ materially from actual results.\nWe do not assume any obligation to update these statements investors should consider the risks and uncertainties detailed in our recent asking news release and financial supplement, which are available on the Investor Relations section of the hartford.com. Our commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures with explanations and GAAP reconciliations available in our recent SEC filings, news release and financial supplements.\nAnd now as a speaker, Chris Swift, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer. After their remarks, we will take your questions assisted by several members of our management team. And now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford is off to a strong start in 2025, sustaining the momentum we have built over the past few years. Before I get into the details, let me take a moment to comment upon the macroeconomic environment. We are operating in dynamic times. However, as an underwriting-centric organization specializing in managing risk, we are well equipped to navigate this evolving environment.\nOur teams are closely monitoring trends and are already taking action to address the impacts of this complex and dynamic policy landscape with solid fundamentals, a durable investment portfolio, and a balance sheet that is stronger than ever, we remain steadfast in our commitment to delivering strong returns for our shareholders. Now let's transition to first quarter results.\nAs I mentioned, the Hartford had a strong start to the year even in the face of the most destructive wildfires in U.S. history. Disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, an innovative customer-centric technology continue to drive our performance. Highlights from the first quarter include top line growth in Business Insurance of 10% with a very strong underlying combined ratio of 88.4%.\nAn underlying combined ratio of 89.7% in Personal Insurance representing a 6.4 point improvement over prior year, including over 8 points in auto, a core earnings margin of 7.6% in employee benefits which continue to outperform in a competitive environment and continued solid performance in our investment portfolio. All these items contributed to a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.2%.\nAs I dive into the details, let me start with P&C current accident year catastrophe losses which totaled $467 million before tax, including $325 million related to the January California wildfires. Catastrophe risk management strategies and reinsurance structure effectively contained exposure, keeping it well within our market share. While we are pleased with the performance of our overall book of business, and risk management program, the losses were significant to first quarter results.\nIn times like these, I am especially proud of the Hartford's claim handlers, adjusters and leaders. Excluding catastrophe losses, our businesses sustained strong performance in line with or exceeding expectations. Turning to Business Insurance. Results were excellent driven by our industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise and data science advancements.\nNew business growth remained strong within small and middle market where the environment continues to be conducive for growth as the leading small business carrier, our digital capabilities offer exceptional functionality and ease of use providing us with a significant competitive advantage in the market. We have successfully leveraged these strengths to enhance the middle market and global specialty businesses.\nWe are going to market as one unified organization to serve diverse needs of customers and partners with a consistent and top-tier experience. In small business, first quarter financial performance was excellent with record-breaking quarterly written premium and double-digit new business growth while extending a 19-quarter trend of sub-90 underlying combined ratios. New\nbusiness growth was driven in part by strong quote flow and modestly higher average premium as well as a 29% increase in E&S binding premium a business where we continue to see tremendous opportunity. In short, small business continues to deliver excellent results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities. We are on track to surpass $6 billion in annual written premium in 2025.\nMoving to middle and large, we are pleased with first quarter performance, including excellent top line growth, paired with a strong underlying margin in line with our expectations. New business growth remained strong with contributions from multiple lines and market sectors. We continue to take advantage of healthy submissions driven in part by investments made to expand product capabilities and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience.\nWritten premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution across most lines, including double-digit increases in liability and auto. Shifting to Global Specialty, results were outstanding with sustained underlying margins in the mid-80s and over $1 billion in quarterly written premium. This impressive top line performance reflects our strong competitive position, diverse product offerings and solid renewal written pricing including double-digit pricing in wholesale casualty.\nOur wholesale business saw an 11% increase in gross written premium with significant contributions from U.S. inland marine, auto and casualty lines and the global reinsurance business also grew at a double-digit clip. With a diverse product set in a generally healthy pricing environment, we remain excited about the growth prospects in Global Specialty.\nAcross business insurance combined emphasis on property expansion has resulted in written premium growth of approximately 15% this quarter. We are capitalizing on the favorable market conditions in the SME space with a disciplined approach and no change in our catastrophe risk appetite. As for pricing, business insurance renewal written pricing, excluding workers' compensation of 9.9% increased 20 basis points from the fourth quarter. Our pricing execution remained strong, including low double-digit increases in general liability and auto with liability pricing continuing to rise. The team hit the ground running on 1/1 renewals, exceeding liability pricing targets, which are comfortably above loss cost trends.\nIn Business insurance property, pricing remains healthy in the low double digits, driven by 18% pricing increases within our small business package product. In Personal Insurance, Margins continue to improve, achieving an underlying combined ratio in the 80s for the first time in 3 years.\nWe expect target profitability in auto by mid-2025, consistent with our expectations. Having navigated a challenging loss cost environment, Personal Insurance is now focused on balancing profitability and a pivot to growth in a competitive environment. Our homeowners business had a strong underlying quarter, highlighted by a mid-70s underlying combined ratio.\nRenewal written pricing of 12.3% driven by net rate and insured value increases continues to support healthy margins while reinforcing our strong position in the market. Moving on to employee benefits. Core earnings margin of 7.6% exceeded prior year by 1.5 points, surpassing our long-term target of 6% to 7%. Group life and disability, both delivered excellent results.\nThe disability loss ratio reflected nearly 20 points of improvement in paid family and medical leave products and the life loss ratio continued to improve. Modest fully insured ongoing premium growth reflects the competitive environment and strong book persistency which is above 90%.\nSales were largely in line with expectations for the quarter. I want to take a moment to highlight ongoing technology investments in employee benefits focused on superior customer experience and enabling growth. In absence and disability, we recently launched our patented [ Leave Lends ] platform empowering employees to confidently plan for their leave of absence through a comprehensive view of their benefits, available time and prospective pay while away from work.\nWe also recently delivered a new absence dashboard tool, which gives employers dynamic reporting capabilities regarding their employees leaves of absence. These market differentiating tools in conjunction with recent investments in life claim digital intake, provide a holistic suite of new digital capabilities for customers. Additionally, we continue to focus on enhancing data exchanges and integration connections with benefit administration and human resource platforms to drive future growth.\nWe now have over 160 integrations with HR technology partners servicing over 2/3 of our book, and we continue to build our leadership position in this space. For example, we have deepened our partnership with Workday to codesign their new Workday wellness platform, which will deliver faster integration, comprehensive implementation support and real-time data exchange.\nWith these capabilities and continued investment in the Benefits business, we expect to retain our #1 disability position and our top 5 life position while delivering an outstanding user experience for customers and their employees. Moving to investments. The portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions.\nBeth will provide more details on the performance in the quarter. Alongside strong financial results, the first quarter also marked the launch of our new brand as we further establish ourselves as an innovative and growth-orientated industry leader, our strategy is intentionally centered on customers and their evolving needs.\nThe new brand celebrates the Hartford strengths built on centuries of trust from businesses, workers in individuals we support every day. As CEO, I remain honored to lead a company with such a rich legacy and bright future, driven by exceptional employees and their unwavering commitment to our customers. Looking ahead, we are expanding digital capabilities, leveraging AI, enhancing our product offering and entering new markets to better serve customers.\nAll these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford as we continue delivering industry-leading financial performance. It is an exciting time at The Hartford for our employees, customers, distribution partners and all stakeholders. Together, we will navigate this dynamic environment and seize the opportunities ahead.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $639 million or $2.20 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.2%. Although results were impacted by elevated catastrophe activity, including the January California wildfire event, underlying P&C results and employee benefits results were excellent.\nIn Business Insurance, core earnings were $471 million with written premium growth of 10% and an underlying combined ratio of 88.4. Small business continues to deliver industry-leading results with written premium growth of 9%, double-digit new business growth and an underlying combined ratio of 89.4. Middle and Large business had another quarter of solid profitability with an underlying combined ratio of 90.6% and written premium growth of 9% including record quarterly new business of $188 million.\nGlobal Specialties first quarter was outstanding with an underlying combined ratio of 84% and a record first quarter written premium of $1 billion. Written premium growth of 11% in the quarter reflects strong growth across much of the book and solid renewal execution, including written pricing increases of 6.2%.\nIn Personal Insurance, core earnings for the quarter were $6 million, with an underlying combined ratio of 89.7% driven by an improvement of 8.1 points in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio over the prior year. The first quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 96.1 improved 8.3 points from the 2024 period and homeowners produced a strong underlying combined ratio of 75.1. Written premium in Personal Insurance increased 8% in the first quarter, in part driven by steady and successful rate actions.\nIn auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 15.8% and earned pricing increases of 20%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 12.3% and 14.4% on an earned basis. Additionally, new business growth continues to be robust in both homeowners and auto.\nHomeowners' policy count continued to grow, while auto decreased as expected. Effective policy count retention for both homeowners and auto remained flat due to strong but moderating renewal written pricing increases. The Personal Insurance first quarter expense ratio of 27 increased from the prior year by 1.7 points, primarily driven by higher direct marketing costs and to a lesser extent, a higher commission ratio, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premiums.\nWith respect to catastrophes, P&C current [ accident ] year losses were $467 million before tax or 11.1% combined ratio points including $325 million net of reinsurance related to the January California wildfire event as well as tornado, wind and hail events primarily in the Midwest and South regions in the month of March.\nWe are pleased with our robust and comprehensive reinsurance program on both a per occurrence and aggregate basis. As a reminder, the aggregate treaty provides $200 million coverage when subject losses and expenses exceed $750 million. Total P&C net favorable prior [ accident ] year development within core earnings was $90 million before tax, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, homeowners and personal auto. There were no increases in prior year reserves for general liability and commercial auto.\nThe actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2024 positioned us well for 2025 both in terms of the overall adequacy of our general liability and commercial auto reserves and equally important incorporating these trends into our pricing models. We recorded $32 million before tax of deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings.\nBased on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect the remaining balance of $32 million to be amortized in the second quarter. Moving to Employee Benefits. We achieved core earnings of $136 million for the quarter. The core earnings margin of 7.6% reflects excellent group life and disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 69% improved from 7.1% in the first quarter of 2024 driven by improvement in the paid family and medical leave product loss ratio and continued strong claim recoveries.\nThe improvement was partially offset by a slight increase in long-term disability incidents compared to the prior year. However, incidence rates remain favorable to long-term historical averages and to our expectations. The group life loss ratio of 79.9% for the quarter improved 2.7 points reflecting lower mortality. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $381 million, combined with increased exposure on existing accounts and excellent persistency above 90% resulted in a 2% growth in fully insured ongoing premiums.\nFor the quarter, net investment income was $656 million. The total annualized portfolio yield ex limited partnerships was 4.4% before tax, 10 basis points above the year ago period and 20 basis points below the fourth quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower equity dividends, lower returns on public equity related fund investments and a modestly lower yield on variable rate securities. Our first quarter annualized LP return of 3.1% before tax were higher than the year ago period, although returns were lower than the fourth quarter including lower returns in our real estate portfolio and other funds.\nWe continue to strategically manage the portfolio, balancing risk while pursuing accretive trading opportunities and in the quarter, we invested at 70 basis points above the sales and maturity yield. Full year 2025 net investment income, excluding LPs, is expected to be higher in 2024, driven by invested asset growth. We expect the 2025 yield XLP to be generally in line with the yield earned in 2024 as lower yields on variable rate securities are expected to offset increases from reinvesting at higher rates.\nTurning to capital management. Holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion at quarter end. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the second quarter. As of March 31, we had $2.75 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our strong financial performance for the first quarter and believe we are well positioned to continue to enhance value for our stakeholders. I will now turn the call back to Kate."

Finally, please note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without The Hartford's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before beginning, I want to take a moment to address the recent wildfires that have devastated the Los Angeles community. Our thoughts are with all those impacted by the strategy. Our team on the ground is working tirelessly to help our customers rebuild and recover, and I thank them for their dedication.\nAfter Beth and I summarize our outstanding fourth quarter and full year results, we will then be joined by our business leaders for a Q&A session, including Mo Tooker who was appointed President, effective tomorrow, February 1. Mo will lead all our P&C businesses and will be responsible for stewarding several enterprise-wide initiatives. Mo is an exceptional leader with a strong reputation for strategic growth, customer-focused solutions, underwriting discipline and building a cohesive culture. He is ideally suited to step into the President role as we advance our growth and innovation strategy aimed at addressing our customers' changing needs.\nSo let's get started. Our fourth quarter results capped off another outstanding year of financial performance and strategic achievements. These results highlight the strength of our franchise, particularly our exceptional underwriting execution, extensive distribution relationships and an unparalleled customer experience. I wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks to our dedicated employees. Your unwavering commitment and hard work are the driving force behind our success.\nReflecting on some key achievements from 2024 for both the quarter and the year. Top line growth in Commercial Lines was 6% for the quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 87.1%. For the year, growth was 9%, and the underlying combined ratio of 87.9% was consistent with prior year.\nPersonal Lines achieved 9.3 points of underlying combined ratio improvement in the quarter, including over 10 points in auto. For the year, Personal Lines delivered an underwriting gain, including an auto underlying loss ratio that was 1 point better than our expectations.\nWe continue to achieve strong renewal written pricing increases across P&C during the quarter, including notable double-digit increases in commercial and personal auto, commercial property, homeowners and general liability.\nGroup Benefits delivered an impressive core earnings margin of 7.8% for the quarter and 8.2% for the year, led by strong life and disability results. And our investment portfolio continues to generate solid performance. All these items contributed to an outstanding core earnings ROE of 16.7% for the year.\nLet me dive deeper into the performance of each of our businesses. Our Commercial Lines business achieved significant top line growth while maintaining highly profitable underlying margins. Written premium growth was driven by strong pricing increases across most lines double-digit new business growth in our SME focused business and exposure growth that continues to benefit from a resilient economy.\nAs expected, underlying margins for the year were consistent with 2023, reflecting our steadfast commitment to disciplined underwriting, while sustaining industry-leading performance. Favorable underwriting results in property, along with strong renewal written pricing execution across all lines offset industry-wide elevated liability severity.\nBeth will provide specifics around prior year development in her comments, but I wanted to take a moment to address our general liability reserves. Based on our fourth quarter review, we have strengthened our general liability reserves by $130 million before tax. We believe that we have addressed the most recent trends and have adjusted our ultimate losses accordingly, reflecting the potential for increasing settlement costs due to a higher percentage of returning representation across all claim sizes and the rise in average settlement rates.\nMoving into each of our commercial lines businesses. Small Commercial remains the cornerstone of growth and profitability for The Hartford, setting an industry standard that is difficult to replicate in the market.\nI am very pleased to share that for the sixth consecutive year, Kinovo Group has ranked The Hartford as the #1 small commercial carrier in overall digital capabilities, an important competitive advantage in this market. Our top ranking reflects our commitment to providing exceptional functionality, ease of use and unparalleled support and access to our agents and customers.\nOur financial performance reflects this top ranking where we achieved a record-breaking written premium of $5.5 billion in 2024, including $1.1 billion of new business while extending a decade-long trend of annual sub-90 underlying combined ratios.\nWith another year of exceptional results in relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our small commercial business. Our middle and large commercial organization continues to demonstrate strong growth and underlying profitability. We are capitalizing on elevated submission [indiscernible] but in part by our strategic investments to expand product capabilities and enhance the efficiency of the broker and agent experience.\nOur investments in middle in large commercial position us well to drive additional top line growth and deliver exceptional results. While fourth quarter new business was slower than previous quarters, full year performance included strong top line growth, and an underlying margin that remained below 90%. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution and a 16% increase in middle market new business with robust growth across nearly all product lines led by Construction and Marine.\nIn 2025, we expect to sustain our track record of delivering meaningful growth with underwriting discipline. Global Specialty had an exceptional year, maintaining excellent underlying margin performance in the low to mid-80s for the past 3 years.\nOur competitive position, breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove strong gross written premium growth and record new business. This expansion was fueled by significant contributions from Global Re and our wholesale business. We remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and across global specialty with execution that has never been stronger.\nThe transformational work we have done over the last 5 years has put us in a strong position to accelerate our market-leading competitive advantage, driven by technology, data science and an experienced workforce. Whether in standard lines or E&S lines, we are gaining market share due to our unique underwriting capabilities and strong distribution relationships.\nAcross commercial lines, our continued emphasis on property expansion generated 16% premium growth this year. We achieved our full year goal ending the year with $3 billion in written premium and plan to continue building on this success in 2025. We remain confident that the market conditions support earnings strong risk-adjusted returns through disciplined underwriting while maintaining a stable approach to catastrophe risk management.\nDespite industry-wide elevated catastrophe losses, we are proud that our full year cat ratio remained flat with 2023, even with our significant property portfolio expansion.\nMoving to pricing. In commercial lines, renewal written pricing in the quarter, excluding workers' compensation of 9.7% was up 40 basis points from the prior quarter. All in, ex comp renewal written pricing in commercial lines remain comfortably above loss cost trends. Workers' compensation pricing was slightly down sequentially.\nAs we look to 2025 pricing, we are focused on keeping pace with loss cost trends across commercial lines with our diversified and expanding product portfolio and innovative mindset, we are primed to continue to grow market share [indiscernible] highly attractive margins.\nTurning to Personal Lines. 2024 was a transformative year, positioning us well for the future. We have positioned the business with new products and capabilities, revamped our operating routines and equipped ourselves with data and technology resources. We have faced business and environmental challenges with unparalleled determination, and I want to recognize the team's hard work and commitment to our vision and strategy.\nFor 2024, in auto, we achieved significant rate increases across the book driving an overall auto underlying loss ratio improvement of 7.3 points over a point better than the high end of our expectations. As a result of the significant written pricing actions that we'll earn into the book, combined with moderating severity trends, we expect continued underlying combined ratio improvement to reach the mid-90s during 2025.\nOur homeowners business had an exceptional year, highlighted by an impressive underlying combined ratio for the quarter, the best we've seen in over a decade, and a slightly improved cat ratio in a year of elevated industry catastrophe losses.\nPricing remained strong all year, outpacing underlying loss cost trends. Substantial investments have significantly improved price to risk matching and enhanced underwriting capabilities that are benefiting the homeowners book more broadly. With our rates and insurance to value, keeping pace with loss trend, we are confident about our strong position in the market.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Our strong core earnings margin in 2024 demonstrates focused execution, a resilient economy, improved mortality trends and continued strong disability results. Group Life mortality trends were favorable, though they are expected to remain above prepandemic levels.\nThe full year disability loss ratio of 68% primarily reflects favorable long-term disability trends, offset by pressure in paid family and medical leave products. These lead products are highly utilized and valued by employees, and we are implementing the necessary rate and underwriting actions to improve the margins.\nOverall, the benefit landscape is evolving with increased awareness of features and benefits which is positively impacting our supplemental products such as critical illness, hospital indemnity and accident. We continue to expect the group benefits market to remain dynamic with digital transformation, product innovation and increasing customer demands. As a result, we are investing in this business and have a clear road map that I am confident will only strengthen our [indiscernible] leadership position.\nLooking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales during 2025, and are off to a solid start. Core earnings margins in recent years have exceeded our long-term targets. However, we continue to expect a core earnings margin of 6% to 7% in this business with disability incidence trends returning to historic levels.\nMoving to investments. The portfolio continues to support The Hartford's financial and strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details.\nIn closing, excellent fourth quarter results capped a year of outstanding financial performance, positioning a sustained, consistent and superior results in 2025. I remain incredibly optimistic about our future because 2024 financial results have showcased the effectiveness of our strategy in the value in our ongoing investments.\nCommercial Lines continues to maintain excellent underlying margins while delivering robust top line growth. Group Benefits core earnings margin remains outstanding. We have achieved key milestones in our personal lines journey, and plan to return auto to targeted profitability by mid-2025.\nInvestment income remained strong, supported by attractive yields and a diversified, durable portfolio of assets and share repurchases and dividends remain our primary capital management tool.\nAs our businesses continue to generate excess capital, we will proactively manage capital resources to further drive shareholder value. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $865 million or $2.94 per diluted share with a full year core earnings ROE of 16.7%. Commercial Lines had a strong quarter with core earnings of $665 million, written premium growth of 6% and an underlying combined ratio of 87.1%.\nSmall Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 9%, including 22% new business growth and an underlying combined ratio of 86.7%. This is the 18th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio below 90%.\nMiddle & Large Commercial had another quarter of strong profitability with an underlying combined ratio of 90.2% and slightly improved from the prior year and written premium growth of 5%, reflecting lower new business as we remain disciplined, particularly with elevated general liability severity loss trends.\nGlobal Specialties fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was an excellent 83.6%, with record earned premium of $865 million. Written premium growth of 3% in the quarter reflects lower new business in primary and excess casualty and from our global reinsurance business, which declined 14%, primarily due to lower premium in Latin America. Global Specialty written premium, excluding Global Re, was up 6%.\nIn Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter increased to $155 million, including the first underwriting gain in 2 years with an underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, driven by a 17.3 point implement in the loss ratio over the prior year. The fourth quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 103 improved 10.5 points from the 2023 period, and homeowners produced an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 61.7%. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 12% in the fourth quarter, in part driven by steady and successful rate actions.\nIn auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 19.1% and earned pricing increases of 21.9%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 13.9% and 14.9% on an earned basis. Additionally, new business growth was robust in both homeowners and auto with homeowners more than doubling to $59 million, and auto increasing by 18% to $77 million.\nThe Personal Lines fourth quarter expense ratio of 26.5% increased from the prior year by 1.9 points, primarily driven by higher direct marketing costs, higher staffing costs and higher commissions, partially offset by the impact of higher earned premium.\nTotal P&C net unfavorable prior accident year development with in core earnings was $97 million before tax, primarily driven by $141 million of asbestos and environmental development. Excluding the A&E development, core prior accident year net development was favorable by $44 million due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes on professional liability and personal auto, partially offset by increases in general liability and commercial auto.\nAs Chris mentioned, we strengthened our general liability reserves this quarter by $130 million before tax. This included strengthening to the 2015 to 2018 accident years, driven by higher-than-expected construction defect claim activity in those years.\nIn addition, across our general liability lines, we strengthened the incurred, but not reported reserves for more recent accident years, as we observed an increase in severity on reported claims above our expectations and anticipate a higher claim severity trend on unreported claims as the industry continues to face increasing settlement costs with rising attorney representation rates and higher average settlement rates.\nWe completed our A&E reserve study in the quarter, resulting in an increase in reserves of $203 million, comprised of $167 million for asbestos and $36 million for environmental. As I mentioned, $141 million impacted core earnings and $52 million was recorded as a deferred gain, exhausting the ADC cover we have for A&E. As a reminder, we have recorded a total of $850 million before tax as a deferred gain within other liabilities for A&E as of December 31.\nFor our Navigators ADC, in 2024, we have amortized $145 million of the total $209 million deferred gain. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect the remaining balance of $64 million to be amortized in 2025. This will positively impact net income and have no impact to core earnings.\nWith respect to cats, P&C current accident year catastrophes in the fourth quarter were $80 million before tax, which was essentially flat to the prior year and included $68 million from Hurricane Millan, as well as net reductions for cash incurred earlier in the year of $18 million. For the year, cat totaled $768 million.\nWe continue to actively manage our cat exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher-risk areas. Additionally, we have a robust and comprehensive reinsurance program on both a per occurrence and aggregate basis.\nIn terms of our catastrophe reinsurance program renewal on January 1, we were very pleased with the placements and terms and conditions for our programs. Our expiring core per occurrence catastrophe protection was renewed at an approximate 10% decrease in cost on a risk-adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information, compares favorably with the overall market and speaks to the quality of our underwriting, strong reinsurer relationships and favorable experience.\nAdditionally, we continue to strategically leverage the combination of traditional reinsurance capacity with the sponsorship of our catastrophe bonds Foundation Re to ensure robust and diversified protection for our portfolio. As of January 1, after the reset of our catastrophe bonds, our occurrence program provides protection from peak peril up to a gross loss event of $1.5 billion.\nThe majority of that protection is secured on a multiyear basis. We also renewed our aggregate treaty under the same structure and at a favorable decrease in cost on a risk-adjusted basis. The continuing strength and diversification of our property, occurrence and aggregate protection aligns with and supports our strategic growth in property writing.\nAlthough it is too early to estimate the potential losses from the current California wildfires, we are closely monitoring the situation in areas where we have insured properties and businesses at risk. Our current reinsurance programs includes coverage for wildfires that attaches at $200 million and exhaust at $1.2 billion. Our reinsurance program does include provisions allowing the combination of events subject to hours and radius provisions. We have summarized the catastrophe reinsurance programs within the slide deck.\nMoving to Group Benefits. We achieved [indiscernible] $39 million for the quarter. The core earnings margin of 7.8% for the quarter reflects improved life results and continued strong disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 66.9% compared to 63.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical lead products and slightly higher LTD incidents in 2024 and after 2 years of all-time historically low incidents, partially offset by favorable long-term disability claim recoveries.\nThe group life loss ratio of 79.9% for the quarter improved 3.1 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. The group benefits expense ratio of 26.7% increased 2.5 points for the quarter reflecting higher staffing costs and increased investments in technology.\nFully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $68 million combined with increased exposure on existing accounts and excellent persistency above 90%, resulted in a 1% growth in fully insured ongoing premiums.\nTurning to investments. Our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. For the quarter, net investment income was $714 million.\nThe total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.6% before tax basis points above third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher reinvestment rates and accretive trading activity earning into the portfolio. The fourth quarter reinvestment yield continued to exceed the sales and maturity yield.\nLooking forward to 2025, we expect net investment income, excluding LPs, to be higher driven by an increased level of invested assets resulting from continued growth and anticipate yields to be marginally higher than 2024. As expected, our fourth quarter annualized LP returns of 6.4% before tax were higher than previous quarters. We continue to anticipate LP returns to improve in 2025, exceeding 2024 on a full year basis.\nTurning to capital. As of December 31, holding company resources totaled $1.3 billion. For 2025, we expect net dividends from the operating companies of approximately $2.5 billion, a 9% increase over 2024. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares under our share repurchase program for $400 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the first quarter. As of year-end, we had $3.15 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2026.\nTo wrap up, 2024 business performance was excellent, and we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns and enhance value for all of our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call back to Susan."

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford's second quarter results were outstanding, contributing to excellent financial performance in the first half of the year. These results reflect the effectiveness of our strategy and ongoing investments to differentiate The Hartford in the marketplace. We remain focused on disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, expanding, product and distribution breadth, developing exceptional talent and delivering a superior customer experience.\nHighlights from the second quarter include top line growth in commercial lines of 11% and with strong renewal written pricing increases and an underlying combined ratio of 87.4%. Personal Lines top line growth of 14%, with improving margins. An exceptional Group Benefits core earnings margin of 10% and solid performance in our investment portfolio. All of these items contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading, trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%.\nI'm also pleased to announce that with continued strong capital generation from our businesses, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3.3 billion. We will continue to balance growth, investing in our businesses and returning excess capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.\nNow let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines produced exceptional results with double-digit top line growth in an underlying combined ratio below [ 90% ] for the 13th straight quarter. We are using our industry-leading underwriting tools, pricing expertise, and data science advancements to drive profitable double-digit new business growth. Retention was steady and the broader economic environment remains conducive for growth.\nIn Small Commercial, with our unique and superior market position, industry-leading products, unmatched customer experience and unrivaled pricing accuracy we continue to deliver exceptional results, including strong top line growth and outstanding margins. New business premium was a record, up 23% in the quarter in part driven by a 36% increase in quotes and nearly 90% growth in E&S binding, where we continue to see tremendous opportunity. With another quarter of exceptional results, and relentless advancement of our capabilities, I remain incredibly bullish on the outlook for our small commercial business.\nMoving to middle and large commercial. Second quarter performance was excellent, including double-digit top line growth, paired with a strong underlying margin. We continue to take advantage of elevated submission flow, driven in part by investments made to expand our product capabilities, and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution, along with double-digit new business growth, primarily in property and liability coverages. We have built a track record of delivering meaningful growth while consistently maintaining underlying margins, a result we expect to sustain going forward.\nIn Global specialty, for the first time, we achieved over $1 billion in quarterly written premium and maintained underlying margins in the mid-80s. Our double-digit top line growth reflects our competitive position, diverse product offerings, and solid renewal pricing. Written premium growth was propelled by a 38% increase in global reinsurance, a 14% increase in our wholesale business with significant contributions from primary and excess casualty lines and double-digit growth in commercial and construction surety.\nWe are particularly pleased with wholesale construction projects bound in the quarter as well as overall increased submission flow, both meaningful drivers of new business growth. The Global specialty business with our expanding position in the wholesale and reinsurance market, our broadened product portfolio and enhanced risk selection tools has developed into a meaningful profitable growth engine for The Hartford.\nAs I've highlighted in the past, we continue to focus on property across commercial lines with written premium growth of approximately 20% in the quarter. We are capitalizing on favorable market conditions with a disciplined approach, including a stable and consistent catastrophe risk appetite.\nTurning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal written pricing accelerated to 6.6% in the quarter, 9.5% excluding workers' compensation. Low teens pricing in auto and high single digits in general liability, including 14% in excess and umbrella is responding to societal trends. Overall, commercial property pricing has begun to moderate, but was strong in the low double digits. All in, ex comp renewal, written pricing in commercial lines remain comfortably above loss cost trends. Workers' compensation pricing remained slightly positive in the quarter.\nBefore moving to Personal Lines, let me share a few comments we received at our recent Annual Agent Summit. Our broadened product portfolio, increased cross-selling opportunities and exceptional talent are resonating with the Asian community opening up new business opportunities. Feedback confirms that the marketplace and our top agents recognize our evolution and strength. They appreciate our strong culture and capability to solve customer problems as a unified commercial lines team, particularly with small business customers where we are taking advantage of disruption and engaging more than ever with our largest partners to drive efficiency.\nOur investments in patent technology were described as compelling and industry-leading and our talent strategy and succession planning was also complemented. Our exceptional Commercial Lines first half results and feedback from our partners makes it clear that we have the team, tools and momentum to capitalize on market opportunities.\nTurning to Personal Lines. Our second quarter financial performance demonstrates continued progress toward target margin improvement. Auto renewal written price increases remained very strong at nearly 24%. While below peak levels from last quarter, they remain consistent with our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year. As I have mentioned, we expect auto renewal written price increases for the year to be approximately 20%.\nIn homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. Investments in Personal Lines continued with the launch of Dynamic Pricing inside our [ Tru ] Lane telematics offering earlier this month, an enhanced price-to-risk matching capability aligned with our prevail product offering. As we return, personal auto to profitability in 2024, capabilities like this, along with enhanced risk segmentation, near-term pricing gains and moderating loss trend position personal lines to reach target margins in 2025.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Our core earnings margin was 10% for the quarter and 8.1% for the first half of the year. These stellar results included a lower life loss ratio versus the prior year and continued strong long-term disability execution. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2%, consistent with the first quarter, reflects strong book persistency still above 90% and sales of $546 million in the first half of the year.\nMoving to investments. The portfolio continues to support The Hartford's financial and strategic goals, performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions. Beth will provide more details.\nFrom a macroeconomic standpoint, the U.S. environment continues to be supportive of The Hartford's businesses. The labor market has been resilient with continued relatively low unemployment and wage rate growth, still in the 4% range, both of which positively affect our two largest and strongest performing lines, workers' compensation and disability.\nIn summary, the Hartford delivered an outstanding quarter with sustained momentum heading into the second half of the year, a testament to our execution, strategy, talent, and the impact of ongoing investments in our business. As I said before, we continue to build on our market differentiating capabilities and broad product offering, all while becoming more efficient. Our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer-centric technology are expected to sustain superior results. And we continue to proactively manage our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $750 million or $2.50 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 17.4%. Commercial Lines had an exceptional quarter with core earnings of $551 million, written premium growth of 11% and an underlying combined ratio of 87.4. Small Commercial continued to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 86.8, further building on its impressive track record of delivering an underlying combined ratio below 90%.\nFavorable non-cat property losses contributed to the strong results. Middle and Large commercial also delivered outstanding results with 13% written premium growth. The strong underlying combined ratio of 89.6 reflects the positive impact of premium leverage industry-leading pricing and segmentation analytics and exceptional talent that continue driving profitable growth.\nGlobal specialties written premium growth of 14% and was driven by accelerating renewal written price increases and strong new business growth, including quarterly net written premium growth of 14% in our wholesale channel. The underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 85.2, relatively flat to the prior year.\nWritten premium in Personal Lines increased 14% over the prior year, driven by rate execution. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 23.5% and earned pricing increases of 22.1%. In homeowners, written pricing increases were 14.9% for the quarter and 14.6% on an earned basis.\nIn Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 96.7 improved by 5 points from the prior year. Homeowners had another strong quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 77.8. We are very pleased with the improvement we are seeing in our auto results. Through June 30, our underlying combined ratio of 104.7 was in line with our expectations and is 3.8 points lower than the prior year period, almost entirely due to improvement in the loss ratio. We remain on track to achieve a 5 to 6-point full year improvement in the auto underlying loss ratio as we have previously discussed.\nThe total personal lines expense ratio increased by 0.7 points, driven by higher direct marketing costs as anticipated. We have achieved new business rate adequacy in states representing approximately 80% of new business, and our contemporary business model enables us to efficiently allocate marketing resources for growth in those states.\nWith respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year [indiscernible] were $280 million before tax or 7.1 combined ratio points, which compares to $226 million or 6.2 points on the combined ratio in 2023. And while catastrophe losses were significantly elevated for the industry, our results were only slightly higher than expectations. We continue to actively manage our [ cat ] exposure through aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher-risk states.\nTotal net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $78 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes, personal lines and bond, which were partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance and commercial auto liability. The increase to general liability reserve of $32 million was primarily related to accident years 2015 to 2019 with some modest increases in more recent years. We recorded $37 million before tax, deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC, which positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. We have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck on both this ADC and the A&E ADC for your reference.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings margin of 10% was exceptional. Results reflect strong group life and disability performance as well as fully insured premium growth. The group life loss ratio of [ 74.9 ] was 9.2 points lower than prior year due to lower claim severity. The group disability loss ratio of 67.1 was essentially flat with 2023, driven by lower long-term disability claim incidents and a higher New York Paid Family Leave risk adjustment benefit, offset primarily by a higher loss ratio in paid family and medical leave products.\nFully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was consistent with first quarter and reflects positive exposure growth, albeit at a lower rate than in 2023 and strong book persistency at over 90%.\nTurning to investments. Our diversified portfolio continues to produce solid results. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+ and net credit losses remain insignificant. For the quarter, net investment income was $602 million. The total annualized portfolio yield exclude limited partnerships with 4.4% before tax, slightly above first quarter. We continue to benefit from higher rates as evidenced by the second quarter reinvestment yield of 6.4%, up 30 basis points from our reinvestment rate in the first quarter and up 110 basis points from the year ago period.\nAs expected, our annualized LP returns of 1.3% were consistent with the first quarter. Although we anticipate LP returns to be somewhat stronger in the second half of 2024, the full year is likely to be below 2023 results. However, we remain confident that over the long term, LPs will generate returns consistent with historical levels.\nTurning to capital. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3.3 billion, which is 10% higher than the 2022 authorization, reflecting the strong capital generation of our businesses. This authorization, effective August 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026, is in addition to the existing authorization, which as of June 30, had approximately $650 million remaining.\nOver the last several quarters, our share repurchase activity has been very consistent at $350 million per quarter. With our new authorization in place, we would expect quarterly share repurchase activity to be closer to $400 million beginning with the third quarter.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our excellent financial performance through the first 6 months, and these results demonstrate consistent execution in delivering profitable growth, contributing to industry-leading returns, thereby enhancing value for all stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Beth. We now will take your questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hartford Financial First Quarter 2024 Results Webcast. Today's conference is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on first quarter 2024 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all the earnings-related materials on our website.\nNow I'd like to introduce our speakers. To start, we have Chris Swift, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Beth Costello, our Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will begin taking your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.\nJust a few comments before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update information or forward-looking statements provided on this call.\nInvestors should also consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings. Our commentary today includes non-GAAP financial measures.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Hartford had a strong start to the year, outstanding financial results through the first quarter. Our strategy and ongoing investments, combined with disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer-centric technology continue to drive outperformance.\nLet me call your attention to some highlights achieved in the quarter. Top line growth in Commercial Lines of 8% and with an underlying combined ratio of 88.4%, strong renewal written pricing increases in Commercial and Personal Lines, Group Benefits core earnings margin of 6.1% and solid performance in our investment portfolio, all these contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.6% reflecting consistency of our margins and continued growth generated by our businesses.\nNow let me share a few details from the quarter. Commercial Lines performance reflects strong top line growth at highly profitable margins. In the marketplace, we are prudently taking advantage of elevated submission flow, in part driven by the investments we have made to expand our product capabilities and the efficiency of the broker and agent experience.\nFrom that flow, we are using our data science advancements, pricing expertise in industry-leading underwriting tools to drive profitable double-digit new business growth in each of our 3 businesses. In addition, retention is steady and exposure growth remains solid although moderating from the elevated levels seen in the past couple of years.\nIn Small Commercial, we are shattering previous quarterly written premium records while sustaining underlying margins. New business growth was 11% in the quarter, driven by strong submission flow and growth in E&S binding. We are particularly pleased with E&S binding, a key area of focus, which is on track to grow annual written premiums by approximately 50% in 2024 to nearly $300 million.\nI remain incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial and bullish on its outlook. We expect to sustain outstanding financial results by reliably serving agents and customers with industry-leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy.\nMoving to Middle & Large Commercial. The financial performance continues to be exceptional. Written premium growth reflects strong renewal rate execution and new business growth of 18% with an especially good quarter in guaranteed cost construction and general industries. We are building a track record of delivering meaningful growth while consistently maintaining underlying margins.\nThe stellar performance in this business is a direct result of our underwriting discipline, enabled by the investments we have made to enhance our capabilities. Combining these advantages with our best-in-class talent and the strength of our distribution relationships, we remain well positioned to profitably grow this business.\nIn Global Specialty, results were excellent with underlying margins consistent with last year and solid top line growth reflecting our competitive position, breadth of products and strong renewal written pricing. Written premium growth was propelled by a 20% increase in our wholesale business with significant contributions from primary and excess casualty lines.\nWe are particularly pleased with wholesale construction activity found in the quarter as well as overall increased submission flow, both meaningful drivers of new business growth. We remain excited about the Global Specialty business, including our position in wholesale and reinsurance market and from a broadened product portfolio.\nLooking across Commercial Lines, we continue to grow our property book, another key area of focus. We are capitalizing on favorable market conditions with a disciplined approach, including no change in our catastrophe risk appetite. Property written premium for the quarter was approximately 17% higher than in 2023.\nTurning to pricing. Excluding workers' compensation, Commercial Lines renewal written pricing rose [ seven tenth ] from the fourth quarter to 9% with strong low double-digit pricing in property and auto and high single digit in general liability.\nPublic D&O pricing is still pressured, though relatively stable with the fourth quarter. All in, ex comp renewal written pricing in commercial lines remained comfortably above loss cost trends.\nIn workers' compensation, renewal written pricing remained slightly positive in the quarter. In summary, Commercial Lines delivered an outstanding first quarter results with ongoing momentum in the market.\nMoving to Personal Lines. Our first quarter financial performance demonstrates progress towards restoring targeted profitability in auto, as we continue to address current loss trends. Auto renewal written price increases of nearly 26% have likely peaked given our view of moderating loss trends for the remainder of the year.\nIn addition, we have achieved new business rate adequacy in the vast majority of states and as a result have resumed national advertising this month. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 15% during the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends.\nThis year, we are celebrating our 40th anniversary with AARP. In 1984, we embarked on this journey with a shared vision and commitment to serve mature market customers. Our focus on this preferred segment, coupled with our modern innovative and digitally enhanced product and platform prevail is a competitive advantage.\nOur updated offering is currently available in 42 states and represents approximately 60% of our new business premium this quarter. With pricing gains, enhanced risk segmentation and moderating loss trends, I expect Personal Lines to meaningfully contribute to core earnings as it returns to profitability in 2024 and reaches target margins in 2025.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Our core earnings margin of 6.1% for the quarter included improved mortality trends from the prior year and continued strong long-term disability claim recoveries. Fully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% reflects strong but slightly lower persistency and a 6% decline in sales primarily driven by group life, where we are being disciplined with pricing and underwriting in this competitive marketplace.\nWe continue to strengthen our capabilities for customer service, with an extensive suite [indiscernible] for HR platform integration, member enrollment, process simplification and analytics. As part of our strategy to grow amongst small and midsized businesses, we are investing in our platform. This includes strengthening distribution relationships and actively seeking out new partnerships. Employers are more focused than ever on the needs of their employees and our products and services are a key part of that value proposition.\nMoving to investments. The portfolio continues to support The Hartford's financial and strategic goals performing well across a range of asset classes and market conditions, and Beth will provide more details.\nIn summary, The Hartford delivered another strong quarter with sustained momentum heading into the remainder of the year. Let me reiterate why I am so bullish about the future. First, our financial results continue to prove the effectiveness of our strategy and the impact of ongoing investments in our business.\nSecond, Personal Lines results are showing improvement. We are achieving necessary rate increases and expect 2024 margins to progress towards targeted profitability.\nThird, with our disciplined underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent, an innovative customer-centric technology, we will continue to sustain superior results.\nFourth, investment income remained solid, supported by elevated yields and a diversified and durable portfolio of assets.\nAnd finally, we remain dedicated to enhancing shareholder value through supporting organic growth, continued investment in our business and proactively managing our excess capital. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford and our ability to extend our track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $709 million or $2.34 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 16.6%. Commercial Lines had an outstanding quarter with core earnings of $546 million and an underlying combined ratio of 88.4%, in line with our expectations and slightly better than the prior year first quarter.\nSmall Commercial continued to deliver excellent results with written premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.6 and further building on its impressive track record of delivering an underlying combined ratio below 90.\nMiddle and Large commercial also delivered outstanding results with 9% growth over the prior year and this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of written premium exceeding $1 billion. The underlying combined ratio was excellent at 89.2, a 0.7 point improvement over first quarter 2023, primarily due to a lower expense ratio driven by the impact of strong earned premium growth.\nGlobal Specialties underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 85.3, relatively flat to the prior year. Written premium growth of 8% was driven by accelerating renewal written price increases and new business growth of 17%, excluding Global Re.\nIn Personal Lines, Core earnings for the quarter were $33 million with an underlying combined ratio of 96.1, including a strong homeowners underlying combined ratio of 77. The auto underlying combined ratio of 104.4 was in line with our expectations and is a year-over-year improvement of 3.7 points. Once the reported ratio for the first quarter of 2023 is increased for the 3 points of development that occurred in the second quarter of 2023.\nThis result is consistent with achieving the 5- to 6-point full year improvement we previously discussed. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 13% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 25.7% and earned pricing increases of 19.1%.\nIn homeowners, written pricing increases were 15.2% for the quarter and 14.4% on an earned basis. The total Personal Lines expense ratio improved by 1.2 points, primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by higher direct marketing costs as we increase our marketing spend to drive new business growth in those states where rates are adequate.\nWith respect to catastrophes, P&C current accident year cat were $161 million before tax or 4.2 combined ratio points which compares to $185 million in 2023 or 5.3 points on the combined ratio. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $32 million, primarily due to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, which were partially offset by reserve increases in general liability, assumed reinsurance and ocean marine.\nIn addition, we had $7 million of favorable development in personal auto physical damage. We also recorded $24 million before tax in deferred gain amortization related to the Navigators ADC. This positively impacted net income with no impact on core earnings. Based on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect total amortization of the deferred gain in 2024 will be approximately $125 million before tax with the remaining balance amortized in 2025.\nWe have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck on both this ADC and the A&E ADC for your reference.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the first quarter of $107 million and a 6.1% Core earnings margin reflect improved Life results, continued strong Disability performance and fully insured premium growth. As a reminder, from a seasonality perspective, we tend to experience higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter.\nThe group disability loss ratio of 70.1 improved 0.3 points from 2023, driven by continued strong claim recoveries, partially offset by higher incidents in paid family leave and short-term disability products. The group life loss ratio of 82.6 improved 4.1 points versus prior year, reflecting improved mortality.\nFully insured ongoing premium growth of 2% was driven by exposure growth, which remained positive, albeit at a lower rate than in the prior year. Book persistency in the first quarter of 2024 was strong at over 90%, but approximately 1.5 points below record high levels in 2023.\nTurning to investments. Our diversified investment portfolio continues to produce solid results. For the quarter, net investment income was $593 million. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.3% before tax, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur annualized LP returns were 1.3% and included positive returns from our private equity portfolio. Our real estate equity portfolio returns were impacted by lower valuations and the absence of real estate JV equity sales. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, limited partnership returns in the second quarter are likely to be similar to first quarter results, with private equity returns being offset by declines in real estate valuations and property depreciation with no sales activity.\nWe continue to believe our real estate holdings are durable, and we will be patient as it relates to any sales in order to maximize value. Although we anticipate LP returns for the full year could be below 2023 results, we continue to believe that over the long term, results will continue to add value and be consistent with historical returns.\nThe overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Net credit losses remain insignificant.\nTurning to capital. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024.\nTo wrap up, our first quarter results reflect another quarter of delivering on our targeted returns to enhance value for all of our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you. We will now take your questions. Operator, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?"

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2023 The Hartford Financial Results Webcast. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings.

I will start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year '23 results, which are simply stellar. Then I'll turn the call over to Beth to dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics, after which I will close our prepared remarks with a review of expectations for 2024. We then will be joined by our business leaders as we move into Q&A. So let's get started.\nThe Hartford is pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter, capping another outstanding year of financial performance and achievement of our strategic objectives. These results demonstrate the power of the franchise and in particular, our superior underwriting execution, depth of distribution relationships and unmatched customer experience. I am grateful for the commitment, dedication and hard work of our 19,000 employees who show up every day to deliver for our customers, partners and shareholders.\nLet me call your attention to some highlights for both the quarter and the year. Top line growth in Commercial Lines was 9% for the quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 86.6%, and growth was 10% for the year with an 87.8% underlying combined ratio. We achieved strong renewal written pricing increases across P&C during the quarter and for the year, including notable double-digit increases in commercial property, personal auto and homeowners in the quarter.\nGroup Benefits fully insured premium growth was 6% for the quarter with a core earnings margin of 9.8%, and growth was 7% for the year with a core earnings margin of 8.1%. We delivered strong investment performance with an 80 basis points increase in the portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships for the full year. All of these items contributed to an outstanding and industry-leading core earnings ROE of 15.8%.\nNow let me share a few details from each of our businesses. Our Commercial Lines business completed its third straight year of double-digit top line growth and underlying margin expansion. Written premium growth of 10% for the year was driven by meaningful exposure growth, pricing increases across most lines and strong new business growth in each of our 3 businesses. As expected, underlying margins improved 0.5 point as slight headwinds in workers' compensation were more than offset by earned pricing, exceeding loss cost trends across the rest of the portfolio and by improved expense leverage.\nSmall Commercial remains a highly profitable growth engine for The Hartford. 2023 included record-breaking annual written premium of $5 billion and a decade-long trend of annual sub-90 underlying combined ratios. Spectrum, our best-in-class package product, continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace, contributing to annual new business premium growth up 20% over prior year. I am incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial, a business we expect will sustain outstanding results with industry-leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy.\nMoving to Middle & Large Commercial. The performance has also been truly exceptional. Our team has improved annual underlying margins by approximately 10 points since 2019 while adding over $900 million in written premium at a 7% compounded annual growth rate. In 2023, written premiums grew 9%, reflecting strong rate execution and new business growth.\nSubmissions, quotes and the hit rate are all up over prior year as we leveraged advanced underwriting capabilities, particularly within the low end of Middle Market. The stellar results in this business are a direct result of data science advancements, pricing expertise and industry-leading tools. Combining these advantages with our best-in-class talent and the strength of our distribution relationships, we are well positioned to sustain profitable growth in this business.\nIn Global Specialty, advanced underwriting capabilities and continued discipline are driving targeted market share gains with excellent underlying margin performance that has hovered in the low to mid-80s for the past 7 quarters. Our competitive position, breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove an 11% increase in net written premium for the year, including 33% in our Global Reinsurance business and mid-double-digit growth in U.S. professional liability and international marine and energy.\nNew business growth of 7% for the year and 20% for the fourth quarter was driven by significant increases in both submissions and wholesale. Renewal written pricing continues to accelerate in wholesale excess casualty, and property pricing has been above 20% all year. We remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and across Global Specialty with execution that has never been stronger.\nLooking across Commercial Lines. We are particularly pleased by the growth in property lines, a key area of focus. We will continue to capitalize on favorable market conditions with a thoughtful and disciplined approach. Property written premium of $2.5 billion for the year was approximately 20% higher than 2022.\nTurning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal written pricing was 6%, an increase from 5.5% in the third quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing rose [ 4/10 ] to 8.5% with strong property pricing at 11%, auto closing in on double digits and many liability lines in the high single digits. Public D&O pricing remains pressured, although the fourth quarter result was the lowest pricing decrease since the second quarter of 2022.\nIn workers' compensation, renewal written pricing continues to exceed expectations, remaining slightly positive in the quarter. All in, ex comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remains comfortably on top of loss costs trends in the fourth quarter. In summary, Commercial Lines produced an exceptional quarter, closing out a very successful 2023.\nMoving to Personal Lines. I am pleased with our continued progress to address elevated loss costs trends in both auto and home. During the quarter, we achieved auto renewal written price increases of nearly 22% and new business rate adequacy in over half the states, representing 2/3 of our new business premium. In homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.7% during the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss costs trends.\nOur focus on the preferred market within the Personal Lines business is a competitive advantage with our modern, innovative and digitally enhanced offering, Prevail. This product and platform are currently available in 41 states with additional states coming online in 2024.\nTurning to Group Benefits. We had an exceptional year, delivering record core earnings of $567 million and an outstanding core earnings margin of 8.1% and strong fully insured ongoing premium growth of 7%, demonstrating focused execution, a resilient economy, improved mortality trends and continued strong disability results. 2023 disability loss ratio of 67.1% reflects low long-term disability incidence trends and favorable claim recoveries.\nIn 2023, group life mortality trends have improved, though they remain above prepandemic levels. We expect the Group Benefits market to remain dynamic with digital transformation, product innovation and increasing customer demands. As a result, we are investing in this business and have a clear road map that I am confident will only strengthen our market leadership position.\nFor example, building on our historically strong presence in national accounts with an enhanced approach for small to midsized employers, we view this as a key strategic initiative, leveraging our unique expertise in these markets. In addition, as we have discussed before, we struck a partnership with Beam, a dental and vision company to expand our product offerings for small to midsized employers.\nOverall, the strength of our Group Benefits diversified product portfolio, our commitment to outstanding customer experience using data and technology resonates in this marketplace, cementing our leadership position.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $935 million or $3.06 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 15.8%. Commercial Lines had a very strong quarter and year with core earnings of $723 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, and an underlying combined ratio of 86.6% for the quarter and 87.8% for the year.\nSmall Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 8% and an underlying combined ratio of 85.8% compared to 87.5% in the prior year fourth quarter. For the year, growth was 10% and the underlying combined ratio was 88.6%.\nMiddle & Large Commercial delivered its third straight quarter of written premium over $1 billion with 11% growth and an underlying combined ratio of 90.3%. For 2023, growth was 9% with an underlying combined ratio of 89.3% compared to 92.1% in the prior year.\nGlobal Specialty's fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 82.9% and for the year, improved 30 basis points to 84.3%. In Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter were $36 million with an underlying combined ratio of 99.5%, including a strong homeowners underlying combined ratio of 67.3%. The fourth quarter auto underlying combined ratio of 113.5% was better than our expectations due to lower auto physical damage losses. This result is an improvement of 5.1 points from the fourth quarter of 2022 once that quarter is adjusted for the adverse development recorded in the first half of 2023 related to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAlso, I will point out that during the fourth quarter of this year, we made no adjustments to loss reserves for prior accident years. As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the loss costs trends we are experiencing.\nWritten premium in Personal Lines increased 12% over the prior year driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 21.9% and earned pricing increases of 15.5%. In addition, we received approval for an 18.7% rate increase in California that was effective in January.\nIn homeowners, written pricing increases were 14.7% for the quarter and 14% on an earned basis. The total Personal Lines expense ratio improved by 10 basis points primarily driven by the impact of higher earned premium, partially offset by higher direct marketing costs.\nWith respect to CAT, P&C current accident year catastrophes were $81 million before tax, which compares to catastrophe losses of $135 million in the prior year quarter. Total net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $102 million, primarily concentrated in Commercial Lines as reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes and bond were partially offset by reserve increases in assumed reinsurance and commercial auto liability.\nWe completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study in the fourth quarter, resulting in an increase in reserves of $194 million, comprised of $156 million for asbestos and $38 million for environmental. All of the $194 million was ceded to the adverse development cover. The increase in asbestos reserves was primarily due to an increase in the cost of resolving asbestos filings and a modest increase in the company's share of loss on a few specific individual accounts. The increase in environmental reserves was mainly due to higher estimated site remediation costs, including an increase in the estimate for PFAS exposures.\nAfter taking into consideration this year's study, as of December 31, we have $62 million of coverage remaining on the A&E ADC and a deferred [indiscernible] previously ceded the full limit of $300 million, of which $209 million has been recognized as a deferred gain within other liabilities. In 2024, we expect to start collecting recoveries on the ADC. And as a result, amortization of the deferred gain is expected to begin in the first quarter.\nBased on our estimate of payment patterns, we expect total amortization of the deferred gain in 2024 will be approximately $125 million pretax with the remaining balance amortized in 2025. This will positively impact net income and have no impact to core earnings.\nBefore turning to Group Benefits, I would like to review the January 1 reinsurance renewals. Overall, we were very pleased with the placements and terms and conditions for our program. Our expiring core per occurrence catastrophe protection was renewed at an approximate 5% decrease in cost on a risk-adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information, compares favorably with the overall market and speak to the quality of our book of business, strong reinsurer relationships and favorable experience.\nThere were some minor changes in the treaty that provides coverage for certain loss events under $350 million. But overall, the structure of our property CAT program did not change significantly. Additionally, we secured another $300 million layer on top of our program through a combination of traditional reinsurance and sponsorship of a catastrophe bond. The addition of CAT bond protection furthers our goal of securing diversified, strongly rated protection that affords durability in both cost and availability. The majority of our occurrence protection is secured on a multiyear basis.\nAs of January 1, we have protection up to a gross loss event of $1.4 billion. We also renewed our aggregate treaty under the same structure and term with favorable pricing from a risk-adjusted perspective. You've heard Chris reference our strategic growth in property writings. These changes ensure a consistent level of protection in keeping with that growth.\nWe have summarized these changes in the slide deck. And in addition to our property catastrophe program, we also successfully renewed several other reinsurance treaties that experienced limited changes in terms, conditions and rates.\nMoving to Group Benefits. We achieved record core earnings of $174 million for the quarter and $567 million for the full year. Core earnings margin of 9.8% in the quarter and 8.1% for the full year reflects strong premium growth, improved life results and continued strong disability performance. The group disability loss ratio of 63.6% for the quarter improved 1.9 points over prior year, reflecting continued strong long-term disability claim recoveries.\nFor the year, the group disability loss ratio improved 1.2 points to 67.1%. The group life loss ratio of 83% for the quarter improved 6.1 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend. For the year, the group life loss ratio improved 3.9 points to 83.5%. The expense ratio improved 0.8 points for the quarter and one point for the year, reflecting strong top line performance and expense efficiencies, somewhat offset by continued investments to meet our customers' evolving needs.\nFully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $71 million contributed to a full year sales total of $839 million. This, combined with excellent persistency at above 90%, resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 6% for the quarter and 7% for the year.\nOur diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter, net investment income was $653 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates, and we continue to be pleased with the positive 150 basis point differential between our reinvestment rate and the yield on sales and maturities. The total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships was 4.3% before tax, 20 basis points higher than the third quarter.\nLooking forward to 2024, we are expecting 15 to 20 basis points of improvement reflected of the current wield environment. This increase, combined with portfolio asset growth, is expected to contribute approximately $135 million to net investment income before tax excluding LPs.\nOur annualized LP returns were 7% in the quarter. Full year 2023 LP returns were 4.8%, reflecting the resiliency of our private equity portfolio, which helped offset the slightly negative returns in the real estate equity portfolio.\nThe overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Fixed maturity valuations increased in the quarter as a result of lower interest rates and tighter spreads. Net credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments, remain insignificant along with a modest increase of $5 million in the allowance for credit losses on the mortgage loan portfolio. All of our mortgage loans continue to be current with respect to interest and principal payments.\nTurning to capital. As of December 31, holding company resources totaled $1.1 billion. For 2024, we expect total dividends from the operating companies of approximately $2.2 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the first quarter. As of year-end, we had $1.35 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024.\nTo wrap up, 2023 business performance was strong, and we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns and enhance value for all of our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call back to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Beth. Let's now pivot forward. Strong fourth quarter results capped a year of outstanding financial performance, positioning us to sustain these results in 2024. In Commercial Lines, with our diversified and expanding product portfolio and innovative mindset, we are primed to continue to build market share at highly attractive margins. We expect total renewal written price increases in Commercial Lines excluding workers' compensation to be consistent with 2023. Workers' compensation renewal written pricing, which is composed of net rate and average wage growth, is projected to be flat to slightly negative.\nWe expect underlying margins to be consistent with 2023, reflecting our steadfast commitment to disciplined underwriting while sustaining industry-leading results. While we anticipate slight headwinds in workers' compensation, earned pricing is projected to remain on top of loss costs trends across the remainder of the Commercial Lines book.\nTurning to Personal Lines. We expect annual renewal written pricing in both auto and home to be consistent with the fourth quarter results. In auto, as a result of the significant written pricing actions that will earn into the book combined with moderating severity trends, we expect meaningful underlying loss ratio improvement of 5 to 6 points during 2024. Earned pricing in home is expected to remain above loss costs trends.\nAs we navigate this inflationary period across Personal Lines, we are focused on balancing rate adequacy, quality of new business and marketing productivity. Overall, I am confident we have the right execution plan to return this business to targeted profitability in 2025.\nIn Group Benefits, we expect the 2024 core earnings margin to be between 6% and 7%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this business.\nIn closing, let me summarize why I'm so bullish about the future. First, 2023 financial results demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy and the ongoing investments in our business. In particular, underlying margins in Commercial Lines were excellent with meaningful top line growth, and we produced record core earnings in Group Benefits with strong premium growth.\nSecond, Personal Lines results have stabilized. We are achieving necessary rate increases and expect 2024 margins to improve towards our targeted profitability.\nThird, we expect our book of diversified but complementary businesses will continue to sustain superior results. With our outstanding underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer-centric technology, we will continue to outperform.\nFourth, investment income remains strong, supported by rising yields and a diversified and durable portfolio of assets.\nAnd finally, in the last 3 years, we have returned $6.2 billion of capital through repurchases and dividends, and we will continue to proactively manage our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders. All these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford. Quarter after quarter, we are delivering industry-leading financial performance with a sustainable core earnings ROE anchored at 15% while creating value for all our stakeholders.\nLet me now turn the call back over to Susan for Q&A.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?"

My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2023 The Hartford Financial Results Webcast. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. And I will now turn the conference over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on third quarter 2023 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all the earnings-related material on our website.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. The Hartford's third quarter financial and operational performance builds upon the momentum achieved in the first half of the year. Once again, Commercial Lines and Group Benefits which, in aggregate, represent over 85% of earned premium delivered exceptional results. We continue to expand our strong competitive position, successfully executing on priorities and delivering superior returns for shareholders.\nLet me now call your attention to highlights from the third quarter. Top line growth in Commercial Lines of 8% with an underlying combined ratio of 87.8%. Strong pricing across P&C, including double-digit increases in commercial property, Personal Lines auto and home. Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 8% with a core earnings margin of 9.8%. Strong investment performance with reinvestment rates climbing to 6%, driving higher portfolio yield and the trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.9%. These results are outstanding and keep us on track to deliver a full year core earnings ROE in the range of 14% to 15%.\nAs I look across the markets, the U.S. economy has remained resilient, and recent data points including robust payroll, strong retail sales and solid levels of industrial production point to an environment which continues to be supportive of The Hartford's businesses.\nNow let me dive deeper into the third quarter performance by business. In Small Commercial, written premiums were $1.2 billion with 16% growth in new business and another sub-90 underlying margin. Our best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum, continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace, contributing new business premium of approximately $100 million, up 20% over prior year. In addition, written premium for excess and surplus lines grew 34% in the quarter with new business growth of over 50%.\nWe expect E&S premium to approach $200 million for the full year. I am incredibly pleased with the overall performance in Small Commercial, which continues to deliver outstanding results with industry-leading products and unmatched ease of conducting business and unrivaled pricing accuracy. This business is poised to exceed $5 billion of written premium this year.\nMiddle & Large Commercial had another great quarter. Written premiums grew 5%, reflecting strong rate execution and new business growth in our excess lines. Our general industry's property book grew 13% while large property grew 15%. Looking across Commercial Lines, we are taking a thoughtful and disciplined approach to grow property premium within favorable market conditions to a level approaching $2.5 billion for the full year or a 25% increase. We are focused on managing our CAT exposure as evidenced by our year-to-date CAT losses, which were lower than our market share.\nComing back to Middle & Large Commercial, underlying margins were exceptional, reflecting the advancements made in data science capabilities, pricing and underwriting tools. Margins also benefited from favorable property losses. Those advancements, combined with our best-in-class talent, position us well to sustain profitable growth in this business.\nGlobal Specialty continues to deliver outstanding results with net written premiums up 11%, driven by new business growth and strong renewal written pricing in a number of key lines. Submission flow in the U.S. was up 11% in the quarter, including 15% growth in wholesale, and international saw strong new business growth in marine and energy. Within renewal written pricing momentum has been building in the wholesale excess market. Property pricing has been above 20% all year, and international casualty is above 10%.\nIn addition, we remain excited about the ongoing benefits to the top line from our expansive product portfolio. Our underwriting discipline, along with enhanced capabilities developed over the past few years in Global Specialty, are driving targeted market share gains with a stellar underlying combined ratio that has hovered in the mid-80s for the past 6 quarters. In short, our execution has never been stronger.\nTurning to pricing. Commercial Lines' renewal written pricing was 5.4%, flat with the second quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing rose to 8%, up [ 14% ] sequentially and with strong pricing in property, auto and general liability. Across commercial, property pricing is over 10% with auto and general liability nearing that level as well. Pricing and other liability and casualty lines also remained strong, while public D&O is still pressured.\nIn workers' compensation renewal written pricing continues to exceed expectations, remaining slightly positive in the quarter. All in ex comp renewal written pricing in Commercial Lines remains on top of loss cost trends, reinforcing my confidence in achieving our margin expectations for the year. In summary, momentum persists in Commercial Lines, where I expect top line growth at highly profitable margins to continue.\nMoving to Personal Lines. I am pleased with our continued response to elevated loss cost in both auto and home. In this challenging environment, our focus, objectives and execution are unwavering. During the quarter, we achieved auto renewal written price increases of nearly 20%, which we expect to continue at that rate into the fourth quarter. Current accident year loss trend expectations for the third quarter, as updated in June, held a promising development as we finish the year.\nIn homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.1% comprised of net rate and insured value increases, outpaced underlying loss cost trends. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit pricing increases in this book. Our focus on the preferred market within Personal Lines business is a competitive advantage with our modern, innovative and digitally enhanced offering, Prevail. This product will be available in 39 states by the end of this month, and we are optimistic about future prospects for growth.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to achieve auto new business rate adequacy in over half the states, representing 2/3 of new business premium. I am confident in the pricing actions we are taking will return this business to targeted profitability in 2025.\nIn Group Benefits, premium growth of 8% and a core earnings margin of 9.8% were both outstanding. Core earnings of $170 million was a quarterly record, reflecting focused execution, improved mortality trends and continued strong disability results. This quarter's disability loss ratio reflects historically low long-term disability incident trends and favorable claim recoveries. In group life, mortality trends have improved both sequentially and year-over-year but remain above pre-pandemic levels.\nLooking at the top line. Growth was driven by book persistency above 90% plus strong year-to-date sales. Overall, the strength of our Group Benefits' diversified product portfolio as well as our commitment to outstanding customer experience through the use of data and technology resonates in this marketplace, cementing our leadership position.\nBefore I turn the call over to Beth, let me share some takeaways from the recent Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers Annual Conference. Throughout the course of the 60-plus meetings and touch points at CIAB, we heard a consistent acknowledgment of the strength of our franchise. Partners called out our unique digital tools, product set, the strength of our innovation agenda and the consistent execution of our strategy over a number of years. They also expressed their desire to grow their business with us and have come to view our team as best-in-class with relationships that have never been stronger.\nConfirmation from distribution partners that we are delivering on our strategy is strong validation of our leading position in the market. Through those relationships, combined with enhanced capabilities, state-of-the-art technology and digital tools, we are taking market share while delivering industry-leading returns. With that track record, I am confident in our ability to consistently deliver core earnings ROE in the 14% to 15% range.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $708 million or $2.29 per diluted share. Commercial Lines had a very strong quarter with core earnings of $542 million and an underlying combined ratio of $87.8. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 9% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.7%, which includes some elevated non-CAT property losses. This is the 13th consecutive quarter with an underlying combined ratio of below 90.\nMiddle & Large Commercial delivered another quarter of written premium over $1 billion and an exceptional underlying combined ratio of 88.1. This was a 5.6 point improvement from the prior year, including favorable non-CAT property losses and expense ratio improvement. Global Specialties underlying margin was a strong 84.3%, a 20 basis point improvement from a year ago, primarily due to lower loss ratios in global reinsurance and international lines partially offset by higher loss ratios in U.S. financial lines due to public D&O rate pressure and marine driven by a couple of large losses as well as higher policyholder dividends in bond due to the strong profitability of the book.\nIn Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was $8 million with an underlying combined ratio of 99. Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 78.1% was in line with expectations. The auto underlying combined ratio was 108.5% for the quarter, which is consistent with our expectation from second quarter. Importantly, we made no adjustments to loss picks from the first half of the year and prior accident years.\nAs Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the loss cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 8% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 19.7% and earned pricing increases of 11.7%. In homeowners, pricing increases of 14.1% on a written basis and 13.7% unearned. The expense ratio improved by 2.9 points, primarily driven by lower marketing spend.\nWith respect to CAT, P&C current accident year catastrophe were $184 million before tax, which compares to catastrophe losses of $293 million in the prior year quarter, which included Hurricane Ian losses of $214 million. Although CAT losses were elevated for the industry again this quarter, our results were in line with our expectations as we believe that our effective aggregation management and underwriting discipline has helped to limit our losses from the increased number of convective storms.\nTotal net favorable prior accident year development was $43 million, with $46 million in Commercial Lines as reserve reductions in workers' compensation and package businesses were modestly offset by reserve increases in general liability.\nMoving to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the third quarter were $170 million with a core earnings margin of 9.8%, reflecting strong premium growth and long-term disability results. Group disability continues to deliver strong results with a loss ratio of 67.3% for the quarter down 1.1 points from prior year. The group life loss ratio of 80.2% improved 2.9 points versus prior year, reflecting an improving mortality trend.\nThe expense ratio improved 1.4 points and reflects strong top line performance and expense efficiencies, somewhat offset by continued investments to meet our customers' evolving needs and drive greater efficiency. Fully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $143 million contributed to a year-to-date sales total of $768 million. This, combined with excellent persistency at above 90%, resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 8% for the third quarter.\nOur diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter, net investment income was $597 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates, and we continue to be pleased with the positive 150 basis point differential between our reinvestment rate and the yield on sales and maturities. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4.1% before tax, slightly higher than the second quarter. We expect the full yield excluding LPs will be about 80 basis points higher than the prior year.\nLooking forward to 2024, we anticipate another 25 basis points of improvement based on the current yield curve, which will contribute to about a $200 million before tax increase in investment income excluding LPs. Our annualized LP returns were 6.3% in the quarter. Results during the first 9 months of 2023 reflect the resiliency of our private equity return and the absence of any real estate equity sales.\nThe overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. This maturity valuation decreased as a result of higher interest rates. Net credit losses, including intent-to-sell impairments remain insignificant, along with an increase of $5 million in the allowance for credit losses on the mortgage loan portfolio. All of our mortgage loans continue to be current with respect to interest and principal payments.\nTurning to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares under our share repurchase program for $350 million, and we expect to remain at that level of repurchases in the fourth quarter. We were also pleased to announce yesterday an 11% increase in our common quarterly dividend payable on January 3. This is the tenth increase in the dividend in the last decade and another proof point of the consistent capital generation of the company.\nOur third quarter results demonstrate that our franchise continues to deliver consistent, sustained industry-leading results. We believe that we have the strategies, talent and technology in place to continue to succeed. I will now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Beth. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, we will now take our first question."

Last night, we reported strong financial and operational performance for the second quarter, completing a successful first half of the year. While we and the industry continue to navigate a dynamic market environment including elevated catastrophe losses and persistent inflationary pressure in personal auto, once again, we achieved exceptional results in Commercial Lines and outstanding performance in group benefits. .\nHighlights of the second quarter include: top line growth in Commercial Lines of 12%, including double-digit contributions from each business with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3 Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 7%, with a core earnings margin of 7.6%. Strong investment performance with increasing fixed income portfolio yields and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 13.6%, while returning $484 million of capital to shareholders. These results only strengthen my confidence in our ability to deliver a 2023 core earnings ROE in the range of 14% to 15%.\nNow let me dive deeper into our second quarter performance for each of our businesses. Momentum is strong in Commercial Lines. I expect continued top line growth at highly profitable margins during the second half of 2023, with full year underlying combined ratio targets unchanged. In Small Commercial, written premium of $1.3 billion and new business of $237 million continue near record high levels. Our best-in-class package product, which we call Spectrum, continues to outperform in a competitive marketplace. Spectrum new business premium of over $100 million was up 23% over prior year. Our unmatched ease of doing business with agents and customers and our unrivaled pricing accuracy and consistency remain important drivers as demonstrated by strong sales and retention and a 6% year-over-year increase in policies in force.\nIn addition, written premium for our excess and surplus line binding product eclipsed $50 million in the quarter, up nearly 60% from a year ago, with new business growth of just over 85%. Our expanding wholesale broker relationships are expected to drive continued robust growth and profitability for this important line. In short, Small Commercial continues to deliver outstanding results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities and is on track to exceed $5 billion of annual written premium in the near term.\nMiddle and Large commercial had an exceptional quarter. Written premiums were at their highest levels ever, up 12% in the quarter, driven by strong momentum in new business with elevated submissions and hit rates along with increasing average account premium. Cross-sell activities remain in full force and are helping to drive new business results. Written premium grew across almost all lines with excellent growth in our construction, energy, and entertainment verticals.\nIn addition, we are particularly pleased by the 24% top line growth in middle-market property lines, which remains a key area of focus and accretive part of this business. Looking across the enterprise, as discussed in prior quarters, we are taking thoughtful and disciplined steps using industry-leading tools to grow our property book within favorable market conditions. These efforts should put us in a position to expand commercial property written premium to approximately $2.5 billion or up 25% by year-end. Underlying margins in Middle and Large Commercial were also at record levels, reflecting advancements in data science capabilities, industry-leading pricing and underwriting tools and exceptional talent, all of which position us well to maintain profitable growth in this business.\nGlobal Specialty continues to deliver outstanding results with net written premium growth of 15% in the quarter. New business growth and improving renewal written pricing were important contributors. In addition, we remain excited about our position in the wholesale market and the ongoing benefits to the top line from our broadened product portfolio, U.S. Ocean Marine, Environmental, International, and Global Reinsurance all achieved double-digit top line increases. Our underwriting discipline, along with enhanced capabilities developed over the past few years are driving targeted market share gains with a stellar underlying combined ratio that has hovered in the mid-80s for the past 5 quarters. In short, our execution has never been stronger.\nTurning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal pricing of 5.2% compared to 4.5% in the first quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, renewal pricing rose to 7.5%, up 0.8 points sequentially with accelerating pricing in property and auto. Across commercial, property pricing is well into the double digits with auto in the high single digits, Pricing in other liability and casualty lines also remained strong, while public D&O pricing remains challenged. In addition, workers' compensation pricing remained slightly positive.\nAll in, our strong written pricing performance in Commercial Lines, combined with stable loss cost trends, bolsters my confidence in our ability to maintain or slightly improve margins going forward.\nMoving to Personal Lines. Persistent severity loss increases in auto have had a meaningful influence on overall industry results. We continue to respond with significant pricing actions. During the quarter, we achieved renewal written price increases of 13.8% and expect acceleration to above 20% by the fourth quarter. As loss cost trends emerge, we will aggressively push for appropriate rate actions.\nIn homeowners, renewal written pricing of 14.4% in the quarter comprised of net rate and insured value increases outpaced underlying loss cost trends. We are very selective and actively manage our homeowners book at a state and territory level, diligently managing risk and growth with sophisticated underwriting capabilities that allow us to effectively manage new business risk selection.\nA few examples of our risk management include the action we took many years ago to stop writing new homeowners business in Florida, a conservative stance on coastal CAT risk and wildfire mitigation efforts that have yielded strong outcomes. We are on the right path in personal lines, driving towards appropriate pricing and managing exposure and growth while continuing to serve our customers with award-winning service.\nIn Group Benefits, I am pleased with both top line and bottom line performance, including an outstanding core earnings margin of 7.6%. Group disability continues to post strong results driven by favorable long-term disability incidence trends and claim recoveries. In Group Life, the loss ratio was up versus prior year. Mortality losses in the second quarter continued to run above prepandemic levels, but improved sequentially. Looking at the top line, growth was driven by book persistency above 90% plus strong year-to-date new sales. Overall, the strength of our diversified product portfolio as well as our commitment to outstanding customer experience through the use of data and technology resonates in this marketplace, giving us a leadership position.\nMoving now to investments. I want to highlight another quarter of strong performance as fixed income yields continue to trend higher with solid credit results. Beth will provide further details.\nBefore concluding, I would like to comment on the advances we continue to make in technology and the competitive advantage it brings to our businesses and distribution partners, along with a superior customer experience. At our Investor Day in November of 2021, I highlighted the significant investments we had made in our core technology platforms which were allowing us to extend our digital and data capabilities. Back then, we were already focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance execution, and today, AI is mainstream at The Hartford. The breadth and depth of our data and analytics and AI has grown into all parts of our business, and is enabling greater agility and faster decision-making while improving and streamlining the experiences of our customers and distribution partners.\nWhile some organizations talk about what they expect to do in the future, we are already doing this at scale. With several hundred AI models in production and driving business results, we believe our capabilities are leading edge. Let me give you just one example of how we are already using what we call our information advantage, fueled by advanced analytics and AI to drive results. We developed an award-winning medical record digestion and extraction tool that has transformed the way we conduct our workers' compensation business. This tool ingests and translates medical records into digital content, characterizes the data and highlights relevant information.\nIn workers' compensation, we are streamlining the adjudication process by suppressing 30% of the extraneous information contained in medical records that otherwise results in significant distraction or lost time to our claim handlers. Since inception of this tool, we have processed more than 500 million pages of medical records, and perhaps more importantly, established a foundation for next-level AI use cases across our business. When it comes to generative AI, we are actively experimenting with this technology in a highly controlled environment.\nNow Hartford understands the potential of this technology, and we believe we're at the forefront in piloting use cases that will augment the capabilities of our employees. All the transformational work we have done over the past 3 or 4 years has put us in a strong position to accelerate our market-leading competitive advantage, driven by technology, data science and our experienced workforce.\nIn closing, we have a unique portfolio of diverse, yet complementary businesses that contribute to our industry-leading returns. As we have reached the midpoint of 2023, it's a good time to reiterate our strategic priorities that we believe will continue to drive our success.\nFirst, leveraging our product breadth and competitive advantage across the P&C and Group Benefits platforms will drive profitable organic growth. Second, underwriting discipline will guide a balanced risk profile, supporting long-term book value growth. Third, we will continue to prioritize digital analytics and data science investments that enhance the customer and agent experience to improve underwriting and claims decision-making. Finally, we believe ROE is the ultimate measure of quality underwriting, execution on priorities and prudent capital deployment. As such, we will continue to focus on exceptional ROE performance. We will continue to deploy excess capital in a thoughtful manner, prioritizing shareholder return and investments in future growth. Results over several successive quarters affirm that this strategy is working. With our strong track record, we are confident in our ability to deliver core earnings ROE in the 14% to 15% range.\nNow I'll turn it over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $588 million or $1.88 per diluted share. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $493 million. Our commercial book posted a very strong quarter and first half of 2023 with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3 and and 88.4, respectively. Small Commercial continues to deliver excellent results with premium growth of 11% and an underlying combined ratio of 89.7. The quarter included higher non-CAT property losses within our package product as compared to the prior year quarter. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the entire book evidenced by the 12th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio of below 90.\nMiddle and Large commercial delivered both a record for written premium of $1 billion and an underlying combined ratio of 88.7. This was a 4.2-point improvement from the prior year including favorable non-CAT property losses and expense ratio improvement. Global Specialty's underwriting margin was a strong 85, a 1.9-point increase from a year ago, primarily due to slightly elevated losses in a runoff line with our international book and a higher expense ratio due to a business mix in Global Re and higher underwriting and technology costs.\nIn Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was $57 million with an underlying combined ratio of 101.7. Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 79.6 was in line with expectations. Auto results reflected continued liability and physical damage severity pressure. The auto underlying combined ratio was in 111.8% for the quarter which is 11.8 points higher than the prior year quarter and is 5 points above our revised expectations from April and includes 3 points related to losses in the first quarter. This increase to our expectations is attributable primarily to a higher-than-anticipated number of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims.\nFor auto liability, we recorded no net increase in prior year reserves as increases of about $60 million for accident year 2022 was offset by improvement primarily in accident years 2019 to 2021. As Chris indicated, we continue to pursue rate increases to offset the loss cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium in Personal Lines increased 6% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions. In auto, we achieved written pricing increases of 13.8% and earned pricing increases of 8.5%.\nIn homeowners, we achieved our highest written and earned pricing increases in over a decade of 14.4% written and 12.7% earned for second quarter. The expense ratio decrease of 2.7 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spend. With respect to CAF, the industry experienced another quarter of elevated losses resulting in our Property & Casualty current accident year cat losses of $226 million, which includes the impact from tornado, wind and hale events across several regions of the United States. And while catastrophe losses were significantly elevated for the industry, our results were only slightly higher than expectations. Our effective aggregation management and underwriting discipline, especially in certain higher-risk dates, helped limit our losses from conducted storms in the quarter.\nTotal net favorable P&C prior accident year development was $39 million with $38 million in Commercial Lines as reserve reductions in workers' compensation and catastrophes were partially offset by modest reserve increases and general liability assumed reinsurance and bond. In Group Benefits, core earnings in the second quarter were $133 million with a core earnings margin of 7.6%, reflecting strong premium growth and long-term disability results. The year-to-date margin of 6.4% is at the midpoint of our full year range of 6% to 7%.\nThe Group Life ratio of 84.1% increased 5.5 points versus prior year. Approximately 4 points of that increase is due to favorable prior period reserve development recorded in second quarter 2022. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher severity in the current quarter. Group disability continues to deliver strong results with a loss ratio of 67% for the quarter. The expense ratio improved 70 basis points and reflects strong top line performance and expense reductions related to The Hartford Next Initiative, somewhat offset by the continued investment in new capabilities to meet our customers' evolving needs and drive greater efficiency.\nFully insured ongoing sales in the quarter of $151 million contributed to a year-to-date sales total of $625 million. This, combined with the excellent persistency Chris noted in his comments, resulted in fully insured ongoing premium growth of 7% for second quarter. The economy remains quite resilient with solid employment levels and wage growth, both of which continue to have positive effects on the business.\nOur diversified investment portfolio produced strong results. For the quarter, net investment income was $540 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from higher interest rates. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 4% before tax, modestly higher than the first quarter. Our annualized limited partnership returns were 2.9% in the quarter. Results within the first half of 2023 were stronger than expected given the resiliency of private equity returns, and we remain on track to achieve our expected full year 2023 target of 4% to 6%.\nThe overall credit quality of the portfolio remains high with an average credit rating of A+. Given the interest in the real estate sector, we wanted to provide an update regarding that portion of our investment portfolio, which remains consistent with what we discussed in our first quarter earnings report. As we mentioned, less than 10% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is in office exposures, all of which we view to be top-tier properties.\nDuring the quarter, 2 loans were fully repaid for approximately $90 million and manageable maturities are expected in the second half of 2023 and 2024. All loans remain current with respect to principal and interest payments with no delinquencies. CMBS holdings and credit quality are also largely unchanged given lower new issuance and limited trading activity. Our high-quality non-Agency CMBS portfolio is primarily conduit focused and has limited exposure to office loans. Holdings are supported by diversified underlying pools of property and have significant credit support to absorb individual loan losses with manageable near-term maturities.\nTurning to capital management, during the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $350 million. At the end of the quarter, we have $2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. Our second quarter results demonstrate that our franchise is well positioned to deliver consistent sustained industry-leading results. We believe that we have the strategies, talent and technology in place to continue to succeed.\nI will now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Beth. Operator, we have about 30 minutes for questions, and we will take our first question."

Today, I will begin with a summary of the Hartford's first quarter results. Then Beth will dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics, after which we and our business leaders, we'll be happy to take your questions. So let's get started. We are pleased to begin the year with exceptional results in our Commercial Lines businesses and continued strong results in Group Benefits. While industry-wide trends such as elevated catastrophe losses and persistent inflationary pressure in personal auto, impacted our results. The first quarter also saw top line growth in Commercial Lines of 11%, including double-digit contributions from each business with an underlying combined ratio of 88.5%, double-digit renewal written price increases across both auto and home in Personal Lines.\nGroup Benefits fully insured premium growth of 8%, combined with strong first quarter sales and a core earnings margin of 5.2%. Solid investment results with increasing fixed income portfolio yields and strong reinvestment rates and a core earnings ROE of 14.3%, while returning $484 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter. Now let me share first quarter highlights from each of our businesses. We have strong momentum across Commercial Lines, and I expect continued online growth at highly profitable margins.\nIn addition, accelerating pricing in several lines, combined with enhanced underwriting execution, bolsters my confidence in our ability to deliver margins consistent with the 2023 outlook I provided back in February. In Small Commercial, written premiums of $1.3 billion and new business of $242 million set new records for the Hartford.\nThree years ago, we completed the launch of our enhanced best-in-class package product which we call Spectrum. Over that 3-year period, Spectrum written premium has grown significantly. For example, this quarter's written premium is nearly 40% higher than the same period 3 years ago, and new business premium is almost double over that same period. In addition, with expanded wholesale broker relationships, our excess and surplus lines finding product continues to gain momentum delivering robust growth.\nWritten premium approximately doubled from a year ago, fueled by a substantial increase in new business. In short, Small Commercial continues to deliver exceptional results with industry-leading products and digital capabilities and is on track to exceed $5 billion of annual written premium in the near term.\nIn Middle & Large Commercial, written premiums grew 10%, driven by new business growth of 23%, sustained exposure growth and solid renewal written price increases. New business submissions and hit rates were both up an average premium on sold accounts continues to increase. We are particularly pleased by the growth in property lines, a key area of focus, and we will continue to capitalize on favorable market conditions. We are committed to getting paid for the CAT and non-CAT risk reunite, setting appropriate terms and conditions in ensuring proper valuations.\nOur investments in data science capabilities, industry-leading risk segmentation and exceptional talent have contributed to healthy margins and position us well to continue driving profitable growth in this business. In Global Specialty, results were outstanding with nearly $4 billion of annual gross written premium. Our competitive position breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove a 10% increase in net written premium with significant contributions from global reinsurance. We are excited about our position in the wholesale market and the ongoing benefits from our broadened product portfolio.\nExecution has never been stronger and our enhanced underwriting capabilities are driving market share gains. Turning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal written pricing was 4.5% compared to 5.2% in the fourth quarter. Excluding workers' compensation, U.S. Standard Commercial Lines renewal written pricing rose to 8.1%, with middle-market property pricing in excess of 10%, in standard commercial auto near 7%. Workers' compensation pricing remained positive, continuing to benefit from a stronger-than-expected average wage growth.\nWithin Global Specialty, property, auto, primary casual and marine all generated strong pricing results well in excess of loss cost trends. In excess casualty, pricing is becoming more competitive while public D&O pricing remains under pressure. Within financial lines, we have been shifting our focus to private companies and management and professional liability, where market pricing and margins are more attractive while maintaining underwriting discipline in the public space. Across Commercial Lines, long-term loss cost trends in our book remains stable. And excluding workers' compensation, the margin between renewal written pricing and aggregate loss cost trends has expanded modestly.\nAs we continue to execute our strategy across Commercial Lines, I want to reiterate my confidence in our ability to manage the book through a variety of economic and market conditions with superior underwriting margins and continued premium growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Moving to Personal Lines. The auto loss cost environment is very dynamic. Across market participants, the level of continued severity increases has had a meaningful impact on industry results.\nAs a result, active management of rate filings in response to the changing landscape is paramount. We achieved renewal written price increases of 10% in the first quarter and expected to accelerate into the high teens later this year. In the first quarter, approved rate filings averaged 18.3%, more than double than the fourth quarter result of 8.3%.\nGiven the vast majority of our book has 12-month policies, it will take time for the rate increases to fully earn in. With continued elevated loss trends reported in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, we have adjusted our rate execution plan. And as a result, new business rate adequacy will build throughout the year as filings are approved.\nWe expect new business rate adequacy in most states by year-end. Overall, I am confident we have the right strategy and with focused execution, expect to achieve auto profitability targets in 2024 across the book. In homeowners, results were quite strong with renewal written pricing of 13.9% in the quarter, comprised of net rate and insured value increases, outpacing loss cost trends. Turning to Group Benefits. We're off to a strong start. Core earnings reflect a significant improvement we have seen in mortality trends versus prior year, including decreasing impacts from pandemic-related losses. Lower pandemic-related mortality is a welcome and encouraging trend. While it is still too early to reach firm conclusions on long-term mortality trends, we expect they will settle above pre-pandemic levels in our pricing business accordingly.\nWe continue to measure the effects of the pandemic and believe we are well prepared to adjust course as necessary. In disability, our capabilities are market-leading, and we remain positive on the performance and outlook of our book. Looking at new business. sales of $474 million were up $85 million over prior year. This was our second highest sales quarter ever. Importantly, we are competing effectively across all market segments from swaps to the largest U.S. enterprises.\nAs a group benefits market leader, we are well positioned to capitalize on rapidly evolving customer requirements for absence management, group life and supplemental health products and services. We continue to strengthen our reputation for customer service with an extensive suite of tools for HR platform integration, member enrollment, process simplification and analytics.\nEmployers are more focused than ever on the needs of their employees and our products and services are a key component of that value proposition. Moving now to investments. The portfolio continues to support the Hartford's financial and strategic objectives while performing well across a range of asset classes and economic cycles. Stephanie will provide further details, and I would highlight that as another quarter of solid net investment income with negligible impairments. Recognizing that commercial real estate is topical, let me take a minute moment on our approach to that market. We have dedicated teams of experienced professionals with a long and successful track record of investing in the commercial real estate sector. We believe the market provides attractive yields and risk-adjusted returns while providing a source of diversification to our investment portfolio.\nWe have approximately $6 billion of commercial mortgage loans, primarily consisting of multifamily and industrial holdings with less than 10% invested in commercial office. We regularly review our property valuation for the impact of lower occupancy levels, higher cap rates, and the impact of rising interest rates. These assessments give us confidence the portfolio will continue to perform well through the economic cycle. While perhaps a bit distinct from other property and casualty peers, we believe these holding an attractive alternative to investment-grade corporate credit as they provide approximately 80 to 100 basis points of additional spread over [ like ] rated corporates.\nIn closing, as we look ahead, we anticipate continued growth and strong margins across our businesses. Our financial performance demonstrates the power of the franchise, the depth of our distribution relationships and our commitment to superior customer experience, and excellent execution by our 19,000 employees. With these competitive advantages, I remain confident that we can continue to deliver superior results. The Hartford has never been better positioned to deliver industry-leading financial performance, highlighted by a core earnings ROE range of [ 13 ]% to 15%, while creating value for all stakeholders.\nNow let me turn it over to Beth to provide more commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $536 million or $1.68 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.3%. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $436 million with an underlying combined ratio of 88.5%, in line with our expectations for the first quarter which was embedded in the full year outlook provided in February. Small Commercial continued to deliver excellent results with an underlying combined ratio of 89.5. The first quarter included higher non-cat property losses compared to unusually low losses in the prior year quarter and a modestly higher loss ratio in workers' compensation as expected.\nThis is the 11th straight quarter of an underlying combined ratio of below 90. Middle & Large Commercial delivered a record 89.9, a 1.6 point improvement from the prior year due to favorable non-cat property losses and expense improvements.\nGlobal Specialties underlying margin improved 3 points from a year ago to an outstanding 85.2, which benefited from lower international losses and an improved expense ratio. In Personal Lines, core loss for the quarter was $187,000 with an underlying combined ratio of 97. Homeowners underlying combined ratio of 78.9 was in line with [ patients ]. Auto results reflected continued liability and physical damage severity pressure driven by, among other things, elevated repair costs, increased car valuation and a modest uptick in attorney representation rate.\nThe auto underlying combined ratio was approximately 12 points higher than the prior year quarter, which is about 5.5 points above our expectations. As we progress through the first quarter, we began to see indications that there was a pronounced step change in loss activity. The first signal of this was in our February data. And at that time, we did not view this as a sustained trend but an area to watch. As we monitored loss activity in March, claim frequency remained in line with our expectations but we observed additional pressure of claim severities for both the current accident quarter and accident year 2022.\nFor example, with respect to our physical damage coverages, we observed a lengthening time to repair vehicles and an increase in the mix of total losses versus repairable. For bodily injury coverages, we continue to experience a mix shift to more severe accidents. Taking all this data into consideration, we booked the current quarter at an underlying combined ratio of 105.1. We also recorded prior year development of $20 million related to accident year 2022 auto physical damage losses, which was primarily related to fourth quarter activity.\nFor auto liability, we recorded no net increase in prior year reserves as elevated activity in 2022 was offset by improvement in accident years 2021 and prior. As Chris indicated, the team continues to file for rate increases to offset the loss cost trends we are experiencing. Written premium and personal lines increased 6% over the prior year, driven by steady and successful rate actions.\nThe expense ratio decrease of 1.1 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spend. With respect to CAT, there were over 20 PCS-designated events this quarter, resulting in Property & Casualty current accident year CAT losses of $185 million which includes the impact from significant winter storms along the East and West Coast and tornado wind and hail events across several regions of the United States.\nTotal net prior accident year development was essentially zero as reserve reductions in workers' compensation and package business were offset by reserve increases in auto physical damage and general liability. Workers' compensation reserves were reduced primarily in Small Commercial, driven by favorable claim severity experience and a $20 million reduction in COVID-related reserves from the 2020 accident year.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the first quarter of $90 million and the 5.2% core earnings margin reflect lower group life and disability loss ratios and growth in fully insured premiums. As a reminder, from a seasonality perspective, we tend to experience higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter, so we would expect the margins lower than our full year estimate.\nEarnings for the quarter benefited from a 12-point reduction in the group life loss ratio, reflecting improvement in the mortality trend as the prior year loss ratio was significantly impacted by the pandemic. Also positively impacting earnings for the quarter was a 2.8 point improvement in the disability loss ratio due to favorable long-term disability incidents.\nFully insured ongoing premium growth was 8%, reflecting growth from existing customers as well as strong persistency and new business sales. Premium growth also benefited from continued strong employment trends as well as our focus on enhancing the enrollment experience of our customers. Our diversified investment portfolio produced solid results amidst financial sector volatility. For the quarter, net investment income was $515 million.\nOur fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from interest rates. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 3.8% before tax, modestly higher than the fourth quarter. Our annualized limited partnership returns were 2.5% in the quarter. These returns were slightly better than we had estimated as private equity annualized returns of 9% partially offset negative returns in our real estate portfolio, given fund valuations and the absence of underlying property sales as we expected. Looking forward, while it is still early in the quarter, we believe second quarter LP results will be similar to first quarter.\nThe overall credit quality of the portfolio remained high with an average credit rating of A+. Given the interest in real estate holdings and baking exposure, we have provided additional information in the appendix of our earnings slide deck. We had less than $600,000 in holdings in the 3 failed regional banks primarily through index investing, and we had no Credit Suisse AT1s. As you can see in the disclosures provided, we own approximately $6 billion of commercial mortgage loans, which are concentrated in multifamily, industrial and grocery-anchored centers with limited office exposure.\nOur portfolio is focused on high-growth geographic areas. Average LTV is 52%. And importantly, we have stressed our properties for lower valuations and are comfortable that the '23 and '24 maturities are manageable. We also own $3.3 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities. These holdings are secured by a diverse pool of properties with significant levels of subordination. We complete underlying loan level analysis for these holdings and also expect '23 and '24 maturities will be manageable.\nTurning to capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares for $350 million. As of the end of the quarter, we have $2.4 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024. We recognize the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, but we are well positioned to deliver consistent, sustained industry-leading results. Our success is a direct result of our steadfast operational excellence. I will now turn it back to Susan."

My name is Alex, and I'll be the moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Susan Spivak with The Hartford Group. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on fourth quarter 2022 earnings.

Replays of this forecast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today. Today, I will start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and accomplishments. Then I will turn the call over to Beth to dive deeper into our financial performance and key metrics. After which, I will close our prepared remarks with a review of expectations for 2023. We will then be joined by our business leaders as we move into Q&A.\nSo let's get started. The Hartford is pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter, capping an outstanding year of financial performance and progress against our strategic objectives. Quarter after quarter, we are delivering strong financial results, demonstrating the power of the franchise and the depth of our distribution relationships. Our commitment to superior customer experience, the benefits of significant investments made over the last few years and superb execution by our 19,000 employees drive our success.\nThese competitive advantages helped us deliver exceptional results in 2022, including: Core earnings growth of 14% with core EPS growth of 23%; top line growth in Commercial Lines of 11%, with an underlying combined ratio of 88.3%; Group Benefits fully insured premium growth of 6%, with a core earnings margin of 6.5%; strong investment results with excellent limited partnership returns and increasing fixed income portfolio yields; and core earnings ROE of 14.4% while returning $2.1 billion of excess capital to shareholders. Looking forward, with strong momentum across all lines, I am confident we can continue to deliver superior results.\nNow let me share a few highlights from each of our businesses. In Commercial Lines, written premium growth for the year was driven by strong exposure growth, pricing increases, higher policy retention and continued strong new business. Underlying margins improved by nearly 1 point driven by earned pricing, exceeding loss cost trends across most lines and growing expense leverage driven in large part by our Hartford Next program.\nAcross Commercial Lines, our brand, depth of distribution and enhanced underwriting capabilities, combined with excellent customer experience, have positioned us well to capture market share while maintaining or improving already strong margins. Small Commercial results continue to be exceptional, consistently producing sub-90 underlying combined ratios with industry-leading products and digital capability, all of which drove record-breaking written premium and new business levels in 2022.\nGoing forward, Small Commercial will remain a growth engine for The Hartford. For example, beyond our traditional product lines, we will continue to expand our addressable market with capabilities in the excess and surplus binding lines. This portion of the E&S business is about an $8 billion market serving small business owners' property and liability exposures. With current written premiums exceeding $100 million and the evolving innovative capabilities within our broker quoting platform, we expect to become a leading destination for E&S binding opportunities and a strong complement to our existing admitted retail offering.\nIn Middle & Large Commercial, our team has done a tremendous job improving underlying margins by approximately 7 points since 2019 with a written premium compounded growth rate of 6% over the same period. In 2022, written premiums grew 10% for the year with improved policy retention and solid new business. Advancements in data science capabilities, industry-leading pricing and segmentation analytics and exceptional talent have delivered healthy margins, which I believe positions us well to continue driving profitable growth in this business.\nIn Global Specialty, I'm extremely pleased with the team's accomplishments since the strategic acquisition in 2019. Their tireless efforts have enabled us to meaningfully increase the size and scale of our specialty business to $3.6 billion of gross written premium, including over $800 million of E&S premium. We are leveraging the Global Specialty franchise to further grow and expand our capabilities across Commercial Lines in this $82 billion E&S market.\nGlobal Specialty results in 2022 were outstanding, with an underlying margin of 84.6%, improving over 4 points from prior year and over 11 points from 2019, demonstrating our execution tenacity, enhanced underwriting tools and the expertise of the team. Our competitive position, breadth of products and solid renewal written pricing drove a 9% increase in gross written premium for the year, including 41% in our global reinsurance business, 19% in ocean marine and 27% in international casualty.\nTurning to pricing. Commercial Lines renewal written price increases for the quarter were 4.9%, flat compared to the third quarter. Underneath, U.S. standard Commercial Lines renewal written pricing, excluding workers' compensation, accelerated from the third quarter to 7.9%, up 1 point, primarily driven by auto and property lines. Workers' compensation pricing remained positive, benefiting from average wage growth.\nWithin Global Specialty, excluding public company D&O, renewal written pricing remained stable in the mid-single digits, and in aggregate, in line with loss cost trends. Wholesale property, auto, primary casualty, all saw higher pricing increases over the third quarter, as did U.S. and international marine. Additionally, the public D&O market continues to be competitive with rate pressures, which requires new business discipline and a focus on retaining profitable current accounts.\nMoving to Personal Lines. Pricing has accelerated across auto and home, resulting in written premium growth of 4% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. Like others in the industry, auto underlying combined ratios remained elevated as we continue to experience inflationary pressure. We have been actively responding with rate filings throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, filed auto rates averaged 8.3% increase, up 3.4 points from the third quarter. In homeowners, we have kept pace with loss cost trends through net rate in insured value increases reflected in renewal written pricing of 10.7% for the year and 13.3% through the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings margin of 8.3% for the quarter and 6.5% for the full year represent significant increases from last year as excess mortality has materially declined. Meanwhile, long-term disability trends are stable and within our expectations for incident rates and recoveries. Fully insured sales for 2022 were $801 million, up 5%. And employer group persistency was approximately 92%, a strong result for the year. First quarter is off to an excellent start with persistency modestly higher and outstanding new sales results.\nWe expect the Group Benefits marketplace to remain dynamic as digital transformation, product innovation and customer demands accelerate. As a result, we are making significant investments today and have a clear road map for the future that I am confident will only strengthen our market leadership position going forward.\nNow I will turn the call over to Beth to provide more detailed commentary on the quarter.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter were $746 million or $2.31 per diluted share with a 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.4%.\nIn Commercial Lines, core earnings were $562 million. Written premium was up 9%, reflecting written pricing increases and exposure growth, along with an 18% increase in new business in Small Commercial and 6% in Middle Market. Policy count retention also increased in Small and Middle Market.\nThe underlying combined ratio of 87.4 improved from the prior year fourth quarter with both a lower loss ratio and expense ratio. Small Commercial continues to deliver superior operating results with an underlying combined ratio of 87.5. And Middle & Large Commercial delivered a solid 90.2. Global Specialty's underlying margin improved 5.8 points from a year ago to an outstanding 83 as it benefited from strong earned pricing increases.\nIn Personal Lines, core earnings for the quarter were $42 million. The underlying combined ratio was 96.2, reflecting continued auto liability and physical damage severity pressure driven by elevated repair costs as well as increased bodily injury trends and includes 2 points of losses related to prior quarters in 2022.\nWritten premium grew 4% for the quarter, largely reflecting pricing increases in both auto and home. In home, overall loss results were in line with our expectations. Non-CAT weather frequency continues to run favorable to long-term averages, and together with the effect of earned pricing increases, mitigates material and labor costs which remain at historically high levels. The expense ratio decrease of 3.5 points was primarily driven by lower marketing spend.\nCurrent accident year CAT losses in the quarter were $135 million, which includes the benefit of a $68 million reduction in estimates from catastrophes that occurred during the first 3 quarters of 2022, including $31 million related to Hurricane Ian. Winter Storm Elliott losses were $167 million net of reinsurance, of which, $150 million was in Commercial Lines.\nTotal net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings was $46 million, primarily related to reserve reductions in workers' compensation, catastrophes and bonds, partially offset by reserve increases in general liability and commercial auto.\nWe completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve study in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $229 million increase in reserves comprised of $162 million for asbestos and $67 million for environmental. All of the $229 million was ceded to the adverse development cover, leaving $256 million of limit remaining. The increase in asbestos reserves was primarily due to an increase in the cost of resolving asbestos filings and a modest increase in the company's share of loss on a few specific individual accounts. The increase in environmental reserves was mainly due to an increase in the estimate for PFAS exposures, one large account settlement and higher estimated site remediation costs.\nBefore turning to Group Benefits, I would like to review the January 1 reinsurance renewals. Overall, we are very pleased with placements and terms and conditions for our programs against the backdrop of a challenging renewal season. Our per occurrence and aggregate property catastrophe protection were renewed at an approximate 20% increase in cost and 28% on a risk-adjusted basis, which based on publicly available information compared favorably with overall market increases and speaks to the quality of our book of business and favorable experience.\nOverall, the structure of our property CAT program did not change significantly. We increased the attachment point on the $200 million aggregate cover to $750 million, up from $700 million. There were also some changes in the treaty that provides coverage for certain loss events under $350 million. We have summarized these changes in the slide deck.\nIn addition to our property catastrophe program, we also successfully renewed several other reinsurance treaties, which also experienced rate increases with limited changes in terms and conditions. The rates we charge insureds already have been incorporating these higher costs, and therefore, we do not expect any significant adverse combined ratio impact from these renewals.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings in the fourth quarter of $141 million and the 8.3% core earnings margin reflect a lower level of excess mortality losses and growth in fully insured premium. The disability loss ratio improved 6.1 points from the prior year quarter, which had elevated estimated long-term disability incidence trends.\nIn addition, COVID-19-related short-term disability losses were lower this quarter. All-cause excess mortality was $43 million before tax compared to $161 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The group life loss ratio, excluding excess mortality, increased 4.7 points primarily due to higher accidental death losses as compared to very favorable experience in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nTurning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings were $39 million, reflecting lower daily average AUM primarily due to equity market declines and higher interest rates over the past 12 months.\nAnd lastly, investment results were strong in the quarter with net investment income of $640 million. Our fixed income portfolio is continuing to benefit from the higher interest rate environment. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 3.7% before tax, a 40 basis point increase in the third quarter. We anticipate our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnership returns, will increase by approximately 50 to 60 basis points in 2023 compared to the full year 2022 before tax yield of 3.2%.\nOur partnership returns of 16.8% in the fourth quarter and 14.4% for full year 2022 were exceptional. Performance was primarily driven by income from opportunistic sales within our commercial real estate JV equity portfolio which generated annualized returns of 31% in the fourth quarter. Our private equity holdings were also resilient, delivering a 7% annualized return in the quarter. For the full year, real estate generated a 22% return and private equity generated a 14% return.\nAs we enter 2023, we expect continued volatility in markets. Given outlooks for a slowdown in consumer consumption, corporate investment and M&A activity, we expect our private equity returns to be below our long-term target. At the same time, the increase in financing costs and the reduced availability of real estate financing is expected to impact sales activity in our real estate JV equity. With this backdrop, we expect a 4% to 6% return for partnership and other alternative investments in 2023.\nTurning to capital. As of December 31, holding company resources totaled $1 billion. For 2023, we expect dividends from the operating companies, of $1.5 billion from P&C, $400 million from Group Benefits and $125 million from Hartford Funds.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares for $350 million. As of the end of the year, we have $2.75 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization through December 31, 2024.\nTo wrap up, our businesses performed strongly in 2022, and we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns and enhance value for all our stakeholders.\nI will now turn it back to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Beth. Let's take it forward, where I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2023. Underpinning the outlook is our commitment to disciplined underwriting and expanding or maintaining margins while prudently growing our book of business.\nIn 2023, we are expecting a Commercial Line's underlying combined ratio in the range of 87 to 89. Total renewal written price increases in Commercial Lines, excluding workers' compensation, are expected to be fairly stable compared with 2022. Meaningful increases in standard commercial property, auto and general liability pricing are somewhat offset with competitive pricing headwinds in parts of our financial lines business. In our Global Reinsurance book, we expect meaningful written price increases, including over 30% for U.S. and European product coverage. Commercial loss cost trends are expected to remain fairly stable with some moderation in property severity as inflation is expected to ease during the second half of the year.\nBefore I get into specific trends for our market-leading workers' compensation business, let me remind you of its current margin strength and stellar contribution to our overall Commercial Line results.\nLooking back over the last 25 years, our loss ratio results have outperformed the industry on average by approximately 5 points, reflecting our significant competitive advantages in pricing sophistication, underwriting analytics and claim management. In addition, our scale and wealth of data allow us to anticipate, identify and quickly react to emerging trends as we manage retention and growth in this line.\nOver the past 10 years, our standard Commercial Lines workers' compensation book has produced combined ratios averaging near 90, while our premier Small Commercial book has performed even better with an average combined ratios in the mid-80s. Also impressive is the 6-point underlying loss ratio improvement since 2019 in Middle Market, accomplished by equipping our underwriters with advanced risk segmentation tools. We expect workers' compensation to remain a highly profitable business and an important earnings contributor to The Hartford.\nTurning to a few specifics in our forecast. Workers' compensation renewal written pricing, which is comprised of net rate and average wage growth, is projected to be flat to slightly negative. Loss costs are expected to be up slightly as long-term frequency and severity selections remain unchanged from 2022. We will continue to use our market-leading tools and underwriting expertise in risk selection and book management to minimize any margin compression. In 2023, we expect workers' compensation returns to remain attractive, with deterioration equating to roughly 0.5 point on the Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio.\nIn summary, for Commercial Lines, we are extremely confident in our ability to manage our book through a variety of economic and market environments. An underlying combined ratio within a range of 87 to 89 will be an outstanding result and reflects our ability to execute consistently and deliver superior margins.\nTurning to Personal Lines. We expect a 2023 underlying combined ratio in the range of 93 to 95. In auto, renewal written price is expected to accelerate into the mid-teens by the second quarter and remain there for the balance of the year. By midyear, we expect new business to be price-adequate. Loss cost trends, primarily driven by severity, are expected to remain elevated during the first half of the year before returning to more normal levels in the second half. In homeowners, we expect earned pricing to generally keep pace with loss cost trends throughout 2023.\nAs we navigate this inflationary period across Personal Lines, we are focused on balancing rate adequacy, quality of new business and marketing productivity. Overall, I am confident we have the right execution plans to return this business to targeted profitability in 2024.\nIn Group Benefits, we expect the 2023 core earnings margin to be between 6% and 7%, consistent with our long-term margin outlook of the business. With COVID shifting from pandemic to endemic state, excess mortality losses are expected to improve versus 2022. However, we expect mortality trends will settle above prepandemic levels, and we are pricing business accordingly. All in, group life loss ratios are expected to improve versus 2022. And in group disability, we expect some moderation of recent favorable incidence and recovery trends.\nBefore closing, I'd like to share a few recent ESG achievements. This year, The Hartford will be honored as 1 of 2 global Catalyst Award winners for advances we have made in diversity, equity and inclusion. The Catalyst Award is the premier recognition of organizational DE&I efforts driving representation and inclusion for women. The Hartford was also named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and to America's Most Just Companies list for 2023, having earned both honors every year since their inception. The recognition we continue to receive is a testament to our long-standing commitment to sustainability and the dedication and hard work of our teams.\nIn closing, let me summarize why I'm so bullish about the future for our shareholders.\nOne, our 2022 financial results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the benefits of continued investments in our business, resulting in strong growth and margins in Commercial Lines, Group Benefits operating at targeted returns and a Personal Lines business tracking back to target margins.\nTwo, we have the capability to sustain superior returns as a result of our performance-driven culture, outstanding underwriting and pricing execution, exceptional talent and innovative customer-centric technology.\nThree, investment income is increasing, supported by a diversified portfolio of assets. And credit quality remains healthy.\nAnd finally, we are proactively managing our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders.\nAll these factors contribute to my excitement and confidence about the future of The Hartford. Our franchise has never been better positioned to deliver industry-leading financial performance with a core earnings ROE range of 14% to 15% while creating value for all our stakeholders.\nLet me now turn the call over to Susan for Q&A.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you. Operator, we have about 30 minutes for questions. Could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?"

Thank you for attending today's The Hartford Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Alex, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Susan Spivak, with The Hartford Group. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on third quarter 2022 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our website. For the call today, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Elliot, President. Following their prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A period.\nJust a final few comments before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update information or forward-looking statements provided on this call.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us.\nThe Hartford produced a strong third quarter with core earnings of $471 million or $1.44 per diluted share which includes the impact of Hurricane Ian and the ongoing effects of a dynamic macroeconomic environment. Before discussing our results in detail, I wanted to extend our thoughts and prayers to all those impacted by Hurricane Ian, a powerful and devastating storm. It is in moments like this that I am especially proud of our Hartford's Claims team. To date, we have inspected approximately 95% of all claims submitted and had issued initial payments on 50% of those claims. Over the coming months, our team will continue to work tirelessly to help all our customers affected by the storm.\nNearly a year ago at our Investor Day, we told you how confident I was in our portfolio, capabilities, expertise, talent, and our ability to deliver consistent and sustainable returns. As we look back, the clearest proof point that our strategy is working is our financial performance. In the first 9 months of 2022, we delivered core earnings growth of 18% and core EPS growth of 27%, top line growth in Commercial Lines of 12%. At Commercial, underlying combined ratio of 88.6, a Group Benefits core earnings margin of 5.9%. We returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders and yesterday announced a 10% dividend increase. And we also produced a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.3%.\nThese are terrific results that reflect The Hartford's performance-based culture and demonstrate why despite the continued headwinds of inflation and economic uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to continue to execute at a high level.\nIn Commercial Lines, we remain disciplined and prudent in establishing loss picks. We continue to have approximately 100 basis points of spread between renewal written pricing and loss trends excluding workers' compensation. Our Small Commercial results continue to be exceptional. Next-gen Spectrum, our market-leading business owners product, is fueling much of our new business success as we gain market share at very favorable margins.\nThe digital customer experience we provide in Small Commercial is a significant competitive advantage for customers, agents and brokers as it provides a fast, intuitive and efficient platform for doing business. The most recent small commercial Keynova study ranks us #1 in digital capabilities for the fourth consecutive year. Our score climbed 4 points and we are now 20 points higher than our closest competitor.\nMiddle & Large Commercial is benefiting tremendously from the combination of deep industry specialization and product breadth, leading to new business growth and improving loss and retention ratios. We are confident that our data science, pricing segmentation and claims execution will continue to support underwriting discipline.\nIn Global Specialty, results are outstanding. Underwriting margins have improved materially over the last 3 years. Execution has never been stronger and the enhanced underwriting expertise we bring to the market is strengthening our competitive position and driving market share gains.\nIn Personal Lines, we continue to take pricing actions as higher inflation impacts results. As Doug will describe, we continue to file for increasing rate changes across our book to restore profitability. Overall, I am confident we have the right strategy and execution in Personal Lines.\nTurning to Group Benefits. In the quarter, core earnings were $117 million, with a margin of 7.2% reflecting lower excess mortality and strong disability results. Long-term disability trends are stable and within our expectations for incidence rates and recoveries. Modestly higher expenses reflect increased investments in capabilities, including digital, claims automation and administrative platforms.\nFully insured ongoing premiums were up 6% compared with the third quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in exposure on existing accounts as well as strong persistency in sales. Fully insured ongoing sales were $106 million in the quarter, up 29%, with increases in both group disability and group life.\nIn many ways, the fundamentals of the Group Benefits business are stronger than prior to the pandemic. Product awareness is greater as both employers and employees are highly engaged on benefit offerings, with growing demand for supplemental products. This is an opportunity for us to deliver higher value and create a differentiated experience for our customers. And lastly, investment results were healthy in the quarter and are beginning to reflect the rising rate environment, which we'll earn in more meaningfully in 2023.\nTaking a step back, I want to touch upon some overarching themes. First, the impact of inflationary pressures and changing weather patterns on pricing and loss cost. Second, the positive impacts of the current interest rate environment. And third, the importance of a healthy and balanced insurance regulatory system that ensures stability and predictability for all.\nAs we have discussed over the last several quarters across the industry, carriers are dealing with elevated inflation related to goods, services and most components used in manufacturing. These inflationary pressures are likely to remain as the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy and despite some early signs of reduced demand and economic output.\nAt the same time, changing weather patterns continue to drive increased frequency of events and associated claims severity. While there is no silver bullet to fix this problem, ongoing efforts to build more resilient homes, communities and commercial properties needs to be an ongoing focus of policymakers, insurers, agents and carriers. Taken together, these trends point to the need to maintain underwriting discipline and ensure pricing keeps pace with loss trends and reserving assumptions. As long as these trends continue, rates will need to rise and in some cases, will reaccelerate pricing increases over the near to medium term.\nThe Hartford is committed to maintaining price discipline, and we have clearly communicated to all our underwriters the need to expand or maintain margins, ex workers' comp, while prudently growing our book of business. Because interest rates are expected to remain elevated, we anticipate our portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, will increase by approximately 50 to 60 basis points in 2023 compared to full year 2022, which will benefit earnings.\nFinally, on the regulatory front, our state-based system of insurance regulation has generally served customers and the industry well, although at times, has experienced instability in certain jurisdictions and across certain product lines. At its core, the mission of insurance regulation is to protect consumers while ensuring a stable market, one that fosters market competition and safeguards carrier solvency.\nBalancing these 2 aspects of the regulatory mission is critical to ensuring widely available and affordable insurance. Recently, we have seen instances where regulation has become politicized, creating instability in the market and upsetting the balance the regulatory system is designed to achieve. We call on policymakers to respect the insurance regulatory framework, take the necessary steps to address rising legal system abuse, rate inadequacy and persistent underinsured exposures while working with the industry to support a well-functioning marketplace where insurers get the coverage they need and carriers secure an appropriate return for the risk they undertake. As a company, whose purpose is to underwrite human achievement, The Hartford stands ready to engage on these issues actively and constructively.\nBefore I close, last month, we announced the retirement of Doug Elliot as The Hartford's President at the end of the year. Beth and I have worked together with Doug and the entire Hartford team over the past decade to transform The Hartford and build the foundation for our company's future success. Doug was instrumental in expanding our product -- suite of products, developing industry-specific verticals within our Property & Casualty business, overseeing the integration of The Navigators Group and elevating our underwriting excellence.\nThanks to Doug's strong leadership, The Hartford is well positioned for profitable growth in the years ahead as we build on the momentum created to best serve all of our agents and brokers and customers. I want to thank Doug for his many contributions to our company. Thank you, Doug.\nDoug leaves us many gifts, including a seasoned group of executives who are going to continue our high-level performance. I have tremendous confidence in the talents, skills and focus of this leadership team.\nIn closing, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. These results demonstrate our strategy and the investments we have made in our businesses have established The Hartford as a proven and consistent performer. We have outstanding execution capabilities and exceptional talent that drives my confidence in our ability to continue to produce superior returns.\nWe are managing the investment portfolio prudently and all holdings are well balanced across diversified asset classes. And we are proactively managing our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders. All these factors underpin my confidence that we will continue to meet or exceed our core earnings ROE objectives.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris.\nCore earnings for the quarter were $471 million or $1.44 per diluted share with a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 14.3%. Before reviewing the results by segment, I will cover the impacts in the quarter of catastrophes and specifically, Hurricane Ian. We recognized catastrophe losses of $293 million with Hurricane Ian losses of $214 million. In Commercial Lines, Ian losses were $133 million, including $35 million in Global Re. In Personal Lines, losses were $81 million, of which about 72% were auto losses, which reflects our market share in the regions impacted as well as a higher average loss per claim due in part to inflationary pressures.\nMoving on to segment results. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $363 million and written premium growth was 10%, reflecting written pricing increases and exposure growth along with an increase in new business in Small and Middle & Large Commercial as well as increased policy count retention in Small Commercial. The underlying combined ratio of 89.3 was up 2.1 points from the prior year third quarter, primarily due to several non-catastrophe property losses.\nIn Personal Lines, core loss of $28 million and the underlying combined ratio was 95.9, reflecting continued increased severity in both auto and homeowners partially offset by earned pricing increases and a lower expense ratio in both lines. P&C prior accident year reserve development was a net favorable $53 million with workers' compensation being the largest contributor.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $117 million and a 7.2% core earnings margin reflects a lower level of excess mortality losses and growth in fully insured premiums. The disability loss ratio was flat to the prior year quarter, reflecting lower COVID-19-related short-term disability losses. And in long-term disability, higher estimates of claim recoveries were more than offset by less favorable incidence trends compared to the prior year quarter, but in line with our expectations.\nAll-cause excess mortality was $26 million before tax compared to $212 million in the prior year quarter. The $26 million included $14 million with days of loss in the third quarter and $12 million of losses related to prior quarters.\nTurning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings were $47 million, reflecting lower daily average AUM, which decreased primarily due to equity market declines and higher interest rates. Net investment income was $487 million. The annualized limited partnership return was 6.3% in the quarter. We have been very pleased with the performance of LPs in the first 9 months of the year and expect the full year return to be at or above the high end of our 8% to 10% range.\nThe total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 3.3% before tax, a 30 basis point increase in the second quarter, and we expect another 10 to 20 basis point improvement in the fourth quarter. The investment portfolio credit quality remains strong with an average rating of A+. During the quarter, we recognized minor losses on sales of fixed maturities as we reduced portfolio duration and modestly reduced risk in the portfolio. So while interest rates and capital markets may remain volatile, we are confident that our high-quality and well-diversified portfolio will continue to support our financial goals and objectives.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares for $350 million. As of September 30, we have $3.1 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We were also pleased to announce a 10% increase in our common quarterly dividend payable on January 4. This is the 10th increase in the dividend in the last decade and another proof point of the consistent capital generation of the company.\nIn summary, we had strong performance in the first 9 months of the year and believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns. I will now turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas Graham Elliot\n\nPresident, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Beth, and good morning, everyone.\nAcross our Property & Casualty business, we continue to be well positioned to sustain industry-leading financial performance. The strength of our broad product portfolio and underwriting execution are evident in our excellent year-to-date top line growth of 9% and sub-90 underlying combined ratio. In addition, the relative size of our Ian loss is further proof of that underwriting discipline.\nIn Commercial Lines, we achieved double-digit written premium growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, and underlying results remain strong even with some volatility in our non-CAT, non-weather property results. Diving deeper into third quarter growth, U.S. Standard Commercial Lines written pricing, excluding workers' compensation, was up about 0.5 point to 6.7%. Pricing increases in auto and property correspond with comparable inflationary increases. And in the coming months, we may see further improved pricing in these lines. Workers' compensation pricing remained positive, benefiting from wage rate growth.\nWithin Global Specialty, rate for the quarter of 3.2% was down about 2 points from the second quarter driven primarily by excess public D&O. For most of Global Specialty lines, pricing was in the mid to high single digits and in the aggregate, ahead of loss trends with very strong accident year results.\nAs Chris highlighted, in total for Commercial, excluding workers' compensation, renewal written pricing is still about 100 basis points above long-term loss trends. In addition to positive pricing, Commercial Lines top line growth benefited from strong new business in Small Commercial and Middle Market, up 15% and 8%, respectively. Our industry-leading products and digital capabilities within Small Commercial continued to drive excellent organic growth as evidenced by a terrific $190 million new business quarter.\nRetention remains strong across markets and continued audit premium momentum from customer payroll growth was another bright spot. Within Small Commercial, as further evidence of our broadened appetite, we're particularly proud of the capabilities we're building in the excess and surplus line space. By the end of this year, written premiums will likely exceed $100 million. Going forward, we expect to become a leading destination for binding opportunities, a strong complement to our existing retail offering.\nIn addition, we're leveraging Small Commercial's underwriting and digital expertise to capture lower-complexity business in both Middle Market and Global Specialty and expect to take advantage of the growing technological developments implemented by our top brokers.\nTurning to the loss ratio. Results were largely in line with our range of expectations. In property, coming off a favorable third quarter of 2021, fire loss frequency was a bit elevated in the quarter. With respect to workers' compensation, indemnity severity remains in line with wage rate growth and actual medical severity trends are well within our long-term assumption of 5%. Our liability lines continue to perform consistent with our expectations, and we are dialed in on social and economic inflation trends.\nClosing out the Commercial discussion, I'm really pleased with the results we posted this quarter. Small Commercial continues to deliver superior operating results. Global Specialty's underwriting -- underlying margins improved 2.4 points from a year ago to a strong 84.5, and Middle & Large Commercial delivered a solid 93.7. We move into the fourth quarter from a position of financial strength, both in terms of accident year performance and balance sheet adequacy.\nLet's switch gears and move to Personal Lines. Our third quarter underlying combined ratio of 95.9 reflects continued auto physical damage severity pressure driven by elevated repair costs related to supply chain and higher labor rates. In response to those loss trends, we have been increasing pricing since the fourth quarter of last year to ensure rate adequacy and overall profitability.\nAuto rate filings have averaged mid-single digits through the first 9 months of this year with renewal pricing of 5% in the quarter, up 1 point from second quarter. Filed rates will move to double digits during the fourth quarter, and we expect mid-teens for the first half of 2023.\nIn home, overall loss results were in line with our expectations. Non-CAT weather frequency continues to run favorable to long-term averages, mitigating material and labor costs, which remain at historically high levels. We continue taking written pricing actions with home at nearly 12% for the quarter.\nTurning to production. Written premium grew 5% for the quarter, largely reflecting pricing increases from both auto and home. Auto policies in force were flat to the third quarter of 2021 and up 1% from this year's 2Q. We will be prudent with growth, balancing rate adequacy, quality of new business and marketing productivity.\nBefore I close, let me share with you a few thoughts about our recent participation in the Annual CIAB conference. Common feedback centered on the complementary strategies across our businesses, strong cross-sell execution and excellent risk collaboration. Our position and engagement with the top brokers has never been stronger, and there are many exciting initiatives underway as our teams pursue deeper penetration with these partners.\nIn closing, I remain bullish about the future of our Property & Casualty business. As I shared with you last quarter, my confidence comes from our broadened and responsive product portfolio, the enhanced underwriting and data analytic capabilities we've built and our state-of-the-art technology and digital tools.\nAs I leave the organization at the end of this year, I could not be prouder of the nearly 12 years I've spent here at The Hartford. I am confident my teammates are well prepared to successfully tackle the challenges ahead while delivering consistent, industry-leading profitable growth. I look forward to watching their success in the coming years.\nLet me now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. Operator, we are ready to take our first question."

Thank you for attending today's The Hartford second quarter earnings call. My name is Jaquita. I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Susan Spivak with The Hartford Group. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on second quarter 2022 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our website. For the call today, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Elliot, President. Following their prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A period.\nJust a few comments before Chris begins. Today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could be materially different. We do not assume any obligation to update information or forward-looking statements provided on this call. Investors should also consider the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements. A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings.\nOur commentary today include non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings as well as in the news release and financial supplement.\nFinally, please note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without The Hartford's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong performance which demonstrates that our strategy and investments we have made in our businesses have established The Hartford as a proven and consistent performer. Core earnings for the quarter were $714 million or $2.15 per diluted share.\nBook value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $52.12, and our 12-month core earnings ROE was an outstanding 14%. During the quarter, we were pleased to return $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends. With our outlook for continued strong financial performance and capital generation, the Board has authorized a new share repurchase program of $3 billion, effective August 1, 2022, through year-end 2024.\nTogether, our strategy, superior execution and prudent capital management demonstrate The Hartford's commitment to long-term value creation through sustained profitable growth, continued investment in our businesses and return of excess capital to shareholders. We are producing excellent results in a very dynamic macroeconomic environment. As we look forward to the second half of 2022, while there are some mixed economic signals, combined with geopolitical tensions and Fed policy uncertainty, The Hartford continues to be well positioned to manage margins and returns successfully.\nAs we all know, within the U.S., we are experiencing historic levels of inflation, which has resulted in accelerated monetary policy tightening. These conditions appear to be pushing the U.S. economy into a lower growth environment or possibly a mild recession. However, this is occurring against the unique backdrop of low unemployment and strong corporate and consumer balance sheets. These conditions are very different from those that existed during 2008 when the recession was driven by credit imbalances across the economy, high unemployment and heavily leveraged balance sheets.\nThe Hartford is also a very different company today. We have well-performing businesses, enhanced capabilities, a diversified portfolio of P&C and Group Benefit products and a stronger balance sheet, including a high-quality investment portfolio. All of our businesses are competing effectively in their target markets with unique value propositions, anchored by The Hartford's brand and reputation. We have invested in new capabilities to deliver an exceptional customer experience while ensuring appropriate rigor in the management of claim outcomes, including the extensive use of data science and artificial intelligence. For our 2 largest and strongest performing lines, workers' comp and disability, these enhanced capabilities have led to improved profitability over the years and give us confidence that even during the economic slowdown we are well positioned to minimize the impact on loss cost.\nNow I'd like to share some highlights from each of our businesses which illustrate how our strategy translates into consistent and sustainable financial performance. Overall, Commercial Lines outperformed with double-digit top line growth and expanding margins in the quarter.\nThere has been much commentary about written renewal rates versus loss cost trends and the impact of inflation. We have been disciplined and prudent in establishing loss picks for 2022. Our assumptions reflect loss trends in the aggregate of approximately 5% excluding workers' compensation, reflecting our overall business mix which skews towards small business and middle market risk. Therefore, we have approximately 100 basis points of spread between written renewal pricing and loss trends.\nStepping back, I am incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in Small Commercial. Over the past decade, we have built a track record of consistent superior performance with underlying combined ratios below 90% as we grew the business to over $4 billion in annual premium. Our momentum in the marketplace is evident with several consecutive quarters of record new business.\nThe speed, accuracy and consistency we deliver to the market along with leading digital capabilities continue to outpace competitors. We are transforming our Middle & Large Commercial business into a specialized organization with broad product offerings and deep underwriting skills across industry verticals, which is driving growth, strong profit margins and more consistent results. Our execution around data science, pricing segmentation and engineering has dramatically improved, which will help drive continued underwriting discipline in more competitive lines of business, including workers' compensation.\nIn Global Specialty, results are outstanding as we continue to maximize our expertise to gain market share. Our teamwork and cross-selling activities have been phenomenal and continue to strengthen the franchise. Underwriting margins have improved materially over the last 3 years, evidenced by our 85.5% underlying combined ratio through 6 months in 2022. These advantages are only getting stronger as the market recognizes our product breadth, efficiency and ease of doing business as key differentiators.\nIn Personal Lines, the rollout of the new platform -- Prevail platform continues and is beginning to show positive traction. However, higher inflation is impacting auto results and will require additional pricing actions. Doug and Beth will talk more about that shortly. But overall, from a strategic perspective, I am pleased with the progress we are making in Personal Lines.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings were $161 million with a margin of 9.8%, reflecting a rapid recovery in mortality and solid disability results. Long-term disability trends are stable and within our expectations for incident rates and recoveries. On the top line, fully insured ongoing premium was up 7%, benefiting from strong persistency above 90% and sales of $204 million, nearly double the prior year quarter. The excellent sales results are primarily driven by the acquisition of new cases and strong enrollment, which reflect a combination of greater product awareness among employees and new enrollment capabilities we introduced over the last 18 months.\nWe observed that both employers and employees are highly engaged on benefit offerings in light of the pandemic. Businesses are also increasingly focused on offerings that can help them attract and retain talent in a competitive labor market and at the same time, struggling with growing complexities of regulation and compliance, including emerging state-paid family leave mandates. This is an opportunity for us to demonstrate higher value through our expanded products and services as we continue to grow the business.\nBefore I turn it over to Beth, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. I remain confident and excited about the future of The Hartford. Our businesses are performing well and have never been stronger. We are managing the investment portfolio prudently, and our holdings are well balanced across a diversified asset classes. We have proven execution capabilities and exceptional talent that drives my confidence in our ability to continue to produce superior returns in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. And finally, we are proactively managing our excess capital to be accretive for shareholders. All these factors underpin my confidence of achieving ROEs of 13% to 14% for this year and 2023.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of $714 million or $2.15 per diluted share reflects strong P&C underwriting results and premium growth in Commercial Lines and Group Benefits as well as a reduction in pandemic impacts. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $544 million and reflect higher earned premium, improvement in the underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses in the prior year period. Commercial Lines reported 14% written premium growth, reflecting written pricing increases and exposure growth, along with an increase in new business and policy count retention in Small Commercial. The underlying combined ratio of 88.1% improved 1.3 points from the prior second quarter due to a lower loss ratio primarily in Global Specialty lines and improved expense ratio, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe property losses in Middle & Large Commercial.\nIn Personal Lines, core earnings were $21 million, and the underlying combined ratio was 94.1%, reflecting increased auto loss costs. We continue to experience inflationary impacts on auto physical damage. We expected to see some moderation in severity trends, and to date, that has not been the case.\nDue to these trends and reduced optimism for improvement in the second half of the year, we expect to be 1 point or 2 above the high end of the full year Personal Lines underlying combined ratio range we guided to in February. To put that into perspective, 1 point is worth about $23 million or $0.07 per share after tax. Doug will comment upon the actions that we continue to take to get more rate into the book.\nP&C current accident year catastrophes in the second quarter were $123 million before tax, which was $5 million below the prior year period and well below our expectation for typical second quarter catastrophes. P&C prior accident year reserve development was a net favorable $58 million with workers' compensation being the largest contributor.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $161 million and the 9.8% core earnings margin reflect a lower level of excess mortality losses and growth in fully insured premiums, partially offset by an increase in insurance operating costs and a higher disability loss ratio of 66.3% compared to 64.2% in the 2021 period. This increase is primarily due to a lower risk adjustment benefit recorded in the quarter related to the New York Paid Family Leave program.\nThe long-term disability loss ratio in the quarter was in line with prior year, reflecting claim recoveries and a stabilization of claim incidents. All-cause excess mortality in the quarter was benefit of $5 million before tax compared to $25 million of expense in the prior year quarter. The $5 million reduction included $19 million of excess mortality with dates of loss in the second quarter and $24 million of favorable development from first quarter 2022 claims.\nTurning to Hartford Funds. Due to equity market declines and higher interest rates, daily average AUM decreased during the quarter to $137 billion, resulting in core earnings of $44 million compared to $50 million (sic) [$51 million] in the first quarter of 2022. Our investment portfolio delivered another strong quarter. Net investment income was $541 million, benefiting from annualized limited partnership returns of 17.3%. Two commercial real estate sales totaling $51 million in gains were material contributors to LP returns as well as strong results from private equity, which is generally reported on a quarter lag.\nWe have been very pleased with the performance of LPs in the first half of the year. Given the evolving macroeconomic outlook in combination with the mix of commercial real estate, private equity and other limited partnership holdings, we anticipate that annualized LP returns in the second half of 2022 could trail our full year annualized target. However, we believe returns in total will be positive in the second half of the year.\nIn the quarter, the total annualized portfolio yield excluding limited partnerships is 3% before tax. With the increase in interest rates and wider credit spreads, the portfolio's reinvestment rate was 4.5%, which compares favorably to the average sales and maturity yield of 3.6%. As we have noted previously, net investment income will benefit from higher rates over time, and we would expect ex LP yields to increase 10 to 20 basis points during the second half of the year.\nNot surprisingly, the portfolio value was also impacted by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. The unrealized loss position of approximately $300 million pretax at March 31 increased to an unrealized loss of approximately $2.4 billion at June 30. The investment portfolio credit quality remains strong with an average rating of A+ with insignificant credit impairments and a small increase of $5 million to the allowance for credit losses for mortgage loans to reflect a growing book and the current economic outlook. So while interest rates and capital markets may remain volatile, we are confident that our high-quality and well-diversified portfolio will continue to support our financial goals and objectives.\nThe confidence we have in our business' ability to generate free cash flow is also evidenced by our capital management actions. As Chris mentioned, yesterday, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3 billion, effective August 1, 2022, through December 31, 2024. This authorization is in addition to the existing authorization which, as of June 30, had approximately $450 million remaining. Our expectation is to complete the existing authorization this year with the vast majority of the new authorization to be utilized in 2023 and 2024, subject to market conditions. In summary, we have had strong performance in the first 6 months of the year and believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver on our targeted returns.\nI will now turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas Graham Elliot\n\nPresident, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Beth, and good morning. The strength of The Hartford's Property & Casualty business was once again evident in the second quarter. Despite inflationary pressures and lower GDP, our broad product portfolio and specialized underwriting expertise positively impacted the quarter's financial results. Those 2 factors, combined with our distribution footprint and deep talent base, position us well to maintain strong performance going forward.\nIn Commercial Lines, we achieved double-digit written premium growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. Underwriting results were excellent with underlying margin improvement in Small Commercial and Global Specialty. Diving deeper into growth, Commercial Lines pricing was fairly consistent with expectations. Written pricing excluding workers' compensation was 6.1%, about 1 point lower than first quarter but continuing to exceed loss cost trends across most products. Workers' compensation pricing remained positive but declined slightly.\nGlobal Specialty pricing markets were more competitive with written price at 5.5%, off about 2.5 points compared to quarter 1. However, pricing in our wholesale book actually ticked up, remaining in the high single digits. Notable contributions to an excellent commercial top line quarter include strong policy retention across markets, our largest new business quarter ever for Small Commercial at $201 million, solid new business levels in middle and Global Specialty despite increasing signs of a more competitive market and strong audit premium from robust customer payroll growth. In total, I'm pleased with our growth profile across these components and confident we will continue our disciplined execution.\nTurning to loss cost. Trends were largely in line with expectations. We continue to watch severity across our book, including social inflation, wage growth, supply chain pressures and commodity pricing. All in, our commercial book posted a very strong quarter and first half of 2022.\nOur Small Commercial team recorded an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 86.9% for the quarter. Since the first quarter of 2013, Small Commercial has achieved a sub-90 underlying combined ratio in every quarter except 2. Global Specialties underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a stellar 83.1%, their best result since the acquisition. And Middle & Large Commercial delivered a solid 92.9%.\nThere certainly has been a fair amount of discussion concerning the impact of future economic conditions on our industry, particularly workers' compensation. From a top line perspective, the data we watch are employment levels and wage growth, which together determine the payroll base for workers' compensation.\nShifting to the loss ratio. We're focused on the following key metrics: wage growth, which acts as a form of pricing with indemnity payment offsets; changes in worker tenure, which can impact claim frequency; and the impact of inflation on medical severity. With respect to medical severity, we believe our long-term view of 5% in both pricing and reserving is sufficient to cover the potential for increased severity above the benign trend we've experienced the past few years.\nWe are well positioned to address these trends head on. Our workers' compensation accident year performance has been excellent over the past several years, and the balance sheet is strong. We have also built sophisticated pricing and risk segmentation tools and expanded data analytics within the organization to successfully underwrite through different economic cycles.\nLet's switch gears and move to Personal Lines. Our second quarter underlying combined ratio of 94.1% reflects auto physical damage pressure driven by supply chain-related inflation, elevated used car prices and wage increases. In the second quarter, these auto severity trends ran higher than we initially anticipated. Combined with normal seasonality in our book, the second quarter auto accident year loss ratio increased 5.7 points from the first quarter of this year.\nThe physical damage increase was 2.5 points; with the remaining delta, normal seasonality. As Beth noted, we expect the continuation of inflation pressure in the back half of '22 and have moved our original guidance up accordingly. We are pleased that our pricing actions initiated over the past few quarters are starting to take hold. Auto written premium price increases recorded in the quarter eclipsed 4%. Rate actions taken across 39 states in the first half of the year averaged 5.7%.\nIn home, overall loss costs were in line with both the first quarter and our expectations. Non-cat weather frequency, although higher than the prior year, continues to run favorable to long-term averages, offsetting elevated large fire losses and material and labor costs, which remain at historically high levels. We are also taking pricing actions in home with written pricing at 9% for the quarter. Given all these factors, I remain pleased with both our year-to-date current accident year home loss ratio of 63.3% and combined ratio of 94.2%.\nTurning to production. Written premium growth was nearly flat with steady retention and new business growth of 5.6% in the quarter. We're seeing a significant increase in responses driven by our digital marketing programs and increased consumer shopping in the 50-plus age cohort. With that said, I would characterize our Personal Lines growth attitude as cautiously optimistic based on the current risk profile of the segment and the opportunities available in the market.\nPrevail is currently available in 16 states, including the launches of Florida in January, Texas in April and 3 more states this month. We have also launched expanded self-service capabilities, demonstrating our digital customer commitment in the space. Year-to-date Prevail new business premium was $36 million with conversion rates at expectations, and we continue to be pleased with the quality of our new business. In addition, our redesigned telematic offering is available in 16 states and will be launched in additional states as Prevail rolls out. Our initial results, including consumer interest, online adoption and enrollment, are all trending ahead of expectations.\nSummarizing the strong results for Property & Casualty. Our Commercial Lines business maintained a double-digit growth rate with exceptional operating margins. And in Personal Lines, while auto severity is pressuring loss ratios, pricing actions are getting stronger, and increasing contributions from Prevail add to our momentum.\nAs I wrap up my comments today, let me step back and provide a bit of perspective from my operating seat here at The Hartford. Neither we nor our competitors can control the external forces or economic trends that will occur in the future. However, we can control our preparation and our response to various likely or possible scenarios.\nI firmly believe The Hartford has never been better positioned to aggressively take advantage of opportunities while mitigating the downside risks. My confidence comes from our broadened product portfolio responsive to solving broker and customer needs, the enhanced underwriting and deep analytic capabilities that deliver competitive advantages and lead to outstanding financial results, strengthened technology and digital tools that have improved our competitiveness over the past 10 years and an invest agenda that is cutting-edge and is forward-leaning as anything I see in the marketplace. In short, we have transformed the small business marketplace with our innovative and industry-leading capabilities, and we are well on our way to achieving the same in Middle Market space.\nGlobal Specialty is producing excellent results and will increasingly leverage the competitive tools built within our walls. And finally, Personal Lines is off to a good start with our cloud-based product Prevail, which will be pivotal to our future. For these reasons and more, I am bullish about our ability to demonstrate strong execution capabilities in the years ahead. I look forward to our next update in 90 days.\nLet me now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Doug. Operator, we're prepared to take questions."

My name is Bailey, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on first quarter 2022 earnings.

Last April at our first quarter earnings call, I had said I've never been more excited about the future of The Hartford and was extremely bullish about our prospects for growth and further margin expansion. Since then, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver on these commitments through exceptional execution quarter after quarter.\nWe continued that momentum in the first quarter with core earnings of $561 million or $1.66 per diluted share, up from $203 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the prior quarter. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was $51.42, and our 12-month core earnings ROE was 14.8%.\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to return $530 million to shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends. These results and actions demonstrate our commitment to long-term value creation through consistent profitable growth, continued investment in our business and return of capital to shareholders. We delivered these results during a very dynamic period, which is likely to continue with ongoing challenges from COVID, the secondary impacts of the Ukraine conflict and the anticipated Fed actions to raise interest rates while shrinking its balance sheet to address historically high levels of inflation.\nAnd yet, there are reasons for optimism. Unemployment remains very low, 3.6% at the end of March. U.S. consumers are historically holding low levels of debt with healthy savings. Home prices have appreciated 17% on average over the past year, providing a valuable source of equity for homeowners. Corporations have strong balance sheets and healthy earnings profiles, while new U.S. business applications are up 65% from the prepandemic levels, a trend that is expected to continue.\nWe view the economic environment as favorable to our business where growth is fueled by higher employment levels, rising wages, new business start-ups and commercial exposure expansion. I remain confident that The Hartford is well positioned to perform across its portfolio of businesses to deliver on our goals, maximizing value for our stakeholders.\nNow let's turn to the highlights from the quarter, which illustrate how our strategy translates into consistent and sustainable financial performance. Overall, Commercial Lines results outperform with double-digit top line growth and expanding margins in all businesses. In Small Commercial, we hold a clear leadership position with our innovative products, digital platform and data analytics, setting us apart from the competition. Last year, we delivered a record growth, eclipsing $4 billion in annual premium. And in the first quarter, we continued this positive momentum with very strong new business and increased premium retention. Middle & Large Commercial results are benefiting from sustained investments in underwriting capabilities, broader product offerings as well as innovative digital and data science tools. In Global Specialty, we continue to maximize our expertise to gain market share while expanding margins with overall profitability improvement of more than 10 points from the second half of 2019.\nAs it relates to the Ukraine conflict, first, let me say, we share the world's outrage at the tragic and senseless death, suffering and destruction and pray for an end to this needless violence. From The Hartford's perspective, we have very modest direct exposure within the region, which is meaningfully reinsured. We have a de minimis amount of premium there and have actively controlled our exposure in the run-up to the conflict and subsequent to the start of the hostilities. Beth will cover the financial impacts to the quarter.\nIn Personal Lines, results were in line with expectations and reflect our transformative work and unique AARP relationship. I am pleased with the progress we are making as we roll out Prevail, our innovative and cloud-based platform that provides a simplified digital customer experience and uses data science to drive new business growth in the profitable 50-plus age segment.\nTurning to Group Benefits. As expected, we continue to be impacted by the pandemic. However, our underlying performance was solid and continues to demonstrate our market leadership position. Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% in the quarter and reflects both increased premium from existing customer and a full point improvement in persistency over the prior year. Favorable employment trends and rising wages also contributed to premium growth.\nSales for the current quarter are down year-over-year as the first quarter of 2021 benefited from the expansion of paid family medical leave products in several states. Adjusting for that onetime lift, sales are comparable to prior year across our life, disability and supplemental health products.\nThrough the first 3 months of the year, our long-term disability book is performing as expected, with modestly higher disability incidence trends. The higher incident rate is reflected in our future pricing and was anticipated when we set forth our margin expectations for 2022.\nModestly higher expenses in the quarter reflect higher staffing costs to manage elevated short-term disability claims and accelerated investments in capabilities, including digital, claims automation and administrative platforms. We expect the full year 2022 expense ratio to be generally consistent with first quarter results.\nDuring the quarter, the number of U.S. COVID cases were at their highest levels of the pandemic, and deaths were elevated. However, both cases and deaths have rapidly declined in March and April. Clearly, the past 2 years have shown that predicting the pandemic impacts is impossible. But with cases and deaths at their current levels, we are cautiously optimistic about the remaining quarters of 2022.\nIn conclusion, The Hartford is off to a strong start in 2022. We are optimistic about macro factors impacting our business, including improving pandemic outcomes and the potential for easing of inflationary pressures. We continue to manage our investment portfolio prudently and expect the portfolio yield to benefit from rising interest rate environment over time. And we are continuing to proactively manage our capital. All these factors underpin my confidence that we will generate a 13% to 14% core earnings ROE in 2022 and 2023.\nOur strategy and the investments we've made in our business have established The Hartford as a proven performer with consistent results. We are competitively positioned with a complementary and a well-performing portfolio of businesses and a winning formula to consistently achieve superior risk-adjusted returns.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of $561 million or $1.66 per diluted share reflect excellent P&C underwriting results, a significant contribution from the investment portfolio and reduced pandemic-related impacts in Group Benefits. As Chris commented, business written related to Russia-Ukraine exposure had a modest impact on results.\nWe recorded $27 million of net catastrophe losses, primarily related to political violence and terrorism, including aviation war and credit and political risk insurance. As a result of incurred losses covered by our reinsurance treaties, we recorded a provision for ceded reinstatement premium of $11 million.\nThe company's direct investment exposure is limited to corporate bonds issued by Russian entities with an amortized cost of $16 million, and we recorded an allowance for credit losses of $9 million in the quarter. We do not have any investments in Belarus or Ukraine.\nMoving on to the business line results. In Commercial Lines, core earnings were $456 million, up $351 million from the prior first quarter, primarily driven by the reserve increase in the 2021 period for Boy Scouts and a stronger top line and lower catastrophes in the current period. Commercial Lines reported 12% written premium growth, reflecting an increase in new business in Small Commercial, strong policy retention, written pricing increases and exposure growth. The underlying combined ratio of 88.3 improved 2.9 points from the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID losses in the prior year and a lower expense ratio and slightly improved margins across several product lines in 2022.\nIn Personal Lines, core earnings were $84 million, and the underlying combined ratio of 88.5 reflects increased auto loss costs as anticipated. I would note that from a seasonality perspective, the first quarter typically has lower loss costs than the balance of the year. As Doug will comment upon, we are making progress in getting more rate into the book given the impact of inflation on loss costs. Although our view of inflation impact is a bit higher than where we were a quarter ago, we expect to be within the underlying combined ratio guidance of 90 to 92 for the full year, albeit at the high end.\nP&C current accident year catastrophes in the first quarter were $98 million before tax, which included the $27 million related to Russia-Ukraine exposures that I just mentioned. P&C prior accident year reserve development was a net favorable $36 million, with workers' compensation being the largest contributor.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Core earnings of $8 million compares to a core loss of $3 million in first quarter 2021. Core earnings reflect a lower level of excess mortality losses in group life partially offset by a higher disability loss ratio and an increase in the expense ratio.\nAll-cause excess mortality in the quarter was $96 million before tax compared to $185 million in the prior year quarter. The $96 million included $122 million with dates of loss in the first quarter, which was partially offset by favorable development on prior quarters.\nThe disability loss ratio increased 4.8 points over the prior year period primarily due to less favorable prior incurral year development on long-term disability as the 2021 loss ratio benefited from low incidence levels from earlier in the pandemic.\nThe long-term disability loss ratio in the quarter was in line with our expectations, which included an assumption for increased incidents relative to the past couple of years. Long-term disability claim recoveries remain strong and are consistent with prior year.\nLastly, the expense ratio for Group Benefits increased by 0.6 points. Consistent with expectations, the expense ratio was impacted by higher staffing costs to handle elevated short-term disability claims and increased investments in technology, partially offset by incremental Hartford Next expense savings and the effect of earned premium growth.\nBefore excess mortality and COVID short-term disability losses, the Group Benefits core earnings margin was 5.7%. From a seasonality perspective, we experienced higher underlying loss costs in the first quarter, so we would expect the margin to be lower than our full year estimate. We remain confident in our guidance of a 6% to 7% core earnings margin for full year 2022, excluding COVID impacts.\nTurning to Hartford Funds. Due to equity market declines and higher interest rates, AUM decreased during the quarter to $148 billion, resulting in a sequential quarterly decrease in core earnings, though core earnings were up 11% compared to first quarter of 2021. Our investment portfolio delivered another strong quarter. Net investment income was $509 million, benefiting from very strong annualized limited partnership return of 14.6%, driven by relatively balanced contributions from our private equity and real estate equity investments.\nTotal annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 2.9% before tax. With the increase in interest rates and wider credit spreads, the portfolio's reinvestment rate was 3.3%, which compared favorably to the average sales maturity yield of 3%.\nNot surprisingly, the portfolio value was also impacted by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. The portfolio moved from an unrealized gain position of $2.1 billion at year-end to an unrealized loss of approximately $300 million. Additionally, the portfolio had a net realized loss of $145 million, which includes $107 million of mark-to-market losses on the public equity portfolio, reflecting the decline in equity markets in the quarter.\nWhile it is still early, as we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the limited partnership annualized return will be in the 8% to 10% range. Both private equity and real estate equity investments contribute to our LP return, and this diversification has proven to be beneficial. So while interest rates and capital markets may remain volatile, we are confident that our high-quality and well-diversified portfolio will continue to support our financial goals and objectives.\nThe confidence we have in our business is also evidenced by our capital management actions. As of March 31, approximately $900 million of share repurchase authorization remains for 2022. From April 1 through April 27, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million common shares for $139 million. On April 15, we redeemed $600 million of hybrid securities with a rate of 7.875%. We had prefunded this redemption with the issuance of $600 million of 2.9% senior notes last September, which will result in net annual after-tax savings of approximately $24 million.\nIn summary, our first quarter financial performance demonstrates the positive results that building and investing in our businesses have yielded. Combined with prudent capital management, we are positioned to deliver on our goals.\nI will now turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas Graham Elliot\n\nPresident, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Beth, and good morning, everyone. The Hartford's Property & Casualty strong first quarter results are evidence of the substantial progress achieved to expand product breadth, advance technology and data science, deepen our distribution footprint and differentiate the customer experience. These accomplishments are powered by our skilled talent base, positioning us well for profitable growth.\nStarting with Commercial Lines. I'm pleased with the underwriting performance across product lines and the improving expense leverage. Written premium growth was strong in the quarter, sustaining the top line momentum achieved last year. With the acceleration of growth during 2021, the year-over-year compares will get more challenging in subsequent quarters, but we're confident there is upside to our initial target of 4% to 5%.\nStarting with pricing. In January, we shared with you our 2022 Commercial Lines guidance, which contemplated moderated renewal pricing, and first quarter was largely in line with those expectations. Commercial written pricing, excluding workers' compensation, was 7.1%, moderating about 1 point from the fourth quarter, but continuing to exceed loss cost trends across most products. This moderation was largely experienced in Middle Market and Global Specialty.\nWorkers' compensation pricing declined slightly from the fourth quarter as expected. The dynamic of higher average wages partially offset by negative filed rates will likely persist throughout 2022.\nNew written premium in Small Commercial was up 6%, driven by Spectrum, and retention improved 2 points from last year. Our #1-rated digital customer experience, outstanding product capabilities and rising no-touch bindability levels are driving business to The Hartford as customers continue to embrace our consistent pricing and underwriting approach, leading to higher sales and excellent retention.\nMiddle Market pricing, excluding workers' compensation, was 6.5%, a very solid start to the year. Retention was up 4 points from the first quarter of 2021, while new business premium was essentially flat. Robust exposure growth also contributed to our quarterly top line increase of 10%.\nPricing remained strong in Global Specialty at 8.3%, with U.S. wholesale pricing just over 9%. Premium retention was steady, and growth from our reinsurance business was significant. We continue to be pleased with our growing momentum, deeper product suite and improved underwriting execution.\nTurning to loss costs. Our 2022 guidance also reflected our disciplined and long-term consistent approach to loss trend selection, including the expected impact of supply chain, inflationary pressures in our auto and property books along with social and economic headwinds in other lines. Overall loss trends and loss ratios for the quarter were in line, with a few puts and takes.\nIn summary, for commercial, I'm very pleased with the continued excellent performance of each of our businesses, and I expect to achieve our underlying full year guidance of 86.5 to 88.5.\nSmall Commercial delivered yet another sub-90 underlying combined ratio quarter and our best first quarter since 2014. At 91.5, Middle & Large Commercial has now achieved 4 straight quarters of strong underlying performance, and this quarter's result is the best first quarter in over a decade. And Global Specialty's underwriting combined ratio -- underlying combined ratio of 88.2 is equally impressive, reflecting the recent strong pricing environment, improved underwriting execution and significant underwriting actions taken since the acquisition.\nAs these results demonstrate, we are effectively balancing the rate and retention trade-off while maintaining disciplined underwriting and leveraging risk segmentation tools to continue driving profitable growth.\nFlipping over to Personal Lines. We're very pleased with the first quarter underlying combined ratio of 88.5, acknowledging the typical first quarter seasonality benefit and industry loss cost headwinds. Maintaining profitability of the legacy book has been a primary focus while developing our new product, Prevail. Consequently, over the past several years, we continued to selectively tune pricing.\nIn Personal Lines auto, loss costs were elevated, primarily due to higher-than-expected severity, particularly in physical damage. We have not been immune to supply chain and inflation pressures. And in response, over the past several months, we have completed over 50 auto filings with an average rate increase of 6.2%. These filings were across multiple class plans and will impact approximately half of our book going forward.\nIn addition, we continue to recalibrate Prevail pricing to reflect these elevated loss trends. We're confident our filing execution, combined with prudent rate increases taken during the past few years, will continue to position our auto book for profitable growth.\nIn home, overall loss costs were in line with quarter 1 of 2021. Non-CAT weather frequency continues to run favorable to long-term averages, while material and labor costs remain at historically high levels, putting pressure on severity. We're similarly taking pricing actions in home. All in, our current accident year home loss ratio of 47.3 is very healthy.\nTurning to Personal Lines production. Retention remained steady, while we generated new business growth in the quarter. Responses and conversion rates are in line with expectations. In addition, Prevail is now available in 13 states, including the launch of Florida in January and Texas in April, a couple of our larger states. We're actively managing our new business flow through an accelerated view of key metrics and enhanced analytics. To date, we're pleased with the quality of the new business we're writing.\nIn closing, the first quarter was a very strong start to 2022 across Property & Casualty and represents mounting evidence that we have and will continue to deliver on our critical and strategic goals. Our Commercial Lines business grew at a double-digit clip with exceptional operating margins. And in Personal Lines, pricing actions are taking hold, while new business growth is emerging with increasing contributions from Prevail. The seamless integration of our product portfolio, technology and analytics, distribution and talent continue to drive our success in the marketplace. The momentum is clear. The results are strong, and our future is bright. I look forward to our next update in 90 days.\nLet me now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you. We have about 30 minutes for questions. Operator, could you please repeat the instructions for asking a question?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Susan Spivak, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our call and webcast on fourth quarter 2021 earnings. Yesterday, we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our website.\nFor the call today, in order of speakers will be Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Elliott, President.

Replays of this webcast and an official transcript will be available on The Hartford's website for 1 year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher Jerome Swift\n\nChairman & CEO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today. In 2021, The Hartford delivered strong financial performance across the organization as we continue to execute on our strategy and realize the growing benefits of investing in our businesses. At our Investor Day in November, we shared our road map for maximizing shareholder value and demonstrated how we are executing in a more consistent and sustainable way. Our targeted priorities will continue to produce results that drive profitable growth, enable market-leading ROEs and deliver consistent capital generation while at the same time sustaining our top-quartile ESG performance.\nAs evidence of our ability to drive profitable growth, core earnings were up 10% in the fourth quarter to $697 million, and full year core earnings grew to $2.2 billion. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 8% from year-end 2020. And the core earnings ROE of 12.7% for the second consecutive year.\nDuring the quarter, we also returned $620 million to shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends, bringing total capital return for 2021 to $2.2 billion. These strong results are the product of an extremely attractive portfolio of businesses and target investments over the last several years to generate strong, sustainable cash flow. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize investments for future organic growth, along with dividends and share repurchases, in our capital allocation decisions.\nThe Hartford's businesses have distinct advantages of their own and complement each other extremely well, sharing deep underwriting and risk management expertise, tools, insights and distribution. Across the portfolio of businesses, we will continue to invest in claims, analytics, data science and digital capabilities to ensure superior performance. All the businesses possess exceptional talent that fully embrace The Hartford's winning behaviors and passion for execution.\nI am incredibly proud of the resiliency demonstrated by our team, especially over the last 2 years. This speaks to our character, focus on continuous improvement and commitment to all our stakeholders.\nLet's now turn to highlights from the quarter, which illustrate how our business strategy translates into financial performance. In Commercial Lines, the positive momentum continued with stellar margins in double-digit top line growth, reflecting higher new business levels, continued strong retention and solid renewal price increases. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect strong growth and earned pricing to continue to exceed loss cost trends in most lines, resulting in further margin improvement.\nPersonal Lines delivered solid operating performance in a dynamic market environment. I am pleased with the progress being made as we advance the rollout of our new Prevail product and platform that provides a more contemporary experience to our unique AARP customers in the 50-plus age segment. We are closely watching the impact of inflation on loss costs and responding with underwriting and pricing actions. We anticipate slightly higher underlying combined ratio in 2022.\nTurning to Group Benefits. Earnings continued to be impacted by the ongoing pandemic with elevated life and disability claims. Despite pandemic headwinds, performance across Group Benefits remained solid and key business metrics demonstrate our market leadership position. Fully insured ongoing premium was up 5% in the quarter, reflecting increased sales as well as growth in new premium from existing customers. Persistency was above 90% and increased 1 point over prior year.\nIn 2021, our sales growth benefited from the initial expansion of paid family medical leave in several states. Adjusting for that onetime lift, we are off to a good start with January '22 sales being on par with prior year. For the full year, we are expecting premium growth in the 2% range compared to 2021.\nWithin our long-term disability book, claim recoveries remain strong. Claim incidents and short-term disability is highly elevated due to COVID, while long-term disability incidence rates have shown modest signs of increases as we have been experiencing and, in turn, will be incorporated into future pricing assumptions.\nThe Omicron variant has driven the most recent surge in cases. Initial effects of Omicron are more impactful for short-term disability, but the lag between infection and in death makes it challenging to predict future mortality. Estimates of expected cases vary widely as do perspectives on the final resolution of COVID as an endemic virus.\nFor 2022, we are estimating between $125 million and $225 million of pretax losses due to the broad effects of the pandemic, including short-term disability and excess mortality, which we expect to impact results primarily in the first part of the year. Our excess mortality estimates are based on the best data we can gather regarding COVID trends and reflect our optimism for the remainder of the year. This optimism is principally due to the population continuing to get boosted and the Omicron being less lethal. In addition, as advanced therapeutics make their way to the market and insulates the medical community, there is an expectation of fewer deaths for those who contract the virus.\nThough uncertainty remains, I am encouraged as we progress through 2022 the pandemic will shift to a regional endemic state with more treatment options available. Excluding any pandemic-related effects for both life and disability, we expect the core earnings margins to be between 6% and 7%, consistent with our long-term margin outlook for this business.\nTurning to the macroeconomic environment for 2022. I am optimistic the business environment will be one in which The Hartford will prosper. We expect that consumer capacity to spend will remain strong, which will drive economic growth. The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9% and is likely to fall below prepandemic levels of 3.5% by year-end, and we are seeing signs of increases to workforce participation.\nIn 2022, we expect inflation to be challenging in the first half of the year. However, as supply chains gradually improve, consumption transitions from goods to services and interest rates rise, we believe core inflation in the second half of the year will decline to the 3% range. Lower unemployment and mid-single-digit GDP growth is supportive of our employment-centric workers' compensation and Group Benefits businesses. An expanding economy is also a catalyst for growth across Commercial Lines, particularly in Small Commercial with higher new business formation.\nWhile monetary policy normalization may lead to volatility in the capital markets, our well-diversified and high-quality investment portfolio is constructed to withstand this market dynamic. With a favorable macroeconomic backdrop, profitable growth, expanding margins in P&C and Group Benefits, and proactive capital management, we are well positioned based on our current pandemic assumptions to generate a 13% to 14% core earnings ROE in 2022 and continuing into 2023.\nbefore I close, I want to speak to our ESG achievements and our commitment going forward. We have been consistently recognized for our efforts and progress, setting us apart from our competitors. Most recently, The Hartford was named the #1 insurer and 14th overall on America's Most Just Companies list. The recognition we continue to receive is a testament to our long-standing commitment to sustainability and the dedication and hard work of our teams that make these priorities core to who we are. ESG leadership remains a critical component of our value-creation strategy as we continue to deliver strong financial results alongside positive outcomes for all stakeholders.\nIn closing, we began 2022 in a very strong competitive position with sustainable advantages and a winning formula to consistently achieve superior risk-adjusted returns. This is a direct result of our performance-driven culture and the significant investments we have made to transform the organization into one with exceptional underwriting tools and expertise, expanded product depth and breadth and industry-leading digital capabilities, complemented by a talented and dedicated employee base. We will continue investing for the long term to become an even more differentiated competitor, all while producing financial results. I am confident that The Hartford has never been in a better position to continue to deliver on our financial objectives and enhance value for all stakeholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Beth.\n\nBeth A. Costello\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Core earnings for the quarter of $697 million or $2.02 per diluted share reflects strong P&C underwriting results and a significant contribution from investments, partially offset by the continued impacts of the pandemic in Group Benefits. Commercial Lines reported 14% written premium growth in the quarter, reflecting an increase in new business, strong policy retention and exposure growth. The underlying combined ratio of 88.9 improved 1.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2020 due to lower COVID losses and improvement in the loss ratios in Global Specialty, workers' compensation and property.\nIn Personal Lines, the underlying combined ratio of 95.9 includes the effect of an increase in auto claims frequency and severity. New business premiums grew 16% with increases in both hot auto and homeowners. P&C current accident year catastrophes in fourth quarter were $22 million before tax, which is net of reinsurance recoveries of $39 million under our aggregate catastrophe cover. As a reminder, this cover attaches once qualifying CAT losses exceed $700 million.\nAs it relates to our CAT reinsurance program, we renewed the program on January 1, 2022, at only a modest increase in cost with no changes in structure. We have included a summary of our program in the earnings slide presentation.\nP&C prior accident year reserve development was in core earnings was a net favorable $144 million driven by a decrease in reserves for workers' compensation catastrophes, package business and personal auto liability, partially offset by adverse Navigators reserve development. In total, for the quarter, we incurred $43 million of adverse reserve development subject to the adverse development cover, of which $18 million was ceded to the cover. We have cumulatively ceded $300 million of losses the coverage limit under the treaty.\nOutside of core earnings, we also recognized adverse development of $155 million before tax for asbestos and environmental, with $106 million for asbestos and $49 million for environmental. During this year's reserve study, we saw a decline in asbestos claim filing frequency, which was more than offset by an increase in defense cost and claim settlement rates and values.\nFor environmental, the reserve increase was primarily due to the settlement of a large legacy pull ash remediation claim, an increase in legal defense costs and higher site remediation cost. While the $155 million of reserve development was economically ceded under the adverse development cover, we took a charge to net income for the deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance. To date, we have ceded a little over $1 billion to the adverse development cover with $485 million of limit remaining.\nTurning to Group Benefits. The core loss of $12 million compares to core earnings of $49 million in fourth quarter 2020. The core loss reflects continued elevated excess mortality losses in Group Life, higher short-term and long-term disability claim incidents and an increase in the expense ratio.\nWhen we shared our third quarter results, the reported U.S. COVID death rate has started to decline from the August surge. Unfortunately, the decline was short-lived as the death rate ticked up again in December. Using CDC-reported COVID deaths, we currently estimate U.S. deaths for the fourth quarter will be about 126,000, just slightly higher than 124,000 deaths for third quarter. The death rate for those under age 65 is down slightly but still higher than the first quarter of 2021.\nOur estimates for all-cause excess mortality in the quarter is $161 million before tax compared to $152 million in the prior year quarter. The $161 million included $176 million with dates of loss in the fourth quarter, partially offset by favorable development on prior quarters.\nThe disability loss ratio was elevated 6.5 points over the prior year due to higher claim incidence levels for both long-term and short-term disability. In the quarter, we increased our 2021 long-term disability accident year estimate to reflect modest increases in claim activity. Additionally, short-term disability claims in the quarter were elevated due to COVID, and we did not experience a corresponding decrease in non-COVID claims as we did earlier in the pandemic. When adjusting for excess mortality and COVID-related short-term disability impacts, the core earnings margin was 7.8%.\nLastly, the expense ratio for Group Benefits increased by 1.7 points compared to the prior fourth quarter. The expense ratio was impacted by higher compensation costs, an increase in technology costs and higher staffing costs to handle elevated plays. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2020 benefited from a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Partially offsetting these expense increases were incremental Hartford net expense savings and the effect of earned premium growth.\nHartford Funds core earnings for the quarter were $60 million compared with $46 million for the prior year period, reflecting the impact of daily average AUM increasing 20%. Total AUM at December 31 was $158 billion. Mutual Fund net inflows were positive for the fifth consecutive quarter of $358 million.\nThe Corporate core loss was $41 million compared to a loss of $51 million in the prior year quarter. The lower core loss was primarily due to an increase in net investment income related to a higher level of dividends received on equity funds.\nAcross the enterprise, we continue to execute on our Hartford Max operational transformation and cost-reduction plan, achieving $423 million of expense savings through year-end 2021. We remain on schedule to achieve savings of $540 million in 2022 and $625 million in 2023.\nTurning to investments. Our portfolio delivered another outstanding quarter. Net investment income was $573 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from very strong annualized limited partnership return of 22%, mostly driven by private equity funds. The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 3.1% before tax for the fourth quarter and the full year.\nLooking forward to 2022, we would expect our total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, will be slightly lower than in 2021 as the reinvestment rate continues to be low -- be below the average sales and maturity yields on the portfolio as well as an expected reduction in returns within the equity portfolio and nonroutine income items such as make-whole payments.\nThe portfolio credit quality remained strong with no credit losses on fixed maturities in the quarter. Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities before tax were $2.1 billion at December 31, down from $2.5 billion at September 30 due to marginally higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 8% since December 31, 2020, to $50.86, and the trailing 12-month core earnings ROE was 12.7%.\nDuring the quarter, The Hartford returned $620 million to shareholders, including $500 million of share repurchases at $120 million in common dividends paid. As of December 31, $1.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remains for 2022. From January 1 through February 2, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million common shares for $180 million. Cash and investments at the holding company were $1.9 billion at year-end. As a reminder, included in the holding company cash at the end of the year are the proceeds from the September debt issuance, which we intend to use to redeem $600 million of hybrid securities in April 2022. During the fourth quarter, we received approximately $440 million in dividends from subsidiaries and expect between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion in 2022.\nLooking forward to 2022, our views for the financial outlook are largely unchanged from those we shared at Investor Day. We expect to generate profitable growth in both P&C and Group Benefits, subject to some uncertainty with the level of excess mortality. This, coupled with our capital management plans, provides the path to a 13% to 14% ROE for 2022 and into 2023. We look forward to updating you on our progress.\nI'll now turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas Graham Elliot\n\nPresident, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Beth, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was an impressive year for The Hartford's Property & Casualty business. We achieved substantial progress on each of the 5 critical strategy drivers as outlined during our Investor Day, and the financial results were simply outstanding.\nAcross the 5, our expanded product breadth is driving top line growth across each of our commercial businesses. Advancements in technology and data are fueling straight-through processing in Small Commercial; speed-to-market improvements in Middle & Large Commercial; and the launch of our new Personal Lines' product, Prevail.\nOur distribution footprint is stronger than ever with expanded capabilities to meet changing customer needs across multiple channels. The Hartford's strong focus on customer experience is distinguishing our marketplace execution. Our Small Commercial digital experience was rated #1 in the industry by Kenova, and Net Promoter Scores have significantly improved in Middle & Large Commercial, putting us in the top tier of national carriers.\nFinally, talent powers our engine and continues to be a differentiator. The combination of these critical drivers has delivered full year 2021 Property & Casualty written premium growth of 9%, an underlying combined ratio of 89.4 and core earnings of $2 billion. The underlying combined ratio was 3 points lower than 2020, and core earnings were 17% higher. Our momentum in the marketplace is evident with several consecutive quarters of strong top line growth and underlying margin improvement.\nLet me dive a bit deeper into each of our business line results before closing with several comments about 2022. The Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio was 89.1 for the year, 6.4 points lower than prior year, improving 3.6 points ex COVID.\ngrowing 12% year-over-year and 14% in the fourth quarter. Small Commercial closed a year of record performance and continued market leadership with written premium eclipsing $4 billion, an increase of 11%. Fourth quarter written premium growth was even stronger at 17%. Policy count retention increased 2% -- 2 points in the quarter driven by consistent pricing and underwriting, and in-force policies grew 6.5% versus prior year. The continuing benefit from an improving economy, including rising payrolls, contributed to both the year's and the quarter's top line results.\nSmall Commercial new business of $673 million for the year was up 21%. Fourth quarter new business was $162 million with growth of 6%, an excellent result given the economic rebound during the last quarter quarter of 2020. New written premium growth was significant across all distribution channels, and our market-leading BOP product, Spectrum, continues to have strong traction.\nIn Middle & Large Commercial, written premium increased 12% for the year and 14% in the fourth quarter. Middle Market new business of $532 million increased 11% for the year, with significant contributions from our core general industries book as well as our specialized verticals. Quote and hit rates for the year both improved over 2 points from 2020, reflecting our growing momentum, deeper product suite and improving underwriting execution. We continue to balance the rate and retention trade-off while maintaining disciplined underwriting and leveraging our risk segmentation tools to drive profitable growth.\nGlobal Specialty produced a strong year with annual written premium growth of 13% and 11% in the quarter. New business of $912 million for the year or growth of 21% was equally impressive, and policy retention remained strong throughout the year in the mid-80s. The breadth of our written premium growth continued to be led by wholesale, U.S. financial lines and environmental. Global REIT also had an excellent year with written premium growth of 21%.\nLet's move to pricing metrics and loss trends. U.S. Standard Commercial Lines renewal written pricing was in line with the prior 2 quarters and continues to exceed loss trend across most products. Ex workers' compensation pricing was 6.5 in the quarter, with workers' comp pricing coming in at 1.2%. Within middle market, ex comp pricing also remained sequentially consistent at 8%.\nIn Global Specialty, U.S. pricing in the quarter was still quite good at 9%. U.S. wholesale achieved 12.7%; and Ocean Marine, 13.5%. Fourth quarter pricing gains in the international portfolio of 11.6% remains strong. Across Commercial Lines, loss trends and loss ratios for the year were largely in line with expectations.\nFor the year, the ex CAT current cent year loss ratio improved 4.9 points with a fourth quarter reduction of 190 basis points, benefiting in part from lower COVID losses. Ex COVID, this loss ratio improvement of 2.1 points for the year and 60 basis points for the quarter. Loss ratio improvement in the fourth quarter was driven by strong pricing and favorable property frequency, partially offset by a few large property losses across our book.\nShifting over to Personal Lines. The underlying combined ratio for the year increased 6.8 points to 89.9. Auto results were impacted by increasing vehicle trips and miles traveled. Liability frequency in the quarter continued to run favorable to expectations. However, physical damage frequency ran a bit worse. Auto severity remains elevated, primarily driven by rising wages and supply chain pressures on the cost of used cars and parts.\nIn home, full year and fourth quarter frequency was better than our expectations. However, higher claim severity from elevated building material and labor costs drove the underlying loss ratio up over 3 points for the year and the fourth quarter.\nWritten premiums declined 1% for both the year and the fourth quarter. However, I am encouraged by the improving growth profile in the second half of 2021. We see positive signs with rising conversion rates, steady retention and slightly improved industry shopping for our 50-plus cohort as included in J.D. Power's reported data.\nAnd Prevail, our new product, is now available in 8 states with the rollout significantly expanding in 2022. While we remain pleased with the quality of our new business, pricing is a top priority. More on that in a moment.\nBefore I turn the call back to Susan for Q&A, I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2022. Consistent with Investor Day, we continue to project 2022 Commercial Lines written premium growth between 4% and 5% with an underlying combined ratio between 86.5 and 88.5. Coming off significant 2021 growth of 12%, 4 to 5 is a strong target for this year. We expect to return to more historical patterns of workers' compensation exposure growth, counterbalanced with rising wages in 2022. The projected underlying combined ratio is approximately 2/3 loss ratio and 1/3 expense.\nRenewal written pricing in Commercial Lines, excluding workers' compensation, is expected to run in the mid-single digits with certain Global Specialty lines such as wholesale and U.S. Ocean Marine closer to double digits. Workers' compensation pricing is projected to remain competitive, especially in Small Commercial. Renewal written pricing is projected to be flat to slightly negative.\nAcross Commercial Lines, we expect earned pricing will continue to exceed loss trend in most lines, except workers' compensation. In Personal Lines, we expect auto frequency to modestly increase but remain below prepandemic trajectory. Persistent building and material inflation, increasing labor costs and supply chain disruptions throughout '22 will continue to impact severity. As a result of these trends, our auto and home regulatory filings have ramped up significantly over the last 90 days. I expect this elevated filing activity to continue throughout the first half of the year.\nTo ensure our initial price points reflect our most current view of loss trend, we have been deliberate and thoughtful with an adjusted Prevail state launch schedule. All in, we expect 2022 Personal Lines underlying combined ratio of 90 to 92.\nIn closing, 2021 was an outstanding year for our Property & Casualty business and a strong validation of our multiyear road map. Our Commercial Lines business, buoyed by the improving economy, grew at a double-digit clip. Strong pricing earned into the commercial book driving lower current accident year loss ratios. Each commercial business delivered strong execution and improved accident year performance. And early results from the launch of Prevail in Personal Lines demonstrate encouraging signs that our cloud platforms with contemporary product design features will compete well into the next decade. The seamless integration of our product portfolio, technology and analytics, distribution and talent have driven our success in the marketplace.\nAs I expressed at our November Investor Day, I'm extremely pleased with our 2021 performance. The results are strong and sustainable, as is our future. I look forward to updating you all on our 2022 performance with our first quarter call.\nLet me now turn the call back to Susan.\n\nSusan Spivak Bernstein\n\nSenior IR Officer, The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nAndrew, we're ready to take questions."

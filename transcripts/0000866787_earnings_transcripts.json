This is Vicky Liu on for Robbie Ohms. Thank you for taking our question. Can you talk about your expectations for early calendar 2026 as we'll likely have the combined impact of a hot summer, cold winter, and maybe some tax refund tailwind from the one big beautiful bill?\n\nis live. Good\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Robbie Ohms from Bank of America. Your line\n\nyou.\n\nforward. Thank\n\nAnd we're really pushing hard on merch margins to mute that or offset that completely. And that's what we'll do as we move\n\nAnd that's a playbook that we run over time and the teams continue to execute very well on that. We're going to continue to have a fairly significant headwind from a faster growing commercial business.\n\nrun the merch margin playbook, we continue to as I've historically said, with intensity. Our teams are doing a fantastic job looking for alternate sources looking for new brands to introduce and quite frankly, when there are opportunities, to move more to our house brands to help us drive margin opportunities.\n\nreferenced? Yeah, I mean,\n\nSo that was strong in the quarter, Jamere, and I'm wondering how to think about that into next quarter. Also, if you look at private label supply chain optimization and price optimization, can you help us just understand a little bit more of the drivers that are offsetting that 30% to 40% mix headwind?\n\nYes, hey, good morning. It's Mike Montani on for Greg Mellick. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the underlying performance and merch margin if I could.\n\nYour next question is coming from Michael Montani from Evercore. Your line is live.\n\nThank\n\nyou. you.\n\nThank\n\nvery much.\n\nThank you\n\nboth. Perfect.\n\nOn the purely discretionary product, it's a little bit of\n\nthat mostly being same SKU inflation driven on that side, or is it units up as well?\n\nForward. And just thinking about the comp there, is...\n\nAnd continue to—and started to slightly grow year over year—which we think is a pretty good sign. That segment of product has kind of bottomed out and will probably continue to grow from this point\n\nOur weaker performers have been over the last couple of years, frankly, the more purely discretionary items over the last year or from a negative comp perspective.\n\nI would say, I mean, our failure categories and our maintenance categories continue to be the best performers. Which I think is indicative of the health of the automotive industry in total.\n\nYeah,\n\nside?\n\nWhich categories were stronger and which were weaker during the quarter? And are you still seeing improvement in discretionary?\n\nperfect. Thank you very much. And then in terms of product categories, just wondering if there's anything to read through there in terms of the healthier core customer.\n\nessentially. Okay,\n\nof products and parts that get sold between the two. The commercial side generally you have a higher hard part mix, and you have generally newer less—well, let me say this the right way—newer SKUs in their life cycle, which generally are a little more expensive because they have more technology associated with them,\n\nsold? Yes, it's a mix and combination\n\nIs that just the mix of the parts that are being\n\nHey, good morning. This is Mark Jordan on for Kate McShane. My first question, I think, might be a quick one, but it's just what drove the difference between same SKU inflation in the retail business and the commercial business?\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\n\nhappy holidays. Thank\n\nGot it. Thank you so much. And\n\nWe're seeing it both in terms of what we're observing from vendors, but also from tariffs. As that rolls through, there is potential to see another point or two over the next couple of quarters impacted on the same SKU, resulting in a higher average ticket.\n\nYeah, I mean, I won't be date certain about when it will peak, but what we can tell you is that we're going to continue to see inflation coming through our cost of goods sold.\n\nyou. And then my follow-up kind of piggybacks off a previous question. So where do you kind of expect same SKU to peak in 3Q as it accelerates sequentially?\n\nthere. Thank\n\nSo, that's a playbook that we're continuing to run with intensity, and the teams are doing a pretty good job.\n\nWe had about a 34 basis points drag just from the mix shift associated with a faster growing commercial business. So all of the merchant actions that were taken inside the company are working really hard to offset that drag from the drag that's associated with the commercial rate.\n\nYeah, we had a very strong quarter from a merch margin standpoint. And what you see in our underlying gross margins is we were up nine basis points excluding LIFO.\n\nAnd any color on the outlook for this fiscal year?\n\nHi, this is Ariana on for Steve. Thank you for taking our questions. My first question is, can you give any color on the merch margin performance in the quarter?\n\nYour next question is coming from Steven Sagone from Citi. Your line is live.\n\nyou. Thank you.\n\nThank\n\nThat was really helpful. Thanks so much, guys.\n\nSo we think that's a really good story for us.\n\nBut they've just done an exceptional job, which you saw in our gross margin overcoming the vast majority of the mix shift to a lower margin business that grew faster on the commercial side of the business.\n\nWe've had a strategy for diversifying our sourcing out of China into other countries. For years, and they've become very adept at it, to Jamere's point, we're running that same playbook and our folks have gotten pretty good at doing that, as well as continuing to improve our supply chain efficiencies which are helping our gross margins.\n\nAnd they've become pretty good at it. Having multiple sources for country of origin, as well as multiple suppliers, to supply a particular category has been a strategy we've had for quite some time.\n\nYeah, I would continue to add that our merchants have been working with this tariff mitigation, country of origin, diversification, and multiple supplier diversification frankly since the original tariffs went back, went in back in 2016 and '17.\n\nAnd that is going to have some impact on ticket average and have some impact on comps going forward. It's just that what we anticipated originally, we're seeing better performance from a cost standpoint and lower IEPA tariffs from the rollback that was announced in November.\n\nBut what we're seeing, and you heard Phil talk about this a little bit earlier, is we're still expecting to see higher costs associated with tariffs as we move through.\n\nI think the second dynamic is you saw the announcements where the IEPA tariffs on China moved from 20 percent down to 10 percent. And so that does lower our expectation going forward.\n\nAnd then the third leg of the stool obviously has been to raise retails. So we haven't been running that playbook. We haven't seen as much inflation as we would have anticipated.\n\nOne is to the extent that there's an opportunity to negotiate lower costs with vendors. And protect the customer. We've been doing that. If there's an opportunity for us to diversify sources, to maintain the sales we're doing that.\n\nLIFO. Number one, we have not seen as much cost impact as we had originally anticipated. I think we've talked very openly about the fact that we're running a tried-and-true playbook.\n\nYeah, so two things on\n\nThanks.\n\nJust want to know if this is from just greater tariff reductions or maybe more focused mitigation efforts. And then could that taper the upper end of your same SKU expectations for inflation throughout the year?\n\nHi there. This is Sherman on for Scott. Thanks for taking my question. LIFO charges were less than expected this quarter and now you've lowered your expectation of the headwind for the next three quarters by around 25 percent.\n\ncoming from Scott Ciccarelli from Truist. Your line is live.\n\nThank you. Your next question is\n\nmuch.\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you very\n\nAnd if you do that on top of a much larger store base, again, that's what has us excited about the model as we move forward.\n\n140 basis points associated You got about with LIFO. So between those two, you add back, call it three and a half points to a business that's going to do 17 and some change on a gap basis, and you're back at your 20 percent operating model.\n\nreality is if you look at the model today and you're talking about operating profits, if you will, you got 2 points associated with this accelerated growth that we're talking about.\n\nprofile? Well, I think the\n\nGot you. Thank you very much. And the model reliance on gross margin to get back to 19 percent margin\n\nAnd this is underpinning the growth that we've talked about. And we like the earnings and cash profile on the backside of this.\n\nBut as we get to the point where these stores mature, then we'll manage SG&A growth in line with sales. But I think the key takeaway is that it's been purposeful.\n\nWhat I'll say about the gap between sales growth and SG&A growth over time is that SG&A will slightly outpace the sales growth as we move through.\n\nAnd two things. Number one, you're starting to see the growth shoots associated with that. And we'd like the earnings profile of the new stores first of all, as they're coming out of the shoots, but more importantly, when those stores mature in the next four to five years.\n\nAnd so what you've seen is that the investments in SG&A have been purposeful. We've had accelerated growth in SG&A related to new stores and acceleration of our commercial business.\n\nSo the first thing that I'll say, and we've reiterated this point, is that we're growing SG&A in a disciplined way as we create a faster growing business.\n\nSo how should we expect that gap between sales and SG&A growth to unfold going forward, especially as you accelerate unit growth? And as part of that, would it be fair to think the model is more reliant on recouping some of the gross margin headwinds you faced in the past couple of years to return to operating margins of 19 percent plus?\n\nGot you. That's helpful. And as far as my second question goes, I'm going to try to approach the SG&A topic a little differently. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2024, SG&A growth has outpaced sales growth in each quarter and by about 2 to 3 percentage points on average.\n\nSo they may flatten out a little bit, but at the end of the day, I think we're going to continue on as growth trajectory for both DIY and on the commercial side of the business.\n\nBut we're confident behind our initiatives that we have in place that we will continue to grow market share on both the DIY and the commercial business.\n\nI would characterize that we think those numbers are going to be relatively stable. Again, our comp, you know, in the latter part of Q3 and Q4, there was an increase from, if you think about a two-year stack, and it might moderate a little bit.\n\nYeah,\n\nQ.\n\nAnd you lap a greater inflation number in Q4.\n\nZane Brockham from Michael Lasser. Thank you very much for taking our question. The first question is on the comps. We're wondering how likely is it that the same store sales momentum would be sustainable domestically as comparisons become more challenging in the third quarter as well as fourth quarter?\n\nlive. Hi, this is\n\nYour next question is coming from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is\n\ntoo. Thank you.\n\nThank you. Happy holidays to you\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good luck and happy holidays.\n\nBut over the last year or so, they've actually been relatively stable and seen some minor improvement in sales. Over the last year.\n\nAnd there hasn't been a lot of volatility in those product categories. In purely discretionary categories, which is a relatively small part of our business, more like 16 to 17 percent of our total market, those categories were impacted over the last two years and had some pretty significant downfalls.\n\nBut, you know, as far as, you know, separating out what has tariff impact and not have had tariff impact, most of the product that we sell is essentially brake fix or it's required maintenance.\n\nSo we'll start to lapse some of that. I suspect that there'll still be some increases, but they'll probably be a little bit less muted in the latter part of what would be our Q4, more like the summertime.\n\nYeah, the inflation, we think the inflation is going to continue to increase through what would be our third quarter. On a year-over-year basis and then some of the impacts from tariff and cost increases started in Q4 of last year.\n\nAnd as a follow-up, how are you thinking about inflation? Has it impacted the entire product catalog and for items not impacted? Are you seeing any signs of demand elasticity there?\n\nmeaningful. Okay, thank you.\n\nAnd there's not a whole lot of upsell opportunities based on good, better, best opportunities. So we don't see a lot of trade down. There's a little bit, but it's really not been that\n\nWe have some, you know, good, better, best opportunities in batteries and brakes and wiper blades, things of that nature. But the vast majority of our inventory is generally one part that fits a particular vehicle.\n\nThe higher-end consumer we think is still doing okay. And we think that's been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters. We don't have a lot of categories where you would see trade down.\n\nYou know, I'd say more than two years. And what I would say is they've been relatively stable. So there hasn't been a significant wobble in that lower-end consumer.\n\nYeah, we kind of figured this question was probably coming at the end of the day. I would kind of characterize it as the lower-end consumer has been under pressure for, frankly, quite some time.\n\nHi, this is Skyler Tennant on behalf of Simeon. Thank you for taking our question. On our first question, we wanted to ask whether the consumer is showing any signs of elasticity to higher prices or whether you're seeing any signs of trade down.\n\nyou. Your next question is coming from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\n\nholidays. Thank\n\nguys. Happy holidays. Happy\n\nThank you,\n\nthis. Got it.\n\nWe're continuing to invest in a disciplined way in those growth initiatives. And, you know, quite frankly, we like the earnings and the cash story that this is going to generate for us as we come out of\n\nAnd a good chunk of that will be weighted in the back half. So you'll see some acceleration as we move through. And again, this is all, you know, predicated on the growth that we're seeing.\n\nAnd then if you look at, you know, our store opening ramp, you know, we're going to continue to open new stores. It's going to be back half weighted, as I mentioned, we'll open 350 to 360 stores globally in total.\n\nmentioned, you know, we had about two points of growth that was related to new stores and really the opening of new programs. And in our commercial area of the business, domestically, and we expect that to continue.\n\nyou. Yeah, as I\n\nThank\n\nSo now that you're accelerating store growth and you said two Q SG&A will be similarly up to one Q, can you help us understand like how does the curve of that SG&A per store growth look throughout the year and does that pretty much moderate into next year?\n\nThat's helpful. Yeah. And then a quick one on SG&A. So previously you talked about mid-single digit SG&A store growth for the year and came in at the higher end in one Q despite softer sales.\n\nclearer. Got it.\n\nsignificantly compared to the first four-week segment and the third And that middle four-week four-week segment. Hope that's a little\n\nSo it was really a wobble in the middle four-week segments, not related to the customer, per se, more related to the impacts from last year, both positive weather event due to hurricanes and a cold snap that happened last year as opposed to something that really segment, as we mentioned, was down deteriorated in this year.\n\nThe middle section of that segment year over year, you had some changes in weather. In more of the northern markets, and you had the impact from the hurricane that benefited us last year that did not reoccur this year.\n\nYeah, I wouldn't say that the demand has necessarily deteriorated. As we mentioned, kind of that weather segment in the middle of the, you know, we broke the quarter down into the 12-week quarter down into four-week segments.\n\nHi, guys. It's Brad Rowan for Chris. Thanks for taking the question. So on DIY, given the sequential slowdown, I know you said weather was a headwind in the middle four weeks, but can you help us parse out how much of that was additional attributable to any government shutdown noise or like any sort of observable deterioration in the underlying trend or demand?\n\nThank you. Your next question is coming from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is live.\n\nGreat. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nWe're growing across all of the four segments. Pretty healthily.\n\nYou know, that you would consider branded national accounts. But we're growing share of wallet in all of those segments. National accounts, what we call up and down the street customers, which are, you know, generally the local mom and pop shop, as well as what we call verticals and associations.\n\nYeah, we're growing on the commercial side of the business in all of the different segments that we break out. Obviously, to your point, there's not a lot of new national accounts.\n\nI mean, obviously not a lot of new national accounts entering the market. Is this skewed more to up and down the street business?\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. Quick question on the commercial growth on a two, three-year basis. Could you sort of parse out what might be national account versus domestic?\n\nSo most of the U.S. expansion is done. It'll be about improving efficiencies. Mexico, we'll be we'll be done effectively in March or April. And that'll take us for quite some time, for the next couple of years from the supply chain perspective.\n\nTo almost double the size, and that will be fully operational probably in March. Then, we're bringing our distribution from third-party to our own supply chain down in Brazil, which should help us for quite some time.\n\nIn Mexico, as we've talked about, we opened up a new DC and expanded one and we're in the process of expanding our Monterey distribution center.\n\nMost of those investments in the U.S. have already been in place, and stood up those two new DCs we opened up last year. There's also some new efficiency strategies built in those distribution centers as well as some direct import facilities.\n\nMaybe I'll add on a little bit to that. We, you know, we've talked a lot about this project we've had in place for several years now, which is supply chain 2030, which is really looking at what did our supply chain need to look like to get us to these faster growing store numbers.\n\nSo that two points of SG&A that I talked about, you know, includes all the investments that we need to make, you know, across the business.\n\nThose have come online, and we're getting the productivity out of them. We're also investing in distribution centers in Mexico and Brazil and all of this will underpin the growth.\n\nAs it relates to investments, you know, obviously we've been investing in distribution centers. We had a couple of new distribution centers that we put in over the last couple of years or so.\n\nAnd then you'll see that sort of lop off and we'll return to the kind of operating margins that we that we have in the past.\n\nWe've got about 100 of those in the pipeline today. And we feel very good about our execution there. So as we look at, you know, the way our operating margins will progress, you know, between now and then, you'll see this roughly two points of incremental SG&A associated with this with this ramp, if you will.\n\nAnd you'll see this ramp, you know, continue as we peak at the 500 stores globally that we're expecting in FY28. You know, what has us excited is, you know, in addition to the new satellite stores that we're building, we're also building out our mega hub footprint, which, as we mentioned, is going to grow to 300 mega hubs.\n\nOur teams do a great job of getting those assets into the market and then building our business around them. You know, regarding SG&A, we had about two points of the growth in our SG&A that was related to new stores and the acceleration of our commercial programs.\n\nYeah, thanks for your question, Brett. So, you know, typically our new stores mature on about a four to five-year timeframe, if you will. And, you know, we've seen this historically over time, and it's fairly predictable.\n\nI mean, you're sort of trying to think about domestic P&A expense at the front, but when do we start getting the return?\n\nYou know, as as far as the ramp and then incremental investment that's required, I think you're talking about a couple of DCs internationally, but as far as domestic store growth, are there more DCs or accelerated hub expansion as you build this new store base?\n\nCould you talk about the maturation schedule of the new stores now that it's become a very, you know, I guess a more significant item?\n\nGood morning.\n\nguys. What up?\n\nHey, good morning,\n\nYour line is\n\nOnce again, if you have any questions or comments, please press star one on your phone. Your first question is coming from Brett Jordan from Jeffries.\n\nWe do ask that while posing your question, please pick up your handset if you're listening on speakerphone to provide optimum sound quality. We do ask that participants please ask one question and one follow-up, then re-enter the queue.\n\nCertainly. Everyone at this time will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you have any questions or comments, please press star one on your phone at this time.\n\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions.\n\nWe are excited about what we can accomplish in this new year, and our AutoZoners are well prepared to deliver on our commitments. We believe AutoZone's best days are ahead of us.\n\nFiscal 2026 top operating priorities will continue to be based on improving execution and delivering wow customer service. We will continue to invest in the following strategic projects: remaining focused on driving DIY or do-it-yourself and commercial sales growth, which will which we are doing in a meaningful way; ramping up our domestic and international store growth; drive our new and mega hub openings; and focus on optimizing our new distribution centers and our supply chain capabilities.\n\nBut we understand that we cannot take things for granted. We must remain laser-focused on customer service, flawless execution, and gaining share in every market in which we operate.\n\nThe top focus areas for 2026 will be growing share in our domestic commercial business and continuing our momentum in international. We are excited about we can what we can accomplish in this second quarter.\n\nWe continue to put our capital to work where it will have the biggest impact on our sales and long-term profitability. That's our stores, our distribution centers, and investing in technology to build a superior customer experience.\n\nWith both our retail and our DIY customers, we expect to manage our gross margins effectively and grow our operating expense in line with an accelerated store opening assumption.\n\nWe are committed to flawless execution and wisely spending our capital to drive growth and efficiency. We feel we are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and our international store base.\n\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Phil. Thank you, Jamire. We are excited to start the calendar of 2026. We have a lot to accomplish this fiscal year.\n\nAnd lastly, in Q2, we expect LIFO to reduce EBIT by approximately $60 million, impact our gross margin rate by approximately 140 basis points, and our EPS by approximately $2.70 a share.\n\nIf yesterday's spot rates held for Q2, then we expect an approximate 57 million benefit to revenue, an 18 million benefit to EBIT, and a 77 cents a share benefit to EPS.\n\nWe're generally don't take on transactional risks, so our results primarily reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes. As mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a tailwind to revenue and EPS.\n\nWe continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. Before handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance.\n\nOur strategy continues to work as we remain focused on gaining market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to the rest of FY26, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient domestic DIY business, a faster-growing domestic commercial business, and an international business that is continuing to grow share in a meaningful way.\n\nTo wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings in cash, and returning excess cash to our shareholders.\n\nWe remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\n\nWe have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.\n\nWe repurchased 431 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter-end, we had $1.7 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our ongoing strong earnings balance sheet and powerful free cash generation allows us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through our buyback program.\n\nAs a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 115.6% versus last year's Q1 of 119.5%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program.\n\nNet inventory defined as merchandise inventory is less accounts payable on a per-store basis, was a negative $145,000 versus negative $166,000 last year, and negative $131,000 last quarter.\n\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5 times EBITDA. Our inventory per store was up 9.1% versus Q1 last year, while total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period last year, driven by new stores, additional inventory investment to support our growth initiatives, and inflation.\n\nWe expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\n\nAs a reminder, LIFO drove our EPS down $4.39 a share. Now, let me talk about our free cash flow for the quarter. We generated $630 million in free cash flow versus $565 million in Q1 last year.\n\nThe combination of lower net income and lower share count drove earnings for share for the quarter to $31.04 down 4.6% versus last year's Q1.\n\nMoving to net income and EPS, net income for the quarter was $531 million, down 6% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.1 million was 1.5% lower than last year's first quarter.\n\nThis quarter's tax rate benefited 186 basis points from stock option exercises, while last year it benefited 72 basis points. For the second quarter of FY25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 22.5%.\n\nWe're planning interest in the $114 million range for the second quarter of FY26 versus $109 million last year. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.7% down from last year's first quarter of 23% driven primarily by higher stock option expense benefit.\n\nAdjusting for the unfavorable LIFO comparison, our EBIT would have been up 4.9% versus the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter was $106 million down 1.3% from a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $9 billion a year ago.\n\nMoving to the rest of the P&L, EBIT for the quarter was $784 million down 6.8% versus the prior year. As I previously mentioned, a non-cash LIFO charge reduced our EBIT by $98 million.\n\nWe remain committed to being disciplined with our SG&A growth, and as the accelerated new stores mature, we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\n\nFor Q2, we expect SG&A to grow similar to the first quarter as the impact of new stores disproportionately impacts payroll, depreciation, and occupancy costs.\n\nWe've been purposefully investing in SG&A in order to capitalize on opportunities to grow our business now and in the near future. These investments will also pay dividends in customer experience, speed of delivery, and productivity, all of which will help us grow market share.\n\nFor Q2, we're assuming 65 to 70 store openings globally, versus 45 last year. For the full year, we expect to open 350 to 360 stores, compared to 304 net new stores opened in FY25.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, and to give investors the opportunity to adjust expectations as we grow store count faster than we have in recent history, we will provide more detail on SG&A growth and store counts.\n\nWe expect to continue to increase our new store opening pace through the end of fiscal 2028 when we reach a total of 500 stores open annually.\n\nOn a per-store basis, our SG&A was up 5.8% compared to last quarter's 4.4% increase. The difference between per-store growth and total SG&A growth is the accelerated new store count that we have driven over the last 12 months.\n\nMoving on to operating expenses, our expenses were up 10.4% versus Q1 last year as SG&A has a percentage of sales deleveraged 69 basis points driven by investments to support our growth initiatives.\n\nWe're planning a LIFO charge of approximately $60 million for each of the next three quarters as we're continuing to experience higher costs due to tariffs that impact our LIFO layers.\n\nWe anticipate continued benefits from merchandise margins next quarter that should help offset the rate headwind from accelerated commercial growth. As I mentioned, we had a $98 million LIFO charge in Q1.\n\nThis quarter, we had a $98 million LIFO charge or $212 basis point unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding the LIFO comparison, we had a 9 basis point improvement to gross margin driven by margin actions which offset a significant rate headwind from the shift to a faster-growing commercial business.\n\nNow, let me spend a few moments on the rest of the P&L and gross margins for the quarter. Our gross margin was 51% down 203 basis points versus last year.\n\nWe remain committed to investing in international expansion and we're pleased with our results in these markets as we accelerate the store opening pace. As we look ahead, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AUTOZONE's future sales and operating profit growth.\n\nOur same-store sales grew 3.7% on a constant currency basis and a positive 11.2% on an unadjusted basis. While sales growth has slowed over the last few quarters in Mexico due to slower economic growth in the country, we've continued to grow our share, and we're well positioned when the economy improves.\n\nNow, I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores in Mexico to finish with 195 stores, and two new stores in Brazil ending with 149 stores.\n\nThese dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives, and macro car park tailwinds we believe will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for the remainder of FY26.\n\nImportantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park, and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers which continues to provide a tailwind for our business.\n\nOn the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 1.5% for the quarter. Our DIY share has remained strong behind our growth initiatives, and we're well positioned for future growth.\n\nWe continue to target having approximately 300 mega hubs at full buildout. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts and local markets closer to the customers while improving our service levels.\n\nWhile I mentioned a moment ago that our average commercial weekly sales per program grew 10%, the 137 mega hubs continue to drive growth at an even faster clip.\n\nThe expansion of coverage in parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These larger stores give our customers access to thousands of additional parts across the market.\n\nWe expect to open at least 30 mega hub locations over the fiscal year, and our pipeline is exceptionally strong. As a reminder, our mega hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive a tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores.\n\nMega hub stores remain a key component of our current and future commercial growth. We opened four mega hubs and finished a quarter with 137 mega hub stores.\n\nThis quarter, we opened 84 net new programs, finishing with 6,182 total programs. We plan to aggressively pursue growing our share of wallet with existing customers and adding new customers.\n\nWe have our commercial program in approximately 93% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we're building our business with national, regional, and local accounts.\n\nOur average weekly sales per program were $17,500 up 10% versus last year. Our commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver strong results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers.\n\nOur domestic DIFM sales were $1.3 billion up 14.5%. For the quarter, our domestic commercial sales represented 32% of our domestic auto parts sales and 28% of our total company sales.\n\nLet me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. First, I'll provide a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business for the quarter.\n\nWe continue to be proud of our results, as the efforts of our AutoZones, as well as our stores and distribution centers, have enabled us to continue to grow our business.\n\nFor Mexico, the peso strengthened just over 6% versus the US dollar for the quarter resulting in a $37 million tailwind to sales, an $11 million tailwind to EBIT, and a $0.44 a share benefit to EPS versus the prior year.\n\nAs Phil stated earlier, excluding our non-cash $98 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have grown 4.9%, and EPS would have been up 8.9%. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our results for the quarter.\n\nOur domestic same-store sales grew 4.8%, and our international comp was up 3.7% on a constant currency basis. Total company EBIT was down 6.8%, and our EPS was down 4.6%.\n\nThanks, Phil. And good morning, everyone. Our operating results remain strong for the quarter and are highlighted by solid top-line revenue. Total sales were $4.6 billion, up 8.2% versus Q1 of last year.\n\nNow, I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nThis is the right time to invest in our business as we believe industry demand will continue to remain strong and we have the ability to grow market share.\n\nWe are also investing in two new distribution centers, one in Mexico and one in Brazil. All while continuing to invest in technology to improve customer service and AUTOZONE's ability to execute on our promise of wow customer service and delivering trustworthy advice.\n\nAnd we expect to invest a similar amount next year. The majority of our investments will be in accelerated store growth, including hubs and mega hubs that place more inventory closer to our customers.\n\nWe are investing both CapEx and operating expense to capitalize on these opportunities. This year, we are investing nearly $1.6 billion in CapEx to drive our strategic growth priorities.\n\nWe continue to invest in improving product assortments in stores and online, and improving efficiency in our supply chain which positions us well for future growth.\n\nIn summary, we have continued to invest capital in opening new stores, driving traffic, and sales growth. While there are always be tailwinds and headwinds in any quarter's results, what has been consistent is our focus on delivering sustainable, long-term results.\n\nToday, we have almost 14% of our total store base outside of the U.S., and we expect this number to grow as we accelerate our international store openings.\n\nWhile we are continuing to gain market share, the economy is experiencing slower growth. As the economy improves, we expect our sales to re-accelerate as we continue to invest in our new stores and distribution centers.\n\nAcross Mexico and Brazil, we now have 1,044 international stores. As I mentioned, our same-store sales grew 3.7% on a constant currency basis behind a softer macro environment in Mexico.\n\nWe will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our international business.\n\nOverall, we are encouraged with our sales performance this quarter. We believe we are positioned well for growth in FY26, and we expect both DIY and commercial sales trends to remain solid.\n\nFor FY26, we expect to continue to open stores in an accelerated pace, and Jamere will share more on our new store development progress in a moment.\n\nAnd we remain committed to more aggressively opening satellite stores, hub, and mega hub stores. Hubs and mega hubs comps results continue to grow faster than the balance of the chain, and we are going to continue to aggressively deploy these assets.\n\nOur future sales growth will be driven by share gains and an expectation that like-for-like retail skew inflation will continue as we move forward. As I said earlier, we opened a total of 39 net domestic stores and 14 stores in our international markets.\n\nLastly, we are very pleased with the growth in our commercial transactions with traffic up 5.9% on a same-store basis as we continue to grow market share.\n\nThese initiatives of delivering share gains and give us confidence as we move further into FY26. Year-over-year inflation on a like-for-like same-skew basis for commercial business was up 6% and grew similarly to our average ticket growth of 6.1%.\n\nOur commercial results have been boosted by our improved inventory satellite store investments, and availability, significant improvements in our hub and mega hub coverage, and continued strength of our Duralast brand and execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and customer service.\n\nThe second four-week segment grew 13.8%, and the third four-week segment grew 14.6%. As with DIY, our commercial sales were impacted during the middle four-week segment due to the weather comparisons to last year.\n\nNext, I will touch on our domestic commercial business. As I mentioned, our commercial sales were up 14.5% for the quarter. The first four weeks grew 15.2%.\n\nIn the last four weeks, due to the weather comparisons and positive impacts from hurricanes in those same markets, we are encouraged by our most recent trends and we expect our DIY business to remain resilient in this environment.\n\nWe also saw DIY traffic down 3.4% as traffic was roughly 2x down roughly 2x in the middle four-week segment versus the first four weeks.\n\nBased on our inflation expectations, we continue to expect our average ticket to grow sequentially through the third fiscal quarter, which ends in May. During the fourth quarter, we will begin to lapse the increases in inflation we saw in this past year's fourth quarter.\n\nWith regard to inflation's impact on DIY sales, we saw like-for-like same-skew inflation up approximately 4.8% for the quarter, the same with our DIY average ticket that was up 4.8%.\n\nOur merchandise categories performed as we would have expected, but less favorable weather comparisons in certain regions definitely impacted our results. More specifically, sales in the northern half of the country outperformed our markets in the southern half of the United States.\n\nRegarding our plus 1.5% DIY comp for the quarter, we experienced a positive 2.1% in the first four-week segment, a flat DIY comp in the second segment, and a plus 2.3% comp during the third segment.\n\nHurricanes drive sales after the storms, and during the cleanup period, and without those storms, this year our sales in some markets were lower. Let me make a few comments on our domestic DIY business.\n\nWhile it got colder in the last four-week segment, it was not until November when we began to get the usual cold winter weather. Also, in a subset of markets in the southeast, where hurricanes occurred last year, our sales were weaker than last year.\n\nWe attribute the weakness in the middle, four-week segment to weather in the month of October that was not as favorable as last year. In a select group of markets, last year we experienced much colder weather in a subset of markets, and this year that did not repeat, which resulted in fewer winter-related parts sales than normal.\n\nNext, I'll discuss the quarter's sales cadence. Regarding our 4.8% quarterly domestic sales same-store sales, the cadence was 5.5% in our first four weeks, positive 3.5% in our second four weeks, and positive 5.5% over the last four-week period in the quarter.\n\nWe are encouraged by our continued improved sales results, and the way we finished the quarter gives us confidence in our sales outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year 2026.\n\nAdditionally, the domestic retail comp performed well up 1.5% but slowed slightly from last quarter's 2.2%. Finally, our international constant currency comp was up 3.7% for the quarter and performed slightly better on a two-year basis than last quarter's result.\n\nWe are very pleased that our domestic commercial sales accelerated again this quarter to 14.5%. This marked an acceleration from our commercial sales growth on a two-year and a three-year basis.\n\nComing into the quarter, we were optimistic that our improved execution would drive sales growth for both retail and commercial. More specifically, we felt the momentum we gained over the last three quarters with our domestic commercial sales would continue this quarter.\n\nWe are very excited about the pace of these openings, and we know that this pace will drive future earnings growth globally. Next, let me address our sales results in a little more detail.\n\nWe opened 53 stores globally this past quarter versus 34 in last year's first quarter. This kind of first-quarter growth is at near record levels for any first-quarter store openings in our history and is indicative of our commitment to accelerate our store growth.\n\nWith over 7,700 stores across three countries, our business is getting more global each day. We finished the quarter with 6,666 US stores and 895 Mexico stores and 147 Brazil stores.\n\nJamere will provide more color for you on our foreign currency impact on our financial results for both this past quarter and the upcoming second quarter later on this call.\n\nOur unadjusted international comp was up 11.2%. This was the first quarter since Q3 24 where FX rates were favorable to our operating profit and EPS.\n\nOur focus is on improving execution, expanding parts availability, and improving the speed of delivery. We are pleased with our results thus far. International same-store sales were up 3.7% on a constant currency basis.\n\nOur domestic DIY same-store sales growth grew 1.5%, while our domestic commercial sales grew up 14.5% versus last year's Q1 and up sequentially from 12.5% on a 16-week basis in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nExcluding this LIFO charge, our EPS would have been up 8.9% versus last year's Q1. We also delivered a positive 4.7% total same-store sales on a constant currency basis, with domestic same-store growth of 4.8%.\n\nAdditionally, I want to point out that this year's gross margin operating profit and earnings per share were negatively impacted by a non-cash $98 million LIFO charge which had a material impact on our margins and EPS.\n\nI'll also address regional disparities where they exist. And finally, I'll address our outlook and how we expect the year to unfold. For the quarter, our total sales grew 8.2%, while earnings per share decreased 4.6%.\n\nI'll discuss both domestic and international results, and break our sales results down between traffic and ticket growth comparisons to address what inflation has meant to both our ticket growth and our sales growth.\n\nDriving our results and our continued success. To start this morning, I'll address our sales results and talk about our new store openings for the quarter.\n\nOur decision-making process starts with asking the question, \"What is right for the customer?\" We strive to deliver on our commitment of providing wow customer service, and it's our AUTOZONERs across our stores and supply chain who deliver on this commitment every day.\n\nPlease click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.

You may begin.\n\nPhilip B. Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2025 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the fourth quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference call to see them.\nTo start out this morning, I want to thank our more than 130,000 AutoZoners across the entire company for their commitment to delivering on the first line of our pledge. AutoZoners always put customers first. Our operating theme for FY '25 was great people, great service, and we have lived up to that theme. Their contributions continue to allow us to deliver solid results. We will continue to succeed as long as we are all working towards the common goal of delivering what AutoZoners call WOW! Customer service.\nTo get started this morning, let me address our sales results. Coming into the quarter, we were optimistic that our focus on improved store execution would drive sales growth for both our retail and commercial channels. More specifically, we felt the momentum we gained over the last 2 quarters with our domestic commercial same-store sales would continue this quarter. We are very pleased that our domestic commercial sales accelerated again this quarter to 12.5% on a 16-week basis.\nAdditionally, our domestic retail comp performed well at 2.2%. Finally, our international constant currency comp remained solid, up 7.2% for the quarter and relatively consistent on a 2-year basis with last quarter's results. We are encouraged by our continued sales results and we are excited about the outlook for the 2026 fiscal year.\nNext, let me touch on a few highlights for the quarter, and then I'll give you a little more color on our execution, the current environment and our outlook. For the quarter, as we continue to focus on what we call WOW customer service, our total sales grew plus 0.6%, while earnings per share decreased 5.6%. I will remind you that last year, we had an extra week in the quarter. If we adjust last year to include only 16 weeks, our total sales grew 6.9% while our earnings per share grew plus 1.3%.\nAdditionally, I want to point out that this year's gross margin, operating profit and EPS were negatively impacted by a noncash $80 million LIFO charge. This charge had an impact on margins and EPS. Excluding this LIFO charge, our EPS would have been plus 8.7% versus last year on a 16-week basis. We also delivered a positive 5.1% total company same-store sales on a constant currency basis with domestic same-store sales growth of 4.8%, our domestic DIY same-store sales grew 2.2% and while our domestic commercial sales grew up 12.5% versus last year on a 16-week basis.\nInternational same-store sales were up 7.2% on a constant currency basis. While our international business continues to comp impressively, we faced over 5 points of currency headwind, which resulted in a lower unadjusted international comp of 2.1%. As you know, the stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our reported sales, operating profit and earnings per share.\nJamere will provide more color for you on the foreign currency impact on our financial results for both this past quarter and the upcoming first quarter later on this call. Specifically related to our domestic commercial business, our focus is on improving execution, expanding parts availability and improved speed of delivery to our commercial professional customers. These initiatives helped us significantly improve our sales results versus last year. Commercial sales were up 12.5% year-over-year on a 16-week basis versus a very strong plus 10.7% in the third quarter and 7.3% in the second quarter. We believe the initiatives we have in place have a long runway and will drive strong results into the future quarters. We are pleased with our efforts and our execution thus far.\nNext, I'll discuss the quarter's sales cadence. Regarding our positive 4.8% quarterly domestic same-store sales, the cadence was plus 4.4% in the first 4 weeks plus 2.4% in the second 4 weeks, plus 6% in the third 4-week segment and plus 6.4% over the last 4 weeks of the quarter.\nBecause this quarter's second 4-week segment had the July 4 holiday, while last year, the holiday fell in the third 4-week segment, we feel it's appropriate to combine the middle 8 weeks of results. Our comp was plus 4.2% over this segment. Therefore, the ramp being plus 4.4%, plus 4.2% and plus 6.4%. We're encouraged by those numbers. We attribute this ramp to both growing market share and the warmer more summer-like weather arriving in mid-July, while last year's warmer weather came earlier in the quarter. This positively impacted both our DIY and commercial sales.\nOverall, we are encouraged with our sales acceleration this quarter, and we are excited to start the new year. Now let me focus for a few more minutes on our domestic DIY business. Our merchandise category segments, failure, maintenance and discretionary were all positive for the quarter. It is very encouraging for us to see the discretionary categories grow at a pace not seen since FY 2023.\nRegarding our plus 2.2% DIY comp for the quarter, we experienced a positive 2.1% in the first 4-week segment, a plus 0.9% in the second segment, plus 1.7% across the third segment and up 4.1% during the last segment.\nWith regard to inflation impact on DIY sales, we saw higher average DIY ticket growth at 3.9% versus like-for-like same SKU inflation up approximately 2.8% for the quarter. We attribute the higher average ticket versus SKU inflation growth to an improved product mix this quarter. We continue to expect ticket inflation to be up at least 3% for the remainder of the calendar year.\nWe also saw DIY traffic count down 1.9%, which was relatively consistent across the quarter, although the best period for DIY transaction performance was our last segment at negative 0.6%, which is exciting as it was also our best average ticket growth in the quarter. This correlated with warmer weather temperatures versus the previous periods. We continue to see data that confirms we are gaining share, and we are encouraged by our most recent trends. We believe we have best-in-class product offerings and customer service. This gives us confidence that we will continue to win in the marketplace.\nFinally, all of our census regions were positive, led by the Northeast and the Rust Belt markets, which were driven by share gains and favorable weather after having a more normal winter and spring weather season. Next, I will touch on our domestic commercial business. As I mentioned, our commercial sales were up 12.5% for the quarter on a 16-week basis. The first 4-week segment grew 11.4%. The second 4-week segment grew 7.3%, the third 4-week segment grew 17.9%, and the last 4-week segment grew 13.4%, including this year's -- excluding this year's additional week.\nAs previously mentioned, the second 4-week segment this year had the July 4th holiday in it, while last year, the July 4th holiday fell in the third 4-week segment. When combining the sales of both second and third segments, sales grew plus 12.5% over those 8 weeks. Overall, we saw a steady increase in the performance throughout the quarter. We are very encouraged with our improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvements in our hub and MegaHub store coverage, the continued strength of our Duralast brand and improved execution in our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and customer service for the professional customers. These initiatives are delivering share gains and give us confidence as we move into FY '26.\nYear-over-year inflation on a like-for-like SKU basis for commercial business was roughly 2.7% and contributed to our average ticket growth of approximately 3.7%.\nLastly, we were very pleased with the growth in our commercial transactions year-over-year, with traffic up 6.2% on a same-store basis. Our sales growth will be driven by our continued availability to gain market share and an expectation that like-for-like retail SKU inflation will accelerate as we move forward. For the quarter, we opened a total of 90 net domestic stores and 51 stores in our international markets.\nFor the year, we opened 304 net new stores, the most since 1996. We remain committed to more aggressively opening satellite stores, hub stores and Mega-Hub stores. Hub and Mega-Hub comps results continue to grow faster than the balance of the chain and we're going to continue to aggressively deploy these assets for FY '26. For FY '26, we expect to continue to open stores at an accelerated pace, and Jamere will share more on our new store development progress.\nAs we move into FY '26, we expect both DIY and commercial sales trends to remain solid as we gain momentum and grow market share behind our growth initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.\nNow let me take a moment to discuss our international business. In Mexico and Brazil, we opened a total of 51 new stores in the quarter and now have 1,030 international stores. As I mentioned, our same-store sales grew 7.2% on a constant currency basis. We remain very positive on our growth opportunities in these markets. Today, we have over 13% of our total store base outside the U.S., and we expect this number to grow as we accelerate our international store openings. We opened 109 international stores for the year, and we expect to open slightly more in FY '26.\nIn summary, we have continued to invest in driving traffic and sales growth. While there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in any quarter's results, what has been consistent is our focus on driving sustainable long-term results. We continue to invest in improving customer service, product assortment initiatives and our supply chain, which all position us well for future growth. We are investing both CapEx and operating expense to capitalize on these opportunities. This year, we invested approximately $1.4 billion in CapEx in order to drive our strategic growth priorities, and we expect to invest a similar amount this next year. The majority of our investments will be in accelerated store growth, specifically hubs and mega hubs that place more inventory closer to our customers. This past year, we also opened 2 new distribution centers, while utilizing our existing distribution centers to drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs and we will continue investing in technology to improve customer service and our AutoZoners ability to deliver on our promise of WOW customer service. This is the right time to invest in these initiatives as we believe the industry demand will continue to remain strong, and we have the ability to grow market share.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Our underlying operating results for the quarter were strong, highlighted by strong top line results. Total sales were $6.2 billion and up 0.6% versus the 17-week quarter last year. On a 16-week comparison of last year, our sales grew 6.9%. Our domestic same-store sales grew 4.8% and our international comp was up 7.2% on a constant currency basis.\nTotal company EBIT was down 1.1%, and our EPS was up 1.3% on a 16-week basis. I do want to point out that excluding our noncash $80 million LIFO charge and reporting on a comparable 16-week basis, EBIT would have grown 5.5% and EPS would have been up 8.7%. As Phil discussed earlier, we also had a headwind from foreign exchange rates this quarter. For Mexico, FX rates weakened just over 5% versus the U.S. dollar for the quarter resulting in a $36 million headwind to sales, a $14 million headwind to EBIT and a $0.57 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year.\nFor the full year, our total sales were $18.9 billion, up 4.5% versus last fiscal year on a 52-week basis. We continue to be proud of our results as the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to continue to grow our business. Let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. And first, I'll give a little more color on our sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business for the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales were $1.8 billion, up 12.5% on a 16-week basis. For the quarter, our domestic commercial sales represented 33% of our domestic auto part sales and 28% of our total company sales. Our average weekly sales per program were approximately $18,200, up 9% versus last year.\nOur commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver good results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program at 92% of our domestic stores which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 87 net new programs finishing with 6,098 total programs. Importantly, we continue to have a tremendous opportunity to both expand sales per program and open new programs. We plan to aggressively pursue growing share of wallet with existing customers and adding new customers.\nMega-Hub stores remain a key component of our current and future commercial growth. We opened 14 Mega-Hubs and finished the fourth quarter with 133 Mega-Hubs stores. We expect to open 25 to 30 Mega-Hub locations over the next fiscal year. As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive a tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. While I mentioned a moment ago that our average commercial weekly sales per program grew 9% and the 133 Mega-Hubs are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q4.\nWe continue to target having almost 300 Mega-Hubs at full build-out. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts in local markets closer to the customer while improving our service levels. On the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 2.2% for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 1.9%, along with a positive 3.9% ticket growth. Over time, we expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth in line with the long-term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.\nOur DIY shares remained strong behind our growth initiatives, and we are well positioned for future growth. Importantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds, we believe, will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for FY '26.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 45 new stores in Mexico to finish with 883 stores and 6 new stores in Brazil, ending with 147. Our same-store sales grew 7.2% on a constant currency basis and positive 2.1% on an unadjusted basis. We remain committed to international, and we're pleased with our results in these markets. We will accelerate the store opening pace going forward as we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales and operating profit growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 51.5%, down 103 basis points versus last year on a 16-week basis. This quarter, we had an $80 million LIFO charge or 128 basis point unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding the LIFO comparison in last year's additional week we had a 25 basis point improvement to gross margin driven by solid merchandise margin improvement.\nNext quarter, we anticipate continued benefits from merchandise margins that should offset the rate headwind from the mix shift to a faster-growing commercial business. As I mentioned, we had an $80 million LIFO charge in Q4, we're planning a LIFO charge of approximately $120 million for next quarter as we're continuing to experience higher costs due to tariffs that impact our LIFO layers.\nMoving on to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.7% versus last year on a 16-week basis as SG&A as a percentage of sales delivered -- deleveraged 53 basis points driven by investments to support our growth initiatives. On a per store basis, our SG&A was up 4.4% on a 16-week basis compared to last quarter's 5.1% increase. We have been investing in an SG&A in order to capitalize on opportunities to grow our business now and in the near future. These investments will help us grow market share, improve the customer experience, speed up delivery times and drive productivity. We remain committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion, down 1.1% versus the prior year on a 16-week basis. As I previously mentioned, a combination of LIFO charges and FX rates reduced our EBIT by $94 million. Adjusting for the unfavorable LIFO comparison and reporting on a constant currency and 16-week basis, our EBIT would have been up 6.6% versus the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter was $148 million, up 2.7% from a year ago on a 16-week basis as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.8 billion versus $9 billion a year ago.\nWe're planning interest in the $112 million range for the first quarter of FY '26 versus $108 million last year, higher borrowing rates have driven interest expense increases. For the quarter, our tax rate was 20.1%, down from last year's fourth quarter of 21%, driven primarily by higher stock option expense benefit. This quarter's tax rate benefited 152 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 80 basis points. For the first quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.2% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. For the full year, EBIT was $3.6 billion, down 4.7% driven by the extra week and $104 million in net LIFO impacts. Excluding the LIFO and currency headwinds, EBIT would have grown 2.7% on a 52-week basis.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $837 million, down 0.5% versus last year on a 16-week basis. Our diluted share count of $17.2 million was 1.8% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of lower net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $48.71, up 1.3% on a 16-week basis.\nAs a reminder, the combination of LIFO and unfavorable FX comparison drove our EPS down $4.14 a share. For FY '25, net income was $2.5 million, down 6.2% and earnings per share was $144.87, down 3.1%. LIFO and FX drove our EPS down $6.42 a share in FY '25.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow. For the quarter, we generated $511 million in free cash flow and $1.8 billion for FY '25. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5x EBITDA. Our inventory per store was up 9.6% versus Q4 last year, while total inventory increased 14.1% over the same period last year, driven by new stores, additional inventory investment to support our growth initiatives and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was negative $131,000 versus negative $163,000 last year and negative $142,000 last quarter.\nAs a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 114.2% versus last year's Q4 of 119.5%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $447 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had $632 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our ongoing strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash allows us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through our buyback program. We have bought back over 100% of [indiscernible] then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.\nWe remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nOur strategy continues to work as we remain focused on gaining market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY '26, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a Brazilian DIY business, a fast-growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is growing share in a meaningful way.\nWe continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners. Before handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so our results primarily reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes. As mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held for Q1 then we expect an approximate $32 million benefit to revenue, a $9 million benefit to EBIT and a $0.38 a share benefit to EPS.\nAdditionally, as you build your FY '26 models, note that we are aggressively building stores, both domestically and in Mexico and expect to build 325 to 350 stores in the Americas in FY '26. The build-out will be skewed to the back half of the year and will make up the majority of our planned CapEx of approximately $1.5 billion.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Phil.\n\nPhilip B. Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. We are excited to start FY '26, we have a lot to accomplish in this new fiscal year. We are committed to improving our execution and driving WOW customer service. We feel we are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and our international store businesses with both our retail and our commercial customers. We expect to manage our gross margins effectively and operating expense is appropriate for future growth.\nWe continue to put our capital to work where it will have the biggest impact on sales. Our stores, our distribution centers, and investing in technology to build a superior customer service experience. The top focus areas for FY '26 will be growing share in our domestic commercial business and continuing our momentum in international. We are excited to get started on our first quarter. But we understand we cannot take things for granted. We must remain laser-focused on customer service, flawless execution and gaining market share in every market in which we operate. This time of year, we also enjoy reflecting on the past 12 months highlights.\nOur teams achieved several impressive milestones this past year. First, $18.9 billion in sales, and we hope to celebrate the $20 billion milestone soon. Domestic commercial sales and an amazing $5.2 billion. Average weekly sales domestically of just over $48,000 a store, equating to just over $2.5 million per store annually. We opened an amazing 195 new stores domestically. This is the most stores we opened annually in the U.S. since fiscal year 2004 over 20 years ago, and we opened a record 109 stores internationally. Globally, we opened a record 304 net new stores, over 43% more stores than the year before. In a week or so, we will be hosting our national sales meeting here in Memphis and we'll discuss with our field leadership, our operating theme for the new year, driving the future together. While improving on our customer service levels will forever be a key theme. This year, we want to celebrate collaboration as a theme to take us even further for the new year.\nOur store assortment and in-stock position are better than they have ever been. So we want to challenge our teams to educate our customers on our product offerings and services. This will only happen if AutoZoners amplify their product availability across our retail and commercial customer bases. Fiscal 2026 top priority -- operating priority will continue to be based on improving execution and WOW customer service. We will continue to invest in the following strategic projects, remain focused on driving our do-it-yourself and commercial sales growth, which we are doing in a meaningful way, continuing to ramp our domestic and international new store growth, drive new hub and Mega-Hub openings, where we are incredibly excited about their continued performance, focusing on improving our new distribution centers and the new supply chain capabilities we have and leveraging our IT capabilities to drive improved customer service and sales. We are excited about what we can accomplish in the new year, and our AutoZoners everywhere are prepared to deliver on our commitments. We believe AutoZone's best days are ahead of us.\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2025 Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results.\nIf not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference call to see them. I want to thank our more than 125,000 AutoZoners across the entire company for their commitment to delivering on our pledge to always put customers first. Their contributions allow us to deliver the consistent performance we have been able to enjoy. We can only succeed if we are all working towards the common goal of outstanding customer service. To get started this morning, let me address our sales results. Coming into the quarter, we were optimistic that our improved execution would drive sales growth for both retail and commercial. More specifically, we felt the momentum we gained last quarter with our domestic commercial sales would continue this quarter.\nWe are very pleased that our domestic commercial sales grew 10.7% for the quarter, marking our first double-digit quarter for commercial growth since the second quarter of FY '23. We also cleared another milestone. For the first time, on a rolling 4-quarter basis, we eclipsed the $5 billion sales mark on commercial. Our domestic retail comp was just north of 3%, which is the best retail growth we have reported since the second quarter of FY '22.\nFinally, our international constant currency comp remained solid, up 8.1% for the quarter. We are encouraged by our sales results and our momentum as we start our fourth quarter. Now let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter, and then I will give you more color on our execution, the current environment and our outlook.\nFor the quarter, with our continued focus on what we call WOW customer service, our total sales grew 5.4%, while earnings per share decreased 3.6%. We delivered a positive 5.4% total company same-store sales on a constant currency basis with domestic same-store sales growth of 5%, our domestic DIY same-store sales growth of 3%, while our domestic commercial sales grew 10.7%.\nOur international same-store sales were 8.1% on a constant currency basis. While our international business continued to comp impressively, we faced over 17 points of currency headwind, which resulted in an unadjusted negative 9.2% international comp. As you know, the stronger U.S. dollar has continued to have negative impact on our reported sales, operating profit and EPS.\nWe expect this trend to continue this quarter. Jamere will provide more color on our foreign currency impact on our financial results for both this past quarter and the fourth quarter. Specifically related to our domestic commercial business, our focus is on improving execution, expanding parts availability and improved speed of delivery. These initiatives helped us significantly improve our year-over-year sales growth.\nCommercial sales were 10.7% year-over-year versus up 7.3% in the second quarter and up 3.2% in the first quarter. We believe the initiatives we have in place have a long runway and will drive strong results in future quarters. We are pleased with our experts and our execution thus far. Next, we found the quarter's cadence to be somewhat predictable with the tax refund season's normal impact on sales. Our domestic same-store sales cadence was 6.7% in our first 4 weeks of the quarter, in our second and 3.1% over the last 4 weeks.\nThe variation being driven by our domestic DIY business with cooler weather, weather and the Easter holiday shifting into our last 4 weeks versus last year falling in the middle 4-week segment. Our commercial comp on the other hand, was more consistent over the 12 weeks of the quarter. This consistency was very encouraging as we build towards future commercial sales growth. Overall, we are encouraged to see the sales acceleration from this past quarter.\nNow let me make a few comments on our U.S. DIY business. While the macro environment and the uncertainty around tariffs have forced customers to be cautious with their spending the consistency of our failure and maintenance businesses continued this past quarter. We saw an improving trend in our maintenance and failure categories on a year-over-year basis.\nDiscretionary categories, the smallest part of our business, have been under pressure for several quarters now. Historically, when our consumer is under pressure, our maintenance and failure categories begin to outperform discretionary categories.\nOur DIY comp was up 6.2% in the first 4-week segment, 2% in the second and up 1% during the last segment. This compares last year's Q3 DIY comps of negative 2.2% in the first 4-week segment, positive 0.1% in the second and negative 0.7% in the last segment. With regard to inflation's impact on DIY sales, we saw both DIY average ticket and average like-for-like SKU inflation up approximately 1% for the quarter.\nWe continue to expect inflation in our ticket to be up approximately 3% over time. And we anticipate average ticket growth will return to historical industry growth rates as we move farther away from the hyperinflation of the last couple of years. We also saw DIY traffic up approximately 1.4%, which significantly improved versus the down 1% we experienced in our traffic trend last quarter.\nWe continue to see data that confirms we are gaining share, and we are encouraged by our most recent trends. We believe we have a best-in-class product and service offering, and this gives us confidence we will continue to win in the marketplace.\nNext, I will speak to our regional DIY performance. We saw weaker performance in the South Central and Western United States, while still showing positive trends, these markets were not quite as strong as the other markets. It was a nice sign for us to see the Northeast and the Rust Belt outperforming for the first time in a while, in fact, outperforming by 250 basis points from the rest of the country.\nWe believe this is a sign of the colder winter and favorable spring weather benefiting us with pent-up demand now leading to better sales for the spring and the summer. Next, I will touch on our U.S. commercial business. Our commercial sales were up [ 10.7% ] for the quarter, and this compares to Q2's plus 7.3% total commercial growth and Q1's 3.2% growth. For commercial, the first 4 weeks of our 12-week quarter grew 9.3%. The second 4-week segment grew 13.6% and the last segment grew 9.3%.\nAgain, the Easter shift allowed us to outperform in the middle of the quarter. More broadly, across the U.S., our commercial business grew at a slower pace in the Northeast and the Rust Belt market versus the rest of the country. The spread was over 200 basis points between the Northeast and the Rust Belt versus the rest of the country. This underperformance in those regions doesn't surprise us as the colder winter weather doesn't show up with jobs to be done at the commercial accounts until later in the summer.\nThere is normally a lag with commercial sales versus what we see in our DIY business. We continue to expect performance in the Northeast and the Rust Belt markets to improve over the remainder of the year as the colder winter weather has historically led to parts failures as the summer goes along. While we have continued to see variation in performance across these more weather-sensitive markets, we remain confident in our initiatives.\nWe are very encouraged with our improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvement in Hub and MegaHub store coverage, the continued strength of our Duralast brand and improved execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and customer service. All of these initiatives give us confidence as we move through the year.\nYear-over-year inflation on a like-for-like SKU basis for commercial business was basically flat and did not contribute significantly to our average ticket growth of approximately 1%. Lastly, we are very pleased with our growth in the commercial transactions year-over-year, with traffic up almost [ 9.8% ] on a same-store basis. Our sales growth will be driven by our continued ability to gain market share and an expectation that like-for-like retail SKU inflation will accelerate as we move forward.\nFor the quarter, we opened a total of 54 net domestic stores. We remain committed to more aggressively opening satellite stores, hub stores and mega hubs. Hubs and mega hubs comp results continue to grow faster than the balance of the rest of the chain, and we are going to continue to aggressively deploy these assets. For the remainder of the year, we expect our store openings to continue to ramp. For our fourth quarter, we expect both DIY and commercial trends to remain solid as our comparisons become slightly easier and we gained momentum from our growth initiatives.\nWe will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as we see trends emerge. Now let me take a moment to discuss our international business. In Mexico and Brazil, we opened a total of 30 new stores in the quarter and now have 979 international stores. As you can see from our press release, our same-stores grew at 8.1% on a constant currency basis.\nWe remain confident in our growth opportunities in this market -- these markets. Today, we have 13% of our total store base outside of the U.S. and expect this number to grow as we accelerate our international store openings. With 58 international stores opened year-to-date, we continue to expect to open around 100 international stores this fiscal year.\nIn summary, we have continued to invest to drive traffic and sales growth. While there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in any quarter's results, what has been consistent is our focus on driving sustainable long-term results. We continue to invest in improving customer service, product assortment initiatives and our supply chain, which all position us well for future growth.\nWe are investing both CapEx and operating expense to capitalize on these opportunities. This year, we expect to again invest approximately $1.3 billion in CapEx in order to drive our strategic growth priorities. As a large part of our CapEx budget for this year, we are investing in accelerated store growth, specifically Hubs and MegaHubs, placing inventory closer to our customers.\nWe have also opened 2 new distribution centers this year, while utilizing our existing distribution centers to drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs, and we are investing heavily in technology to improve customer service and our AutoZoners ability to deliver on our promise of WOW! customer service. This is the right time to invest in these initiatives as we believe industry demand will continue to ramp.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying we had a strong sales quarter. Total sales were $4.5 billion and were up 5.4%. Our domestic same-store sales grew 5%, and our international comp was up 8.1% on a constant currency basis. Total EBIT was down 3.8% and our EPS was down 3.6%.\nAs Phil discussed earlier, we had a headwind from foreign exchange rates this quarter. For Mexico, FX rates weakened nearly 20% versus the U.S. dollar for the quarter, resulting in an $89 million headwind to sales, a $27 million headwind to EBIT and $1.10 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year. Excluding the FX headwind, we would have reported an EPS decrease of 0.6% for the quarter.\nWe continue to be proud of our results as the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to continue to grow our business. Let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. And first, I'll start with a little more color on our sales and growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, our domestic DIFM sales increased 10.7% to $1.3 billion. For the quarter, our domestic commercial sales represented 32% of our domestic auto part sales and 28% of our total company sales.\nOur average weekly sales per program were $17,700, up 8% versus last year. Our commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver good results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We continue to have our commercial program in 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts.\nThis quarter, we opened 49 net new programs finishing with 6,011 total programs. Importantly, we continue to have a tremendous opportunity to both expand sales per program and open new programs. We plan to aggressively pursue growing our share of wallet with existing customers and adding new customers. Mega Hub stores are a key component of our current and future commercial growth.\nWe opened 8 mega hubs and finished the third quarter with 119 Mega Hub stores. We expect to open at least 10 more locations over the next quarter. As a reminder, our MegaHubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive a tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores.\nThe expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network.\nWhile I mentioned a moment ago that our commercial weekly sales per program grew 8%, the 119 mega hubs are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q3. We continue to target having just under 300 mega hubs at full build-out. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts in local markets closer to the customer while improving our service levels.\nOn the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 3% for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic up 1.4% along with a positive 1.5% ticket growth. Over time, we expect to see slightly declining traffic counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.\nOur DIY share has remained strong behind our growth initiatives, and we're well positioned for future growth. Importantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds, we believe, will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for the balance of 2025.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 25 new stores in Mexico to finish with 838 stores and 5 new stores in Brazil, ending with 141. Our same-store sales grew 8.1% on a constant currency basis and negative 9.2% on an unadjusted basis.\nWe remain committed to international, and we're pleased with our results in these markets. We will accelerate the store opening pace going forward as we're bullish on international being in an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales and operating profit growth. Now let me spend a few moments on the rest of the P&L and gross margins.\nFor the quarter, our gross margin was 52.7%, down 77 basis points versus last year. This quarter, we had an $8 million net or a 21 basis point unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding the LIFO comparison, we had a 56 basis point headwind to gross margins. The results were impacted by similar basis point headwinds from higher commercial mix, both domestically and internationally, domestic shrink and new U.S. distribution center ramp-up costs, which more than offset solid merchandise margin improvement.\nWe anticipate that the headwinds from strength in the U.S. distribution centers will largely abate in Q4 and merchandise margin improvement will mute the commercial mix drag. This quarter, we took a $16 million LIFO credit to the P&L as freight costs have continued to trend lower from their peak. At Q3 quarter end, we still had $3 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L.\nAnd as I've said previously, once we credit back the $3 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits as we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve. As a reminder, for Q4 last year, we had no LIFO credits, and we expect no credits in Q4 of this year. I would like to take a moment and discuss the impact of tariffs on our results. For this past quarter, we saw minimal impact from the implementation of tariffs.\nGoing forward, there are several outcomes that may impact our results from tariffs, including vendor absorption, diversifying sourcing, taking pricing actions or some combination of the 3. Currently, we expect these actions to offset any Q4 tariff costs and not have a material impact on our gross margins.\nTo be clear, we intend to [indiscernible] our margin profile post tariffs, and we expect the entire industry will behave in a rational way as our historical experience has shown. Moving on to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.9% versus last year as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 108 basis points, driven by investments to support our growth initiatives and an increase in our self-insurance expense.\nOn a per store basis, our SG&A was up 5.1% versus last year's Q3. We have been investing in SG&A in order to capitalize on opportunities to grow our business now and in the future. We will continue to invest at an accelerated pace on initiatives that we believe will help us continue to gain share. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed of delivery and productivity.\nWe will remain committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth, and we'll manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $866 million, down 3.8% versus the prior year. As I previously mentioned, FX rates reduced our EBIT by $27 million, while unfavorable LIFO comparisons reduced EBIT growth by another $8 million.\nAdjusting for the unfavorable LIFO comparison and reporting on a constant currency basis, our EBIT would have been up 10% versus the prior year, which is below our normal performance driven by the gross margin and SG&A drivers I mentioned earlier. Interest expense for the quarter was $111 million, up 6.6% from a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.9 billion versus $9 billion a year ago. We are planning interest in the $146 million to $149 million range for the fourth quarter of FY '25 versus $144 million last year on a 16-week basis.\nHigher borrowing rates are continuing to drive interest expense increases. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.4% and up from last year's third quarter of 18.1%, driven primarily by higher stock option expense benefit last year. This quarter's tax rate benefited 301 basis points from stock options exercised while last year, it benefited 479 basis points.\nFor the fourth quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.2% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $608 million, down 6.6% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.2 million was 3.1% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of lower net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $35.36 down 3.6% for the quarter.\nAs a reminder, the unfavorable FX comparison drove our EPS down $1.10 a share. Now let me talk about our free cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $423 million in free cash flow versus $434 million last year in Q3. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5x EBITDAR. Our inventory per store was up 6.7% versus Q3 last year, while total inventory increased 10.8% over the same period last year, driven by new stores and additional inventory investments to support our growth initiatives.\nNet inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $142,000 versus negative $168,000 last year and negative $161,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 115.6%, versus last year's Q3 of 119.7%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $250 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had $1.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our ongoing strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash continues to allow us to deliver a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through our buyback program.\nWe have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. So to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nOur strategy continues to work as we remain focused on gaining market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to the remainder of FY '25, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is gaining momentum and growing share.\nWe continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners. Before handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so our results primarily reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes.\nAs mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held for Q4, then we expect an approximate $50 million drag on revenue, a $20 million drag on EBIT and an approximate $0.80 a share drag on EPS.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back to Phil.\n\nPhilip B. Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. We are on track for the remainder of FY '25 to accomplish our goals. We are committed to continually focus on improving our execution and driving WOW! customer service. We feel we are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and our international store bases with both our retail and our commercial customers.\nWe expect to manage our gross margins effectively, and our operating expense is appropriate for future growth. We continue to put our capital to work where we'll have the biggest impact on our sales. Our stores, specifically our hubs and mega hubs, our distribution centers and investing in technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs.\nThe top focus areas for this last quarter of fiscal '25 remain growing share in our domestic commercial business and continuing our momentum in our international markets. We are excited to get started on our fourth quarter. We understand we cannot take things for granted. We must remain laser-focused on customer service, execution and gaining share in every market in which we operate.\nFiscal 2025's top operating priorities are based on improving execution and WOW customer service. we will continue to invest in the following strategic projects, accelerating our domestic and our international store growth, reaccelerating our new hub and MegaHub openings.\nThese stores do take time but we are incredibly excited about their continued performance and most importantly, remain diligent driving our domestic commercial sales growth, which we are doing in a meaningful way. We are excited about what we can accomplish and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering on our commitments for FY '25. We believe AutoZone's best days are ahead of us. Now we would like to open up the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Brian Campbell. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nBrian L. Campbell\n\nVice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nBefore we begin, please note that today's call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Please refer to this morning's press release and the company's annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and the company takes no obligation to update such statements. Today's call will also include non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our press release.\n\nPhilip B. Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2025 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the second quarter, I hope you had a chance to read our press release and learn about this quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.\nAs we begin today, we want to thank our more than 125,000 AutoZoners across the globe for their commitment to delivering on our pledge to always put customers first. Their contributions allow us to deliver the consistent performance we have enjoyed over many years. We can only succeed if we all work together to deliver our goals.\nFirst off this morning, I'll say the quarter played out the way we thought it might. We felt optimistic that our execution could drive sales increases. And we also believed we would experience winter weather earlier in the quarter than we did last year during our second quarter.\nNow let me highlight a few highlights from this quarter and give a little more color on our execution, the current environment and our outlook.\nFor the quarter, with our continued focus on what we call WOW! Customer Service, our total sales grew 2.4%, while earnings per share decreased 2.1%. We delivered positive 2.9% total company same-store sales, with Domestic same-store sales growth of 1.9%; and our Domestic Commercial sales grew 7.3% and were up 10% on a 2-year stack basis.\nInternational same-store sales increased 9.5% on a constant currency basis. While our International business continued to comp impressively, we faced an approximate 1,900 basis points of currency headwind, which resulted in an unadjusted negative 8.2% International comp.\nAs you know, the U.S. dollar has continued to have a negative impact on our reported sales, operating profit and EPS. We expect this trend to continue for the remaining 2 quarters of this fiscal year. Jamere will provide more color on our foreign currency impact for the third and fourth quarters as well as the full fiscal year.\nIn terms of execution, specifically related to our Domestic Commercial business, our focus on improving both availability and speed of delivery helped us significantly improve our year-over-year sales growth. We drove Commercial sales up 7.3% versus up 3.2% in the first quarter. We believe the initiatives we have in place have a long runway and will drive further improvement. We are pleased with our efforts and execution thus far.\nSecondly, the environment did improve as we experienced winter weather earlier than we had the last couple of years. Due to a colder November and early December, our sales noticeably increased. Our Domestic same-store sales cadence was 4.3% in the first 4 weeks, plus 2.8% in our second 4 weeks and a [ negative 1.2% ] over our last 4 weeks. This compares to the previous year's second quarter where domestic sales were a positive 1.4% in the first 4 weeks, a negative 4.9% in the second 4 weeks and a positive 4.4% in the last 4 weeks.\nOn a 2-year basis, GAAP comps were a positive 5.7% in the first 4 weeks, a negative 2.1% in the second 4 weeks and a positive 3.2% in the last 4-week segment. It is important to point out that the Arctic cold that came early this year came later in the last 4-week segment last year. That is why the last 4-week segment was such a difficult comparison for us.\nThirdly, the Domestic variation over the 4-week segment was driven by volatility in our retail business. In fact, for our Domestic retail business, the last week of the quarter was by far the worst week, with our DIY comp being down almost 7%. But it was understandable. That week, for much of the country, was very cold weather, along with heavy snowfall and it hurt our customer traffic. That is what happens during the winter quarter, which is always the most volatile.\nDuring the weeks where weather is extreme, our traffic softened significantly, but returns once people are able to get back out to shop, seem to capitalize on the pent-up demand. Our Commercial comp on the other hand, was much more consistent over the 12 weeks of the quarter. This consistency was very encouraging to us and informs us that we are on the right track to continue future Commercial sales growth.\nWhile the macro environment has continued to force customers to be cautious with their spending, the consistency of our [indiscernible] business continued this past quarter. Weather in Q2 always has such a big impact on our results. With a winter that started earlier, we benefited this year from more related parts sales. Winter also causes discretionary categories to be a lower percentage of our sales mix.\nNow let me make a few comments on our DIY business. Our Domestic DIY results showed an improvement to last quarter as Q2's DIY comp were plus 0.1%. Our discretionary merchandise [indiscernible] continued to be the lowest across domestic DIY sales. For our second quarter, discretionary category sales were approximately 16% of our mix, and they were down on a same-store sales basis. Our belief is that discretionary sales will continue to be pressured until the customer gets some economic relief and consumer confidence improves.\nOur DIY comp was up 2.9% in the first 4-week segment, plus 2% in the second 4-week segment and down 4.3% during the third fourth-week segment. That compares to last year's Q2 DIY comps of 0.7% in the first 4 weeks, negative 6.2% in the second 4 weeks and a positive 4.8% in the third fourth-week segment. With regards to inflation impact on DIY safety, we saw both DIY average ticket and average like-for-like same SKU inflation up slightly for the quarter.\nWe continue to expect that inflation in our ticket will be up approximately 3% over time, and we anticipate average ticket growth will return to historical industry growth rates as we move farther away from the hyperinflation of the last [ 4 ] years.\nWe also saw DIY transaction count down approximately 1%. This, too, was better than the down 1.8% we experienced in our traffic trend for last quarter. While we do not have final share data for the last segment of the quarter, we were encouraged by the recent favorable share trends. We believe we have a best-in-class product offering and service offering. And this gives us confidence that when customers return to their historical shopping habits, we will be the beneficiaries.\nNext, I'll speak to our regional DIY performance. We saw slightly weaker performance in the Northeast, Midwest -- or Mid-Atlantic, sorry, and Rust Belt versus the rest of the country. [indiscernible] markets were up 0.5% versus 1.1% across the rest of the Domestic markets as sales are heavily dependent on winter weather. Winter weather benefited these Northeastern and Rust Belt markets earlier in the quarter, and our sales increased nicely during those times versus Q2 last year.\nHowever, the last week of the quarter was much weaker in the Northeastern and Rust Belt markets as they were down 10% versus the rest of the country being down roughly 1%. Again, weather created a lot of volatility during the second quarter of our fiscal year, we would expect our performance to improve as our customers are now able to get back out and shop.\nNext, I will touch on U.S. Commercial business. Our Commercial sales were up 7.3% for the quarter versus last year, and this compares to 3.2% total Commercial growth in Q1.\nFor Commercial, the first 4 weeks of our 12-week quarter grew 8.8% due to the impact from winter weather previously discussed. The second 4-week period grew 5.9% and the last 4-week period grew 7.1%. Commercial was also impacted the last week of the quarter due to the severe winter storm.\nMore broadly, across the U.S., our commercial business grew at a slower pace in the Northeast and the Rust Belt versus the rest of the country. The spread was pronounced 60 basis points between the Northeast and Rust Belt versus the rest of the country, as many of our customers closed their businesses while these storms roll through these markets.\nWe expect performance in the Northeast and the Rust Belt markets to improve over the remainder of the year as the colder winter weather has historically led to parts failures and increased maintenance as the summer goes along.\nWhile we have continued to see wide variations in performance across the more rather-sensitive markets, we remain confident in our initiatives. We are very encouraged with our improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub stores coverages, the strength of our Duralast brand and good execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and improve cost service, which gives us confidence as we move throughout the year.\nThis quarter, year-over-year inflation on a like-for-like same SKU basis and our commercial business increased versus Q1, contributing to our average ticket growth of 0.5%. Lastly, while ticket growth was slightly positive, we were very pleased with the growth in our Commercial transactions year-over-year.\nOur sales growth will be driven by our continued ability to gain market share and an expectation that like-for-like same SKU inflation will accelerate as the year moves along.\nFor the quarter, we opened a total of 28 net domestic stores. We remain committed to more aggressively opening regular stores, Hubs and Mega-Hub stores. And Mega-Hub comps continue to grow faster than the balance of the chain, and we are going to continually, aggressively deploy these assets. In FY '25, our openings will continue to be skewed to the back half of the fiscal year.\nFor the third quarter, we expect both the DIY and commercial sales trends to improve as our comparisons become slightly easier and we gained momentum from our growth initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.\nNow let me take a moment and discuss our International business. In Mexico and Brazil, we opened a total of 17 new stores in the quarter and now have 949 total International stores. As you can see from our press release, our same-store sales were up 9.5% on a constant currency basis. While slightly below double-digit growth, we remain very positive on our growth opportunities in this market.\nToday, we have just under 13% of our total store base outside of the U.S. and we expect this number to grow as we accelerate our International store openings. For the fiscal year, we expect to open around 100 International stores, and we will accelerate our opening over the remaining 2 quarters of the fiscal year.\nWhile there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in any quarter's results, what has been consistent is our focus on driving sustainable long-term results. We continue to invest in improving customer service, product assortment initiatives and our supply chain. We believe we are well positioned for future upswings in consumer demand. We are investing in both CapEx and operating expense at the right time for market share growth.\nI'd like to recognize all AutoZoners who helped to get our 2 new Domestic distribution centers open this quarter. Both our California and Virginia DC will help us tremendously with the future parts needs of our customers. The Virginia distribution center will be AutoZone's largest DC, and both DCs will deploy new technology and automation. We are very excited by the supply chain efficiencies these facilities will provide us.\nIn summary, we have continued to invest in driving traffic and sales growth. This year we expect, again, to invest more than $1 billion in CapEx in order to drive our strategic growth priorities. We are investing in accelerated store growth, specifically Hubs and Mega-Hubs, placing inventory closer to our customers; distribution centers that drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs; and leveraging technology and our IT systems to improve customer service and our AutoZoners' ability to deliver on our promise of WOW! Customer Service.\nWe believe this is exactly the right time to invest in these initiatives in order to grow market share now and be ready when industry demand ramps up.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, total sales were $4 billion and were up 2.4%. Our Domestic same-store sales grew 1.9% and our International comp was up 9.5% on a constant currency basis. Total company EBIT was down 4.9% and our EPS was down 2.1%.\nAs Phil discussed earlier, we had a headwind from foreign exchange rates this quarter. From Mexico, FX rates weakened 19% versus the U.S. dollar for the quarter resulting in a $91 million headwind to sales, a $30 million headwind to EBIT and $1.22 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year. Excluding the FX headwind, we would have reported an EPS increase of 2.1% for the quarter.\nWe continue to deliver solid results as the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to continue to grow our business. Let me take a few moments to elaborate on this in our P&L for Q2. And first, I'll give a little more color on sales initiatives.\nStarting with our Domestic Commercial business. For the first quarter, our Domestic DIFM sales increased 7.3% to $1.1 billion. For the quarter, our Domestic Commercial sales represented 31% of our Domestic auto part sales and 27% of our total company sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $14,700, up 4.3% versus last year's second quarter.\nOur Commercial acquisition initiatives are continuing to deliver good results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We continue to have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts.\nThis quarter, we opened 27 net new programs, finishing with 5,962 total programs. Importantly, we continue to have a tremendous opportunity to expand sales per program and open new programs. We plan to aggressively grow our share of wallet with existing customers and add new customers.\nMega-Hub stores are a key component of our current and future commercial growth. We finished the second quarter with 111 Mega-Hub stores, and we expect to open at least 19 more locations over the next 2 quarters. As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive a tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores.\nThe expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our Commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network.\nWhile I mentioned a moment ago, our Commercial weekly sales per program average was $14,700 per program, the 111 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q2.\nWe continue to target having just under 300 Mega-Hubs at full build-out. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts in local markets closer to the customer, while improving our service levels.\nOn the Domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 0.1% for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down approximately 1%, along with a positive 1% ticket growth. Our DIY comps were up 2 across 2 periods and down 4.3% over the last 4 weeks, as we were up against a difficult comparison from an extremely cold period a year ago, along with very difficult DIY sales in the last week of the quarter.\nAs we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low single-digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. Our DIY share has remained strong behind our growth initiatives, and we are well positioned when the industry reaccelerates its growth.\nImportantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car parc and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers which continues to provide a tailwind to our business. These dynamics: ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro carparc tailwinds, we believe will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for the balance of FY '25.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 13 new. Mexico finished with 813 stores, 4 new stores in Brazil, ending with 136. Our same-store sales grew 9.5% on a constant currency basis and a negative 8.2% on an unadjusted basis.\nWe remain committed to international, and we're pleased with our results in these markets. We will accelerate the store opening pace going forward as we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales and operating profit growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rental and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.9%, flat to last year. This quarter, we had a $14 million or a 30 basis points unfavorable LIFO comparison to last year. Excluding LIFO from last year's results, we had a 36 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by continued and merchandising margins.\nAs a result, for Q3 last year, we had a $24 million credit. And while this Q3, we're not expecting to record any LIFO impacts. So at quarter end, we still had $19 million in cumulative LIFO yet to be reversed through our P&L. And as I previously said, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits as we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO results. So just to remind you, for Q3 last year, we had a $24 million credit. In Q3 this year, we're not expecting to record any LIFO impacts.\nNow let me take a moment and discuss the impact tariffs could have on our results. Recently, 20% tariffs were instituted on all SKUs purchased from China. Now there are several outcomes that may impact our go-forward results, including vendor absorption, diversifying sourcing, taking pricing actions or some combination of the 3. To be clear, we intend to maintain our margin profile post tariffs, and we expect the entire industry will behave in a rational way as our historical experience has shown.\nMoving on to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6.4% versus last year as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 134 basis points. On a per store basis, our SG&A was up 2.9% versus last year's Q2. While we're managing our SG&A spend on a slower growth environment in a disciplined way, we will continue to invest at an accelerated pay initiatives that we believe will help us continue to gain share. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, either delivery and productivity.\nFrom our past experiences, we believe investing now at a reasonable pace is key for us to gain market share. We will remain committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $707 million, down 4.9% versus the prior year. As I previously mentioned, FX rates reduced our EBIT by $30 million. On a constant currency basis, our EBIT would have been down 0.9%.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $108.8 million, up 6% from Q2 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9.1 billion versus $8.6 billion a year ago. We are planning interest in the [ $10 million ] range for the third quarter of FY '25 versus $104 million last year. Higher debt levels and bond rates are continuing to drive interest expense increases.\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was 18.4% and down from last year's second quarter of 19.6%, driven by onetime discrete items. This quarter's rate also benefited 239 basis from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 360 basis points. For the third quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.2% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. And once again, we suggest investors model Q3 option exercises to be significantly less than Q3 last year, which had 479 basis points of benefit.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $488 million, down 5.3% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 17.2 million was 3.3% [indiscernible] in last year's second quarter. The combination of lower net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter of [ $28.29 ] down 2.1% for the quarter. As a reminder, the unfavorable FX comparison drove our EPS down $1.22 a share.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow. For the second quarter, we generated $291 million of free cash flow versus $179 million last year in Q2. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5x EBITDAR. Our inventory per store was up 6.8% versus Q2 last year, while total inventory increased 10.4% over the same period last year, driven by additional inventory investments to support our growth initiatives.\nNet inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was $161,000 versus negative $100,000 last year and negative $166,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 118.2% versus last year's Q2 of 118.8%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation in our repurchase program. We repurchased $330 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had $1.3 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our ongoing strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash continues to allow us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through our buyback program.\nWe bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of our stock since our buyback conception in 1998 while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined cap allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\nSo to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work, as we remain focused on gaining market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way.\nAs we look forward the remainder of FY '25, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing International business and a Domestic Commercial business that has gained momentum and growing share. We continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners.\nBefore handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so our results primarily reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes.\nAs mentioned earlier in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held for Q3, then we expect an approximately $106 million drag on revenue, a $34 million drag on EBIT and $1.41 a share drag on EPS. And for our fourth quarter of FY '25, we would expect a $101 million drag on revenue, a $37 million drag on EBIT and $1.53 a share drag on EPS.\n0And finally, if rates remained at the current spot rates for the balance of the fiscal year 2025, we would now expect a $356 million impact of revenues, an $18 million impact to EBIT and a $4.82 a share impact to full year EPS.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Phil.\n\nPhilip B. Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. We are excited about where we are striving to accomplish for the remainder of FY '25. We promised to continue to focus on improving our execution and delivering WOW! Customer Service. We are pleased with the progress we have made on our initiatives and feel our investments to grow sales are on track for the back half of the year.\nWe are well positioned to grow sales across our Domestic and our International spaces, with both our retail and our commercial customers. Our gross margins remain solid and our operating expense is appropriately scaled for future growth. We continue to put our capital to work where we'll have the biggest impact on sales and profits, and that is our stores, distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs.\nThe top focus areas for fiscal 2025 will remain growing share in our Domestic Commercial business and continuing our momentum in our International markets. We believe we have a solid plan in place for the remainder of the fiscal year. We know our focus on parts availability, and what we call WOW! Customer Service will lead to sales growth and gains in market share. We are excited to ramp up our efforts calendar 2025.\nWe are going to have a very busy remainder of our fiscal year, and we have to remain the execution machine we have always been. Fiscal 2025's top priorities are based on improving execution and WOW! Customer Service. We will continue to invest in the following strategic projects.\nRamp up our Domestic and International store growth. As discussed, our International teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of just under 10%, [indiscernible] several years of strong growth. Reaccelerate our new Hub and Mega-Hub openings, as we are planning 19 more Mega-Hubs to open in the back half of the fiscal year. These stores do take time, but we are incredibly excited about their continued performance.\nAnd most importantly, reaccelerate our Domestic Commercial sales growth, which we are doing in a meaningful way. We are excited about what we can accomplish and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering on our commitments in 2025. We believe AutoZone's best days are ahead of us.\nNow we would like to open the call for questions."

As we mentioned on our previous conference call, we did not expect the macro environment to positively impact our results. We are, however, optimistic that our improved execution and customer service initiatives are on track. The environment will improve as we experience winter weather, and the uncertainty of the election are now behind us. While the macro environment has led customers to be cautious with their spending, we remain confident that we will continue to gain share over time in both domestic DIY and commercial.\nFor the quarter, with our continued focus on what we call, WOW! Customer Service, our total sales grew 2.1%, while earnings per share decreased 0.1%. We delivered positive 1.8% total company same-store sales with domestic same-store sales growth of 0.3%, and our domestic commercial sales grew 3.2% and up 9% on a 2-year stack basis.\nInternational same-store sales up 13.7% on a constant currency basis. While our international business continued to comp impressively, up almost 14% in local currencies, we faced approximately 1,300 basis points of currency headwind, which resulted in an unadjusted 1% international comp. The stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our reported sales, operating profit and EPS. And Jamere will provide more color concerning the foreign currency impact on our business and what we are thinking regarding the impact on our financial results for Q2 and the remainder of the year.\nWhile there will always be tailwinds and headwinds in any quarter's results, what has been consistent is our focus on driving sustainable long-term results. We continue to invest in improved customer service, product assortment initiatives, our supply chain, and believe we are well positioned for future upswings in consumer demand.\nNow let me dive into our sales results. First off, our domestic DIY results showed a slightly improved -- a slight improvement to last quarter as Q1's DIY comp sales were down 0.4%. Our discretionary merchandise categories continue to be a drag on our domestic DIY sales, similar to the last several quarters. For our first quarter, discretionary category sales were approximately 17% of our mix, and these categories continue to underperform our expectations.\nWhile better on a percentage basis than last quarter's results, we are now comping against last year's mid-single-digit declines in the discretionary categories. Our belief is that sales will continue to be pressured until the customer gets some economic relief and consumer confidence improves.\nWith regard to inflation's impact on DIY sales, we saw the average like-for-like SKU inflation up approximately 1.6% for the quarter, while the average DIY ticket was up 1.3%. The difference between inflation and ticket growth was driven by the mix of goods sold. We were encouraged with the uptick in our average ticket and expect that trend to continue into Q2. We continue to expect inflation in our ticket to be approximately 3% over time and we anticipate average ticket growth will remain -- will return to historic industry growth rates as we move further away from the hyperinflation over the last couple of years.\nWe also saw DIY transaction count down 1.8%. This, too, was better than the down 2% we experienced last quarter. While we do not have final share data for the last segment of the quarter, we were encouraged by the recent favorable trends. We believe we have a best-in-class product and service offering, and this gives us confidence that when customers return to their historic shopping habits, we will be beneficiaries.\nSecondly, I'll speak to our regional DIY performance. We saw noticeable underperformance in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and the rest of what we call the Rust Belt. These markets were down negative 1.8% versus negative 0.1% in the rest of the domestic markets. This doesn't surprise us as these markets have underperformed due to the milder-than-normal temperatures and lower than usual precipitation levels the last couple of years.\nThird, I will address weather and what we believe the impact was on our DIY business. This quarter was impacted by several markets having hurricanes. Although these storms are difficult for our customers and our AutoZoners, they did not have a meaningful impact on our DIY business. Also across much of the country, the weather pattern was similar to the previous year. We do not believe weather played a meaningful role on our DIY performance in Q1.\nNext, I will touch on our U.S. commercial business. Our commercial sales were up 3.2% for the quarter compared to last quarter's 4.5% total commercial growth. The first 4 weeks were the weakest as sales grew only 1.8%, primarily because of the hurricanes. More broadly across the U.S. and similar to what we saw with our DIY customers, we noticed underperformance in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Rust Belt markets. The spread between these markets and the rest of the country was approximately 400 basis points. We exited the quarter with stronger sales and believe we are continuing to gain share.\nWhile we have continued to see wide variations in performance across these more sensitive weather markets, we remain steadfast with our initiatives. We are encouraged with our improved satellite store inventory availability, significant improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage, the continued strength of our Duralast brand and good execution on our initiatives to improve speed of delivery and improved customer service, which gives us confidence as we move through the year.\nThis quarter, on a like-for-like SKU basis, our commercial business was down, which contributed a negative 0.7% to average ticket. The lack of inflation continued to pressure sales. Our sales growth will be driven by our continued ability to gain market share and an expectation that like-for-like retail SKU inflation will accelerate by the end of FY '25.\nFor the quarter, we opened a total of 23 net domestic stores. We remain committed to more aggressively opening regular stores, Hubs and Mega-Hub stores. And for the remainder of FY '25, our openings will be continued to be skewed towards the back half of the year. Hubs and Mega-Hubs lead to better comp results that are growing faster than the balance of the chain and we are going to continually aggressively deploy these important assets.\nFor the second quarter, we expect both DIY and commercial sales trends to modestly improve as our comparisons become slightly easier and we gain momentum from our sales growth initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.\nBefore turning the call to Jamere, I'd like to take a moment and discuss our international business. In Mexico and Brazil, we opened a total of 11 stores in the quarter, and now have 932 total international stores. As you can see from the press release, our same stores were just under 14% on a constant currency basis and accelerated from last quarter's 10%. Today, we have just under 13% of our total store base outside of the U.S. and expect this number to grow materially as we accelerate our international store openings.\nFor the fiscal year, we expect to open around 100 international stores. As you'd expect, we continue to take our U.S. store learnings and introduce them into our international operations. We are very excited about the future in international stores.\nIn summary, we have continued to invest in driving traffic and sales growth. This year, we expect to again invest more than $1 billion in CapEx in order to drive our strategic growth priorities. We are invested -- investing in accelerated store growth, specifically Hubs and Mega-Hubs, placing inventory closer to our customers, distribution centers that drive efficiency and reduce supply chain costs and leveraging technology and our IT systems that improve our AutoZoners' ability to serve our customers. We believe that this is exactly the right time to invest in these initiatives in order to be ready when industry demand ramps up.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil. Good morning, everyone. For the quarter, total sales were $4.3 billion, up 2.1%. Our domestic same-store sales grew 0.3%. Our international comp was up 13.7% on a constant currency basis. Total company EBIT was down 0.9% and our EPS was down 0.10%.\nAs Phil discussed earlier, we had a headwind from foreign exchange rates this quarter. For Mexico, FX rates weakened 13% versus the U.S. dollar for the quarter, resulting in a $58 million headwind to sales, a $17 million headwind to EBIT and a $0.68 a share drag on EPS versus the prior year. We continue to deliver solid results despite the challenging economic backdrop that Phil discussed earlier as the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to continue to grow our business.\nLet me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. I'll start with giving a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business. For the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.2% to $1.1 billion. For the quarter, our domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales and 26% of our total company sales.\nOur average weekly sales per program were $15,900, flat to last year as we lap several new programs that we opened that are not at maturity. Our commercial acceleration initiatives are continuing to deliver good results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We continue to have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts.\nThis quarter, we opened 37 net new programs, finishing with 5,935 total programs. Importantly, we continue to have lots of opportunities to expand sales per program and open new ones. We plan to aggressively pursue growth across our domestic commercial customers, which represents a tremendous sales opportunity for our company.\nTo support our commercial growth, we now have 111 Mega-Hub locations. While I mentioned a moment ago that our commercial weekly sales per program average was $15,900 per program, the 111 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial business in Q1. As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores.\nThe expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We have now set a new objective to have just under 300 Mega-Hubs at full buildout. Our customers are excited by our commercial offering as we deploy more parts in local markets closer to the customer while improving our service levels.\nOn the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was down 0.4% for the quarter. Importantly, we maintained share in DIY, and we're well positioned when the industry reaccelerates. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 1.8%, along with a positive 1.3% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth in line with the long-term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. Our DIY share has remained strong behind our growth initiatives.\nImportantly, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park in a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds, we believe will continue to drive a resilient DIY business environment for FY '25.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in our international markets. During the quarter, we opened 6 new stores in Mexico to finish with 800 stores, and 5 new stores in Brazil, ending with 132. Our same-store sales grew 13.7% on a constant currency basis and 1% on a reported basis.\nWe remain committed to international and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. We are bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future sales and operating profit growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53%, up 16 basis points. This quarter, while we did not book any LIFO adjustments, we did have a $2 million unfavorable LIFO comparison than last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 21 basis point improvement in gross margin driven by continued improvement in merchandising margins.\nAs a reminder, for Q2 last year, we had a $14 million credit, and we do not expect to have any credits this Q2 as freight cost increases are offsetting deflation in the remainder of our cost of goods. At quarter end, we still have $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L. And as I've said previously, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 4.5% versus last year as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 75 basis points. While we are managing our SG&A spend in a slower growth environment in a disciplined way, we will continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and CapEx to underpin our growth initiatives. We believe these investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity, and are important enablers for us to gain future market share. We will remain committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and we will manage SG&A expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $841 million, down 0.9% versus the prior year. As I previously said, FX rates reduced our EBIT by approximately $17 million. On a constant currency basis, our EBIT would have been up approximately 1%.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $107.6 million, up 18% from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $8.6 billion a year ago. We are planning an interest in the $108 million range for the second quarter of FY '25 versus $102.6 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are continuing to drive interest expense increases.\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was 23% and up from last year's first quarter of 21.6%. This quarter's rate benefited 72 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 147 basis points.\nFor the second quarter of FY '25, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock [ option ] exercises. We are assuming Q2 option exercises are less than Q2 last year, which had $23 million of credits.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $565 million, down 4.8% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.4 million was 4.7% lower than last year's first quarter. The combination of lower net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $32.52, down 0.10% for the quarter. As a reminder, the unfavorable FX comparison drove our EPS down approximately $0.68 a share.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow. For the first quarter, we generated $565 million in free cash flow versus $595 million last year in Q1, driven by lower net income and higher CapEx. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished at 2.5x EBITDAR. Our inventory per store was up 5.4% versus Q1 last year, while total inventory increased 8.7% over the same period last year, driven by new store growth and inventory placement to support new growth opportunities. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was negative $166,000 versus a negative $197,000 last year and negative $163,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 119.5% versus last year's Q1 of 124.4%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $505 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter, and at quarter end, we had $1.7 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization.\nOur ongoing strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash continues to allow us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through our buyback program. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\nTo wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to the balance of our fiscal year, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders behind a strong industry, a winning strategy and an exceptional team of AutoZoners.\nBefore handing the call back to Phil, I want to remind you that we report revenue comps on a constant currency basis to reflect our operating performance. We generally don't take on transactional risks, so our results primarily reflect the translation impact for reporting purposes.\nAs I mentioned earlier, in the quarter, foreign currency resulted in a headwind on revenue and EPS. If yesterday's spot rates held for Q2, then we expect approximately a $95 million drag on revenue, a $30 million drag on EBIT and $1.30 a share drag on EPS. And if rates remained at the current spot rates for the full fiscal year of 2025, we would expect approximately a $355 million impact to revenues, $120 million impact to EBIT and a $4.90 a share impact to full year EPS.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Phil.\n\nPhilip B. Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. We are proud of our AutoZoners across the globe and the results our team delivered this past quarter. We promise to continue to focus on improving our execution and driving WOW! Customer Service.\nWhile our sales increases don't reflect it quite yet, we believe we've made meaningful progress on our initiatives and are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and our commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid and our operating expense is appropriate for future growth. We continue to put our capital at work where we'll have the biggest impact on sales, our stores, distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs.\nThe top focus areas for fiscal 2025 will remain growing share in our domestic commercial business and continuing our momentum in international. We believe we have a solid plan in place for the balance of the fiscal year. We know our focus on parts availability and our WOW! Customer Service culture will lead to sales growth and gains in market share. We are excited to start calendar 2025.\nIn September, we hosted our field leadership teams here in Memphis for AutoZone's 2025 National Sales Meeting. The energy and excitement about our plans and what we can accomplish was fantastic. Our operating theme for this new year, Great People, Great Service, was on full display over those 4 days. I could not be more proud of the effort being exhibited across our organization.\nThis year, we will focus on our AutoZoners like never before. We are determined to improve upon an already outstanding culture of customer service. In this difficult macro environment, we cannot rest on our laurels. We have to make sure every store is staffed right every hour of the day. Our processes need to function correctly, always. We must meet our store opening goals and timelines. Simply put, we have to remain in the execution machine that we have always been.\nFiscal 2025 top priorities are based on improving execution and WOW! Customer Service. We will continue to invest in the following strategic projects. Reaccelerating our new Hub and Mega-Hub openings. As we said recently, we now plan to have more than 285 domestic Hubs and Mega-Hubs. These stores do take time, but we are incredibly excited about their continued performance. Effectively and efficiently opening our new distribution centers and optimizing our direct import facility. Ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As discussed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency base of nearly [ 14% ], continuing several years of strong growth. And most importantly, reaccelerate our domestic commercial sales growth.\nAs the macro environment has remained challenging, AutoZoners have been focused on improving execution and leveraging our culture of outstanding customer service. The automotive aftermarket is always going to go through change, and we look to take advantage of that change and focus on gaining additional market share. We are excited about what we can accomplish, and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering better results in 2025. We believe AutoZone's best days are ahead of us.\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the AutoZone's 2024 Q3 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. The company would like to announce the following forward-looking statement.\n\nBrian L.

With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the third quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the Quarterly Earnings Conference calls to see them.\nAs we begin the call, I want to say thank you to our more than 120,000 AutoZoners across all of our businesses for delivering solid earnings results in the face of a difficult macro environment. With our continued focus on providing what we call WOW customer service, our AutoZoners delivered our total sales increase of 3.5%, total company same-store sales up 1.9%, and on a constant currency basis, total company same-store sales of 0.9%. Also, our operating profit grew 4.9%, while our earnings per share grew 7.5%.\nIn spite of our lower-than-planned sales, we managed our business well, and we were able to deliver bottom line results that continue to build on the phenomenal results we've had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere who helped us achieve this quarter's growth. Your dedication to delivering on our commitment of WOW! Customer service is always inspiring.\nBefore I begin my comments on our third quarter sales, as a reminder, the backdrop to this quarter and every third quarter of our fiscal year includes tax refund season. It is roughly a $300 billion influx of cash to our customers. It begins around Valentine's Day and generally last 4 to 6 weeks. These dollars matter to our customers and meaningfully impact their shopping patterns in our stores. This year, refund dollars ended up slightly versus the previous year. However, February refund flows were lower than expected and negatively impacted the first 3 weeks of the quarter's domestic same-store sales.\nWhile the refund flows did catch up later -- in the later weeks, we felt the delayed refunds were a drag on our sales results through February and early March, similar to what you may have heard from other retailers. Secondly, the weather was unfortunately cooler and wetter than we had expected and planned, especially in the Northeast and the Midwest markets. As a result, sales in these markets were noticeably below the remaining markets with this pattern more pronounced over the last 8 weeks of our 12-week quarter. Again, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives hard part failures and accelerates maintenance over time, thereby driving higher sales.\nSo on balance, we believe this quarter's sales were impacted negatively by the late start of the tax refund season, while the last 8 weeks were impacted by cooler than weather than we had planned. Despite these headwinds, we also had many successes. We gained share in our retail business, and we believe we continue to gain share in commercial. We continue to be encouraged by our supply chain initiatives. The construction of our 2 new domestic DCs are on track for Q2 FY '25 opening as well as our continued forward deployment of inventory across both our Hubs and our Mega-Hubs.\nWe continue to see progress on our initiatives within our domestic commercial business that give us confidence about accelerated growth. While it is prudent for us to remain cautious on our outlook for the remainder of the year, we believe sales will accelerate over time.\nWe are excited about our commercial initiatives that are providing deeper parts coverage closer to the customer with faster delivery times, improving customer service, and thereby, driving sales.\nFor the third quarter, our total company same-store sales were 0.9% on a constant currency basis. As we have mentioned, international has become a more important part of our growth story in this quarter. We delivered another strong quarter, up over 9.3% on a constant currency basis.\nWe continue to be very encouraged with both our short-term and long-term growth prospects we have internationally, and we plan to accelerate new store openings and drive operational improvements in these markets over the next several years.\nOur domestic same-store sales were flat this quarter compared to up 0.3% last quarter and up 1.9% in Q3 of last year. As I mentioned previously, we believe our sales were impacted in the first 4 weeks of the quarter by the delayed tax refund season and the last 8 weeks by the mild wet weather pattern across much of the U.S. Domestically, we ran a negative 0.7% comp across the first 4 weeks and collectively across the last 8 weeks of plus 0.3% comp.\nOur commercial business grew 3.3% against last year's Q3 growth of 6.3%. Our commercial results were higher in the first 8 weeks and relatively consistent, but slightly lower the last 4 weeks. The last 4 weeks comparison were the most difficult of the quarter. Weather impact was more pronounced in the last 8 weeks of the quarter, and it was during this time that the regional performance disparities became more apparent. The Northeast and the Midwest underperformed the remainder of the country by close to 200 basis points over the last 8 weeks of the quarter.\nCommercial transaction counts were up and were partially offset by slightly negative ticket growth, which was attributable to similarly negative inflation on a same SKU basis.\nWe opened 20 net new commercial programs and now have commercial in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales for Q3.\nDespite the choppiness in our commercial sales results this quarter, we are planning for a stronger growth rate in Q4 behind continued execution of our growth initiatives and somewhat easier comparisons. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we've been working on over time, improved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality parts and products and technology enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are encouraged by our recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times. As we roll these initiatives to the majority of the chain, we are anticipating faster growth and accelerated share gains.\nRegarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 1% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of 0.6%. DIY ran negative 2% across the first 4 weeks of the quarter, positive 0.1% the second 4-week segment and negative 0.1% comp over the last 4 weeks. Regionally, the Northeast and the Midwestern markets underperformed the remainder of the country by approximately 100 basis points over the last 8 weeks of the quarter, similar to our commercial business.\nHeading into the fourth quarter, we feel weather should be less volatile and we are planning accordingly.\nRegarding our merchandise categories in the DIY business, our sales floor categories, and particularly discretionary categories, underperformed hard parts. We also saw several seasonal merchandise categories and weather-sensitive hard part categories being off our planned results due to the cooler-than-expected weather.\nRegarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down approximately 2%, while our ticket average was up only 1%. We expect our average ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from the higher inflation from the last couple of years. We attribute our previously mentioned DIY share gains to improve customer service levels in our stores and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels driven by most of our vendor partners returning to more normalized operations, meaning recovering from the pandemic sales surge and supply chain disruptions.\nAs we look forward, we are continuing to focus on flawless execution and delivering WOW customer service will drive our accelerated sales growth in our domestic business.\nBefore handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 872 stores opened internationally, or 12% of our store base, this business had yet again impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in our international markets.\nAnd before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our key objectives for fiscal year 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business, and we believe our improved customer service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We are also focused on our supply chain with 2 initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability versus our expanded Hub and Mega-Hub rollouts. And secondly, we are making good progress on adding capacity to our distribution network. We have 2 distribution centers that are nearing completion in the U.S., 1 in Chao Chilla, California, and the other in New Kent, Virginia. We are also very close to completing the expansion of our Tapeje Mexico DC. And last quarter, we broke ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey, Mexico DC.\nOur strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer, driving sales growth with improved speed, expanded parts availability and improved efficiencies. These capacity expansions will underpin our future growth.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid third quarter, with 3.5% total company sales growth, flat domestic comp growth, a 9.3% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 4.9% increase in EBIT and a 7.5% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way.\nTo start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 3.5%, and let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business, our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.3% to just under $1.2 billion and were up 9.6% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were $16,400, down 2.4% versus last year's $16,800.\nNow as a reminder, we have added over 300 new programs over the last 12 months, and these new programs are diluting the overall sales per program. We are, however, extremely pleased that these programs are maturing significantly faster than our historical performance and position us well for the future. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which [indiscernible] accounts. This quarter we opened [indiscernible] programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and look to gain share of wallet with existing customers. Importantly, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us, and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth in the highly fragmented commercial market, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity.\nTo support our commercial growth, we now have 103 Mega-Hub locations with 2 net new Mega-Hubs opened in Q3. Our Mega-Hubs continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs, and grew more than 3x the rate of our overall commercial business in Q3. Our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs, drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone store is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open Mega-Hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to open well north of 200 Mega-Hubs hubs at full build-out. These assets are key to our growth plans.\nOn the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was down 1% for the quarter. As Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down approximately 2%, offset by approximately 1% ticket growth. Overt time, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.\nWhile DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q3, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, miles driven back to prepandemic levels, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally. Our same-store sales grew an impressive 18.1% on an actual basis and 9.3% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 12 stores in Mexico to finish with 763 stores, and 1 store in Brazil ending with 109. We remain committed to international, and given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.\nNow let me spend a few moments on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.5%, up 102 basis points, driven by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 15 basis points from a noncash $24 million LIFO credit in this quarter versus a $17 million LIFO credit in Q3 of last year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 87-basis-point improvement in gross margin.\nOur merchandising and supply chain teams have done an exceptional job of driving gross margin improvement this year. I will point out that we now have $19 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over the next couple of quarters. We're currently modeling approximately $10 million in LIFO credits in Q4 based on the deflation experienced this past year. This compares to $30 million LIFO credit we had in Q4 last year, which means we would have a $20 million net headwind from LIFO in gross profit.\nAs I've said previously, once we credit back the $19 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6% as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 76 basis points. On a same-store basis, SG&A grew 3.3% as we continue to invest in initiatives that drive speed, productivity and improve customer service. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $900 million versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $104 million, up 41% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $9 billion versus $7.3 billion in Q3 last year. We are planning interest in the $148 million range for the fourth quarter versus $109 million last year. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curb are driving this increase, along with the extra week that we will have in this year's fourth quarter.\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was 18.1%, and up from last year's third quarter of 17.4%. This quarter's rate benefited 479 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 595 basis points.\nFor the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.2% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $652 million, up 0.6% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.8 million was 6.4% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of slightly higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $36.69, up 7.5% for the quarter.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow. For the third quarter, we generated $434 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago, and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I will also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of each of our fiscal years.\nWe expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong, and our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.5x EBITDAR. Our inventory was up 7.9%, driven by a combination of inventory per store growth to support our growth initiatives, improvements in in-stock levels along with new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was $168,000 negative versus $215,000 negative last year and negative $164,000 negative last quarter.\nAs a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 119.7% versus last year's 126.5%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $735 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target of 2.5x and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\nSo to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and free cash flow and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to Q4, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a steady DIY business, a fast-growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Phil.\n\nPhilip Daniele\n\nThank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this last quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2024, but we must continue to focus on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting customer first are what defines us. We are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margins are solid and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital investments where they matter most, our stores, distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer service experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' need.\nFiscal 2024's top priority has been enhanced execution. We are making good progress. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new Mega-Hub and Hubs, completing construction on our new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As discussed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of plus 9.3%, continuing several years of strong growth. While I mentioned all these investments in FY '24, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. We continue to believe we have a solid plan in place for growth for the foreseeable future.\nWe know our focus on parts availability and wow customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering the results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

Welcome to the AutoZone's 2024 Q2 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. Before we begin, the company would like to announce the following forward-looking statements.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nBefore we begin, please note that today's call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Please refer to this morning's press release and the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements. Today's call will also include certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in our press release.\n\nPhilip Daniele\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the second quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with the slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website at www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on the quarterly earnings conference call to see them.\nAs we begin this morning, I'd like to say how honored I am to talk with you on behalf of our more than 120,000 AutoZoners. As today marks my first conference call as AutoZone's President and Chief Executive Officer. At AutoZone, our first priority is to provide what we call WOW customer service. This quarter, the efforts of our AutoZoners increased our total sales by 4.6% and total company same-store sales by 1.5% on a constant currency basis. Both our operating profit and earnings per share grew by a very impressive double-digit rates. We continue to build on the phenomenal performance we had over the last several years. Congratulations to our AutoZoners everywhere who helped us achieve this amazing growth.\nBefore I begin my comments regarding our second quarter sales, as a reminder, this is always our most volatile quarter to predict as the timing and severity of winter weather is both meaningful and variable. It is also our lowest sales volume quarter. This year, the Christmas and New Year's Day holidays fell on a Monday compared to Sunday last year. For commercial sales, this really mattered. Sunday is a very low sales day while Monday is one of the best. While weather across the U.S. was very mild for the first 8 weeks of the quarter, we experienced a polar vortex and snow in the last 4 weeks.\nThis extreme weather helped to propel us to stronger results in DIY, but muted our sales in commercial as snow in much of the Eastern United States, stayed on the ground for an extended period of time. Again, weather extremes either hot or cold, drive hard part failures and accelerate maintenance over time. For the second quarter, our total company same-store sales were 1.5% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story in an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, we will continue reporting on our international performance.\nWe encourage you to focus on the same-store sales, constant currency number where International, again, had a strong quarter, up 10.6%. We are very excited about the short- and long-term growth prospects internationally, and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years. Our domestic same-store sales were up 0.3% this quarter compared to 1.2% last quarter and 5.3% in Q2 of last year. Breaking our 12 weeks of sales into the first 8 weeks and then the last 4 weeks, you can see the impact of the holiday shift and the weather volatility.\nDomestically, we ran a negative 1.8% comp across the first 8 weeks and a positive 4.4% comp in the last 4 weeks. This was even more pronounced when splitting these time frames up between commercial and DIY. Our commercial business grew 2.7% against very strong sales last year of 13.1%. Although our commercial business finished stronger than we started, our results were below our expectations. Across the 12-week quarter, we were up 4.1% for the first 4 weeks, then down 0.7% over the second 4-week segment and up 4.4% over the last 4 weeks. Although better in the last 4 weeks segment, of the quarter, our sales were depressed due to the winter storms shutting down many commercial customers, particularly in the mid-south.\nThe holiday shift combined with weather negatively impacted our sales by roughly 2% for the quarter. Despite all this volatility in commercial sales, we are encouraged that we finished the quarter stronger. Commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on over time. Improved satellite and store inventory availability, material improvements in hub and Mega-Hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products and technology enhancements to make us easier to do business with.\nWe recently launched initiatives focused on improving customer service with faster delivery times in commercial, while very early, we are encouraged by the initial results. In commercial, we continue to see higher growth rates for traffic relative to ticket. In Q2, we opened 20 net new commercial programs. We now have commercial programs in 92% of our domestic stores. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales for Q2. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rates will improve as we move through the year. sales growth comparisons get easier in the back half of the year and our execution, customer delivery times, in-stock levels and parts availability continue to improve.\nRegarding domestic DIY, we had a negative 0.3% comp this quarter versus last year's comp of positive 2.7%. DIY ran 0.7% across the first 4 weeks of the quarter, a negative 6.2% across the second 4-week segment and a positive 4.8% comp over the last 4 weeks. The last 4-week time segment was accelerated due to the winter weather, as a reminder, last year, the polar vortex hit in the second 4-week segment.\nI'd like to add some color on our regional performance as well. The Northeast and the Midwest markets underperformed the remainder of the country by 500 basis points in the middle 4-week segment, only to swing to a positive 1,250 basis points overperformance for the last 4-week segment. For the quarter, we saw a 270 basis point favorable performance in the Northeast and the Midwest versus the remainder of the country. Although the Midwest had some extreme cold, we frankly would like to see more winter weather along the East Coast markets, where the winter has been persistently mild for more than 2 years now.\nOverall, for the quarter, the West performed least favorably. Headed into the third quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern, meaning we feel weather will not play a big story, one way or the other. Our Q3 performance is always contingent on a normalized tax refund season and we expect this year to be similar to last year. Regarding our merchandise categories and DIY business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback, particularly from the low-end consumer.\nRegarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, our DIY traffic was down 2.2%, while our ticket average was up 1.7%. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 2% to 4% range as we get further removed from higher inflation last year. We attribute our share gains to improve customer service levels in our store, and our in-stock nearing pre-pandemic levels driven by improved productivity in our distribution centers. While we are up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress. We've made many changes across the organization. From doubling down on many of our long-term execution processes, ensuring that we are hiring the best AutoZoners and reducing turnover, our execution is improving, and we're making steady progress.\nBefore handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on our international business. At 859 stores opened internationally or 12% of our total store base, the business had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in our international markets.\nAnd finally, before Jamere discusses our financial results, I'd like to remind you of our overarching objectives for fiscal 2024. We are focused on growing our domestic commercial business and believe our improved service levels will lead to continued sales growth. We also continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight and drive improved availability. First is our expanded hub and Mega-Hub rollouts. And secondly, we're making good progress on transforming our distribution network. We have two domestic distribution centers currently under construction in the U.S. Chowchilla, California and New Kent, Virginia. We are also nearing the completion of our expanded Tepeji Mexico distribution center.\nAdditionally, we have broken ground on a larger facility that will house our relocated Monterrey distribution center. Our strategy is focusing on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer. driving sales growth with improved speed and expanded parts availability and improved efficiency.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As Phil has previously discussed, we had a solid second quarter, marking our fifth sequential quarter of double-digit EPS growth. This quarter, we delivered 4.6% total company sales growth with a 0.3% domestic comp, a 10.6% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.9% increase in EBIT and a 17.2% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers continue to enable us to drive growth in a meaningful way.\nTo start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total sales were up -- were $3.9 billion, up 4.6% and let me give a little color on our sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 2.7% to $980 million and were up 15.8% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales.\nOur average weekly sales per program were $14,051, down 2.8% versus last year. Once again, the weekly sales averages were impacted by the addition of a significant number of immature programs over the last couple of quarters. I'll also remind you that Q1 and Q2 are our toughest comparisons this fiscal year and we expect our year-over-year comparisons to be somewhat easier in the back half of our fiscal year.\nWe now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 20 net new programs finishing with 5,823 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we seek to grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers.\nImportantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 101 Mega-Hub locations. Our Mega-Hubs continue to average significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs and grew more than 3x the rate of our overall commercial business in Q2. Our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box and serve as an expanded fulfillment source for other stores.\nThese assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We will continue to aggressively open Mega-Hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 Mega-Hubs at full buildout. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was negative 0.3% for the quarter, as Phil mentioned, we saw traffic down 2.2%, offset by 1.7% ticket growth.\nAs we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts. While DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q2, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles.\nIn addition, miles driven are back to pre-pandemic levels. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the remainder of FY '24. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally, our same-store sales grew an impressive 23.9% on an actual basis and 10.6% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 6 stores in Mexico to finish with 751 stores and 4 stores in Brazil, ending with 108. We remain committed to international and given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 53.9%, up 160 basis points, driven primarily by a significant improvement in our core business gross margins and 63 basis points from a noncash $10 million LIFO charge in last year's quarter versus a $14 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 97 basis points improvement in gross margin which increased from last quarter's 70 basis point improvement.\nWe've had exceptional gross margin improvement. And in fact, Q2's gross margin was at the highest gross margin rate we've had since Q2 of FY 2021. I'll point out that we now have $43 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We're currently modeling $15 million of LIFO credits for Q3 based on the deflation experienced in Q1 and Q2. This compares to the $17 million LIFO credit we had in Q3 last year, which means we'll have a $2 million net LIFO headwind in gross profit in Q3. As I've said previously, once we credit back to $43 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 6.1% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 49 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $743 million, up 10.9% versus the prior year driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements. Interest expense for the quarter was $102.6 million, up 56% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $7 billion at Q2 end last year. We're planning interest in the $105 million range for the third quarter of FY '24 versus $74.3 million last year.\nHigher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.6% and down from last year's second quarter of 21.2%, this quarter's rate benefited 360 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 222 basis points. For the second quarter of FY '24, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $515 million, up 8.1% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $17.8 million was 7.8% lower than last year's second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $28.89, up 17.2% for the quarter.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $179 million in free cash flow. We had higher CapEx spending this quarter versus a year ago, and we expect to spend close to $1.1 billion in CapEx this fiscal year as we complete the addition of our distribution center capacity expansion ahead of schedule. I'll also remind you that we generate a majority of our free cash flow in the back half of our fiscal year.\nWe expect to continue to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders. Regarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.4x EBITDA. Our inventory per store was up 1.6% versus last year, while total inventory increased 4.2% driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $164,000 versus negative $227,000 last year and negative $197,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percentage of inventory finished the quarter at 119.8% versus last year's 127.7%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $224 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just over $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. We've bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to a leverage target in the 2.5x area and a disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\nSo to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY '24, we remain bullish on our initiatives to grow sales behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business and a domestic commercial business that remains underpenetrated and should accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy and our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Phil.\n\nPhilip Daniele\n\nThank you, Jamere. I want to stress how proud I am to represent the company as only the fifth CEO over the almost 45 years we have been in business. As you've heard, we have a lot of initiatives in flight and we have a great team of AutoZoners in place to take us to the next level. We truly believe we will continue to improve from here. We are well positioned to grow sales across our domestic and international store bases with both our retail and commercial customers. Our gross margin margins are solid, and our operating expense structure is appropriate for future growth. We are putting our capital expenditures where it matters most. Our stores, our distribution centers and leveraging technology to build a superior customer experience where we are able to say yes to our customers' needs.\nFiscal 2024's top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in various stages of completion. We will continue opening new Mega-Hub and hubs, completing construction on the new distribution centers and optimizing our new direct import facility. We are also in the early stages of ramping up our domestic and international store growth. As you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.6%, much higher than our domestic comps. International has been strong for several years now. While I mentioned all these investments in FY 2024, AutoZone's biggest opportunity remains growing share in our domestic commercial business. While Q2 was below our expectations, we believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the remainder of the year. We know our focus on parts availability and wow customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish and our AutoZoners are committed to delivering results. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Bill Rhodes, Chairman and CEO of AutoZone. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Phil Daniele, CEO-elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the first quarter, I hope you had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.\nAs we begin this morning, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their contributions during the quarter that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states, we lead with putting customers first, which allowed us to grow our total sales by 5.1%, while both our operating profit and earnings per share grew by very impressive high teens rates.\nAs we have previously said, we have been able to continually build on the phenomenal performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023. Our leadership team and I continue to be impressed with our post-pandemic sales performance. To put this in perspective, our FY 2019 sales were $11.6 billion. And now, our trailing 4 quarter sales are $17.7 billion, a 50%-plus increase over a 4-year time horizon. Congratulations to AutoZoners everywhere who made that enormous success possible.\nFor the first quarter, our total sales -- our total company same-store sales were 3.4% and 2.1% on a constant currency basis. As international has become a more important part of our growth story and an area where we are increasingly deploying capital, last quarter, we began disclosing our global sales comp. We encourage you to focus on the constant currency number where international, again, had a strong quarter, up 10.9%.\nBoth our Mexican and Brazilian same-store sales had double-digit growth. We are very excited about the short- and long-term growth prospects of international. Our expectations are we will continue to grow both mature store volumes, both in DIY and DIFM, and we plan to accelerate new store openings over the next several years, ultimately getting to a minimum of 200 international new stores by 2028.\nNext, our domestic same-store sales were up 1.2% this quarter compared to 1.7% last quarter and 5.6% in Q1 of last year. Our performance in retail was slightly below our expectations, but still, still resilient in the current environment. Breaking our sales into 3, 4-week segments, our DIY same-store sales were roughly 1% for both the first and last 4-week segments, but were negative 2% in the middle 4 weeks for October.\nCommercial sales, on the other hand, accelerated for the quarter, but we started stronger than we finished. As you know, some of the comparisons over the last few years were distorted. And on a 3-year basis, the performance of each of the businesses this quarter was remarkably similar. Our commercial business grew 5.7% against exceptionally strong comps last year. Importantly, we continue to be encouraged by the new initiatives we have in place to accelerate top line growth in commercial, and those efforts are having a positive impact on our performance.\nAnd as we further analyzed our DIY and DIFM results and specifically, our second period sales slowdown, our retail business was clearly impacted on a regional basis as we saw a 70 basis point performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. We continue to attribute this gap in performance to the lack of winter weather last year and lack of snowfall. But enough about \"what happened to us.\"\nWhile not satisfied with our sales performance, we are encouraged as we enjoyed both dollar and unit share gains in our domestic and retail businesses -- domestic retail and commercial businesses. We previously highlighted that we were not executing at peak levels, and we are encouraged to share that we are seeing steady progress.\nOur in-stock levels are nearing pre-pandemic levels. Turnover, while still elevated, is beginning to decline. Productivity levels in our distribution centers have improved. The technology we deployed to improve service levels to commercial customers is seeing much higher adoption rates, leading to decreased delivery times. And we have opened a significant number of new commercial programs, reaching 92% domestic penetration for the first time in our history.\nEven more encouraging is the continued strength in sales we are seeing from those new program openings as many are only weeks old. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Phil Daniele to give more in-depth quarter on the color -- on the quarter. Phil?\n\nPhilip Daniele\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our domestic same-store sales were 1.2% this quarter on top of last year's 5.6% growth. While we were up against exceptionally strong same-store sales from a year ago, particularly in commercial, we believe we are making progress with more room for improvement. I want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago that we've made many changes across the organization from reinstituting many of our long-term processes to placing share of voice in vitally important areas, ensuring we are hiring the right AutoZoners and execution is improving meaningfully.\nOur domestic commercial business grew 5.7%. We still have work to do, but we were pleased with the improvements we saw in this business. As the business began improving, we believe we grew share and set another record for the quarter with $1.1 billion in commercial sales. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales for quarter 1. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years.\nImproved satellite store inventory availability, material improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage, adding new Hubs and Mega-Hubs, the strength of the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products and technological enhancements that make us easier to do business with. We are also operating more efficiently with improvements in delivery times and enhanced sales force effectiveness.\nIn Q1, we opened 121 net new commercial programs, opening the majority of them in the back half of the quarter. 69 of those 121 programs opened in week 7 through 12 of the quarter. While programs that opened late in the quarter have minimal sales impact on the quarter, they do position us for sales growth for the remainder of FY '24 and beyond.\nAs Bill previously shared, I want to reiterate, we now have commercial in approximately 92% of our domestic stores. When I was SVP of Commercial, we didn't have line of sight to reaching that level of penetration. It really is a great sign of the progress that we've made over the last 5 years or so. We believe our commercial business will get stronger and growth rates should improve as we move through the year as comps get easier and our execution will continue to improve.\nRegarding domestic DIY, we had flat comps this quarter on top of last year's comp of 2.6%. While the data we have available to us indicates we continue to gain share in both dollars and units, our comp is below our expectations but in line with what we are seeing across the industry. Regarding weather, it was quite mild this quarter. It is this time of year when our sales will fade as the summer sales slow down into winter.\nThis year, October was warmer than last year, and sales in weather-sensitive hard part categories in the Midwest and the Northeast underperformed the remainder of the country. While our retail comp was flat for the quarter, we saw the first 4 weeks comp up 1%, the second 4 weeks comp down 2% and the last 4 weeks comp up 0.7%. While our performance clearly improved over the last 4 weeks of the quarter, we fell short of our own expectations for retail for the full quarter.\nAs a reminder, historically, extreme weather, either hot or cold, drives part failures and accelerated maintenance. Regarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 1.6%, while our ticket was up similarly. We expect our ticket growth will return to more normalized levels in the 3% to 4% range as we get further removed from the large increases from last year due to significant inflation, particularly due to freight costs.\nRegarding our commercial trends, we continue to see higher growth rates for ticket -- for traffic relative to ticket. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 230 basis point worse performance between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As the Northeast and the Midwest experienced a very mild winter last year, with below-average snowfall, we sold less weather-sensitive hard parts in this part of the country.\nHeading into the second quarter, we are planning for a more normal weather pattern. But as a reminder, that Q2 is always our most volatile quarter as weather fluctuations can be extreme, meaningfully impacting our short-term sales performance either positively or negatively. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories underperformed hard parts as we saw more discretionary pullback from customers. We do feel the low-end consumer started pulling back on discretionary purchases.\nLet me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw low single-digit inflation. And as a result, our ticket was up roughly 1.5%. We believe inflation for the second quarter will be similar as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels, lapping very high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.\nHistorically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost, and we believe we have entered into one of those periods.\nFor the second quarter, we expect our DIY sales to remain more difficult and our commercial sales trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge. Before handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our other key business priorities for the new fiscal year.\nFirst, we continue to focus on our supply chain with 2 initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded Hub and Mega-Hub rollouts; and secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our distribution network, along with having 2 domestic distribution centers currently under construction. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive growth with speed and expanded availability and efficiency.\nAdditionally, we plan to continue to grow internationally. At 849 stores opened internationally or 12% of our total store base, these businesses had impressive performance last quarter and should continue to grow at a robust pace for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As both Bill and Phil have previously discussed, we had a solid first quarter stacked on top of an impressive first quarter last year with 5.1% total company sales growth, 1.2% domestic comp growth, 10.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 17.4% increase in EBIT and an 18.6% increase in EPS. We continue to deliver solid results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our storage and distribution centers have continued to enable us to drive earnings growth in a meaningful way.\nTo start this morning, let me make a -- take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1. For the quarter, total sales were $4.2 billion, up 5.1%. And let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our domestic commercial business. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 5.7% to $1.1 billion and were up 20.6% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales.\nOur average weekly sales per program were $15,900, down six tenth of a percent. It's important to point out that our sales per program productivity was again impacted by a large number of immature programs that have opened over the last 5 quarters. While these openings depressed the point-in-time productivity metric, we're encouraged by the gross prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business.\nWe have intentionally opened more storage with commercial programs in response to the tremendous opportunity we see to grow our market share. We now have our commercial program in approximately 92% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 121 net new programs, finishing with 5,803 total programs. Our commercial acceleration initiatives continue to make progress as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers.\nImportantly, we continue to have a lot of runway in front of us, and we will continue to aggressively pursue growth opportunities in commercial, which we believe is our single largest growth opportunity. To support our commercial growth, we now have 100 Mega-Hub locations with 2 new Mega-Hubs opened in Q1. The 100 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial programs and grew more than 2x the rate of our overall commercial business in Q1.\nAs a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network.\nWe will continue to aggressively open Mega-Hubs for the foreseeable future, and we expect to have north of 200 Mega-Hubs at full build-out. And these are difficult to find boxes in the right locations, but we are keenly focused on rapid expansion and have 45 currently in the pipeline and growing. On the domestic retail side of our business, our comp was essentially flat for the quarter.\nAs mentioned, we saw traffic down 1.6%, offset by 1.5% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining transaction counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business, driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.\nWhile DIY discretionary purchases were challenged in Q1, we continue to see a growing and aging car park, a challenging new and used car sales market and a consumer that is likely to continue to invest in their existing vehicles. As such, we believe our DIY business will remain resilient for the balance of FY '24.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making internationally. Our same-store sales grew 25.1% on an actual basis and 10.9% on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, we opened 5 stores in Mexico to finish with 745 stores and 4 stores in Brazil, ending with 104. We remain committed to international. And given our success, we're bullish on international being an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.8%, up 279 basis points, driven primarily by a noncash $81 million LIFO charge in last year's quarter versus a $2 million LIFO credit this year. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a very strong 70 basis point improvement in gross margin, which increased from last quarter's 37 basis point improvement.\nWe've had exceptional gross margin improvement. And in fact, we're at the highest gross margin rate we've had since FY 2021. I will point out that we now have $57 million in cumulative LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect this credit balance to reverse over time. We're currently modeling $5 million in LIFO credits for Q2 based on the deflation experienced in Q1. And as I said previously, once we credit back the $57 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild an unrecorded LIFO reserve.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 7.4% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 68 basis points. The increase in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in store payroll and IT to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are paying dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $849 million, up 17.4% versus the prior year, driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements, including the LIFO year-over-year favorable comparison. Interest expense for the quarter was $91.4 million, up 58% from Q1 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $8.6 billion versus $6.3 billion at Q1 end last year. We're planning interest expense in the $98 million range for the second quarter of FY '24 versus $65.6 million last year.\nHigher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 21.6% and up from last year's first quarter of 18.9%. This quarter's rate benefited 147 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 446 basis points. For the second quarter of FY '24, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, up 10% versus last year. Our diluted share count of 18.2 million was 7.2% lower than last year's first quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $32.55, up 18.6% for the quarter.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the first quarter, we generated $600 million in free cash flow. We expect to continue being in an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong, and our leverage ratio finished Q1 at 2.5x EBITDAR, returning to our long-term target. Our inventory per store was up three tens of a percent versus last year, while total inventory increased 3%, driven by new store growth. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $197,000 versus negative $249,000 last year, a negative $201,000 last quarter.\nAs a result, accounts payable as a percent of inventory finished the quarter at 124.4% versus last year's 131%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1.5 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter and at quarter end, we had just over $300 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 3% of the shares outstanding in the quarter.\nWe have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\nTo wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, expanding our margins and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. And as we look forward to the remainder of FY '24, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is reaccelerating.\nI continue to have tremendous confidence in our strategy, in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Phil.\n\nPhilip Daniele\n\nThank you, Jamere. During the quarter, we launched our new fiscal year, and I'd like to take a moment to discuss the key takeaways from our national sales meeting in September. At the meeting, we launched our operating theme for the new year, Live the Pledge. While we have used this theme previously, it continues to deeply resonate with our AutoZoners. Simply put, it differentiates us from everyone else.\nThe energy at the event has never been higher. The pledge is the core of our culture, and I, our Board and our leadership team believe we can never overemphasize our culture. It is defined by helping solve our customers' challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It is based on a team-based approach of recognizing everyone's contributions and performance, putting team goals ahead of personal goals.\nIt sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity. And it's about caring about people, both our customers and our AutoZoners. It's about providing unparalleled career opportunities to a diverse population of AutoZoners, and it's about the AutoZone family. Calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility, and it's so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategy succinctly.\nFiscal 2024's top priority is enhanced execution. Additionally, we have many strategic projects in varying stages of completion. We will continue opening new Mega-Hubs and Hubs. Constructions on our -- construction on our new distribution centers and the optimization of our new direct import facility are a focus as we are also ramping up our domestic and international store growth to achieve 500 annual new store openings by 2028.\nAs you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 10.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now. While I mentioned all of these investments in FY '24, the number one focus for the remainder of the year will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months.\nWe know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to additional sales growth. We are excited about what we can accomplish for the remainder of this year. Finally, I'd like to update you on our leadership transition plan. Next month, Bill will become Executive Chair, and I will become President and CEO. It will be one of the greatest honors of my life to move into that role.\nAnd while that role will come with new opportunities and challenges, I continue to be very bullish about the prospects because I know we have an extraordinary culture in a terrific industry and as you have seen, an ever evolving but exceptional team. As Bill and I both continue to say, and it may sound a little bit cliche, but we both believe it, AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us.\nI want to thank Bill for his wonderful nearly 19-year tenure leading this company and thank him for his leadership. I'm excited about the opportunity to continue to leverage him and his experiences in this new role as Executive Chair. I also want to thank 3 other long-term senior leaders for their amazing contributions to our success: Grant McGee, Charlie Pleas and Al Saltiel with their respective 34, 27 and 10 years of service to AutoZone. They have had an enormous contributions and their legacies will be evident in the teams they have built and the contributions those teams will make over the coming decades.\nI congratulate each of them and wish Grant and Bonnie, Charlie and Doris and Al and Sue, well-earned happiness in their next chapters. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Phil Daniele, our CEO-elect; Jamere Jackson, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the fourth quarter, hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.\nAs we begin, we want to thank our AutoZoners for their incredible contributions during fiscal 2023 that resulted in our solid performance. As our pledge states, they continued putting our customers first which resulted in total sales growth of 7.4% for the fiscal year, while earnings per share increased 12.9%. It's important to remember that these results built on the phenomenal 3-year performance from the pandemic years of 2020 to 2022.\nCandidly, Phil, Jamere, Tom Newbern, and I felt at some point, we would see our sales per store migrate closer to pre-pandemic levels. That hasn't happened, and at this stage, we do not expect it will.\nTo put it in perspective, our domestic average weekly sales per store are 33% higher than in 2019, growing from $35,600 a week to $47,300 a week. This level of growth in sales also drove enormous growth in operating profit, where this year's $3.474 billion was 61% above 2019 when adjusted for the [ 2019 53rd week ]. That is remarkable growth, especially for a 44-year old enterprise. We could not have achieved this success without exceptional efforts across the entire organization.\nWe have several updates for you this morning. First, I'm sure you've noticed a new table in our press release. We are now presenting same-store sales results for domestic, international and total company. We're also reporting our international same-store sales, which includes both Mexico and Brazil, on both an actual and constant currency basis.\nWhy the change? The answer is international is becoming a larger and larger part of our business, and we are investing a sizable amount of our growth capital in those countries. As we evaluate important growth metrics, we think it is important to assess it in total. As we know this is a change, we are committed to providing you with each component individually for at least 5 quarters as our objective is to enhance your visibility.\nNext, our domestic same-store sales were 1.7% this quarter compared to 1.9% last quarter and about half of our fiscal 2023 growth of 3.1%. Our performance in retail was respectable and generally in line with our expectations.\nBut as was well documented last quarter, our commercial sales performance in the second half of our fiscal year declined meaningfully. And to us -- we ended with 3.9% growth in domestic commercial sales. Our performance in both retail and commercial in the first half of the quarter was disappointing. But during this period, we experienced very mild weather.\nAs we reach the second half of the quarter and [indiscernible] escalated materially so did our sales. Specifically, for the first 8 weeks of the quarter, our retail comps were flat, but increased 3.4% in the second half. Commercial experienced a similar trajectory ending particularly strong in the last 4 weeks of the quarter, up over 7%.\nRegarding regional results, we saw a material performance gap between the Northeast and Midwestern markets versus the rest of the country. The total comp difference was well over 300 basis points and over 450 basis points for commercial. We attribute this lack of winter attribute this to the lack of winter weather and snowfall in the latter part of last winter in that region. This has led to lower growth trends in undercar categories. Both those are things that happen to us, not what we did to enhance and improve our performance. Last quarter, we highlighted that we were not executing at our peak levels. We have made many changes since then and are pleased with the improvements in execution we are seeing. We aren't there yet, but we're on a really good path.\nWe also recently completed another strategic review of our commercial business. We have validated our direction and have some exciting new enhancements that we will be testing over the next few quarters. We also made significant improvements in the information technology that we use to operate our commercial business and we opened many more commercial programs, reaching 90% domestic penetration for the first time in our history.\nEven more encouraging is how strong those new openings are starting and how many weeks [ are there ] just a few weeks old. Ultimately, we will operate in a favorable and unfavorable macro and weather environment. We want to share our perspectives with you so you can understand our performance, but ultimately, it is our actions that will determine our long-term success, and we are encouraged by the actions we're taking.\nFinally, our strategy supporting our store operations and commercial teams includes several other key elements. Global new store growth, where we disappointingly didn't achieve our goals in FY '23, more on that later. Continued growth with our hubs and in particular, mega hubs, where we are nearing the halfway point of our ultimate goal of having 200 Mega Hubs and 300 hubs. It is important to reinforce the continued very strong performance of these stores, especially the Mega Hubs and particularly in commercial. Reconfiguring our global supply chain to efficiently process the enhanced sales we have achieved and expect to achieve over the next decade, while optimizing our processes for handling more direct import products from many countries and more challenging slow turning parts assortments that are critical to our success. And finally, continuing to lean in hard on technology improvements to make our AutoZoners more knowledgeable, efficient and effective.\nI've given you the high-level soundbites on the quarter's results. Now I'd like to introduce Phil Daniele to give more in-depth color on the quarter. Phil?\n\nPhilip B. Daniele\n\nSenior Vice President-Commercial & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm honored to be participating in my first earnings release conference call. I will start by reviewing our Q4 overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, and merchandise categories that drove our performance as well as any regional disparities. We will also share how inflation is affecting our gross, our costs and retails and how we think inflation will impact our business in FY '24.\nOur domestic same-store sales were 1.7% this quarter on top of last year's exceptionally strong 6.2% growth. I do want to reiterate what Bill said a moment ago, our execution improved materially over the quarter. and that execution, which is a hallmark of our success, will ultimately deliver better results as we move forward.\nOur domestic commercial business grew 3.9%. Despite lower-than-anticipated, we believe we grew share and set another fourth quarter record with $1.5 billion in sales.\nFor the full year, we generated nearly $4.6 billion, up 8.7% from last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto park sales, which is identical to last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store availability, material improvements in hub and Mega-Hub coverage, in addition to aggressive growth in the number of those types of stores. We continue to strengthen the Duralast brand with an intense focus on high-quality products, and we continue to deliver technological enhancements to make us easier to do business with.\nWe are also operating more efficiently with improvements in delivery time and enhanced sales force effectiveness. In Q4, we opened 156 net new commercial programs opening the majority of them late in the quarter, which had minimal impact on sales but positions us well for FY '24 and beyond. With these moves, we now have commercial in over 90% of our domestic stores. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for commercial sales growth in FY '24 and beyond.\nWe're also very proud of our performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's comp of 1.1%. Additionally, for the year, we delivered 1.8% DIY on top of a 2.9% DIY comp last fiscal year and an 11.2% comp in FY '21. These results are very solid, considering the outsized growth we saw during the pandemic. The fact that we continue to retain the vast majority of the share we built during the pandemic and our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY '24. Now let's focus on the sales cadence.\nOver the quarter, which spans 16 weeks, early May through the end of August, as Bill mentioned, our same-store sales were flat over the first weeks, but increased to 3.4% over the last 8 weeks. We were encouraged by the trends we saw as the quarter ended.\nRegarding weather, in May and June, we experienced cooler and wetter weather trends across the country, which negatively impacted our sales trends. By July, however, it became very hot across much of the country and it remained very hot through August. The heat and the associated rebound in sales helped us partially overcome a relatively mild winter, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast where weather-sensitive hard part categories underperformed our expectation. We anticipate that the summer heat will give us some positive momentum as we head into fall. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, either hot or cold drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance.\nRegarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down 0.8%, while our ticket was up 2%. Our transaction count improved as the quarter went along and in fact, turned positive over the last 8 weeks of the quarter, However, the average ticket being up only 2% was the weakest quarterly increase we've seen since FY 2000 as we lap significantly higher inflation a year ago where the ticket was up 8%.\nRegarding commercial trends, we continue to see traffic and ticket growth, but our commercial ticket growth, just like retail, has shown a marked deceleration compared to recent history as [ hyperinflation ] begins to abate. For perspective, our ticket growth was 11% in Q4 last year versus roughly 2% this year. As expected, some of our commercial customers are experiencing trade down and lower car counts as the consumer comes under economic pressure.\nIn order to continue to grow our comps in '24, we will have to continue to increase share of wallet with our customers. The share data we see continues to encourage us that we are gaining share in the industry despite the macro trends, but recently, not in line with our aspirations, which we intend to change.\nDuring the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did perform differently than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a material 315 basis point difference between the Northeast and the Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and the Midwest performing lower. As the Northeast and the Midwest experienced a very mild winter with below average snowfall, we've seen less weather-sensitive hard parts in this part of the country. Headed into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we are not anticipating that weather will have a significant impact on sales.\nRegarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our sales floor categories outperformed our hard part categories, and our hard part business was essentially flat for the quarter. As I said previously, weather-sensitive hard parts were clearly impacted by the milder winter weather, particularly in the Midwest and the Northeast.\nLet me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw low single-digit inflation. And as a result, our ticket average was up roughly 2%. We believe inflation for the first quarter will be similar to the fourth quarter as the industry is migrating back to pre-pandemic inflation levels and lapping high inflation from a year ago. I want to reiterate that our industry has been very disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue.\nHistorically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation our industry historically has not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost, and we believe we have entered one of those periods. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect our DIY sales to be resilient and our commercial trends to improve. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.\nBefore handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue to focus on our supply chain with two initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability: One is our expanded hub and Mega-Hub rollouts; and secondly, we are making good progress on transforming our supply chain. Our strategy is focused on leveraging the entire network to carry more inventory closer to the customer to drive sales growth with speed to customer and expanded availability.\nAdditionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexican and Brazilian businesses. With 804 stores opened internationally or 12% of our store base, these businesses had impressive performance last fiscal year, and should continue to grow in 2024. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jamere Jackson.\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Phil, and good morning, everyone. As both Bill and Phil have previously discussed, we had a solid fourth quarter, stacked on top of an impressive fourth quarter last year, a 6.4% total company sales growth, a 1.7% domestic comp, a 14.9% international comp on a constant currency basis, a 10.8% increase in EBIT, and a 14.7% increase in EPS. In addition, our results for the entire fiscal year were very strong as total sales grew 7.4% and EPS grew 12.9%. We continue to deliver great results in the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to grow our business and our earnings in a meaningful way.\nTo start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just under $5.7 billion, up 6.4%. For the year, our total sales were $17.5 billion, up 7.4% versus last fiscal year.\nI continue to marvel at the strength of our business [ since ] FY '19. Our sales are up an amazing 47% or nearly $5.6 billion since 2019. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our domestic commercial business.\nFor the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 3.9% to $1.5 billion and up 25.9% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 26% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our average weekly sales per program were approximately $16,700, down 1.8%. Now it's important to point out that our sales per program productivity was impacted materially by the late in quarter openings of approximately 120 new programs. While these openings depress the point-in-time productivity metric, we're encouraged by the growth prospects of these programs and their early contribution to our commercial business. These openings are part of our efforts to open more stores with commercial in response to the tremendous opportunity to grow our market share.\nOur commercial acceleration initiatives are delivering the expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We now have our commercial program in approximately 90% of our domestic stores which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 156 net new programs finishing with 5,682 total programs.\nAs I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY '23, and we feel good about our prospects heading into the new year. For FY '23, our commercial sales were $4.6 billion, up 8.7% versus last year and up 37% from 2 years ago. Importantly, we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we expect to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. To support our commercial growth, we now have 98 Mega-Hub locations with 13 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,700 per program, the 98 Mega-hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint.\nIn fact, our commercial Mega Hub business grew twice as fast as our overall commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. These assets are performing well individually, and the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network. We have an objective to reach 200 Mega-Hubs supplemented by 300 regular hubs in the near term. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited, and we're determined to build on our strong momentum.\nOn the domestic retail side of our business, our DIY comp was up 1.4% for the quarter. For FY '23, our DIY crop grew 1.8% and 4.7% on a 2-year stack basis. The business continues to be remarkably resilient as we've managed to deliver positive comp growth through this cycle. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down slightly and 2% ticket growth. As we move forward, we would expect to see slightly declining traffic counts, offset by low to mid-single-digit ticket growth, in line with the long-term historical trends for the business driven by changes in technology and the durability of new parts.\nImportantly, our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park in a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continues to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, ticket growth, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp. We're forecasting a consistent and resilient DIY business environment for FY '24.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. As you may have noted, we changed our disclosure on our international business, and we will continue to do so going forward. With 12% of our total store base outside of the U.S., the current revenue contribution and the growth prospects moving forward, we simply have to share more about international.\nWe continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 27 new stores in Mexico to finish with 740 stores and 17 new stores in Brazil, ending with 100. Our same-store sales grew 34.1% on a reported basis and 14.9% on a constant currency basis. We remain committed to Mexico and Brazil, and given our success in these markets, we will accelerate the store opening pace going forward. By 2028, after a robust strategic review of the market and ultimate store count potential, we've revised our strategy and anticipate opening as many as 200 stores annually in these markets in a disciplined fashion, making this an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margin. For the quarter, our gross margin was 52.7%, up 118 basis points, driven primarily by a noncash $30 million LIFO credit this quarter. For Q4 last year, we had a $15 million LIFO charge. Excluding LIFO from both years, we had a 37 basis point improvement in gross margin. I will point out that we now have $59 million in LIFO charges yet to be reversed through our P&L, and we expect these to largely reverse over FY '24. We're currently modeling $15 million in LIFO credits in Q1 as inflation continues to abate and we turn our inventory. And as I've said previously, once we credit back to $59 million through the P&L, we will not take any more credits, and we will begin to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 7.6% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged 34 basis points. The accelerated growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends in customer experience, speed and productivity. We are committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 10.8% versus the prior year driven by our positive same-store sales growth and gross margin improvements, including the LIFO year-over-year benefit. EBIT for FY '23 was just under $3.5 billion, up 6.2% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $108.7 million, up 70% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q4 end last year. We're planning interest in the $88 million range for the first quarter of FY '24 versus $57.7 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase.\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was 22.4% and up from last year's fourth quarter of 22.1%. This quarter's rate benefited 22 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 70 basis points. For the first quarter of FY '24, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $865 million, up 6.8% versus last year. Our diluted share count of $18.6 million was 6.9% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count grow earnings per share for the quarter to $46.46, up 14.7% for the quarter. For FY [ '23 ], net income was $2.5 million, up 4.1% and earnings per share was $132.36, up 12.9%.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash and $701 million in free cash flow. For the year, we generated $2.1 billion in free cash. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was down [ 0.6% ] versus Q4 last year, while total inventory increased 2.2% over the same period last year, driven by new store growth.\nNet inventory, defined as merchandise inventory less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $201,000 versus negative $240,000 last year and negative $215,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 124.9% versus last year's Q4 of 129.5%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just over $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 100% of the then outstanding shares of stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts to cash to shareholders.\nWe finished Q4 at 2.3x EBITDA, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDA. However, we remain committed to our leverage objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target in FY '24. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nOur strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. As we look forward to FY '24, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business, a fast-growing international business and a domestic commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders driven by a high degree of confidence in our strategy and our exceptional team of AutoZoners.\nOne last housekeeping point. I'd like to remind you that in FY '24, we will have a 53rd week in our financial results. This extra week will be added to our Q4 results. As a result, our fiscal year will now end August 31, 2024. In order to model that extra week, I encourage you to look at our financial breakouts of both our fiscal 2019 and 2013 4th quarters, which for the last 2 years, we had the extra week, and we show breakouts of the full P&L accordingly.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the New Year, Live the Pledge. I know this sounds like a very consistent theme for AutoZone. In fact, it was the theme we used in my first full year as CEO in 2006.\nI'm asked frequently what differentiates AutoZone from others? My answer goes back to the same point over and over, the culture. I, our board and our leadership team believe we can never emphasize the culture enough. The culture is defined by helping solve our customers' challenges and optimizing the performance of their vehicles. It's based on a team-based approach, recognizing everyone's contributions and performance and putting team goals ahead of personal goals. It sets the standard at exceptional performance, not mediocrity. It's about the AutoZone family, calling yourself a family comes with great responsibility, and it is so much more. The pledge and our values summarize our operating strategy succinctly.\nAs we've accelerated our top line since the onset of the pandemic, our competitive positioning has also materially improved. Our efforts for 2024 will be focused on execution. We have a lot of projects in flight, and we need to get them completed. Supply chain improvements will remain a key focus in FY '24. We will continue with our additions of Mega-Hub and Hub stores, new distribution centers, and international store growth.\nAs you noticed, our international teams posted same-store sales comps on a constant currency basis of 14.9%, much higher than our domestic comp. International has been strong for a few years now.\nThis morning, I'm excited to share after an extensive strategic review of the ultimate number of locations we can have in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, we are announcing our plans for a much more aggressive global store development plan. Over the last 5 years, we've averaged 140 domestic store openings and 50 international openings for a total of roughly 190 new stores a year in the Americas. We plan on accelerating this pace and aspire to open as many as 500 stores 5 years from now. So by FY '28, we are modeling 500 store openings with the split being 300 in the U.S., 200 internationally. FY '24 will remain around 200 but we will ramp from there.\nYou may be asking why this change of strategy and why now? The answer is our profitability per store is materially higher since the beginning of the pandemic. We continue to find new trade areas even in our more mature U.S. markets. Our growth in commercial has materially changed the economics on a per store basis. We believe this is just the beginning on commercial and our ROIC, One of the most important metrics we track is over 50%.\nAlso, our international markets are immature, so we continue to see expansion opportunities in Mexico and Brazil along with putting a toe hold at some point in other new markets. I want to stress that we will be diligent and disciplined. We have a long track record of performance with high returns and strong cash flow generation. We have no plans on changing that strategy and approach where we believe in evolution, over revolution, we believe in continuous improvement, and we believe in test and learn. We have been and remain anchored on our capital allocation strategy.\nWhile I spend time talking about our store development strategies for the future, that is not the key focus for us in FY '24. The #1 focus will be on growing share in our domestic commercial business. We believe we have a solid plan in place for growth over the next 12 months. We know our focus on parts availability and better customer service will lead to sales growth. We're excited as we start 2024.\nThis time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. Our team achieved some impressive milestones this year. $17.5 billion in sales, racing past the $17 billion milestone. DIY comps are 1.8%, most impressively, 15.9% on a 3-year basis. Commercial sales are now $4.6 billion. I personally distinctly remember a goal of $1 billion not that long ago. Average weekly sales domestically of [ $47,600 ] equating to just under $2.5 million per store annually. Our Mexico and [ ALLDATA ] teams both broke multiple records and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count and getting to profitability breakeven on the path to substantial profitability in the future. We bought back $3.7 billion in AutoZone stock, the second highest ever, only behind last year's $4.4 billion. And our team has grown our EBIT by 61% in 4 years, that's remarkable.\nBut we can't rest on our laws, and we aren't without our challenges, that's for sure. As I've said on several occasions, we have to exit pandemic mode. We had to get back to taking care of the customer, and this requires as close to flawless execution as possible. We have to make sure every store is staffed right every hour of every day. Our processes need to function correctly, always we have to meet our store opening goals and time lines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine that we have always been.\nOn June 26, we announced a leadership transition plan and yesterday, we announced the next evolution of AutoZone's senior most leadership team. I've had the honor and privilege of being part of this team for nearly 29 years now, and it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. We, as part of that leadership transition plan announced that I would step away from the President and CEO roles, but remain Executive Chairman in January. As a Board, we've been contemplating this transition for many, many years and began a very robust, well-defined, disciplined process nearly 3 years ago. Our goal was to identify a successor and ensure that successor had a fabulous team with them. I think we've accomplished that goal. The company will be in fantastic hands with Phil Daniele leading it. He loves this business, he's a car fanatic, and has been here for 30 years and in the industry for nearly 40 years.\nWith Jamere Jackson leading the finance and store development teams and Tom Newbern now serving as our Chief Operating Officer, in addition to the balance of our talented executive team, our company is in terrific hands.\nWhile it will be better sweet for me, I'm excited that Phil and the Board have asked me to continue to be very involved for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, I know Phil, Jamere, Tom and I all know this is a team sport. And ultimately, it's not about the senior most leaders in this organization. It's about, in our case, the pledge, our values and most importantly, our culture, which at its core is all about having the best, most passionate AutoZoners taking care of customers and the organization prioritizing AutoZoners and their development or as we say, caring about others.\nYesterday, we announced that other organization changes with the promotion of Bill [ Hackney ], to Executive Vice President, Merchandising, Marketing and Supply Chain. I congratulate Bill, a 38-year AutoZoner, who knows this business exceptionally well, and it's always been a top performer. We also announced that 3 terrific long-term leaders will be retiring around the end of the calendar year. I thank and congratulate [ Grant McGee, Charlie Plus and Al Saltiel ], for their partnership, leadership and friendship for all these years. They leave AutoZone, a massively better organization than they founded many years ago.\nSo changes in the air. Frankly, it always is. It is amazing to me to see how much our leadership has changed over my near 30-year tenure at AutoZone. To me, that's why the culture -- it's why the culture is so important in this organization with a phenomenal culture. It's not about individuals, it's about the team, it's about the goals, and it's about performance. As we begin this transition, Phil and I both shared that not only do we both feel we embody the culture. Both of us believe we are products of this culture. We've learned extraordinary lessons from our three decades at AutoZone, most importantly, always put the customer first, execution wins, people want to play on winning teams and be recognized for their performance, details matter, listen to those closest to the customer and so much more. So on our -- both continue to say, and it may sound like a cliche, but we believe it, AutoZone's best days lie ahead of us.\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Welcome to AutoZone's 2023 Q3 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.

Sir, you may begin.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.\nAs we begin, I would like to thank our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to providing our customers with WOW! Customer Service, which has been the secret to our long-term consistent success. For the third quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 5.8%, which included a 1.9% domestic same-store sales comp. While our top line results were below our expectations at the start of the quarter, our sales improved later in the quarter as we experienced improved weather. We were pleased to deliver operating profit growth north of 9% and EPS growth of 17.5%. Both our operating profit and EPS growth were the highest growth rates we've had in over a year.\nAs many retailers have reported, March was a tough month as cool wet weather impacted customer traffic. In addition, snow accumulations were down significantly in February and March for much of the country, which also had some impact on our business. We mentioned in our last call that weather, particularly during tax refund season really matters. Unfortunately, it was unfavorable this year as our results reflect. We also, after rapid growth and extensive market share gains in commercial, experienced some headwinds this quarter, and our growth was disappointing to us. We were lapping tremendous growth last year and had some internal and external factors that impacted our growth this quarter. We have had some sectors of this business that have been extremely challenged with rising interest rates and high used car prices.\nAdditionally, during our rapid growth over the last couple of years, we also unintentionally deemphasized some of our tried and true disciplines. As I've said for the last 6 months or so, as we exit pandemic mode, we must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution, which I believe will help us reignite top line growth. We have good initiatives in flight in both our retail and commercial businesses, and we are determined to move with urgency to reaccelerate our sales and share growth. Fortunately, as these difference between our domestic same-store sales growth and our total sales growth implies, our international team, particularly in Mexico, delivered very strong sales growth for the quarter. Our teams in Mexico and Brazil continue to do a great job offering differentiated customer experiences, which is leading to strong sales growth.\nThis morning, we will review our third quarter same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance in some regional call outs. We'll also share how inflation is, in fact, impacting our cost in retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY '23.\nMoving to the specifics for the quarter. Domestic same-store sales were up 1.9%. Our net income was $648 million, and our earnings per share was $34.12, increasing 17.5%. On a 2-year basis, we delivered a 4.5% domestic same-store sales comp. And on a 3-year basis, a 33.4% stacked comp. Our 3-year stacked comp was in line with what we've seen in the last 3 quarters. Domestic resale sales were up 2.2% and our domestic commercial growth was 6.3%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records with $1.11 billion in sales as we generated an additional $66 million in sales than in Q3 last year. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we delivered $4.54 billion in annual commercial sales, up a strong 14.4% over last year. We also set another Q3 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,800.\nAs I've mentioned earlier, March was a bit of an outlier in the quarter's domestic sales results. We had a greater than 3% comp in February but fell to a negative 1% in March before recovering back to just under 4% in April and early May. On a regional basis, we experienced slower growth in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets than the rest of the country. This held true for both our DIY and commercial businesses. Our business on the West Coast was in line with our remaining markets. Average ticket grew 4% in retail and commercial for the quarter, decreasing 1% from last year.\nAfter the most significant product cost inflation we have seen in decades, we are seeing those trends moderate and are negotiating some cost reductions from our vendors, as both product cost and freight inflation are slowing or have subsided. Additionally, while not anywhere close to historical norms, we saw wage inflation moderate to approximately 4%. While the staffing environment has substantially improved versus this time last year, we don't envision wage inflation pulling back much from these levels as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures.\nWhile we've had to manage through external forces, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives did just [indiscernible] this past quarter and included new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, Hub and Mega-Hub openings, improvements in coverage, leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we delivered.\nWhile our sales moderated this past quarter, we remain focused on growing our share over time and becoming the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Digging deeper into our domestic DIY business this quarter, we delivered a 0.6% comp. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 4% versus last year, and our transaction count trends were down [ 3% ]. From the data we have available, we continue to gain both dollar and unit share during the quarter. Our sales floor outperformed hard parts with approximately a 3% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales force categories is attributable to both discretionary categories improving and the hard parts category slowing. It was encouraging to see our sales floor items performing so well, specifically batteries, oil and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year. Our friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this summer as we expect miles driven improvements while our growth initiatives continue delivering strong results.\nLet me also address our pricing strategies. In Q3, we continued experiencing mid-single-digit pricing inflation in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the fourth quarter as we are lapping the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expected to slow as the economy slows.\nI want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs.\nWe remain excited about our growth initiatives. Our team's focus on execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both our retail and commercial businesses over the last few years. For our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by our commercial business as we execute on opening additional Hub and Mega-Hub stores, have an improving in-stock position and improve customer service. We also believe our DIY business will remain resilient as the difficult macro environment is pointing customers to continue maintaining their vehicles. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge.\nBefore handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to reiterate our plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil. With almost 800 stores combined across these 2 markets, as previously noted, these businesses had impressive performance again this quarter, and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next 5 years. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future, and we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be successful.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had solid results for our third quarter. This quarter, we delivered a 1.9% domestic comp growth, a 9.3% increase in EBIT and a 17.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3.\nFor the quarter, total sales were just under $4.1 billion, up 5.8%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives. Let me give a little more color on our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased 6.3% to just over $1.1 billion, and we're up just over 32% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 31% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,786, up 1.2%. We experienced growth across both our local customer base and national accounts with locals being the stronger of the 2 categories. Our results for the quarter set another record for highest weekly sales volume in the history of the chain at $92.5 million.\nI want to reiterate that our commercial business is strong, and we believe we grew share despite a deceleration in our growth rates this quarter. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 26 net new programs, finishing with 5,526 total programs. As expected, commercial growth continues to lead [ the way in ] FY '23, and we continue to focus on growing our business faster.\nOur strategy remains intact as we continue to gain share in the industry. And as I have noted on past calls, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses. Once again, I'll add some color on our progress. We now have 85 Mega-Hub locations with 4 new ones opened in Q3. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was roughly $16,800, the 85 Mega-Hub averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and continue to grow significantly faster than our overall commercial business in Q3. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to tens of thousands of additional parts and lifting the entire network for both DIY and commercial. This strategy is working. We will open 22 to 25 new Mega-Hub in FY '23, and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 Mega-Hub supplemented by 300 regular hubs.\nNow many of you have heard me say that in the near term, our commercial business should grow double digits as far as the eye can see, and we've maintained that conviction despite this quarter's results. We are significantly underpenetrated with a 4 or 5 share in an addressable market that is approaching $100 billion. The investments that we have made in our Duralast brand, expanding our coverage and assortment, adding more Hubs and Mega-Hub, building technologies and improving our customer service continue to pay significant dividends and have a long runway. Nothing has changed in our views on what we can accomplish going forward, although we still have work to do to get back to this performance.\nMoving to our domestic retail business. We delivered a 0.6% comp in Q3. Like our domestic commercial business, retail has been resilient, and we continue to grow share and deliver positive comp growth despite a dismal March. We exited the quarter much stronger, and we're focused on execution in Q4. We saw a 4% ticket growth, as Bill mentioned, and we saw traffic down 3% from last year's level. However, excluding the [ middle 4 weeks ] of the quarter, traffic was in line with last quarter when we were down only 2%. This past quarter, we continued to gain unit and dollar share across the retail segment, a reflection of the relative strength of our business.\nOur DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park with both the new and used car markets posing significant challenges for our customers. We expect these markets to remain challenged for a longer period of time than we originally assumed, which should be a tailwind for DIY. These dynamics, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of 2023.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 6 new stores in Mexico to finish with 713 stores and 2 new stores in Brazil, ending with 83. On a constant currency basis, we continue to accelerate our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With just over 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, we are bullish on international growth, and we're adding stores and supply chain capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was up 56 basis points, including a $17 million LIFO credit, which drove 42 basis points of improvement. Excluding the LIFO benefit, our gross margin increase over last year's quarter was driven by higher merchandise margins, which more than offset a drag from the commercial business mix. With this quarter's LIFO gain, we have taken our remaining LIFO balance to $89 million. As I mentioned over the last few quarters, hyperinflation and freight costs was the primary driver for the charges we took in the P&L. Freight costs have continued to abate over the past several months, and we expect this trend to continue and drive a similar LIFO benefit in the fourth quarter.\nAs a reminder, we plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we have taken thus far, and after we have taken P&L gains that fully reversed the charges that we've incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance as we have done historically.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 5.5% versus last year's Q3 as SG&A levered 10 basis points versus last year. As we've said previously, we're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward. We will continue to manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nNow moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $858 million, up 9.3% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $17 million LIFO credit, EBIT would have been up 7.1% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $74.3 million, up 77% from Q3 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7.3 billion versus $6.1 billion at Q3 end last year. We are planning interest expense in the $105 million area for the fourth quarter versus $64 million in last year's fourth quarter. Higher debt levels and higher borrowing rates, especially at the short end of the borrowing curve are driving the increase in interest expense. For the quarter, our tax rate was 17.4% below last year's third quarter rate of 20.3%. This quarter's rate benefited 595 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year's benefit was 284 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $648 million, up 9.3% versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of $19 million was 7% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $34.12 up 17.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO credit, our net income would have increased 7.1% and our EPS growth would have been 15.2%.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $554 million in free cash flow versus $682 million [indiscernible] Year-to-date, we've generated just over $1.4 billion versus just over $1.6 billion a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 4.3% versus Q3 last year, and total inventory increased 7.4%, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis [indiscernible] [ negative ] $215,000 versus negative $216,000 last year and negative $227,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 126.5% versus last year's Q3 of 127.9%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $908 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just under $850 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 6% of the company's total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q3 at 2.3x EBITDAR, and we remain committed to return to the 2.5x area.\nTo wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and growing commercial and international businesses. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered this past quarter. We remain on track to deliver a solid 2023, but we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution in our culture of always putting the customer first are what define us.\nAs Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital, and we continue investing where our returns are the highest. This upcoming quarter will be very busy for us. We'll be opening over 100 stores in the Americas. We also remain focused on those initiatives that we have underway to grow sales in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned previously, we are doubling down on execution and are focused on driving share gains. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now, and we accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners.\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Sir, you may begin.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President, CEO & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\nAs we begin, we'd like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the company for their commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. For the second quarter, our team delivered total sales growth of 9.5% versus 8.6% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. We were pleased with this performance as we were up against 15.8% total sales growth in last year's second quarter. We could not have achieved these results without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Once again, our AutoZoners' efforts generated double-digit domestic commercial growth and single-digit domestic retail same-store sales growth.\nAs we move further and further away from the societal impacts experienced as a result of the pandemic, we are very pleased with our team's ability to not only retain the tremendous growth we experienced over the last 3 years, but continue to grow on top of those phenomenal levels. Our team is relentlessly focused on getting back to normal or, as I call it,quote-unquote \"exiting pandemic mode\". We must get back to our well-known and highly regarded flawless execution.\nIn all candor, we still aren't there yet. But we also have to reignite our innovation engine. We have some very good initiatives in development in both Retail and Commercial, and we have some significant improvements underway in our supply chain as we modernize and expand it for the next decade of growth and beyond.\nWe are halfway through our fiscal year, and we are pleased with our performance so far. More encouraging, we feel good about the balance of the year and know our AutoZoners are keenly focused on delivering great service and terrific performance.\nThis morning, we will review our second quarter same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends; our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter merchandise categories that drove our performance; and some regional call-outs. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of our fiscal year. Let's now move into more specifics on our performance.\nDomestic same-store sales were up 5.3%. Our net income was $477 million, and our EPS was $24.64 a share, increasing 10.5%. Our domestic same-store sales comp was on top of last year's 13.8% and in line with last quarter's 5.6% comp. On a 2-year basis, we delivered a 19.1% comp. And get this, on a 3-year basis, a 34.3% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results despite the comparison to the last couple of years being the hardest quarterly compare for the entire fiscal year.\nNow let me spend a few moments on growth, our growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rates for Retail and Commercial were both strong, with domestic retail sales up nearly 5% and domestic commercial growth north of 13%. We continue to set commercial quarterly records with $955 million in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $111 million more in sales than in Q2 last year. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.5 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing 19% over last year.\nWe also set another Q2 record for average weekly sales per store at $14,500 versus $13,500 last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 28% this time last year. It was encouraging to see our transaction trends improving from last quarter.\nOur Retail transactions meaningfully improved and were down just 2.2% for the quarter, while our Commercial transactions were up mid-single digits and improving. Our average ticket in both Retail and Commercial experienced solid mid-single-digit growth. Ticket growth decelerated from Q1 as we began to lap the acceleration in inflation we experienced this time last year. We're beginning to see signs of product cost and freight inflation slowing, and we expect to see these begin to return to historical norms over time.\nWe are continuing to see -- to experience substantially higher wage inflation than historically in the mid-single-digit range, more than double our historical experience. While the staffing environment is substantially improved versus this time last year, we don't envision wage inflation abating soon as there continues to be regulatory and market pressures.\nWhile we have to manage through these external forces, our focus, our focus continues to be on driving profitable market share growth, particularly in units and transactions. Our growth initiatives are doing just that and include: new store unit growth, improved satellite store availability, Hub and Mega-Hub openings, improvements in coverage leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand, enhanced technology to make us easier to do business with and more efficient, reducing delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver. Our goal remains over time to become the industry leader in both DIY and commercial. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us confidence as we move forward.\nDigging deeper into our domestic DIY business this past quarter, we delivered a positive 2.7% comp on top of last year's 8.4%. Our DIY results were similar to last quarter's results on a 1-year and 2-year basis and accelerated on a 3-year basis. As previously said, our ticket growth was up 5% versus last year. We're pleased with our transaction count trends improving as we reported transactions down just 2%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison to last year.\nFrom the data we have available, we continued to retain the majority of the dollar share gains we've built during the pandemic, and we continue, continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of our success. Our performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of our sales growth for the remainder of the year.\nAs we've shared forever, our second quarter is always the most volatile sales quarter due to the holidays; their timing shifts; and more importantly, weather, specifically extreme temperatures, which all can have a tremendous impact on our weekly sales. This quarter was no different with softer sales at the beginning of the quarter when the weather was mild and wet, followed by a large spike around Christmas with the very cold temperatures the country experienced.\nWe exited the quarter with normalized growth rates. We do believe we had enough harsh winter weather that we won't be talking about the lingering effects of a mild winter weather or mild winter for the next several months. Our attention has now turned to tax rebate season, which historically drives enormous demand in our category.\nRegarding our retail merchandise categories, our sales floor outperformed hard parts with approximately a 1.5% difference between them. Our relative outperformance in sales for categories is attributable to the discretionary categories improvement. As gas prices naturally have come down and consumer has shown surprising resiliency, our discretionary categories performed better.\nThe discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales in the quarter. We were encouraged to see our battery, oil and wiper categories performed well and successfully lapped very strong performance last year. These categories have exceeded our expectations all year.\nOur friction category for both DIY and commercial performed below our expectations for much of the quarter. However, it bounced back late, and we are encouraged by our recent trends. We believe both our sales floor and hard parts businesses will continue to do well this spring, as we expect miles driven to continue improving, while our growth initiatives continued delivering solid results.\nLet me also address pricing. In Q2, we experienced high single-digit pricing inflation in line with cost of goods. We believe both numbers will decrease in the current quarter as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. To be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, especially wage inflation, but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows.\nI want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity, because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, increasing margin dollars. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower cost.\nOver the last 3 years, we've encouraged investors to keep a keen focus on our 2- and 3-year comparisons. As we return to normal, we believe our year-over-year comparisons will be more and more relevant. While it's difficult to predict sales, we are excited about our growth initiatives. Our team is improving execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors.\nFor our third quarter 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives, combined with the resilient DIY business. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge.\nBefore handing the call to Jamere, I'd like to give a brief update on our supply chain initiatives. I'll start with our in-stock position. I spent several quarters talking about how we were not back to where we were pre-pandemic. I'm pleased to report, we are continuing to improve and are very close to our targets. Our merchandising and supply chain teams have worked diligently and creatively to get our levels back up, and we've made enormous progress. There are still a few categories where we are not where we want to be. But we will -- we have line of sight to putting this behind us. This has taken a lot of effort by our vendor community, and I'd like to publicly thank them for their tremendous efforts as well. We know this will pay future dividends.\nSecond, our supply chain initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability are on track. One we have often highlighted is our expanded Hub and Mega-Hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets closer to the customer will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and, in turn, drive sales.\nAdditionally, we've previously announced the development of 2 new domestic distribution centers and additional capacity in Mexico. All 3 efforts are under construction and are expected to be completed by early fiscal 2025. These distribution centers will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores but also increase our capacity. With the tremendous sales growth we've experienced since 2020, the additional capacity will enable us to carry more, slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand.\nI'm excited that -- I'm also excited we opened a facility on the West Coast recently to handle direct import product on a timelier and more effective and efficient basis. This new West Coast facility is already paying dividends by allowing products ordered abroad to be distributed to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer, and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent sales success, especially in commercial. Simply put, every time we intelligently add inventory to our network, our sales grow.\nLastly, we plan on continuing to grow our business in Mexico and Brazil at almost 800 stores combined across the 2 markets. These businesses had impressive performance again this quarter and they should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil.\nIn Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to expand our store footprint significantly and aggressively over the next 5 years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. We are dedicated to growing our business in a disciplined and profitable manner well into the future. And we know, with our AutoZoners leading the charge, we will continue to be very successful.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter stacked on top of exceptionally strong comps from last year. This quarter, we delivered 5.3% domestic comp growth, a 6.9% increase in EBIT, and a 10.5% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2.\nFor the quarter, total sales were just under $3.7 billion, up 9.5%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives. And let me give a little more color on those growth initiatives.\nStarting with our Commercial business for the second quarter. Our domestic DIFM sales increased just over 13% to $955 million and were up just over 45% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $14,500, up 7.4%, and our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest second quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the chain.\nI want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure. And we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts.\nThis quarter, we opened 41 net new programs, finishing with 5,500 total programs. As expected, commercial growth is leading the way in FY '23, and we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace. We've delivered double-digit sales growth for the past 10 quarters.\nIn addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market-leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I've noted on past calls, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our Commercial and Retail businesses.\nOnce again, I'll add some color on our progress. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 81 Mega-Hub locations with one new one opened in Q2. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $14,500, the 81 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales than the balance of the commercial footprint and grew significantly faster than our overall Commercial business in Q2.\nAs a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry 80,000 to 100,000 SKUs and more in certain cases and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our Commercial and DIY business. These assets are not only performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores is giving our customers access to thousands of additional parks and lifting the entire network.\nThis strategy is working. We're targeting 25 new Mega-Hubs for FY '23, and we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 Mega-Hubs, supplemented by 300 regular Hubs. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customers and improving our delivery times. We will build on our strong momentum over the remainder of the fiscal year.\nOur domestic retail comp was up 2.7% in Q2. This business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates remain solid, and we've managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw our traffic down 2.2% from last year's levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q1 where traffic was down 4%. We also saw 5% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives.\nIn addition, on a macro basis, the market is still experiencing a growing and aging car park and a still challenging new and used car sales market for our customers. These dynamics, pricing growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injection and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. We are forecasting a resilient DIY business for the remainder of FY '23.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico to finish with 707 stores, and 5 new stores in Brazil, ending with 81. On a constant currency basis, we meaningfully accelerated our sales growth in both countries at higher growth rates than we saw in the overall business. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base currently outside the U.S. and a commitment to continued expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. We are bullish on international growth. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we're adding distribution center capacity in Mexico to improve our competitive positioning in the market.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 69 basis points and included a 27 basis point headwind stemming from a noncash $10 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 42 basis points in gross margin, was driven by supply chain costs and our faster-growing lower gross margin commercial business. With this quarter's LIFO charge, we have taken our LIFO credit balance to $106 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight cost is the primary driver for the charges. Both the first and second quarter actuals are below the outlook we gave at the start of each quarter as freight costs have continued to abate over the past few months, and we expect this trend to continue. As such, we anticipate having minimal, if any, LIFO charges during the third quarter.\nAs spot rates have come down, we have renegotiated some of our long-term contracts, and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate. We expect to see these quarterly charges start to reverse during FY '24 and, quite possibly, as early as Q4. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we've taken thus far. And after we've taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we've incurred, we expect to rebuild our unrecorded LIFO reserve balance as we've done historically.\nNow moving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.8% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A levered 24 basis points versus last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $670 million, up 6.9% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $10 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 8.5% over last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $65.6 million, up 54.5% from Q2 a year ago, as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $7 billion versus $5.8 billion at Q2 end last year. We're planning interest in the $72 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42 million in last year's third quarter. Higher debt levels and expected continuing higher borrowing costs are driving this increase.\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was 21.2% and above last year's second quarter rate of 19.3%. This quarter's rate benefited 222 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year's benefit was 401 basis points. For the third quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.\nNow moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $476.5 million, up 1% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 19.3 million was 8.6% lower than last year's second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $24.64, up 10.5% versus a year ago. Excluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 2.6% and our EPS growth would have increased 12.3%.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $210 million in free cash flow versus $260 million a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated $900 million versus $930 million a year ago. We expect to be an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q2 last year, and total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $227,000 versus negative $198,000 last year and negative $249,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 127.7% versus last year's Q2 of 126.8%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased 906 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just under $1.8 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. Our strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash generated this year have allowed us to buy back 4% of the company's total shares outstanding since the start of the fiscal year. We bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach that enables us to invest in the business while returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. Our leverage ratio finished Q2 at 2.3x EBITDAR, and we remain committed to return to the 2.5x area during FY '23.\nSo to wrap up, we continue to drive long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. We're growing our market share, and we're improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. Our strategy continues to work. As we look forward to the back half of FY '23, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast-growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value.\nAnd now I'll turn it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President, CEO & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. We are proud of the results our team delivered in the second quarter. But we must, we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for the remainder of the year. We will continue to invest in initiatives that drive an appropriate return on capital, and we continue investing where our returns are the highest.\nFor the remainder of fiscal '23, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. This year, not only we'd be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we will be opening many more Mega-Hub and Hub stores. And we're focused on initiatives to continue driving strong performance in both our Retail and Commercial businesses.\nFor the remainder of '23, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. We remain focused on achieving our store opening goals, both domestically and internationally. We're working diligently to expand and enhance our supply chain, and we have to achieve this growth, all while managing our costs appropriately. Simply said, we have to focus on exceptional execution in order to drive continued share gains.\nWe know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like in 3 to 5 years from now, and we welcome and accept that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone, which is led by AutoZoners.\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Rhodes\n\nChairman, President, CEO & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2023 First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax. Regarding the first quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results.\nIf not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, is available on our website, www.autozone.com, under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them. As we begin, we'd like to thank and congratulate our AutoZoners across the enterprise for their commitment to taking care of our customers, which led to the strong results they continue to deliver.\nIt has been a busy first quarter of our new fiscal year as every day we strive to get back to normal and exit \"pandemic mode\". This quarter, we opened our new direct import distribution center on the West Coast, continued to improve our in-stock position. And we had our first full national sales meeting since the pandemic began. In fact, we returned to having national sales meetings in every country where we operate and at ALLDATA.\nThese meetings, they are critical to our success where we celebrate our past accomplishments and lay the groundwork for our future success. Most importantly, they allow us to inspire each other and grow and nurture our unique and powerful culture. For the quarter, as our teams delivered exceptional service, their efforts led to our overall sales growing 8.6% on top of 16.3% last year.\nOur 2-year growth rate marks some of the highest ever. We could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. Our AutoZoners' efforts generated a positive and accelerating retail same-store sales comp, along with another strong commercial comp for the quarter. Thank you, AutoZoners for always putting customers first, which led to the success.\nThis morning, we will review our Q1 same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12-week quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our cost and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for the remainder of FY '23.\nOur domestic same-store sales comp was a solid 5.6% this quarter on top of last year's 13.6%. On a 2-year basis, we delivered a 19.2% comp. And on a 3-year basis, a 31.5% stacked comp. Our team once again delivered amazing results despite these difficult comparisons. Let me spend a few moments on growth dynamics in the quarter. Our growth rate for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth of 15%.\nWe set a first quarter commercial sales record and over $1 billion in sales, another impressive quarter as we generated $138 million more in sales than in Q1 last year. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we delivered just under $4.4 billion in annual commercial sales, up an amazing $820 million over last year. We also set a Q1 record for average weekly sales per store at $16,000 versus 144 just last year.\nDomestic commercial sales represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales versus 27% last year. Our sales growth in the quarter was driven by transaction growth from new and existing customers, along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. Our commercial growth of 15% while still very impressive and well ahead of industry growth, did slow. And unfortunately, we broke our streak of 6 straight quarters of 20% plus sales growth.\nWhile we could easily explain this resulted from a difficult comparison to last year's Q1 amazing growth of 29.4%, we also saw our transaction counts decline nearly 4 points from the pace we were growing in Q4 of fiscal '22. That said, we continue to be pleased with the results from the key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, Hub and Mega-Hub openings and improvements in coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, reduce delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being priced right for the value proposition we deliver.\nWe believe our offering to our customers is better than ever, and we continue to hear great things from our customers and prospective customers about the strength of our value proposition as we continue to execute our commercial acceleration strategy. Our goal remains, over time, to become the industry leader in both DIY and commercial in every geography where we operate. Our strategy, execution and market momentum give us tremendous confidence as we move forward.\nWe're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. Our growth in retail since the beginning of the pandemic has been remarkable, representing the highest 3-year growth we have experienced in my 28-year tenure with the company. We delivered a positive 2.6% comp this quarter on top of last year's 9% And versus last year's quarter's growth, DIY grew on a 2-year basis and on a 3-year basis.\nWhile our ticket growth was similar to last quarter, of just over 7%, we are encouraged that our transaction count trend has improved, decreasing by 4%. These results are very strong considering the difficult comparison, driven by the lingering effects of stimulus last year. From the data we have available, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous dollar share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic.\nAnd more importantly, we continue to grow unit share, a critical measurement of success for us. And our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability for our fiscal year. In terms of sales cadence, our total same-store sales trends were very consistent, increasing in the mid-single-digit range for each of the 4-week periods.\nIn addition, for Q1, our 2-year comp was 19.2% and our 3-year comp was 31.5% and relatively consistent over the 4-week periods. We are incredibly pleased with the sustainability of the very large sales and share gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Weather did not have a material impact on our sales this quarter. On a national basis, weather trends were very similar to last year. Regionally, we saw less rainfall in the West and Southeast in last year.\nBut overall, we didn't feel this drove our results materially. This winter's weather forecast calls for a slightly colder winter with, as we've recently experienced, cooler weather beginning sooner. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, cold or hot drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance. During the quarter, there was geographic regions that did better than others as there always are.\nThis quarter, we saw comp sales in the Northeastern and Midwestern markets underperform the [balance] of the company by about 260 basis points. We believe that our underperformance in these markets was driven by milder and wetter weather this year. For our second quarter winter weather is likely to meaningfully influence our results. As a reminder, our Q2 is historically by far in a way the most volatile sales quarter as weather patterns greatly vary week-to-week. And we have key holidays that fall on different days of the week.\nAt the moment, our forecasting team is telling us winter will likely be colder than last year's Q2, and if that happens that would be a positive for our outlook. Now let's move into more specifics on our performance. Same-store sales were up 5.6%. Our net income was $539 million, and our EPS was $27.45 a share, increasing 6.9%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed sales floor categories with approximately a 1% difference between them. With elevated gas prices, our discretionary categories remain soft.\nThe discretionary categories represented approximately 18% of our DIY sales and were down 2.5% versus up 8% last year. In general, the categories that are driven by failures performed well, and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lap very strong performance last year and again, exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this winter as we expect miles driven to improve while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results. Let me also address inflation and pricing.\nIn Q1, we experienced 11% pricing inflation in line with cost of goods, which was also up 11%. We believe both numbers will decrease slightly in the current quarter as we begin to lap the onset of high inflation last year. But to be clear, we do not believe inflation is going away, specially wage inflation but expect it to slow a bit as the economy slows.\nI want to highlight that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Most of the parts and products we sell in this industry have low price elasticity because purchases are driven by failure or routine maintenance. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margin rates, thereby increasing margin dollars.\nIt's also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not meaningfully reduced pricing to reflect lower costs. While we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it still remains challenging for us to forecast near to midterm sales as the economy impacts our customers. What I previously said on the past 6 quarterly calls is sales have been consistent on both a 2-year and 3-year stacked comp basis.\nWhile it's difficult to predict sales going forward. We are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Over the past 1.5 years, the overall macro environment has been favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term.\nFor our second quarter in 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives combined with the resilient DIY business. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and performance as trends emerge.\nBefore handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to give a brief update on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we continue focusing on our supply chain with 2 initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded Hub and Mega-Hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and, in turn, drive sales.\nSecondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of 2 new domestic DCs and one additional DC weeks ago. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to source, but also increase our capacity. Note that we didn't expect to grow our business 30-plus percent in 3 years as we have, and the additional capacity will enable us to carry more slower turning inventory that is not yet in high demand.\nI'm also excited to announce that we opened a facility on the West Coast to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs to reduce safety stock and drive productivity. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more products closer to the customer, and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. And we have initiatives in place to continue our growth trajectories in both our domestic retail and commercial businesses.\nAdditionally, we plan on continuing to grow our mexico and brazilian businesses. And almost 800 stores combined, these businesses have had impressive performance again this quarter and should continue to be key contributors to sales and profit growth for decades to come. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, in particular, we are targeting to significantly and aggressively expand our store footprint over the next 5 years. We are very excited about our growth prospects internationally. Now I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, from a sales perspective, we had a strong first quarter stacked on top of an exceptionally strong first quarter last year with 5.6% domestic comp growth. We also had a 4.2% decrease in EBIT and a 6.9% increase in EPS. To start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q1.\nFor the quarter [growth] sales 8.6%, reflecting continued strength in our industry and solid execution of our growth initiatives, let me give you a bit of color on growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the first quarter, our domestic DIFM sales was increased nearly 15% to $1 billion and were up 44.3% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 29% of our domestic auto parts sales, our weekly sales were per program were $16,000, up 11.1% and our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed well for the quarter.\nOur results for the quarter set a record for the highest first quarter weekly sales volume in the history of the [chain]. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives continues to deliver exceptionally strong results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 88% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts.\nThis quarter, we opened 117 net new programs finishing with 5459 total programs. As i have said previously, commercial growth will lead the way in FY '23, and we continue to deliver on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. Our strategy and execution continue to drive share gains and position us well in the marketplace, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments in local market competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 9 quarters.\nIn addition, we are increasing the penetration of our market-leading ALLDATA shop management, diagnostic and repair software suite to new and existing commercial customers, which gives us yet another key competitive advantage. And as I've noted on past calls, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and position us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses.\nLet me add a little more color on our progress. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 80 Mega-Hub locations with 2 new ones opened in Q1. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,000, the 80 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint.\nAs a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry 80,000 to 110,000 SKUs and drives tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business. What we're learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lift the entire network.\nThis strategy is working. And we remain committed to our objective to reach 200 Mega-Hubs supplemented by 300 regular Hubs. We're targeting at least 25 new Mega-Hubs in FY '23. We continue to leverage sophisticated data analytics to expand our market reach, placing more parts closer to our customer and improving our delivery times. We're determined to build on our strong momentum. Our domestic retail business comp was 2.6% in Q1. The business has been remarkably resilient as growth rates accelerated from Q4, and we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds.\nAs Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 4% from last year's levels. However, they improved sequentially from Q4, where traffic was down 7%. We also saw 7% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our DIY continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and an [aging] car parts and a still challenging new and used car sales market for our customers.\nThese dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injection and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady through the quarter, and we're forecasting a resilient DIY business in 'FY 23. Now I'll say a few words regarding our international businesses. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Mexico to finish with 706 stores and 4 new stores in Brazil ending with 76. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future.\nWith 11% of our total store base currently outside of the U.S. and a commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth. As Bill mentioned earlier, we expect significant growth in store count internationally over the next 5 years, and we are excited about the future. In the spirit of our growth in store count outside of the U.S., we will celebrate our chain's 7,000th store opening this week in Leon, Mexico.\nI know Bill looks forward to being there to celebrate this historic event with our AutoZoners, and we couldn't be more proud to celebrate this occasion with our Mexico team. Now let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 242 basis driven primarily by a 203 basis point headwind stemming from a noncash $81 million LIFO charge. The difference for the quarter, a decline of 39 basis points in gross margin, was primarily driven by our faster-growing lower gross margin commercial business.\nWith this quarter's LIFO charge, we've taken our LIFO credit balance to $96 million. As I mentioned last quarter, hyperinflation and freight costs are the primary driver for the charges. We're still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, and we anticipate approximately $40 million in LIFO charges during the second quarter. Both the first quarter actuals and our second quarter outlook are below the outlook we gave last quarter as freight costs continue to abate over the past few months.\nAs spot rates have come down, we've also renegotiated some of our long-term contracts, and the lower costs are reflected in our outlook. We expect freight costs to continue to abate, and I want to remind everyone that at some point, we expect to see these quarterly charges reverse, and we will begin to rebuild our LIFO reserve balance. We plan to take P&L gains only to the extent of the charges we've taken thus far.\nAnd after we've taken P&L gains that fully reverse the charges we've incurred, we expect to rebuild our LIFO reserve balances as we've done historically. Moving on to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.6% versus last year's Q1 as SG&A as a percentage of sales were flat with last year. Our operating expense growth has been purposeful as we continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments are expected to pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity.\nWe're committed to being disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time. Moving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $723 million, down 4.2% versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $81 million LIFO charge, EBIT would have been up 6.6% over last year's quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $57.7 million up 33.4 from Q1 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.3 billion versus $5.3 billion in Q1 in last year, and our variable rates have increased significantly.\nWe're planning interest in the $60 million range for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $42.5 million in last year's second quarter. Higher debt levels and expected higher bar across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 18.9% and below last year's first quarter rate of 21.9%. This quarter's rate benefited 446 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 159 basis points.\nFor the second quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.4% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises. Moving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $539 million, down 2.9% versus last year's first quarter. Our diluted share count of $19.6 million was 9.1% lower than last year's first quarter. The combination of lower net income offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $27.45, up 6.9% over the prior year's first quarter.\nExcluding the LIFO charge, our net income would have increased 8.3%, and our EPS growth would have been 19.2%. Now let me talk about our free cash flow for Q1. For the fourth quarter, we generated $794 million of operating cash flow and spent $114 million in CapEx allowing us to generate $680 million in free cash flow versus $676 million a year ago. We expect to continue being in an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong. Our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 14.4% versus Q1 last year, and total inventory increased 17.6% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation, our growth initiatives and in-stock recoveries. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis was a negative $249,000 versus negative $207,000 last year and negative $240,000 last quarter.\nAs a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 131% versus last year's Q1 of 129.4%. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just under $2.7 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back almost 2% of the shares outstanding at the start of the fiscal year.\nWe have bought back well over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q1 at 2.2x EBITDA, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x.\nHowever, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target during FY '23. To wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings in cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way.\nAnd as we look forward to FY '23, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and fast-growing commercial and international businesses that are growing considerable share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our industry, our business and the opportunity to drive long-term shareholder value. Before I turn it back to Bill, on December 5, we celebrated Bill's 28th year anniversary with the company. And I want to say congratulations to you, Bill, and it's been a remarkable run.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President, CEO & Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jamere. Fiscal 2023 is off to a solid start, but we must continue to be focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Execution and our culture, a culture of always putting the customer first is what defines us. As Jamere said a moment ago, we continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for the new year. Our team continues to work collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, we've done a good job improving our in-stock position.\nBut we still are a couple of hundred basis points below our historical norms. We're also being smart about adding new inventory coverage. We're meeting the ever-growing needs of our customers, especially our commercial customers by being able to say, yes, we've got it. It's a requirement. For the remainder of fiscal '23, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. Not only will we be opening roughly 200 stores across the U.S., Mexico and Brazil, but we'll be opening more Mega-Hubs and Hub stores.\nAnd we're focused on initiatives in place to continue driving strong performance in both our retail and commercial businesses. For the remainder of fiscal 2023, we are keenly focused on relentless execution. We will not accept shortcuts. Our vendors must return to providing us the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right every hour of every day. And our processes need to function correctly, always.\nWe have to meet our store opening goals and time lines. Simply put, we have to focus on exceptional execution. It has made a difference for us for decades. We know that investors will ultimately measure us on what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Before we begin, the company would like to read some forward-looking statements. Apologies, just 2 seconds.\n\nBrian L.

Bill, over to you.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the fourth quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.\nAs we begin, we want to recognize our AutoZoners for their tremendous success this past year. They far exceeded our expectations from the beginning of the year and in a very challenging environment as our pledge states put our customers first, resulting in additional share gains and terrific sales performance on top of fantastic results in FY '21. We grew our overall sales of 11.1% on top of 15.8% growth last year, resulting in a 2-year growth that is among the highest we've ever experienced.\nWe could not have achieved this success without phenomenal contributions from across the organization. This year began with the resurgence of the pandemic, ongoing supply chain challenges, a very difficult staffing environment and finished with rising interest rates and inflation at its highest levels in decades, all as major storylines.\nThroughout the year, our team's incredible supply chain efforts to improve our in-stock position, likely at industry-leading levels, helped our sales growth. These efforts resulted in a positive retail comp and an exceptionally strong commercial comp for both the quarter and the year.\nAny way you evaluate our FY '22 performance, we had a terrific year. Congratulations AutoZoners, and thanks for always putting our customers first, which led to this success. This morning, we will review our Q4 overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 16 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our cost and our retails and how we think inflation will impact our business for FY '23.\nOur domestic same-store sales were an impressive 6.2% this quarter on top of last year's 4.3%. On a 2-year basis, we delivered 10.5% comp and on a 3-year basis, a remarkable 32.3% stacked comp. Our team once again executed at an exceptionally high level, and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons, and significant challenges I mentioned above.\nOur growth rates for commercial and retail were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 20%. This quarter was our sixth consecutive commercial growth above 20%. Additionally, Commercial set a fourth quarter record with $1.442 billion in sales, an impressive accomplishment. We generated $260 million more in sales this quarter than in Q4 last year. For the fiscal year, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion versus $3.3 billion just a year ago, up over 26%.\nLast fall, at our National Sales Meeting, our Senior VP of Commercial, Grant McGee, declared a stretched goal to achieve $4 billion in sales for FY '22. That lofty goal ultimately wasn't near lofty enough. We also set a record average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $17,000 per store versus 14.4% last year. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto parts sales, another record for us compared to just 26% in last year's quarter. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by key initiatives we have been working on for the last several years. Improved satellite store inventory, massive improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being \"priced right\" for the value proposition we deliver.\nWe continue to execute in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team's performance. We're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We had a positive 1.1% comp this quarter. While our 2-year comp decelerated from Q3's, we believe the more relevant comp is the 3-year, and we are higher than last year's quarter at 24.5% versus 21.6%. For the year, we were very proud of our DIY results considering we grew so much in FY '21. To level set, we had 11% DIY comp in FY '21. And for the full year '22, we were up 2.9%. These results are very strong, considering the difficult comparison, which was driven by the various forms of stimulus last year.\nFrom the data we have available to us, we continue to retain the vast majority of the enormous share gains in dollars and more importantly in units that we built during the initial stages of the pandemic. Our recent performance gives us continued conviction about the sustainability into FY '23.\nNow let's focus on sales cadence. Our quarter spans 16 weeks, early May through the end of August. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first 4 weeks to high single digits, 8.4%. The next 8 weeks, our growth was nearly halved, dropping to 4.9%. And then it reaccelerated over the last 4 weeks, up 6.8%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are difficult to interpret, as so much was going on last year and even the year before. However, for Q4, our 2-year comp was 10.5% and the 4-week periods of the quarter increased 10.4%, 9.4%, 7.9% and 14.4%, respectively. But our 3-year comp was 32.3% and for the 4-week periods of the quarter increased 35.2%, 33.5%, 30.1% and 31%, respectively.\nWe have been encouraged by the sustainability of the enormous sales gains we generated since the beginning of the pandemic. Regarding weather in May and June, we experienced slightly cooler and wetter weather trends across the country. By July, however, it became very hot across most of the country, and it remained unseasonably warm for August. Overall, we feel weather had a small, but slightly positive effect on our sales performance. As we look forward to the fall months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, cold or hot, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance.\nRegarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was down roughly 7%, while our ticket was up about 8%. Our transaction count decline wasn't surprising, and was driven by lower demand for discretionary sales floor items. However, we were pleased to be in line with last quarter's 3-year transaction trends. We are also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We're also very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Our sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers, along with higher tickets as we price for inflation. I regularly visit our stores and commercial customers, and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our offerings. The reception our AutoZoners are receiving from our customers and as importantly, our prospective customers has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy.\nI'll say it now, but we're determined, determined to continue to grow meaningfully faster than the market, and we're focused on future growth opportunities to keep our momentum. Our goal stated simply, over time is to become the industry leader in both sectors.\nAs we start our new fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the fall months. During the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 30 basis point difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country with the Northeast and Midwest being higher. As the Northeast and Midwest were warmer in May and June, their sales accelerated. However, this trend reversed itself over the last 8 weeks of the quarter. As the remainder of the country heated up, those regions grew their comp sales faster than the Northeast and Midwest markets. Heading into the first quarter of the new fiscal year, we continue to believe weather will have only a minimal impact on our sales.\nNow let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. While I said our same-store sales were up 6.2% versus last year's fourth quarter, our net income was $810 million and our EPS was $40.51 a share, increasing 13.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed sales floor categories with approximately a 2.5% difference between them. As gas prices increased, our discretionary sales for merchandise categories certainly softened. The discretionary categories represent approximately 20% of our DIY sales in any 1 quarter. But this quarter, they were weaker at 19% of the retail mix. This category was down 6.5% in the quarter versus up 3.5% last year in Q4.\nMore recently, as gas prices have abated, we are encouraged to see the discretionary categories bounce back a bit. In general, the categories that are driven by failure due to heat performed well, and we were encouraged to see our battery category successfully lapped very strong performance last year and exceed our expectations. We believe our hard parts business will continue to do well this fall as we expect miles driven to improve while our growth initiatives are delivering solid results.\nLet me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 11% from inflation, in line with cost of goods, which was up about 10%. We believe both numbers for the first quarter will be similar. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space.\nWe believe inflation is stabilizing. We are seeing transportation costs begin to moderate after reaching historic levels, but we are not seeing product cost deflation yet nor are we seeing any signs that labor wage growth is slowing.\nImportantly, I want to point out that our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. Historically, as costs have increased, the industry has increased pricing commensurately to maintain margins. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower cost.\nWhile we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to midterm sales. What I previously said is that the past 5 quarter sales have all been consistent on both a 2- and 3-year stacked comp basis. While it's difficult to predict sales going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's execution and the tremendous share gains we've achieved in both sectors.\nOver the past 12 to 18 months, the overall macro environment has been favorable for our industry despite inflationary pressures for some of our customers. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term. For our first quarter of 2023, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we execute on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.\nBefore handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to highlight and give some color on a few of our key business priorities for the new fiscal year. First, we are focusing on our supply chain with 2 initiatives that are in flight to drive improved availability. One is our expanded hub and Mega-Hub rollouts. We know intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently and in turn, drive our sales.\nSecondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced the development of 2 new distribution centers domestically and 1 additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores, but they increase our capacity. No, we didn't expect to grow our business 30% in 3 years as we did, and they will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning, yet in demand across the country.\nI'm also excited to announce that we opened a new facility on the West Coast just this month to handle direct import product on a timelier basis. This facility will flow products ordered abroad and distribute them to our other DCs postponing the inventory allocation, and therefore reducing safety stock. Our supply chain strategy is focused on carrying more product closer and closer to the customer, and we believe it has been a significant contributor to our recent success, especially in commercial. Additionally, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico and Brazilian businesses. At almost 800 stores open internationally, these businesses had impressive performance this past fiscal year and should continue to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong fourth quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable fourth quarter last year with 6.2% domestic comp growth, a 5.7% increase in EBIT and a 13.4% increase in EPS. Our results for the entire fiscal year were incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions.\nTo start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q4. For the quarter, total sales were just over $5.3 billion, up 8.9%. For the year, our total sales were $16.3 billion, up 11.1% versus last fiscal year. I continue to marvel at the strength of our business since FY '19. Our sales are up an amazing 37% or nearly $4.4 billion since 2019.\nLet me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business. For the fourth quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 22% to $1.4 billion and were up 43.2% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our domestic DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $17,000, up 18.1% as we exceeded our internal expectations. Our growth was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter. Our results for the quarter set another record for the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers.\nWe have a commercial program in approximately 87% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts. This quarter, we opened 66 net new programs, finishing with 5,342 total programs. As I've said, since the outset of the year, commercial growth led the way in FY '22 and our results in the fourth quarter and year reflected this dynamic.\nFor FY '22, our commercial sales were $4.2 billion, up 26.5% versus last year. Importantly, we believe we have a lot of runway in front of us, and we're delivering on our goal of becoming a faster-growing business. We remain confident in our strategies and execution, and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing an exceptional service has enabled us to deliver double-digit sales growth for the past 8 quarters.\nOur core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And as I've noted on past calls, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses.\nLet me add a little more color on our progress. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 78 Mega-Hub locations with 11 new stores opened in Q4. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $17,000 per program, the 78 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint.\nIn fact, our commercial Mega-Hub business grew at twice the rate of our overall commercial business in Q4. As a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box, as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business.\nWhat we're learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lift the entire network. This strategy is working. We have an objective to reach 200 Mega-Hubs supplemented by our objective of a total of 300 regular Hubs. We're targeting up to 25 new Mega-Hubs in FY '23.\nBy leveraging sophisticated analytics, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners and our customers are excited, and we're determined to build on our strong momentum.\nOn the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business comp was up 1.1% in Q4. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have managed to continue to deliver positive comp growth despite underlying market headwinds. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 7% from last year's traffic levels. However, we also saw 8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment.\nFor FY '22, our DIY comp grew 2.9% and 14.1% on a 2-year stack basis. Our DIY business has continued to strengthen competitively behind our growth initiatives. In addition, on a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which continue to provide a tailwind for our business. These dynamics, pricing, growth initiatives and macro car park tailwinds have driven a positive comp despite tough comparisons from last year's stimulus injections and consumer discretionary spending pressure from overall inflation in the economy. Our sales were steady throughout the quarter, and we're forecasting a resilient DIY business in FY '23.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 30 new stores in Mexico to finish with 703 stores and 14 new stores in Brazil, ending with 72. On a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall.\nWe remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 11% of our total store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the rest of the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 73 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business and a 28 basis points headwind stemming from a noncash $15 million LIFO charge. I'd like to address the $50 million LIFO charge we took this past quarter, which came from the exhaustion of our reserve balance that occurred during the quarter.\nThe level set, we went from a $335 million reserve balance in Q4 of last year to 0 in Q4 this year, plus an additional $15 million charge. Said differently, we recognized $350 million in higher costs this past year. Basically, all the reduction in our reserves came from higher inventoriable freight costs. This charge does not show up in our cash flow statement this quarter because the accounting for LIFO will adjust the weighted average cost through the P&L to the last in higher-priced items.\nIn a nutshell, it assumes everything you sold in the quarter was at the last and higher prices. We're still modeling for higher freight costs through the end of the calendar year, which in turn means we are modeling LIFO charges through the first half of the new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we anticipate up to $100 million in LIFO charges, and we're forecasting a similar amount for the second quarter. I will note that if freight costs abate as we expect them to, then we'll see these charges reverse and we'll begin to rebuild a LIFO reserve balance.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 8.4% versus last year's Q4 as SG&A as a percentage of sales leveraged 12 basis points driven by strong sales growth. The growth in SG&A has been purposeful as we continue to invest in an accelerated pace in IT and payroll to underpin our growth initiatives. These investments will pay dividends and customer experience, speed and productivity. We're committed to being disciplined on SG&A as we move forward, and we will manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 5.7% versus the prior year's quarter driven by our strong sales growth. FY '22, EBIT was just under $3.3 billion, up 11.1% versus the prior year, also driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $64 million, up 10.1% from Q4 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $6.1 billion versus $5.3 billion at Q4 end last year.\nWe're paying interest in the $55 million range for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $43.3 million in this past year's first quarter. Higher debt levels and borrowing rates across the curve are driving this increase. For the quarter, our tax rate was 22.1% and flat with last year's fourth quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 70 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 215 basis points. For the first quarter of FY 2023, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $810 million, up 3.1% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our diluted share count of 20 million was 9.1% lower than last year's fourth quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $40.51, up 13.4% over the prior year's fourth quarter. For FY '22, net income was $2.4 billion, up 11.9% and earnings per share was $117.19, up 23.1%.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, spent $300 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $900 million of free cash flow. For the year, we generated $2.5 million in free cash versus $2.9 million in the prior year. The decline in free cash flow versus last year was due to a change in working capital this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 18.4% versus Q4 last year, and total inventory increased 21.5% over the same period last year, driven primarily by our growth initiatives and inflation.\nNet inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $240,000 versus negative $203,000 last year and negative $216,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 129.5% versus last year's Q4 of 129.6%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $1 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. And at quarter end, we had just under $1.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 10% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\nOur leverage metric finished Q4 at 2.1x EBITDAR, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDAR. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target during FY '23.\nSo to wrap up, we remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive position in a disciplined way.\nAnd as we look forward to FY '23, we're bullish on our growth prospects behind a resilient DIY business and a fast-growing commercial business that is continuing to grow share. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. As we start a new fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our operating theme for the new year. Last night, we kicked off our National Sales meeting with our amazing President's Club winners, our very best store managers. This week, we will embrace our theme for the year, Accelerate Together. We are very excited to have our field leadership team in Memphis for the next 4 days, and I cannot wait to congratulate everyone on their year and thank them for their phenomenal results. They delivered exceptional results in fiscal '22, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service heading into fiscal '23.\nOur culture was built on providing exceptional service and this is what will continue to define our success well into the future. As we've accelerated our top line, our competitive positioning has materially improved and customer behavior may have permanently changed post pandemic. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pandemic levels.\nOur industry is unique, and it is a very long track record of strong performance with high returns and consistent cash flows. We would also encourage you to migrate to studying our performance on a 1-year comp basis to gauge our performance, as we believe the business is steady enough to talk about year-over-year comps going forward. This time of year, I always enjoy reflecting on the past. This year in particular, is a rewarding experience. Our team delivered some really impressive milestones, $16.3 billion in sales, racing past the $15 billion milestone. DIY comps of 2.9%, most impressively 21.6% on a 3-year basis. Commercial sales blew past $4 billion, ending at $4.23 billion. Average weekly sales domestically of $46,300 per store per week, equating to over $2.4 million per store annually.\nOur Mexico and ALLDATA teams both broke numerous records, and Brazil is poised for significant growth in store count. We bought back a record-breaking $4.4 billion in AutoZone stock, and our team has grown our EBIT by roughly 50% in 3 years. Yes, that's 5-0, and that is remarkable. But we can't rest on our laurels, and we aren't without our challenges. That's for sure.\nOur greatest challenge, which we will spend time discussing this week with the team, is \"exiting pandemic mode.\" In addition to our fanatical customer focus, and our phenomenal culture, a huge part of our historical success has been flawless execution. In all candor, we haven't been flawlessly executing. In the depths of the pandemic, it was impossible and our teams appropriately made trade-offs. We have ensured that some of those trade-offs do not result in \"new norms or worse, numbness or bad habits.\" Those new norms can't and won't be tolerated. We have to make sure our in-stock levels finally recover to our historic levels and they recover soon. Our vendors must return to providing us with the right amount of merchandise at the right time. Every store has to be staffed right, every hour of every day. Our processes need to function correctly always. We have to meet our store opening goals and time lines. Simply put, we have to remain the execution machine we have always been an exit pandemic mode.\nI've had the honor of being part of this team for nearly 28 years now, and it has been one of the great privileges of my life. I could not be more proud of our AutoZoners across the organization for their commitment to passionately serving our customers. We must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success and rest assured, we are doing just that.\nWe know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry, and in particular, on our team at AutoZone.\nNow we'd like to open up the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Before we begin, Brian would like to read some forward-looking statements.\n\nBrian L. Campbell\n\nVP of Tax, Treasury & IR, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nBefore we begin, please note that today's call includes forward-looking statements that are subject the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Please refer to this morning's press release and the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures can be found in our press release.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Bill Rhodes, Chairman, President and CEO of AutoZone. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the third quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on quarterly earnings conference calls to see them.\nAs we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization continues to take this responsibility seriously and I'm very proud of how our team continues to respond to COVID-19 and subsequent variants. While mask mandates have abated, we continue to make sure the environment our AutoZoners are working in and our customers are shopping in are as safe as possible for these times.\nSince the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers, especially for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has meant for all of us. This quarter, we will start the same by, again, thanking our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service, while helping our customers with their automotive needs.\nThis morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We will also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails, and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our domestic same-store sales were a solid 2.6% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 28.9%.\nOn both a 2-year and 3-year stack comp sales basis, our trends accelerated. Our team, once again, executed at an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the difficult comparisons. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong, with domestic commercial growth north of 26%.\nCommercial set a third quarter record with $1.044 billion in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $216 million more in sales this quarter than in Q3 of just last year. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our commercial sales are just under $4 billion versus $3.1 billion a year ago, up 27%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any quarter at $16,600 versus $13,500 last year.\nOn a 2-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter. Domestic commercial sales represented 30% of our domestic auto part sales, another record for us compared to just 24.8% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host of key initiatives. We've been working on for the last several years, improved satellite store availability, massive improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage, the strength of the Duralast brand, better technology to make us easier to do business with, improve delivery times, enhancing our sales force effectiveness and living consistent with our pledge by being \"priced right\" for the value proposition we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance.\nWe're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. As a reminder, it was last year's Q3 that had the massive stimulus payments that were distributed to consumers in the U.S. We ran a negative 4.5% comp this quarter on top of last year's record positive comps of 24.8%. While our DIY 2-year comp decelerated slightly from Q2's 2-year DIY comp, perhaps the more relevant comp is the DIY 3-year comp, which did accelerate. We were very proud of our DIY results considering we had such a tough comparison to last year. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous share gains in dollars and units we built during the initial stages of the pandemic, but modestly build on those gains.\nOur performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us continued conviction about the sustainability of the massive elevated sales levels we have experienced since the beginning of the pandemic.\nNow let's focus on the sales cadence. Our quarter spans at 12-week period. Our same-store sales increased materially over the first 4 weeks, up 11.8%. Then they were down over the middle of 4 weeks by 5.2%. But remember, we were comping against the stimulus payments made during this time last year. And our same-store sales then accelerated over the last 4 weeks, up 3%. All of these year-over-year comparisons are really difficult to interpret as so much is going on last year and even the year before.\nFor Q3, our 2-year comp was 31.5%, and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 23.4%, 65.4% and 17%, respectively. But our 3-year comp was 30.5%, and the 4-week periods for the quarter increased 29.7%, 44.7% and 29.8%, respectively. What I want to stress is that our 2-year and 3-year comp accelerated for the quarter from Q2's 2- and 3-year comparison. We are encouraged by the sustainability of these enormous sales gains.\nRegarding weather, in February and March, we experienced normal weather trends across the country. April, however, was a little cooler and a little wetter than normal. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the summer months, we anticipate normal weather patterns. As a reminder, historically, extreme weather, hot or cold, drives parts failure and accelerated maintenance. Regarding the quarter's traffic versus ticket growth in retail, our traffic was down roughly 8.5%, while our ticket was up 4%. Our transaction count decline was correlated to last year's Q3 meaningful 16% traffic count increase.\nWhile we had expected a decline in transactions this quarter, we were pleased to exceed our beginning of the quarter assumptions on transaction count declines. We're also quite pleased with the ongoing growth in unit share we are seeing in our market share data. We're very encouraged by the sales trends we continue to experience in commercial. Most of the sales growth is coming from transaction growth from new and existing customers.\nI've visited our stores and commercial customers extensively this quarter and find it very encouraging to hear the positive comments from our customers and AutoZoners on our comprehensive offerings. The tone of our sales calls has changed meaningfully over the last few years as we continue to implement and execute our commercial acceleration strategy.\nAs we start our final quarter of the fiscal year, we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the summer months.\nDuring the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. This quarter, we saw a 54 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country, with the Northeast and Midwest performing lower. As the Northeast and Midwest were cooler in weather in April, their sales were below last year's results. We do not believe there will be lasting effects on sales performance in the Northeast and Midwest due to the slightly cooler April weather. Heading into the fourth quarter, we continue to believe weather will have a minimal effect on summer sales.\nNow let's move into more specifics on our performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 2.6% versus last year's third quarter. Our net income was $593 million, and our EPS was $29.3 a share, increasing 9.6%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts outperformed our sales floor categories, but there was less than a 1% difference between them. As gas prices jumped recently, our sales results in certain hard part categories performed below our plan. This is unlike the sales floor categories, which were on plan. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in many of our categories like batteries that have successfully left very strong performance last year, and easily exceeded our planned assumptions for the quarter. We believe our hard parts business will strengthen as our customers return to driving more.\nLet me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by 7.8% from inflation, in line with the cost of goods inflation, which was up similarly at 7.2% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers for the fourth quarter could be slightly higher than this past quarter's increases. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades, and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, our industry has historically not reduced pricing to reflect lower ultimate cost.\nWhile we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult for us to forecast near to midterm sales. What I have previously said is that the past 5 quarter sales have all been consistent on both a 2-year stacked comp basis and a 3-year stacked comp basis. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term.\nFor our fourth quarter, we expect our sales performance to be led by the continued strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. We will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing, and provide color on our markets and outlook as trends emerge.\nBefore handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to make sure the listeners know what our key business priorities are for the remainder of the fiscal year and give some color on those.\nFirst, we are focusing on our supply chain. We have 2 initiatives in place to drive improved availability. One is our expanded Hub and Mega-Hub rollouts. We believe intelligently placing more inventory in local markets will lead to our ability to continue to say yes to our customers more frequently, and, in turn, continue to drive our sales performance.\nSecondly, we are expanding our distribution center footprint. We announced opening 2 new domestic DCs and 1 additional DC in Mexico. These DCs will allow us to not only reduce drive times to stores and market service by the new DCs, but they, being larger than the previous DCs, will allow us to carry inventory that is slower turning yet in demand across the country. We previously relied on our vendor community to carry these SKUs and shipped them once ordered by our stores. Our DC strategy is focused on carrying more product in our supply chain that was not available previously. These SKUs will smartly expand our stocked inventory across all 50 states.\nAnd lastly, we plan on continuing to grow our Mexico business, while accelerating growth in Brazil, and we are leveraging many of the learnings we have in the U.S. to refine our offerings in Mexico and Brazil.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, stacked on top of a remarkable third quarter last year, with 2.6% comp growth, a 2% decline in EBIT and a 9.6% increase in EPS. Our results for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year have been incredibly strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have continued to enable us to take advantage of robust market conditions.\nTo start this morning, let me take a few minutes to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q3. For the quarter, total sales were just under $3.9 billion, up 5.9%, and total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.8 billion, up 5.7%. Let me give a little more color on sales and our growth initiatives, starting with our commercial business for the third quarter.\nOur domestic DIFM sales increased 26% to over $1 billion, and were up 70.4% on a 2-year stack basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 27% of our total company sales and 30% of our domestic auto part sales. Our weekly sales per program were $16,600, up 23% as we averaged just over $87 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, growth at 26% exceeded our internal expectations and was broad-based as both national and local accounts performed very well for the quarter.\nOur results for the quarter represented the highest weekly sales volume for any quarter in the history of the chain. I want to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we grow share by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have a commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts.\nThis quarter, we opened 43 net new programs, finishing with 5,276 total programs. As I've said since the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY '22, and our results in the third quarter and year-to-date reflect this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategy and execution and believe we will continue gaining share. Delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 7 quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth, and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses.\nLet me add a little color on our progress here. As we have discussed over the last several quarters, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 67 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 11 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $16,600 per program, the 67 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint.\nAs a reminder, our Mega-Hubs typically carry over 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores. The expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business.\nThis quarter, I visited one of our key markets where we're testing greater Mega-Hub density. And although it's early innings, I am thrilled with the results. What we're learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually, but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network. This strategy is working, and we're doubling down by raising our near-term Mega-Hub target from approximately 110 to 200 Mega-Hubs, supplemented by our new objective of a total of 300 regular hubs. Yes, we plan to have 500 total locations, with significantly higher levels of expanded parts availability and soon.\nBy leveraging sophisticated analytics, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. Our AutoZoners are excited, our customers are excited, and we're building a meaningful competitive advantage.\nOn the retail side of our business, our domestic retail business was down 4.5%, but up 20.3% on a 2-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained significant market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic down 8.5% from last year's record traffic levels that were fueled by government stimulus. However, we also saw a 4% ticket growth as we continue to methodically raise prices in an inflationary environment.\nOur DIY business has continued to strengthen behind our growth initiatives in a favorable macro environment. On a macro basis, the market is experiencing a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers, which are providing a strong tailwind for our business. Our in-stock positions, while still below historic norms, continue to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers' needs. Our AutoZoners, who are taking care of our customers, give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment.\nWe remain confident as the fundamentals of our DIY business remains strong, macro conditions are favorable for us, and we've had great execution by our teams.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Mexico to finish with 673 stores, and 3 new stores in Brazil, ending with 58. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in fact, at higher growth rates than we saw overall.\nWe remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With 12% of our total store base now outside the U.S., and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 54 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where mix drove margin pressure, but increased our total gross profit dollars 4.8%, a welcome trade-off that is a net positive for our business. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we're continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We are continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry pricing remains rational.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 9.8% versus last year Q3 as SG&A, as a percentage of sales, deleveraged 114 basis points. The deleverage was driven by payroll as last year's historic DIY comp drove significant and more than appropriate leverage on SG&A, where we simply couldn't staff to the accelerated sales growth fast enough. We also continue to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $786 million, down 2.2% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by last year's strong sales performance in DIY. Interest expense for the quarter was $41.9 million, down 7% from Q3 a year ago, although our debt outstanding at the beginning of the quarter was $6.1 million versus $5.3 billion in Q3 last year. We're planning interest in the $61 million range for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 versus $58.1 million in last year's fourth quarter.\nFor the quarter, our tax rate was 20.3% versus 21.4% in last year's third quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 284 basis points from stock options exercised, while last year, it benefited 211 basis points. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.5% before any assumptions on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $593 million, down [0.6%] versus last year's third quarter. Our diluted share count of 20.4 million was 9.3% lower than last year's third quarter. The combination of lower net income offset by lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $29.03, up 9.6% over the prior year's third quarter.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q3. For the third quarter, we generated $843 million of operating cash flow and spent $161 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $682 million in free cash flow. Year-to-date, we've generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow, down 13% versus the prior year. The primary reason for the decline in free cash flow versus last year is the timing of merchandise inventories and payments this year versus last year. We expect to continue being an incredibly strong free cash flow generator going forward. We remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. Our inventory per store was up 10.7% versus Q3 last year. Total inventory increased 13.9% over the same period last year, driven primarily by inflation and our growth initiatives. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $216,000 versus negative $167,000 last year and negative $198,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable, as a percent of gross inventory, finished the quarter at 127.9% versus last year's Q3 of 123.9%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased $900 million of AutoZone stock in the quarter. At quarter end, we had just under $2.1 billion remaining under our share buyback authorization. The strong earnings, balance sheet and powerful free cash flow we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 8% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We've bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business.\nWe remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders. We finished Q3 at 2.1x EBITDA, which is below our historical objective of 2.5x EBITDA. However, we remain committed to this objective, and we expect to return to the 2.5x target when appropriate.\nTo wrap up, we had another very successful quarter. We're driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings in cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We're growing our market share and improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. We had very solid results so far in fiscal '22, and we remain focused on superior execution and customer service. Our culture was built on providing exceptional service, and this is what we'll continue to define our success well into the future. And looking to the future, it is still very difficult to predict the next 6 to 12 months. But our perspective has meaningfully morphed over the last 2 quarters. On last quarter's call, we discussed how most, if not all, of the growth in sales we experienced since the start of the pandemic was sustainable. We believed our competitive positioning was materially improved, as indicated by our significant retail share gains and rapidly accelerated commercial sales growth. We believe customer behavior may have permanently changed. We continue to believe all of this today. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time, the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have been through significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to prerecessionary or pre-pandemic levels.\nOur industry is unique, and it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we have now lapped the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we have all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and took several months.\nFor Q4, in light of the amazing performance in the back half of 2020, the 2-year comparison for overall comps won't be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to studying 3-year comps to gauge our fourth quarter performance.\nThat said, soon, we look forward to returning to focusing solely on 1 year comparisons. We continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our own opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for near and long term. Our customers across the Americas, they want to get out and drive, and we are here when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers. And together, they've done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone.\nWe continue to believe we are better in stock than most retailers, and I think our results obviously support that belief. I'd like to share a few other points with you.\nIt has been a rather noisy earnings season for retailers, and I want to be clear, crystal clear about our business and the environment. First, I believe AutoZone can manage effectively through this inflationary environment. Historically, our industry has been disciplined and rational about passing along cost increases with higher retails and that is true today. Second, we feel our store staffing levels are appropriate, and we can, and we will manage expenses appropriately for either stronger or weaker sales environments.\nOur business and our industry has been remarkably resilient and, frankly, robust. For the remainder of fiscal '22, we are focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. Last quarter, we announced we would begin construction on 3 new distribution centers to fuel continued growth, 2 in the U.S. and 1 in Mexico. Expected to open in fiscal '24, these new distribution centers represent a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in DCs as during the pandemic, we've learned we need to have more excess capacity.\nSecondly, we are targeting to open 11 more new domestic Mega-Hubs in the U.S. in this quarter, Q4. These Mega-Hubs will enhance our availability and support growth in both our retail and commercial businesses. As we have mentioned many times before, our Mega-Hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability, and our results show that they are working. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in our Brazil business. Our fourth quarter will be a busy one from a store development standpoint. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and our own growth prospects.\nWe are being disciplined, yet we are being aggressive. Lastly, I want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now, and we very much welcome that challenge.\nI continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone. Now we'd like to open up the call for questions."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for AutoZone's 2022 Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Jamere Jackson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian Campbell, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations and Tax.\nRegarding the second quarter, I hope you've had an opportunity to read our press release and learn about the quarter's results. If not, the press release, along with slides complementing our comments today, are available on our website, www.autozone.com under the Investor Relations link. Please click on Quarterly Earnings Conference Calls to see them.\nAs we begin, we want to continue to stress that our highest priority remains the safety and well-being of our customers and AutoZoners, Everyone, everyone across the organization takes this responsibility very seriously, and I am extremely proud of how our team has continued to respond to COVID-19 and the recent Omicron variant. Since the start of the pandemic, we have consistently recognized our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers for giving exceptional service in the face of all the challenges COVID-19 has presented.\nThis quarter, we will start the same way by saying thank you to our AutoZoners for their dedication to providing exceptional customer service and helping our customers with their automotive needs. This morning, we will review our overall same-store sales, DIY versus DIFM trends, our sales cadence over the 12 weeks of the quarter, merchandise categories that drove our performance and any regional discrepancies. We'll also share how inflation is affecting our costs and retails and how we think they will impact our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Lastly, I'll touch on the subject of pricing in the industry.\nOur domestic same-store sales were an impressive 13.8% this quarter, on top of last year's very strong 15.2%. Our team has once again executed an exceptionally high level and delivered amazing results despite the ongoing very challenging environment. In Q1 of this fiscal year, we reported 13.6% same-store sales on top of 2021's Q1 same-store sales of 12.3%. Impressively, very impressively, our team delivered accelerating 2-year comps in our second quarter. Our growth rates for retail and commercial were both strong with domestic commercial growth north of 32%. Commercial set a second quarter record with $844 million in sales, an incredible accomplishment. We generated $200 million more in sales this quarter than in Q2 last year.\nOn a trailing 4-quarter basis, we generated $3.8 billion in annualized commercial sales versus $2.9 billion just a year ago, up 30%. We also set a record in average weekly sales per store for any second quarter at $13,500 versus $10,500 last year. On a 2-year basis, our sales accelerated from last quarter, exceeding 46% in commercial. Domestic commercial sales represented 25% of our total company sales, another record for us compared to 21.9% last year. Our commercial sales growth continues to be driven by a host, and I want to emphasize, a host of key initiatives we've been working on for the last several years.\nWe improved our satellite store inventory availability. We've had massive improvements in Hub and Mega-Hub coverage. We're leveraging the strength of the Duralast brand. We have better technology to make us easier to do business with. We have significantly improved our delivery times. We've enhanced our sales force's effectiveness, and we're living consistent with our pledge by being \"priced right\" for the value proposition that we deliver. We continue to execute very well in commercial, and we are extremely proud of our team and their performance.\nWe're also very proud of our organization's performance in domestic DIY. We ran at 8.4% comp this quarter on top of last year's 15.7%. As our DIY 2-year stacked comp accelerated from the first quarter, it's remarkable to reflect on 4 consecutive quarters of more than 20% 2-year comps in this more mature portion of our business. From the data we have available to us, we continue to not only retain the enormous 3 full points of share gains we built during the initial stages of the pandemic but modestly continued to build on those gains.\nOur performance, considering the amount of time from the last stimulus and the ending of the enhanced unemployment benefits, has substantially exceeded our expectations and gives us more conviction on the sustainability of these sales levels.\nNow let's focus on sales cadence. Our same-store sales decreased sequentially from late November through January and then accelerated again in the few days of the quarter we had in February. The deceleration through January could be deceiving as last year's comp strengthened as the quarter progressed as a result of the federal stimulus distributed around the first of last calendar year. Given the dynamics in the past 20 months, we, like others who've benefited from the pandemic, believe it has been more instructive to look at 2-year stacked comps. On this basis, the monthly results were almost identical and were very stable.\nFor Q2, our 2-year comp was 29.1%, and the 4-week periods of the quarter increased 29.6%, 28.9% and 29.1%, respectively. Regarding weather, until February, we experienced warmer than usual weather in the northeastern U.S., while the remainder of the country experienced pretty normal winter trends. Overall, we feel weather did not play a material role in our sales performance. As we look forward to the spring months, we believe we will see normal weather trends and therefore, weather is not planned to be a big story for this upcoming quarter or summer. As a reminder, historically extreme weather, either cold or hot, drives parts failures and accelerated maintenance.\nRegarding this quarter's traffic versus ticket growth, in retail, our traffic was up slightly while our ticket was up 7.8%. This slight transaction count growth continues to be a meaningful acceleration from pre-pandemic levels, although it decelerated versus last year, as expected, due to the elimination of stimulus and enhanced unemployment. In our commercial business, we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers. It was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong, and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we are seeing in both domestic businesses heading into the spring months.\nDuring the quarter, there were some geographic regions that did better than others as there always are. But this quarter, we saw a mere 15 basis points difference between the Northeast and Midwest compared to the balance of the country. As winter definitely came in late January in the Northeast and Midwest, we are expecting that gap will remain close. Also, the market share data suggests we continued to gain share in most of our markets.\nNow let's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter. Our same-store sales were up 13.8% versus last year's second quarter. Our net income was $472 million and our EPS was $22.30 a share, increasing an impressive 49.4%. Regarding our merchandise categories in the retail business, our hard parts grew slightly faster than our sales floor categories but not material, say, maybe less than 1%. As Americans get back to driving more, we've seen maintenance and failure-related categories perform well. We've been especially pleased with our growth rates in select failure-related businesses like batteries that have successfully lapped very strong performance last year. We believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more.\nLet me also address inflation and pricing. This quarter, we saw our sales increase by over 5% from inflation while our cost of goods was up over 4% on a like-for-like basis. We believe both numbers will be slightly higher in the third quarter as cost increases and many key merchandise categories continue to work their way through the system. As rising raw material pricing, labor and transportation costs are all impacting us and our suppliers, inflation has been prevalent in the aftermarket space. We have no way to say how long this will last, but our industry has been disciplined about pricing for decades and we expect that to continue. It is also notable that following periods of higher inflation, we typically do not see corresponding deflation.\nWhile we continue to be encouraged with the current sales environment, it remains difficult to forecast near to midterm sales. What I will say is that the past 4-quarter sales have all been consistent on a 2-year stacked comp basis and a 3-year basis, and that goes for both our DIY and our commercial businesses. While it's difficult to predict absolute sales levels going forward, we are excited about our growth initiatives, our team's exceptional execution and the tremendous share gains we have achieved in both sectors. Currently, the macro environment, while uncertain, remains very favorable for our industry. And even if these near-term trends fade, we believe that we are in an industry that is positioned for solid growth over the long term.\nFor FY '22, we expect our sales performance to be led by the strength in our commercial business as we continue executing on our differentiating initiatives. As we progress through the year, we will, as always, be transparent about what we are seeing and provide color on our markets and outlooks as trends emerge.\nBefore handing the call over to Jamere, I'd like to address the subject of pricing and if AutoZone's pricing disciplines or philosophies have changed from past practices. The short answer is a resounding no. While we initiated a retail pricing adjustment last year in Q1 and further adjusted some commercial pricing in quarters 2 through 4, these moves were done to be price competitive but with other channels, not with our direct competitors. Specifically, in the retail business, we reduced our premiums to mass, particularly on highly visible commodity products.\nRegarding the more significant change in commercial, our prices have always, always been meaningfully higher than our WD competitors as our service level is superior. Our pricing changes over the last year or so have been too narrow. I emphasize narrow but not eliminate that gap. We must make sure we receive a premium for our service advantage, but we narrowed that premium by roughly half. While this has created some consternation in the investment community, we think our results have shown that this was a prudent and productive decision. We continue to see our industry as very rational when it comes to pricing strategies.\nAnd I want to be clear, crystal clear. I don't want anyone to conclude that our growth in commercial is solely due to pricing. We launched a comprehensive new strategy about 3 years ago, with improvements in assortments, local market availability with Hubs and Mega-Hubs, our delivery times are dropping as we leverage new technologies that have been deployed. Our team's execution is enhanced. We've made ourselves easier to do business with and we've improved our pricing versus WDs. We stated last year, we didn't envision any additional pricing reductions beyond those deployed at the beginning of last year's Q4, and that remains our stance. Now I'll turn the call over to Jamere Jackson. Jamere?\n\nJamere Jackson\n\nCFO, Executive VP - Finance & Store Development and Customer Satisfaction, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with double-digit comp growth, a 30% growth in EBIT and a 49% growth in EPS. Our results for the first half of the fiscal year have been remarkably strong as our growth initiatives continue to deliver great results, and the efforts of our AutoZoners in our stores and distribution centers have enabled us to take advantage of robust market conditions.\nTo start this morning, let me take a few moments to elaborate on the specifics in our P&L for Q2. For the quarter, total auto parts sales, which includes our domestic Mexico and Brazil stores, were $3.3 billion, up 15.6%. Now let me give a little color on sales and our growth initiatives. Starting with our commercial business for the second quarter, our domestic DIFM sales increased 32.1% to $844 million and were up 46.8% on a 2-year stacked basis. Sales to our DIFM customers represented 25% of our total company sales, and our weekly sales per program were $13,500, up 28.6% as we averaged just over $70 million in total weekly commercial sales. Once again, our growth was broad-based as national and local accounts both grew at approximately 32% for the quarter.\nWhile the second quarter is seasonally our lowest selling quarter, our results for the quarter are exceptional and represent the highest-volume second quarter in the history of the chain. I want to continue to reiterate that our execution on our commercial acceleration initiatives is delivering better-than-expected results as we focus on building a faster-growing business. We are making tremendous progress in growing share in this highly fragmented portion of the market by winning new business and increasing our share of wallet with existing customers. We have our commercial program in approximately 86% of our domestic stores, which leverages our DIY infrastructure, and we're building our business with national, regional and local accounts.\nThis quarter, we opened 22 net new programs, finishing with 5,233 total programs. As I said at the outset of the year, commercial growth will lead the way in FY '22 and our results in the second quarter and the first half of the year reflects this dynamic. We remain confident in our strategies and execution and believe we will continue gaining share, delivering quality parts, particularly with our Duralast brand, improved assortments, competitive pricing and providing exceptional service has enabled us to drive double-digit sales growth for the past 7 quarters. Our core initiatives are accelerating our growth and position us well in the marketplace. And notably, our Mega-Hub strategy is driving strong performance and positioning us for an even brighter future in our commercial and retail businesses.\nLet me add a little more color on our progress. As I mentioned last quarter, our Mega-Hub strategy has given us tremendous momentum. We now have 64 Mega-Hub locations, and we expect to open approximately 14 more over the remainder of the fiscal year. While I mentioned a moment ago, the commercial weekly sales per program average was $13,500 per program, the 64 Mega-Hubs averaged significantly higher sales and are growing much faster than the balance of the commercial footprint. As a result, our Mega-Hubs typically carry roughly 100,000 SKUs and drive tremendous sales lift inside the store box as well as serve as an expanded assortment source for other stores.\nThe expansion of coverage and parts availability continues to deliver a meaningful sales lift to both our commercial and DIY business, and we are testing greater density of Mega-Hubs to drive even stronger sales results. What we are learning is that not only are these assets performing well individually but the fulfillment capability for the surrounding AutoZone stores gives our customers access to thousands of additional parts and lifts the entire network.\nBy leveraging sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning, we're expanding our market reach, driving closer proximity to our customers and improving our product availability and delivery times. We're building a meaningful competitive advantage, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to create a faster-growing business.\nOn the retail side of our business, same-store sales for our domestic retail business was up 8.4% and up 24.1% on a 2-year stack. The business has been remarkably resilient as we have gained and maintained nearly 3 points of market share since the start of the pandemic. As Bill mentioned, we saw traffic up slightly to go along with 7.8% ticket growth as we continue to raise prices in an inflationary environment. Our growth initiatives are also leading to share gains as we improve the customer shopping experience, expand assortment and leverage our Hub and Mega-Hub network. These dynamics, along with favorable macro trends in miles driven, a growing and aging car park and a challenging new and used car sales market for our customers have continued to fuel sales momentum in DIY.\nOur in-stock positions, while still below where we were pre pandemic, are continuing to improve as our supply chain and merchandising teams have made great progress in a challenging supply chain environment. We've been able to navigate supply and logistics constraints and have product available to meet our customers' needs. Our AutoZoners who are taking care of our customers give us a key competitive advantage that enables us to thrive in this market environment.\nNow there's no question that DIY comps get tougher in the back half of the year due to exceptionally strong back half performance in both FY '20 and FY '21. But we remain confident that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, macro conditions are favorable for us and we have had great execution by our teams.\nNow I'll say a few words regarding our international business. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in Mexico and Brazil. During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores in Mexico to finish with 669 stores and 2 new stores in Brazil to finish with 55. And on a constant currency basis, we saw accelerated sales growth in both countries, in line with the growth rates we saw overall. We remain committed to our store opening schedules in both markets and expect both countries to be significant contributors to sales and earnings growth in the future. With only just over 10% of our total store base now outside the U.S. and our commitment to continue expansion in a disciplined way, international growth will be an attractive and meaningful contributor to AutoZone's future growth.\nNow let me spend a few minutes on the P&L and gross margins. For the quarter, our gross margin was down 59 basis points, driven primarily by the accelerated growth in our commercial business, where the shift in mix, coupled with the investments in our initiatives, drove margin pressure but increased our total gross profit dollars 14.5%. I mentioned on last quarter's call that we expected to have our gross margin down in a similar range this quarter as we saw in the first quarter where we were down 65 basis points versus the previous year.\nOur merchandising team has been focused on driving margin improvements primarily through pricing actions that offset inflation, resulting in slightly better performance than our initial expectations. As Bill mentioned earlier in the call, we are continuing to see cost inflation in certain product categories, along with rising transportation and distribution center costs. We're continuing to take pricing actions to offset inflation, and consistent with prior inflationary cycles, the industry's pricing remains rational. We would expect our margins in the third quarter to be down in the 50 bps range versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by mix headwinds from our fast-growing commercial business.\nMoving to operating expenses. Our expenses were up 7.5% versus last year's Q2 as SG&A as a percent of sales leveraged 264 basis points. The leverage was driven primarily by our strong results and approximately $40 million or 137 basis points and prior year pandemic-related expenses. While our SG&A dollar growth rate has been higher than historical averages, we've been focused on maintaining high levels of customer service during a period of accelerated growth. We also continued to invest at an accelerated pace in IT to underpin our growth initiatives, and these investments will pay dividends in user experience, speed and productivity. We will continue to be disciplined on SG&A growth as we move forward and manage expenses in line with sales growth over time.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. EBIT for the quarter was $627 million, up 30.1% versus the prior year's quarter, driven by strong top line growth. Interest expense for the quarter was $42.5 million, down 7.7% from Q2 a year ago as our debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $5.8 billion versus just over $5.5 billion at Q2 end last year. We are planning interest in the $45 million range for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, roughly flat with Q3 last year. For the quarter, our tax rate was 19.3% versus 20.6% in last year's second quarter. This quarter's rate benefited 401 basis points from stock options exercised last year -- exercised, while last year, it benefited 265 basis points. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we suggest investors model us at approximately 23.6% before any assumption on credits due to stock option exercises.\nMoving to net income and EPS. Net income for the quarter was $472 million, up 36.4% versus last year's second quarter. Our diluted share count of 21.2 million was 9% lower than last year's second quarter. The combination of higher net income and lower share count drove earnings per share for the quarter to $22.30, up 49.4% over the prior year's second quarter.\nNow let me talk about our free cash flow for Q2. For the second quarter, we generated $362 million of operating cash flow and spent $106 million in capital expenditures, allowing us to generate $270 million of free cash flow, up 3.1% versus the prior year. Year-to-date, we have generated $960 million in free cash, up 12.4% versus the prior year. You should expect us to continue being an incredibly strong cash flow generator going forward, and we remain committed to returning meaningful amounts of cash to our shareholders.\nRegarding our balance sheet, through our share repurchase program and the prepayment of a bond due in April, we have exhausted our excess cash balance on the balance sheet, but rest assured our liquidity position remains very strong and our leverage ratios remain below our historic norms. We're also managing our inventory well as our inventory per store was up 3.3% versus Q2 last year. Total inventory increased 6.2% over the same period last year, driven mainly by new stores and inflation. Net inventory, defined as merchandise inventories less accounts payable on a per store basis, was a negative $198,000 versus negative $93,000 last year and negative $207,000 last quarter. As a result, accounts payable as a percent of gross inventory finished the quarter at 126.8% versus last year's Q2 of 113%.\nLastly, I'll spend a moment on capital allocation and our share repurchase program. We repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of AutoZone stock in the quarter. As of the end of the fiscal quarter, we dropped below 20 million shares outstanding. As a point of emphasis, when we started our share repurchase program in 1998, we had 154 million shares outstanding. Now we have less than 20 million. At quarter end, we had just under $958 million remaining under our share buyback authorization. The powerful free cash we generated this year has allowed us to buy back over 6% of the shares outstanding since the beginning of the fiscal year. We have bought back over 90% of the shares outstanding of our stock since our buyback inception in 1998, while investing in our existing assets and growing our business. We remain committed to this disciplined capital allocation approach where we expect to return to our long-term leverage target in the 2.5x area and generate powerful free cash flows that will enable us to invest in the business and return meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders.\nTo wrap up, we had another very strong quarter, highlighted by strong comp sales, which drove a 36.4% increase in net income and a 49.4% increase in EPS. We are driving long-term shareholder value by investing in our growth initiatives, driving robust earnings and cash and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Our strategy continues to work. We are growing our DIY and DIFM businesses at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, and we are committed to capturing our fair share while improving our competitive positioning in a disciplined way. I continue to have tremendous confidence in our ability to drive significant and ongoing value for our shareholders. And now I'll turn it back to Bill.\n\nWilliam C. Rhodes\n\nChairman, President & CEO, AutoZone, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jamere. Fiscal 2022 is off to a very strong start, and we remain focused on superior customer service and flawless execution. Our culture is based on exceptional service and that will continue to define our success.\nI want to step back for a minute and talk about the big picture. Throughout the pandemic, each of us has had a very difficult time forecasting the future in light of all the uncertainties: the disease, the variants, consumer and government responses, competitive dynamics and on and on. But we are now nearly 2 years into this pandemic. What has happened to our business over those 2 years due to the tremendous contributions of our AutoZoners is nothing short of phenomenal.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis versus pre pandemic, our sales volumes have increased by over a remarkable 30%, and our profitability expressed as EBIT has increased nearly 50%. 6 to 9 months ago, if you would have asked us, our expectation was that some of those incremental sales and profits would go back closer to historic norms. While it is still very difficult to predict the next 6 to 12 months, our perspective has morphed. As we are nearly a year past the last stimulus and nearly 6 months from the suspension of enhanced unemployment, we believe most, if not all, of this growth is sustainable.\nWe believe our competitive positioning is improved, as indicated by our significant share gains in both retail and commercial. And consumer behaviors may have permanently changed. If this holds true, it will be the fourth time in the last 30 years that the economy and society have had significant shocks, leading to material acceleration in our growth in sales and profits without a corresponding decline back to pre-recessionary or pre-pandemic levels.\nOur industry is unique, but it has a very long track record of strong performance with high return and cash flow characteristics. As we begin to lap the second anniversary of the pandemic, some of the measurements we've all used recently to measure our performance will become skewed. Remember, at the beginning of the pandemic, our sales dropped radically. Our retail sales rebounded quickly with the April 2020 stimulus, but commercials rebound lagged and it took several months to recover.\nFor Q3, the 2-year stacked comp measurement holds reasonably well as we delivered basically flat overall comps in Q3 of 2020. However, that measure for our commercial business won't be as meaningful. And then in Q4, in light of the amazing performance in 2020, the 2-year comparison for overall comps won't be comparable. We would encourage you to migrate to 3-year comps.\nWe continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on our opportunities for 2022. We believe the macro backdrop is in our favor for the near and long term. Our customers across the Americas want to get out and get out and drive, and we'll be there when they need helpful advice. Our team has worked diligently and collaboratively with our suppliers, and together, they have done a very good job dealing with the enormous supply chain challenges that exist for everyone.\nWhile our in-stock levels are improving and we expect that to continue, we also believe we are better in stock than most retailers. And our results, they support that belief. For the remainder of fiscal 2022, we are launching some very exciting initiatives. We're focused on further growing share, but as always, doing so on a very profitable basis. In fiscal 2024, we plan to open a new distribution center in California to fuel continued growth of our domestic business. We just recently announced a new distribution center in Virginia. And we're now planning an additional distribution center in Mexico to allow us to service a growing store base in that country.\nThis is a meaningful acceleration in our historic investments in distribution centers as during the pandemic, we have learned we need to have a bit more excess capacity in our supply chain. We're also targeting to open 14 more new domestic Mega-Hubs in the U.S. that will enhance our availability and support growth in our retail and commercial businesses. As we've mentioned many times before, our Mega-Hub strategy is at the core of materially improving our inventory availability. This strategy is expected to help us drive both commercial and retail sales for many, many years to come. We also will be leveraging our Hub and Mega-Hub strategy further in Mexico.\nFor the fiscal year, we expect to open more than 200 new stores throughout the Americas with notable acceleration in Brazil. These capacity expansion investments reflect our bullishness on our industry and, in particular, our own growth prospects. We're being disciplined yet we're being aggressive.\nI also want to reiterate how proud I am of our AutoZoners across the stores and distribution centers, in particular, for their commitment to servicing our customers and doing so in a very safe manner. First and foremost, our focus will be on keeping our AutoZoners and customers safe while providing our customers with their automotive needs. And secondly, we must continuously challenge ourselves during these extraordinary times to position our company for even greater future success. We know that investors will ultimately measure us by what our future cash flows look like 3 to 5 years from now. And we very much, very much welcome that challenge. I continue to be bullish on our industry and, in particular, on AutoZone and AutoZoners. Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

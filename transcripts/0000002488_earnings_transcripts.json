Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered an outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability, reflecting broad-based demand across our data center, AI, server and PC businesses. .\nRevenue grew 36% year-over-year to $9.2 billion. Net income rose 31% and free cash flow more than tripled led by record EPYC, Ryzen and Instinct processor sales. Our record third quarter performance marks a clear step-up in our growth trajectory as the combination of our expanding compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center AI business drives significant revenue and earnings growth.\nTurning to our segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 22% year-over-year to a record $4.3 billion led by the ramp of our Instinct MI350 series GPUs and server share gains. Server CPU revenue reached an all-time high as adoption of fifth-gen EPYC turn processors accelerated rapidly, accounting for nearly half of overall EPYC revenue in the quarter. Sales of our prior generation EPYC processors were also very robust in the quarter, reflecting their strong competitive positioning across a wide range of workloads.\nIn cloud, we had record sales as hyperscalers expanded EPYC CPU deployments to power both their own first-party services and public cloud offerings. Hyperscalers launched more than 160 EPYC-powered instances in the quarter, including new turn offerings from Google, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba and others that deliver unmatched performance and price performance across a wide range of workloads. There are now more than 1,350 public EPYC cloud instances available globally, a nearly 50% increase from a year ago. Adoption of EPYC in the cloud by large businesses more than tripled year-over-year as our on-prem share gains are driving increased demand from enterprise customers for AMD cloud instances to support hybrid compute.\nWe expect cloud demand to remain very strong as hyperscalers are significantly increasing their general purpose compute capacity as they scale their AI workloads. Many customers are now planning substantially larger CPU build-outs over the coming quarters to support increased demands from AI, serving as a powerful new catalyst for our server business.\nTurning to enterprise adoption. EPYC server sell-through increased sharply year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting accelerating enterprise adoption. More than 170 fifth-gen EPYC platforms are in market from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others, our broadest portfolio to date with solutions optimized for virtually every enterprise workload.\nWe closed large new wins in the quarter with leading Fortune 500 technology, telecom, financial services, retail, streaming, social and automotive companies as we expand our footprint across major verticals. The performance and TCO advantages of our EPYC portfolio, combined with our increased go-to-market investments and the expanded breadth of offerings from the leading server and solutions providers position us well for continued enterprise share gains.\nLooking ahead, we remain on track to launch our next-generation 2-nanometer Venice processors in 2026. Venice silicon is in the labs and performing very well, delivering substantial gains in performance, efficiency and compute density. Customer pull and engagement for Venice are the strongest we have seen, reflecting our competitive positioning and the growing demand for more data center compute. Multiple cloud OEM partners have already brought their first Venice platforms online setting the stage for broad solution availability and cloud deployments at launch.\nTurning to data center AI, our Instinct GPU business continues to accelerate. Revenue grew year-over-year driven by the sharp ramp of MI350 Series GPU sales and broader MI MI300 series deployments. Multiple MI350 series deployments are underway with large cloud and AI providers with additional large-scale rollouts on track to ramp over the coming quarters.\nOracle became the first hyperscaler to publicly offer MI355x instances, delivering significantly higher performance for real-time inference and multimodal training workloads on OCI's [indiscernible] supercluster. Neo cloud providers Crusa, DigitalOcean, Tensor Wave, Vultr and others also began ramping availability of their MI350-series public cloud offerings in the quarter.\nMI300 Series GPU deployments with AI developers also broadened in the quarter. IBM and Zyphra will train multiple generations of future multimodal models on a large-scale MI300x cluster. And Cohere is now using MI355X at OCI to train its command family of models.\nFor Inference, a number of new partners, including Character AI and LumaAI, are now running production workloads on MI300 series, demonstrating the performance and TCO advantages of our architecture for real-time AI applications.\nWe also made significant progress on the software front in the quarter. We launched ROCm 7, our most advanced and feature-rich release to date, delivering up to 4.6x higher inference and 3x higher trading performance compared to ROCm 6. ROCm 7 also introduces seamless distributed inference, enhanced code portability across hardware and new enterprise tools that simplify the deployment and management of instant solutions. Importantly, our open software strategy is resonating with developers. Huggingface, [indiscernible] and others contributed directly to ROCm 7 as we make ROCm the open platform for AI development at scale.\nLooking ahead, our data center AI business is entering its next phase of growth with customer momentum building rapidly ahead of the launch of our next-gen MI400 series accelerators and Helios rack scale solutions in 2026. The MI400 series combines a new compute engine with industry-leading memory capacity and advanced networking capabilities to deliver a major leap in performance for the most demanding AI training and inference workloads. The MI400 series brings together our silicon, software and systems expertise to power Helios, our rack scale AI platform designed to redefine performance and efficiency at data center scale.\nHelios integrates our Instinct MI400 series GPUs, Venice EPYC CPUs and Pensando Nick in a double-wide rack solution optimized for the performance, power, cooling and serviceability required for the next generation of AI infrastructure and supports Meta's new open rack wide standard.\nDevelopment of both our MI400 series CPUs and Helios rack is progressing rapidly, supported by deep technical engagements across a growing set of hyperscalers, AI companies and OEM and ODM partners to enable large-scale deployments next year. The ZT Systems team we acquired last year is playing a critical role in Helios development, leveraging their decades of experience building infrastructure for the world's largest cloud providers to ensure customers can deploy and scale Helios quickly within their environments.\nIn addition, last week, we completed the sale of the ZT manufacturing business to [indiscernible] and entered a strategic partnership that makes them our lead manufacturing partner for Helios. This collaboration will accelerate large customer deployments of our rack scale AI solutions.\nOn the customer front, we announced a comprehensive multiyear agreement with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs with the first gigawatt of MI450 series accelerators scheduled to start coming online in the second half of 2026. The partnership establishes AMD as a core compute provider for OpenAI and underscores the strength of our hardware, software and full stack solution strategy.\nMoving forward, AMD and OpenAI will work even more closely on future hardware, software, networking and system-level road maps and technologies. OpenAI's decision to use AMD instant platforms for its most sophisticated and complex AI workloads sends a clear signal that our instinct GPUs and ROCm open software stack deliver the performance and TCO required for the most demanding deployments. We expect this partnership will significantly accelerate our data center AI business with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.\nOracle announced they will also be a lead launch partner for the MI450 series, deploying tens of thousands of MI450 GPUs across Oracle Cloud Infrastructure beginning in 2026 and expanding through 2027 and beyond.\nOur Instinct platforms are also gaining traction with sovereign AI and national supercomputing programs. In the UAE, Cisco and G42 will deploy a large-scale AI cluster powered by Instinct MI350x GPUs to support the nation's most advanced AI workloads. In the U.S., we are partnering with the Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Labs to build Lux AI, the first AI factory dedicated to scientific discovery together with our industrial partners, OCI and HPE. Powered by our instinct MI350 series GPUs, EPYC CPUs and Pensando networking, Lux AI will provide a secure open platform for large-scale training and distributed inference when it comes online in early 2026.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy also selected our upcoming MI430x GPUs and EPYC Venice CPUs to power discovery the next flagship supercomputer at Oak Ridge designed to set the standard for AI-driven scientific computing and extend U.S. high-performance computing leadership. Our MI430X GPUs are designed specifically to power nationscale AI and supercomputing programs, extending our leadership, powering the world's most powerful computers to enable the next generation of scientific breakthroughs.\nIn summary, our AI business is entering a new phase of growth and is on a clear trajectory towards tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027, driven by our leadership rack scale solutions, expanding customer adoption and an increasing number of large-scale global deployments. I look forward to providing more details on our data center AI growth plans at our Financial Analyst Day next week.\nIn Client and Gaming, segment revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $4 billion. Our PC processor business is performing exceptionally well with record quarterly sales as a strong demand environment and breadth of our leadership Ryzen portfolio accelerates growth.\nDesktop CPU sales reached an all-time high with record channel sell-in and sellout led by robust demand for our [indiscernible] processors which deliver unmatched performance across gaming, productivity and content creation applications. OEM sell-through of Ryzen-powered notebooks also increased sharply in the quarter, reflecting sustained end customer pull for premium gaming and commercial AMD PCs. Commercial momentum accelerated in the quarter with Ryzen PC sell-through up more than 30% year-over-year as enterprise adoption grew sharply, driven by large wins with Fortune 500 companies across health care, financial services, manufacturing, automotive and pharmaceuticals.\nLooking ahead, we see significant opportunity to continue growing our client business faster than the overall PC market based on the strength of our Ryzen portfolio, broader platform coverage and expanded go-to-market investments.\nIn gaming, revenue increased 181% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Semi-custom revenue increased as Sony and Microsoft prepared for the upcoming holiday sales period. In gaming graphics, revenue and channel sell-out grew significantly, driven by the performance per dollar leadership of our Radeon 9000 family. FSR 4, our machine learning upscaling technology that boosts frame rates and creates more immersive visuals saw rapid adoption this quarter with the number of supported games doubling since launch to more than 85.\nTurning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year to $857 million. Sequentially, revenue and sell-through increased as the demand environment strengthened across multiple markets, led by test and emulation, aerospace and defense and industrial vision and health care.\nWe expanded our Embedded product portfolio with new solutions that extend our leadership across adaptive and x86 computing. We began shipping industry-leading Versal Prime series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs to lead customers, delivered our first virtual RF development platform to support several next-generation design wins and introduced the Ryzen Embedded 9000 series with industry-leading performance per watt and latency for robotics, edge computing and smart factory applications.\nThe design momentum remains very strong across our Embedded portfolio. We are on track for a second straight year of record design wins already totaling more than $14 billion year-to-date, reflecting the growing adoption of our leadership products across a broad range of markets and expanding set of applications.\nIn summary, our record third quarter results and strong fourth quarter outlook reflect the significant momentum building across our business, driven by sustained product leadership and disciplined execution. Our data center AI, server and PC businesses are each entering periods of strong growth, led by an expanding TAM, accelerating adoption of our Instinct platforms and EPYC and Ryzen CPU share gains.\nThe demand for compute has never been greater as every major breakthrough in business, science and society now relies on access to more powerful, efficient and intelligent computing. These trends are driving unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD. I look forward to sharing more on our strategy, road maps and long-range financial targets at our Financial Analyst Meeting next week.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our third quarter results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nWe are pleased with our strong third quarter financial results. We delivered record revenue of $9.2 billion, up 36% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Our third quarter results do not include any revenue from shipments of the MI308 GPU products to China. Revenue increased 20% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the Data Center and the Client and Gaming segment and modest growth in the Embedded segment.\nGross margin was 54%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by product mix. Operating expenses were approximately $2.8 billion, an increase of 42% year-over-year as we continue to invest aggressively in R&D to capitalize on significant AI opportunities and go-to-market activities for revenue growth. Operating income was $2.2 billion, representing a 24% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other totaled $273 million.\nFor the third quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $1.20 compared to $0.92 a year ago, an increase of 30% year-over-year.\nNow turning to our reportable segments, starting with the Data Center. Data Center segment revenue was a record of $4.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year, primarily driven by the strong demand for fifth-generation EPYC processors and Instinct MI350 series GPUs. On a sequential basis, Data Center revenue increased 34%, primarily driven by a strong ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPUs.\nThe Data Center segment operating income was $1.1 billion or 25% of revenue compared to $1 billion a year ago or 29% of revenue, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to capitalize on significant AI opportunities.\nClient and Gaming segment revenue was a record of $4 billion, up 73% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, driven by strong demand for the latest generation of client and graphic processors and stronger sales of console gaming products.\nIn the client business, revenue was a record $2.8 billion, up 46% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, driven by record sales of our Ryzen processors and richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.3 billion, up 181% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, reflecting higher semi customer revenue and strong demand for our Radeon GPUs.\nClient and Gaming segment operating income was $867 million or 21% of revenue compared to $288 million or 12% a year ago, driven by higher revenue, partially offset by increase in go-to-market investment to support our revenue growth.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $857 million, down 8% year-over-year. Embedded was up 4% sequentially as we saw certain end market demand strengthen. Embedded segment operating income was $283 million or 33% of revenue compared to $372 million or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to lower revenue and end market mix.\nBefore I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the sale of ZT System manufacturing business to [indiscernible] last week. The third quarter financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operating activities of continuing operations and the free cash flow was a record of $1.5 billion. We returned $89 million to shareholders through share repurchases resulting in $1.3 billion in share repurchases for the first 3 quarters of 2025. Exiting the quarter, we have $9.4 billion authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments were $7.2 billion. Our total debt was $3.2 billion.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter 2025 outlook. Please note that our fourth quarter outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China. For the fourth quarter of 2025 we expect revenue to be approximately $9.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 25% year-over-year revenue growth driven by strong double-digit growth in our Data Center and Client and Gaming segment and a return to growth in our Embedded segment.\nSequentially we expect revenue to grow by approximately 4% driven by double-digit growth in the Data Center segment with strong growth in server and the continued ramp of our MI350 series GPUs. A decline in our Client and Gaming segment with client revenue increasing and the gaming revenue down strong double digits and double-digit growth in our Embedded segment. In addition, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54.5%. And we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.8 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be a gain of approximately $37 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.65 billion shares.\nIn closing, we executed very well, delivering record revenue for the first 3 quarters of the year. The strategic investments we are making position us well to capitalize on expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling shareholder value creation.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\nMatthew D. Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nThank you very much, Jean. John, we can go ahead and poll the audience for questions now. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce to you, Matthew Ramsay, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew D. Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, and welcome to AMD's 2025 Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and the accompanying slides. If you have not had the chance to review these materials, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of amd.com. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press release and slides posted on our website.\nParticipants in today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jean Hu, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.

Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa.\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered very strong second quarter results, with revenue exceeding the midpoint of guidance as higher EPYC and Ryzen processor sales more than offset headwinds from export controls that impacted Instinct sales. We've had records for both EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales, reflecting the broad-based demand for our differentiated high-performance data center, PC and embedded processors.\nSecond quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion and we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow. Excluding the $800 million inventory write-down related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54%, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion led by a richer product mix.\nTurning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. We saw robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for emerging AI use cases. In particular, adoption of agentic AI is creating additional demand for general purpose compute infrastructure as customers quickly realize that each token generated by a GPU triggers multiple CPU-intensive tasks. Against this backdrop, fifth-gen EPYC Turin shipments ramped significantly, and we had sustained demand for our prior generation EPYC processors. As a result, we set records for both cloud and enterprise CPU sales and delivered our 33rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains.\nIn cloud, adoption expanded with the largest hyperscalers as they deployed EPYC to power more of their mission-critical infrastructure, services and public cloud products. More than 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle Cloud that deliver up to twice the performance of our previous generation, which were already the industry's highest-performing There are now nearly 1,200 EPYC cloud instances available globally as providers continue expanding both the breadth and regional availability of their AMD offerings. This continued expansion is accelerating enterprise adoption of EPYC in the cloud, with deployments growing significantly from the prior quarter as we closed large wins with dozens of large aerospace, streaming, financial services, retail and energy companies.\nEPYC adoption also grew with telecom customers as providers modernize their infrastructure for next-generation networks. For example, KDDI announced plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its 5G virtualized network. And Nokia selected EPYC cloud platform used by service providers to build, deploy and manage core network functions.\nTurning to enterprise on-prem adoption. HPE, Dell, Lenovo and Super Micro launched 28 new Turin platforms in the quarter that deliver leadership performance, efficiency and TCO across a wide range of enterprise workloads. EPYC enterprise deployments grew significantly from the prior quarter, supported by new wins with large technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services and public sector customers.\nTo extend our momentum with SMB and hosted IT service customers, we launched the EPYC 4005 series that combine enterprise-grade performance and features and cost-optimized platforms, purpose-built for smaller scale deployments.\nTurning to HPC, AMD now powers more than 1/3 of the world's fastest supercomputers, including El Capitan and Frontier, which retained the #1 and #2 spots on the latest Top 500 list. We also power 12 of the top 20 systems on the Green 500, highlighting the performance per watt advantages of EPYC and Instinct for large-scale deployments. Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our server CPU business, driven by durable tailwinds, including growing demand for cloud and on-prem compute, sustained share gains and the growing investments in general purpose infrastructure required to enable AI.\nTurning to our Data Center AI business. Revenue declined year-over-year as U.S. export restrictions effectively eliminated MI308 sales to China, and we began transitioning to our next-generation MI350 series accelerators. We made solid progress with MI300 and MI325 in the quarter, closing new wins and expanding adoption with Tier 1 customers, next-generation AI cloud providers and end users. Today, 7 of the top 10 builders and AI companies use Instinct, underscoring the performance and TCO advantages of our Data Center AI solutions.\nWe launched our Instinct MI350 series with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity and broad adoption across hyperscalers, AI companies and OEMs. From a competitive standpoint, MI355 matches or exceeds B200 in critical training and inference workloads and delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at significantly lower cost and complexity. For upscale inferencing, MI355 delivers up to 40% more tokens per dollar, providing leadership performance and clear TCO advantages.\nWith the MI350 series, we're also expanding our system-level capabilities to support deployments powered by AMD CPUs, GPUs and NICs. As one example, Oracle is building a 27,000-plus node AI cluster combining MI355x accelerators, fifth-gen EPYC Turin CPUs and Pollara 400 SmartNICs. We began volume production of the MI350 series ahead of schedule in June and expect a steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large-scale production deployments with multiple customers.\nOur sovereign AI engagements accelerated in the quarter as governments around the world adopt AMD technology to build secure AI infrastructure and advance their economies. As one example, we announced a multibillion-dollar collaboration with HUMAIN to build AI infrastructure powered entirely on AMD CPUs, GPUs and software. Initial deployments are underway in key regions with quarterly expansions planned over the coming years. In addition, we have more than 40 active engagements globally and see significant opportunities to power an increasingly larger portion of national computing and sovereign AI initiatives.\nOn the AI software front, we made significant progress this quarter, increasing the performance, improving the usability and expanding the adoption of ROCm. We announced ROCm 7 with major upgrades across every layer of the stack, delivering more than 3x higher inferencing training performance compared to our prior generation and adding support for large-scale training, distributed inference and lower decision data types.\nTo deepen developer engagement, we introduced nightly ROCm builds and expanded access to Instinct compute infrastructure, including launching our first developer cloud that provides preconfigured containers for instant access to AMD GPUs. We also expanded native support for ROCm across key frameworks, including BLLM and SG Lang, enabling Frontier models like Llama 4, Gemma 3 and DeepSeek-R1 to launch with day 0 AMD support.\nTo accelerate enterprise adoption, we introduced ROCm Enterprise AI, a full-stack platform that integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and includes everything needed for an enterprise to deploy, manage and scale AI across their business. Looking ahead, the development of our next-generation MI400 series is progressing rapidly. Via the most advanced GPU we have ever built with up to 40 petaflops of [ FT4 ] AI performance and 50% more memory, memory bandwidth and scale-out throughput than the competition.\nWith the MI400 series, we're bringing together everything we've learned across silicon, software and systems to deliver Helios, a full-stack rack scale AI platform. Helios is purpose built for the most demanding AI workloads with each rack connecting up to 72 GPUs that can operate as a single massive AI accelerator. Helios is expected to deliver up to a 10x generational performance increase for the most advanced Frontier models, and we believe it will be the highest-performance AI system in the world when it launches. MI400 series development is progressing well towards our planned launch in 2026, with significant interest in large-scale deployments from multiple high-profile customers.\nTo accelerate our development, we have invested significantly to expand our AI software and hardware capabilities, both organically and inorganically with a number of acquisitions and strategic investments. We strengthened our software stack last quarter with the addition of the and Lemony teams, building on our acquisitions of Nod.ai, Mipsology, and Silo AI.\nOn the hardware side, we added a world-class rack and data center scale design team in the second quarter with our acquisition of ZT Systems. The ZT team is integrated seamlessly and they are actively engaging with multiple customers to accelerate deployments of our Helios solutions at scale. We also announced last quarter that Sanmina intends to acquire ZT's U.S.-based manufacturing business, becoming our lead partner for AI rack manufacturing.\nTurning to the AI regulatory environment. Earlier this quarter, we were notified by the Department of Commerce that it is moving forward with the review of our license applications to export MI308 to China. We appreciate the focus the Trump administration is placing on assuring that the U.S. technology remains central to global AI infrastructure, and we expect to resume MI308 shipments as licenses are approved, subject to end customer demand and supply chain readiness.\nAs our licenses are still under review, we are not including any MI308 revenue in our third quarter guidance. Despite that, we expect Instinct revenue to grow year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by the ramp of MI350 at multiple customers.\nIn Client and Gaming, segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our semi-custom game console SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Client revenue increased 67% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, led by record desktop CPU sales. Demand for our latest-generation Ryzen 9000 series was strong, especially for our differentiated X3D processors. We delivered record desktop channel CPU sales as Ryzen processors consistently topped the best-selling CPU lists at major global e-tailers throughout the quarter.\nWe also expanded our Zen 5 desktop portfolio with the launch of our latest Threadripper processors that feature up to 96 cores and deliver up to double the performance of the competition in many popular content creation and design workloads. In mobile, demand for AMD-powered notebooks was strong with sellout growing by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year. We drove a richer mix of higher ASP mobile parts year-over-year as we expanded our share in the premium notebook segment where our Ryzen AI 300 CPUs deliver leadership performance and value for both general purpose and AI workloads.\nIn commercial PCs, rising adoption accelerated as OEM consumption increased more than 25% year-over-year. We saw strong sell-through for AMD commercial notebooks with Lenovo and HP and a significant uptick in Dell sales as they ramp availability of their AMD commercial portfolio. We also closed new enterprise wins with Forbes 2000 pharma, tech, automotive, financial services, aerospace and health care companies. We expect to continue growing our commercial client share based on the strength of our product portfolio and expanded breadth of OEM offerings.\nLooking more broadly, we remain confident we can continue growing client processor revenue ahead of the market over the coming quarters, driven by increased adoption of our desktop and notebook products, growing commercial momentum and a richer product mix.\nIn Gaming, revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Semi-custom revenue increased by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year as console inventories normalized and our customers began preparing for the holiday season. We announced a new multiyear collaboration with Microsoft for custom chips that will power the next generation of Xbox devices, including consoles, PCs and handhelds. We also deepened our collaboration with Sony through Project Amethyst, a co-engineering program that will use machine learning to power the next wave of immersive gaming experiences.\nIn PC gaming, demand for our latest-generation Radeon 9000 series GPUs was very strong, with desktop GPU sell-through accelerating in the quarter as demand outpaced supply. We launched the Radeon 9600XT, extending the performance advantages of RDNA 4 to mainstream gamers and delivering a significant uplift in gaming performance, including more than double the ray tracing of our prior generation. As part of our end-to-end AI strategy, we introduced the Radeon AI Pro R9700 GPU for local inferencing, model fine-tuning and other data-intensive workloads. The R9700 features more memory, full ROCm support and multi-GPU scalability, enabling advanced AI development and deployment directly on the desktop.\nTurning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $824 million. Demand continues recovering gradually with sell-through in the second quarter picking up as strength in most markets was offset by a few pockets of softness in inventory reduction actions largely with industrial customers. We expanded our Embedded portfolio with the first production shipments of Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs that deliver leadership performance and advanced security for cost-sensitive low-power applications.\nAdoption of our Versal Adaptive SoCs continues expanding in high-end applications including next-generation robotaxi platforms developed by Bosch in Europe, where Versal serves as a high-performance controller, enabling real-time processing, security and encryption in fully electric automated vehicles. Looking ahead, we expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications and aerospace markets will drive a return to sequential growth in the second half of 2025.\nLonger term, design win momentum continues to build, tracking ahead of this point last year and putting us on pace to pass the record $14 billion in design wins we achieved in 2024. In summary, demand is very strong across our product portfolio, and we are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, led by the steep ramp of MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen share gains.\nOur server and PC businesses are accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio and expanded go-to-market investments. Our Embedded and Gaming businesses are returning to growth and are well positioned for long-term success, supported by strong design win momentum. And in AI, we are seeing strong adoption of our MI350 series and ROCm 7 as we deliver leadership performance and TCO advantages across a broader range of workloads and ramp deployments with an expanded set of cloud and enterprise customers.\nLooking ahead, we see a clear path to scaling our AI business to tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. We are very excited about our next-generation MI400 series, which is another giant step forward on our road map and has been designed to deliver leadership performance at the chip, server and rack levels. Customer interest for the MI400 series is very strong, and we are actively engaging with an expanding set of customers to support large-scale deployments in 2026.\nWe are in the early stages of an industry-wide AI transformation that will drive a step function increase in compute demand across all of our markets, positioning us for significant revenue and earnings growth over the coming years. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We are pleased with our strong second quarter financial results. We delivered record revenue of $7.7 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, up 32% year-over-year, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Record sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and higher semi-custom shipments more than offset the impact of the U.S. export controls, restricting MI308 sales to China.\nRevenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the Client and the Gaming segment, partially offset by the Data Center revenue decrease due to export controls. Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. The decrease was due to the $800 million inventory and related charges associated with the export restrictions. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.\nOperating expenses were approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year as we continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities for revenue growth and in R&D to capitalize on significant future AI expansion opportunities. Operating income was $897 million, representing a 12% operating margin compared to $1.3 billion or 22% a year ago. The decline was primarily due to the inventory and the related charges. Taxes, interest expense and other totaled $126 million. For the second quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $0.48 compared to $0.69 a year ago. The inventory and the related charges reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.43.\nNow turning to our reportable segment, starting with the Data Center. Data Center segment revenue was $3.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by strong EPYC CPU revenue and the share gains across both cloud and enterprise customers. On a sequential basis, Data Center revenue decreased 12% due to the impact of the export controls on MI308. The Data Center segment operating loss was $155 million compared to operating income of $743 million a year ago or 26% of revenue. The loss was primarily due to the inventory and related charges.\nClient and Gaming segment revenue was $3.6 billion, up 69% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our PC and console gaming products. In the Client business, revenue was a record of $2.5 billion, up 67% year-over-year, driven by record sales of our Ryzen desktop CPUs and a richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.1 billion, up 73% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for our newly launched gaming GPUs and higher semi-custom revenue as inventory has now normalized and the customers prepare for the holiday season. Client and Gaming segment operating income was $767 million or 21% of revenue compared to $166 million or 8% a year ago, driven by richer Client product mix and operating leverage on higher revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $824 million, down 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially as Embedded end market demand remains mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $275 million or 33% of revenue compared to $345 million or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to product mix.\nBefore I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of ZT Systems early in the second quarter. As we had announced our intent to divest the ZT manufacturing business, the financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials. Subsequently, in May, we entered into agreement with Sanmina Corporation to sell the ZT manufacturing business for $3 billion in cash and stock, inclusive of contingent payment. The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and the customary closing conditions.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operating activities of continuing operations, and free cash flow was a record of $1.2 billion. We returned $478 million to shareholders through share repurchase, resulting in $1.2 billion in share repurchases for the first half of 2025. In May, our Board of Directors approved an additional $6 billion authorization. Exiting the quarter, we have $9.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase program.\nAt the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment were $5.9 billion. Our long-term debt was $3.2 billion during the quarter. We paid down $950 million of commercial paper used to finance the ZT Systems acquisition close.\nNow turning to our third quarter 2025 outlook. Please note that our third quarter outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China as our license applications are currently under review by U.S. government. For the third quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Client and Gaming and the Data Center segments.\nSequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in the Data Center segment, the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPU products, modest growth in our Client and Gaming segment, with Client revenue increasing and the Gaming revenue to be flattish, and our Embedded segment revenue to return to growth. In addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.55 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be a gain of approximately $10 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.\nIn closing, we executed very well in the first half of the year, delivering record revenue and building strong momentum for growth in the second half. The strategic investments we are making position us to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling value creation. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\nMatthew D. Ramsay\n\nAnalyst, Cowen & Co. LLC\n\nOperator, will you please poll the audience for questions? Thank you."

You will also find a detailed discussion of our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, in particular, AMD's most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K. And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Lisa.\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered an outstanding start to the year despite the evolving dynamics related to tariffs and the regulatory environment. Growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter year-over-year driven by strength in our core businesses and expanding Data Center and AI momentum. Revenue and EPS both exceeded consensus estimates as Instinct AI accelerator, EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales grew significantly year-over-year.\nAs a result, first quarter revenue increased 36% year-over-year to $7.4 billion as our Data Center and Client and Gaming segments both grew by a large double-digit percentage. We expanded gross margin year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter and increased net income by 55%, driven by a higher overall percentage of Data Center product sales and a richer Ryzen processor mix. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, our first quarter performance highlights the strength of our differentiated product portfolio and execution and positions us well for strong growth in 2025.\nTurning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 57% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. We gained server CPU share driven by the ramp of our latest fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and sustained demand for 4th Gen EPYC. Hyperscaler demand remains strong as cloud providers expanded EPYC deployments to power their critical infrastructure and public services. More than 30 new instances launched from Alibaba, AWS, Google, Oracle, Tencent, and others in the quarter, including the initial wave of 5th Gen EPYC Turin instances.\nIn addition, AWS launched new FPGA accelerated instances in the quarter, powered by EPYC processors with Xilinx FPAs that are optimized for data and compute-intensive workloads like genomics, multimedia processing, network security and cloud-based video broadcasting. Every major cloud provider is deep in development on Turin programs with a steady stream of public instances and internal deployments expected to ramp into production over the coming quarters.\nEnterprise adoption of EPYC instances was very strong in the quarter. The number of EPYC-powered cloud instances activated by Forbes 2000 enterprise customers more than doubled year-over-year, including new wins with Internet native streaming, transportation, financial services, and social media companies. For example, CrowdStrike achieved major performance in cost improvements by broadly deploying EPYC instances across its multi-cloud infrastructure.\nAt the same time, we're also actively partnering with leading application and cloud providers to deploy EPYC-optimized solutions tailored for specialized industry verticals. Siemens launched their latest software-defined vehicle solution powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Pro GPUs on Azure, leveraging digital twin technology to significantly speed up automotive design and validation. Oracle launched a new version of its Exadata database platform, which is used by more than half of the Fortune Global 100. The latest Exadata X11N has been optimized for 5th Gen EPYC processors to deliver up to 25% faster performance in transaction processing and analytics compared to the prior generation.\nTurning to enterprise on-prem adoption. EPYC CPU sales grew by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year for the seventh straight quarter, driven by new public sector wins and high-volume deployments with large automotive, semiconductor, financial services, retail, energy, and technology companies. We have built significant enterprise momentum over the last few years as our partners expanded the number of EPYC-based platforms to more than 450 and we scaled our joint go-to-market programs. As a result, EPYC is now deployed by all of the top 10 telecom, aerospace, and semiconductor companies, 9 out of the top 10 automotive, 7 out of the top 10 manufacturing, and 6 out of the top 10 energy companies on the Forbes 2000. We expect enterprise adoption to accelerate over the coming quarters as more than 150 Turin platforms become broadly available from Dell, Cisco, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro and others.\nLooking forward, we see a clear path to continued share gains as customers ramp their 5th Gen EPYC offerings that deliver unmatched performance, efficiency and TCO across every major cloud and enterprise data center workload. We passed key milestones in April to begin manufacturing 5th Gen EPYC at TSMC's new Arizona fab, with first production shipments expected in the second half of 2025. Longer term, we announced our next-gen EPYC Venice processors, our lead HPC products for TSMC's 2-nanometer process node. Vena Silicon is in our labs and performing well with bring-up and validation progressing to support a 2026 launch.\nTurning to our Data Center AI business. Revenue increased by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year as MI325x shipments ramped to support new enterprise and cloud deployments. More than 35 MI300 Series platforms are in production from all the leading service providers, supporting the expanding number of GPU deployments with cloud, enterprise and AI customers. Several hyperscalers expanded their use of Instinct accelerators to cover an increasing range of generative AI search, ranking and recommendation use cases.\nWe also added multiple Tier 1 cloud and enterprise customers in the quarter, including one of the largest frontier model developers that is now using Instinct GPUs to serve a significant portion of their daily inference traffic. The depth and breadth of our customer engagements continues to expand as breakthroughs in large-scale AI models like OpenAI's o3 and DeepSeek's R1 drive increased demand for traditional inferencing and increasingly as a critical part of pretraining.\nThe industry-leading memory capacity and bandwidth of our Instinct portfolio is ideally suited for these workloads, and we are actively working with multiple customers to scale Instinct from single-node deployments to distributed inferencing clusters. Training engagements also ramped in the quarter as multiple Tier 1 hyperscale, AI and enterprise customers scaled Instinct GPU clusters to train internal and frontier models. In parallel, we're making meaningful progress with sovereign AI deployments as countries expand investments to establish domestic nation-scale AI infrastructure.\nIn February, we announced a strategic partnership with [ 342 ] to build one of France's most powerful AI compute facilities powered by Instinct accelerators. On the AI software front, we significantly accelerated our release cadence in the first quarter, shifting from quarterly ROCm updates to delivering ready to deploy training and inferencing containers on a biweekly basis that include performance optimizations and support for the latest libraries, kernels and algorithms.\nWe expanded our open source community enablement in the quarter, making significantly more instant compute infrastructure available to enable developers to automatically build, test, and deploy updates to ROCm code nightly. As a result, more than 2 million models on Hugging Face now run out of the box on AMD. We're also enabling an increasing number of models to launch with day zero support for Instinct accelerators, including Meta's Llama 4, Google's Gemma 3, and DeepSeek's R1 models that were released in the first quarter.\nBeyond launch, we are delivering regular software updates that increase performance for new models. For example, in the weeks following the launch of DeepSeek's R1 model, we introduced ROCm optimizations that enabled MI300 to deliver leadership inferencing throughput. We released ROCm 6.4 in the quarter with major upgrades that increased training and inferencing performance across popular AI frameworks like PyTorch, JAKKS and VLLM. The release also adds multiple ease-of-use features, including new cluster management tools that simplify the scaling and optimization of large-scale Instinct deployments.\nTurning to our AI solutions capabilities. Earlier this quarter, we completed our acquisition of ZT Systems, adding world-class systems design expertise to complement our silicon and software leadership. With ZT, we can provide ready-to-deploy rack-level AI solutions based on industry standards built with AMD CPUs, GPUs and networking, reducing deployment time for hyperscalers and accelerating time to market for OEM and ODM partners. The team is fully engaged and already co-designing with key customers and rack-level designs optimized for our upcoming MI400 series and working with customers and OEM partners to accelerate time to market for our MI350 series.\nWe have received significant interest in ZT's manufacturing business and expect to announce a strategic partner shortly. We began sampling our next-gen MI350 series with multiple customers in the first quarter and remain on track to begin accelerated production by midyear. MI350 Series performance is very strong based on the advances in our CDNA 4 architecture. We designed CDNA 4 to deliver leadership performance across a wide range of AI workloads, increasing memory capacity and bandwidth 1.5x, adding support for new data types and improving network efficiency to deliver 35x higher throughput and performance compared to MI300x.\nCustomer interest in the MI 350 series is very strong, setting the stage for broad deployment in the second half of this year. As 1 example, we are partnering with Oracle to deploy a large-scale cluster powered by MI355x accelerators, 5th Gen EPYC turn processors and Polera400 AI NICs. The multibillion-dollar initiative highlights the expanding AMD and OCI partnership and the growing demand for AMD Instinct to power the next wave of large-scale AI infrastructure.\nLooking ahead, our MI400 Series development remains on track to launch next year. The MI400 Series is designed to deliver leadership performance for both inferencing and training, scaling seamlessly from single servers to full data center deployments. Early customer feedback has been very positive, marking a major step forward in our Instinct road map and significantly expanding our AI accelerator TAM as customers plan broader Instinct deployments to power a larger share of their AI infrastructure. I'm looking forward to sharing more details on the MI350 Series, future MI400 rack-scale solutions and the growing customer adoption of our Instinct platforms at our Advancing AI event on June 12.\nTurning to our Client and Gaming segment. Segment revenue increased 28% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. Client revenue grew 68% year-over-year, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue share gains. We delivered record client CPU ASP, driven by a richer mix of high-end desktop and mobile Ryzen processors. Desktop channel sell-out increased by more than 50% year-over-year. We set new sell-out records in multiple regions as our latest-generation Ryzen processors became the CPU of choice for gamers, topping bestseller lists at leading global e-tailers.\nTo build on this momentum, we extended our desktop CPU portfolio with the launch of our 16-core Ryzen 9950 X3D processor that delivers significantly higher gaming and productivity performance than the competition. In mobile, AMD-based notebook sell-through was very strong in the quarter. We also saw strong demand for our latest generation AI PC processors as sales ramped, increasing by more than 50% quarter-on-quarter. The first notebooks powered by our new high-end Ryzen AI MAX+ and the first mainstream Ryzen AI 7 and 5 300 series processors launched to very positive reviews.\nThese new processors set the standard for traditional computing and graphics performance while also delivering unmatched AI capabilities in battery life, positioning Ryzen as a CPU of choice for gaming, ultrathin and commercial notebooks. Demand for AMD-based commercial PCs was also very strong in the quarter. Ryzen Pro PC sell-through grew more than 30% year-over-year, driven by new end customer wins and an 80% increase from 2024 in the number of AMD-powered commercial systems from HP, Lenovo, Dell and Asus. We closed multiple wins with large auto, energy, health care, financial services and telecom companies in the quarter.\nLooking more broadly across the PC market, we remain confident we can grow client processor revenue well ahead of the market in 2025, led by expanding adoption of our desktop channel and consumer and commercial notebook portfolio as well as a richer mix.\nTurning to our Gaming business results. Gaming revenue decreased 30% year-over-year as higher Radeon Graphics sales were more than offset by low semi-custom sales. While our semi-custom SoC sales declined year-over-year, console channel inventories have normalized as demand sales have strengthened for 2025. For PC gaming, we launched our Radeon 9070 series to strong demand as our new RDNA 4 architecture delivers leadership performance for mainstream gamers. First week sell-out set a record and was more than 10x higher than our previous best Radeon launch. Demand remains very strong, and we are working closely with our board partners to replenish inventory weekly and need to sustain demand.\nWe also introduced FSR 4, our first machine learning-based rendering technology that delivers significantly higher frame rates and more immersive gaming experiences. FSR is already enabled in over 30 games with support expected to reach 75 titles by year-end.\nTurning to our Embedded segment. First quarter revenue decreased 3% year-over-year to $823 million. Embedded demand continues to recover gradually. We expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications and aerospace markets will drive a return to growth in the second half of 2025. We completed initial shipments of our optimized Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs and second-generation Versal AI Edge to meet growing demand for AI at the edge.\nAs a part of continuing to grow our Embedded X86 business, we launched our EPYC Embedded 9005 Series CPUs that deliver leadership performance for networking, storage and industrial edge applications. Cisco selected our new EPYC Embedded processors for their latest high-end firewall solutions, and IBM is using them to power its latest storage scale System 6000 for performance-intensive enterprise analytics and AI workloads. We also released our latest Vitis AI software suite, expanding support for the latest models and accelerating Edge AI deployment across a broader range of applications, further strengthening our leadership in the rapidly emerging edge AI market.\nIn summary, our strong first quarter results and second quarter outlook reflect the momentum we are building across our business. While we face some headwinds from the dynamic macro and regulatory environments, including the recently announced export controls for [ Instinct MI308 ] shipments to China, we believe they are more than offset by the powerful tailwinds from our leadership product portfolio. Against this backdrop, we remain confident we can deliver strong double-digit percentage revenue growth in 2025 based on accelerating share gains with our latest generation of [indiscernible] EPYC and Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs and ramping production of our Instinct MI350 Series accelerators in the second half of the year to support an expanded set of customers and AI workloads.\nWe also expect full year growth in our semi-custom business and for our Embedded business to return to year-over-year growth in the second half of the year, driven by the reduced inventory levels and improving band environment. To capitalize on our unprecedented growth opportunities and deliver our next major growth arc, we are expanding investments in our product and technology road maps, go-to-market initiatives and full stack AI software and Data Center solutions capabilities.\nWe're also doubling down our execution to deliver and, where possible, accelerate our industry-leading road maps. We view the current environment as a strategic opportunity to further differentiate AMD as we deliver an expanding product portfolio that combine leadership compute and AI capabilities for data centers, edge, PCs and embedded end devices. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, our first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial statement disclosures include the combination of our Client and the Gaming businesses into a single reportable segment to align with how we manage the business, continue to provide this team revenue disclosures for our Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded businesses.\nWe are pleased with our record first quarter revenue of $7.4 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance, up 36% year-over-year, driven by 57% revenue growth in the Data Center segment and a 28% revenue growth in the Client and the Gaming segment. Revenue declined 3% sequentially due to lower revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by sequential growth in the Client and Gaming segment. Gross margin was 54%, up 140 basis points from a year ago.\nOperating expenses were $2.2 billion, an increase of 28% year-over-year as we continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities and in R&D to address the significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Operating income was $1.8 billion, representing a 24% operating margin. Taxes, interest expenses and the other was $213 million. For the first quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share was $0.96, an increase of 55% year-over-year.\nNow turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center. Data Center segment revenue was 3.7 billion, up 57% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued CPU server share gains across both the cloud and enterprise customers and strong growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. On a sequential basis, Data Center segment revenue decreased 5%. Data Center segment operating income was $932 million or 25% of revenue compared to $541 million or 23% a year ago.\nClient and Gaming segment revenue was $2.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by strong customer demand for our latest generation Zen 5 AMD rising processors, partially offset by lower semi-customer revenue. Client revenue was $2.3 billion, up 68% year-over-year. More than half of the growth was driven by higher ASPs from a richer mix of high-end Ryzen processors. On a sequential basis, Client and Gaming segment revenue increased by 2%, primarily driven by stronger-than-seasonal performance of our Client product portfolio and increased semi-customer product revenue.\nClient and Gaming segment operating income was $496 million or 17% of revenue compared to $237 million or 10% of a year ago, driven by operating leverage on higher revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $823 million, down 3% year-over-year. Embedded demand continues to recover gradually. Sequentially, embedded was down 11%, consistent with our expectations. Embedded segment operating income was $328 million or 40% of revenue compared to $342 million or 41% a year ago.\nTurning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $39 million in cash from operations, and our free cash flow for the quarter was $727 million. We returned $749 million to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock and our repurchase program. We have $4 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was $7.3 billion. Within the quarter, we reached $1.5 billion of debt for issued $950 million of commercial paper to help fund our acquisition of ZT Systems, which was completed on March 31.\nNow turning to our second quarter 2025 outlook. As a reminder, in April, a new export license requirement was put in place for MI308 shipments to China, the impact of which is included in our guidance. We expect revenue to be approximately $7.4 billion plus or minus $300 million. This includes an estimated $700 million revenue reduction as a result of the new export license requirement. Despite this headwind, the midpoint of our guidance represents 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\nFor the full year 2025, we estimated the revenue impact due to the export license requirement to be approximately $1.5 billion. Sequentially, we expect Client and Gaming segment revenue to increase by double-digit percentage. Embedded segment revenue to be flattish, and we expect Data Center segment revenue to decrease due to the exclusion of MI308 revenue. In addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be 43%, inclusive of approximately $800 million in charges for inventory and related reserves. Excluding this charge, our non-GAAP gross margin would be approximately 54%.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.3 billion, which includes approximately $50 million in OpEx due to the addition of the ZT Systems' design team. The financials for the ZT manufacturing business will be reported as discontinued operations starting in the second quarter. We expect net interest and other expenses to be $5 million due to the debt associated with the ZT System transaction. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares, which includes 9 million shares related to the ZT transaction.\nLooking forward, despite ongoing macro and trade policy-related uncertainties, we believe the investments we are making will position us well to address the large growth opportunities ahead as AI expand use of high-performance computing across all our end markets. In closing, 2025 is off to a strong start as we continue to execute on key strategic and financial goals. We delivered strong top line revenue growth, expanded gross and operating margins and closed the key acquisition of ZT Systems to expand and accelerate our data center GPU and the systems road maps. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\nMatt Ramsay\n\nThank you very much, Jean. John, can you go ahead and pool the callers for the Q&A session, please?"

Lisa?\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. 2024 was a transformative year for AMD. We successfully established our multibillion-dollar data center AI franchise. Launched a broad set of leadership products and gained significant server and PC market share. As a result, we delivered record annual revenue, grew net income 26% for the year and more than doubled free cash flow from 2023. Importantly, the data center segment contributed roughly 50% of annual revenue as Instinct and EPYC processor adoption expanded significantly with cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers.\nLooking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 24% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion, led by record quarterly data center and client segment revenue both of which grew by a significant double-digit percentage. On a full year basis, annual revenue grew 14% to $25.8 billion as data center revenue nearly doubled and client segment revenue grew 52%, more than offsetting declines in our gaming and Embedded segments.\nTurning to the segments. Data center segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to a record $3.9 billion. 2024 marks another major inflection point for our server business as share gains accelerated, driven by the ramp of fifth-gen EPYC Turin and strong double-digit percentage year-over-year growth in fourth gen EPYC sales. In cloud, we exited 2024 with well over 50% share at the majority of our largest hyperscale customers. Hyperscaler demand for EPYC CPUs was very strong, driven by expanded deployments powering both their internal compute infrastructure and online services. Public cloud demand was also very strong with a number of EPYC instances increasing 27% in 2024 to more than 1,000. AWS, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft and Tencent launched more than 100 AMD general purpose in AI instances in the fourth quarter alone. This includes new Azure instances powered by a custom-built EPYC processor with HBM memory that delivers leadership HPC performance based on offering 8x higher memory bandwidth compared to competitive offerings.\nWe also built significant momentum with Forbes 2000 global businesses using EPYC in the cloud as enterprise customers activated more than double the number of EPYC cloud instances from the prior quarter. This capped off a strong year of growth as enterprise consumption of EPYC in the cloud nearly tripled from 2023.\nTurning to enterprise on-prem adoption. EPYC CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year as sales grew increased, and we closed high-volume deployments with Akamai, Hitachi, LG, ServiceNow, Verizon, Visa and others. We are seeing growing enterprise pull based on the expanding number of EPYC platforms available and our increased go-to-market investments. Exiting 2024, there are more than 450 EPYC platforms available from the leading server OEMs and ODMs, including more than 120 turn platforms that went into production in the fourth quarter from Cisco, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Super Micro and others.\nLooking forward, Turin is clearly the best server processor in the world with more than 540 performance records across a broad range of industry standard benchmarks. At the same time, we are seeing sustained demand for both fourth and third gen EPYC processors as our consistent road map execution has made AMD the dependable and safe choice. As a result, we see clear growth opportunities in 2025 across both cloud and enterprise based on our full portfolio of EPYC processors optimized for leadership performance across the entire range of data center workloads and system price points.\nTurning to our data center AI business. 2024 was an outstanding year as we accelerated our hardware road map to deliver an annual cadence of new Instinct accelerators expanded our ROCm software suite with significant uplifts in inferencing and training performance, built strong customer relationships with key industry leaders and delivered greater than $5 billion of data center AI revenue for the year.\nLooking at the fourth quarter, MI300x production deployments expanded with our largest cloud partners. Meta exclusively used MI300X to serve their Llama 405B [indiscernible] meta.ai and added instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads. Microsoft is using MI300x to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services and launched flagship instances that scale up to thousands of GPUs for AI training and inference and HPC workloads. IBM, Digital Ocean, Vulture and several other AI-focused CSPs have begun deploying AMD Instinct accelerators for new instances. IBM also announced plans to enable MI300x on their Watson X AI and data platform for training and deploying enterprise-ready generative AI applications. Instinct platforms are currently being deployed across more than a dozen CSPs globally, and we expect this number to grow in 2025.\nFor enterprise customers, more than 25 M300 series platforms are in production with the largest OEMs and ODMs. To simplify and accelerate enterprise adoption of AMD Instinct platforms, Dell began offering MI300x as a part of their AI factory solution suite and is providing multiple ready-to-deploy containers via the Dell Enterprise Hub on hugging face. HPC adoption also grew in the quarter. AMD now powers five of the 10 fastest and 15 of the 25 most energy-efficient systems in the world on the latest top 500 supercomputer list. Notably, the El Capitan system at Lawrence Livermore National Labs debuted as the world's fastest supercomputer, using over 44,000 MI300 AAPUs to deliver more than 1.7 exaflops of compute performance.\nEarlier this month, the high-performance computer center at the University of Stuttgart, launched the Hunter supercomputer that also uses MI300A. Like El Capitan, Hunter will be used for both foundational scientific research and advanced AI projects, including training LOMs in 24 different European languages.\nOn the AI software front, we made significant progress across all layers of the ROCm stack in 2024. Our strategy is to establish AMD ROCm as the industry's leading open software stack for AI, providing developers with greater choice and accelerating the pace of industry innovation. More than 1 million models on hugging face now run out of the box on AMD. And our platforms are supported in the leading frameworks like Pie torch and JAKs, serving solutions like VLLM and compilers like OpenAI trite.\nWe have also successfully ramped large-scale production deployments with numerous customers using ROCm, including our lead hyperscale partners. We ended the year with the release of ROCm 6.3 that included multiple performance optimizations including support for the latest flash attention algorithm that runs up to 3x faster than prior versions and SG Lang run time that enabled day support for state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek V3. As a result of these latest enhancements, M300 inferencing performance has increased 2.7x since launch.\nLooking forward, we're continuing to accelerate our software investments to improve the out-of-the-box experience for a growing number of customers adopting Instinct to power their diverse AI workloads. For example, in January, we began delivering biweekly container releases that provide more frequent performance and feature updates and ready to deploy packages, and we continue adding resources dedicated to the open source community that enable us to build, test and launch new software enhancements at a faster pace.\nOn the product front, we began volume production of MI325x in the fourth quarter. The production ramp is progressing very well to support new customer wins. MI325 is well positioned in market, delivering significant performance and TCO advantages compared to competitive offerings. We have also made significant progress with a number of customers adopting AMD Instinct. For example, we recently closed several large wins with MI300 and MI325 at Lighthouse AI customers that are deploying instinct at scale across both their inferencing and training production environments for the first time.\nLooking ahead, our next-generation MI350 series featuring our CDNA 4 architecture is looking very strong. CDNA 4 will deliver the biggest generational leap in AI performance in our history, with a 35x increase in AI compute performance compared to CDNA 3. The silicon has come up really well. We were running large-scale LLM within 24 hours of receiving first silicon and validation work is progressing ahead of schedule. The customer feedback on MI350 series has been strong, driving deeper and broader customer engagements with both existing and net new hyperscale customers in preparation for at-scale MI350 deployments.\nBased on early silicon progress and the strong customer interest in the MI350 series, we now plan to sample lead customers this quarter and are on track to accelerate production shipments to mid-year. As we look forward into our multiyear AMD Instinct road map, I'm excited to share that MI400 series development is also progressing very well. The CDNA next architecture takes another major leap enabling powerful Rackscale solutions that tightly integrate networking CPU and GPU capabilities at the silicon level to support Instinct solutions at data center scale.\nWe designed CDNA next to deliver leadership AI and HPC flops while expanding our memory capacity and bandwidth advantages and supporting an open ecosystem of scale up and scale out networking products. We are seeing strong customer interest in the MI400 series for large-scale training and inference deployments and remain on track to launch in 2026.\nTurning to our acquisition of ZTE Systems. We passed key milestones in the quarter and received unconditional regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions, including Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. Cloud and OEM customer response to the acquisition has been very positive as ZTE's systems expertise can accelerate time to market for future instinct accelerator platforms. We have also received significant interest in ZTE's manufacturing business. We expect to successfully divest CT's industry-leading U.S.-based data center infrastructure production capabilities shortly after we closed the acquisition, which remains on track for the first half of the year.\nTurning to our client segment. Revenue increased 58% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion. We gained client revenue share for the fourth straight quarter, driven by significantly higher demand for both Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. We had record desktop channel sell-out in the fourth quarter in multiple regions as Ryzen dominated the best-selling CPU list at many retailers globally. Exceeding 70% share at Amazon, New Ag, Mine factory and numerous others over the holiday period.\nIn mobile, we believe we had a record OEM PC sell-through share in the fourth quarter as Ryzen AI 300 Series notebooks ramp. In addition to growing share with our existing PC partners, we were very excited to announce a new strategic collaboration with Dell that marks the first time they will offer a full portfolio of commercial PCs powered by Ryzen Pro processors. The initial wave of Ryzen-powered Dell commercial notebooks is planned to launch this spring with the full portfolio ramping in the second half of the year as we focus on growing commercial PC share.\nAt CES, we expanded our Ryzen portfolio with the launch of 22 new mobile processors that deliver leadership compute, graphics and AI capabilities. Our Ryzen processor portfolio has never been stronger with leadership compute performance across the stack. For AI PCs, we are the only provider that offers a complete portfolio of CPUs, enabling Windows Copilot plus experiences on premium ultrathin, commercial, gaming and mainstream notebooks.\nLooking into 2025, we're planning for the PC TAM to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage year-on-year. Based on the breadth of our leadership client CPU portfolio and strong design win momentum, we believe we can grow client segment revenue well ahead of the market.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 59% year-over-year to $563 million. Semi-custom sales declined as expected as Microsoft and Sony focused on reducing channel inventory. Overall, this console generation has been very strong. Highlighted by cumulative unit shipments surpassing $100 million in the fourth quarter.\nLooking forward, we believe channel inventories have now normalized and semi-custom sales will return to more historical patterns in 2025.\nIn Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year as we accelerated channel sellout in preparation for the launch of our next-gen Radeon 9000 series GPUs. Our focus with this generation is to address the highest volume portion of the enthusiast gaming market with our new RDNA 4 architecture. RDNA 4 delivers significantly better rate tracing performance and add support for AI-powered upscaling technology that will bring high-quality 4K gaming to mainstream players when the first Radeon 970 series GPUs go on sale in early March.\nNow turning to our Embedded segment. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 13% year-over-year to $923 million. The demand environment remains mixed, with the overall market recovering slower than expected as strength in aerospace and defense and test and emulation is offset by softness in the industrial and communications markets. We continue expanding our adaptive computing portfolio in the quarter with differentiated solutions for key markets.\nWe launched our Versal RF series with industry-leading compute performance for aerospace and defense markets, introduced our Versal premium series Gen 2 as the industry's first adaptive compute devices supporting CXL 3.1 and PCI Gen 6 and began shipping our next-gen Alveo card with leadership performance for ultra-low latency trading. We believe we gained adaptive computing share in 2024 and are well positioned for ongoing share gains based on our design win momentum.\nWe closed a record $14 billion of design wins in 2024, up more than 25% year-over-year as customer adoption of our industry-leading adaptive computing platforms expands and we won large new embedded processor designs. In summary, we ended 2024 with significant momentum, delivering record quarterly and full year revenue. EPYC and Ryzen processor share gains grew throughout the year, and we are well positioned to continue outgrowing the market based on having the strongest CPU portfolio in our history. We established our multibillion-dollar data center AI business and accelerated both our Instinct hardware and ROCm software road maps.\nFor 2025, we expect the demand environment to strengthen across all of our businesses, driving strong growth in our data center and client businesses and modest increases in our gaming and Embedded businesses. Against this backdrop, we believe we can deliver strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth year-over-year. Looking further ahead, the recent announcements of significant AI infrastructure investments like Stargate, and latest model breakthroughs from DeepSeek and the Allen Institute highlight the incredibly rapid pace of AI innovation across every layer of the stack, from silicon to algorithms to models, systems and applications.\nThese are exactly the types of advances we want to see as the industry invests in increased compute capacity while pushing the envelope on software innovation to make AI more accessible and enable breakthrough generative and agentic AI experiences that can run on virtually every digital device. All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses. AMD is the only provider with the breadth of products and software expertise needed to power AI from end to end across data center, edge and client devices. We have made outstanding progress building the foundational product, technology and customer relationships needed to capture a meaningful portion of this market. And we believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise for more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. AMD executed very well in 2024, delivering record revenue of $25.8 billion, up 14%, driven by 94% growth in our data center segment and a 52% growth in our client segment, which more than offset headwinds in our gaming and embedded segments. We expect gross margin by 300 basis points and achieved earnings per share growth of 25% while investing aggressively in AI to fuel our future growth.\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Revenue was a record $ 7.7 billion, growing 24% year-over-year as strong revenue growth in the data center and client segment was partially offset by lower revenue in our gaming and embedded segments. Revenue was up 12% sequentially, primarily driven by the growth of client data center and the gaming segments. Gross margin was 54%, up 330 basis points year-over-year due to a favorable shift in revenue mix with higher data center and client revenues lower gaming revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower embedded revenue. Operating expenses were $ 2.1 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. as we invest in R&D and marketing activities to address our significant growth opportunities. Operating income was a record of $2 billion, representing 26% operating margin. Taxes, interest and other was $249 million net expense.\nFor the first quarter of 2024 Diluted earnings per share was $1.09, an increase of 42% year-over-year, reflecting the significant operating leverage of our business model. Now turning to our reportable segment. starting with the data center segment. Revenue was a record of $3.9 billion, up 69% year-over-year driven by strong growth, both AMD Instinct GPU and the fourth and the fifth generation AMD EPYC CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $1.2 billion or 30% of revenue compared to $666 million or 29% a year ago. Client segment revenue was a record of $2.3 billion, up 58% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for AMD Ryzen processors. Client segment operating income was $446 million or 19% of revenue compared to operating income of $55 million or 4% of revenue a year ago, driven primarily by operating leverage due from higher revenue. Gaming segment revenue was $563 million, down 59% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in semi customer revenue. Gaming segment operating income was $50 million or 9% of revenue compared to $224 million or 16% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $923 million, down 13% year-over-year as end market demand continues to be mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $362 million or 39% of revenue compared to $461 million or 44% a year ago.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in cash from operations and a record $1.1 billion for free cash flow. Inventory increased sequentially by $360 million to $ 5.7 billion. In the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments were $5.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares and returned 256 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased 5.9 million shares and they returned 862 million to shareholders. We have a $4.7 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization.\nBefore I turn to our financial outlook, let me cover our financial segment reporting. Beginning with our first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial statement disclosures. We plan to combine the client and the gaming segment into one single reportable segment to align with how we manage the business. Therefore, reporting three segments: data center, client with gaming and the embedded. We'll continue to provide distinct revenue disclosures for our data center, client, gaming and embedded businesses. consistent with our current reporting.\nNow turning to our first quarter of 2025 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion plus or minus $300 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our data center and the client business. More than offsetting a significant decline in our gaming business and a modest decline in our embedded business. We expect revenue to be down sequentially approximately 7%, driven primarily by seasonality across our businesses. In addition, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.1 billion. Non-GAAP other net income to be $24 million, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares.\nIn closing, 2024 was a strong year for AMD, demonstrating our disciplined execution to deliver revenue growth and expand earnings at a faster rate than revenue. All while investing in AI and the innovation to fuel long-term growth. Looking ahead, we will build on the momentum to drive double-digit percentage revenue growth and further accelerated earnings in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you very much, Jean. We're now ready to start the Q&A session. As the operator pulls for questions, we remind each participant to please ask one question and a brief follow-up. Operator, please poll for questions. Thanks. ."

With that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa.\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered strong second quarter financial results, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of guidance and profitability increasing by a double-digit percentage driven by higher-than-expected sales of our Instinct, Ryzen, and EPYC processors. We continued accelerating our AI traction as leading cloud and enterprise providers expanded availability of Instinct MI300X solutions, and we also saw positive demand signals for general purpose compute in both our client and server processor businesses.\nAs a result, second quarter revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $5.8 billion as significantly higher sales of our Data Center and Client processors more than offset declines in Gaming and Embedded product sales. We also expanded gross margin by more than 3 percentage points and grew EPS 19% as Data Center product sales accounted for nearly 50% of overall sales in the quarter.\nTurning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 115% year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion, driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy 4th Gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to [indiscernible] portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages.\nThe number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected 4th Gen EPYC public cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission-critical customer-facing workloads.\nIn the enterprise, sell-through increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, health care, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than 1/3 of our enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers.\nLooking ahead, our next-generation Turin family featuring our new Zen 5 core is looking very strong. Zen 5 is a grounds-up new core design optimized for leadership performance and efficiency. Turin will extend our TCO leadership by offering up to 192 cores and 384 threads, support for the latest memory and I/O technologies, and the ability to drop into existing 4th Gen EPYC platforms. We publicly previewed Turin for the first time in June, demonstrating our significant performance advantages in multiple compute-intensive workloads. We also passed a major milestone in the second quarter as we started Turin production shipments to lead cloud customers. Production is ramping now ahead of launch, and we expect broad OEM and cloud availability later this year.\nTurning to our Data Center AI business. We delivered our third straight quarter of record Data Center GPU revenue with MI300 quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Microsoft expanded their use of MI300X accelerators to power GPT-4 Turbo and multiple copilot services, including Microsoft 365 Chat, Word, and Teams. Microsoft also became the first large hyperscaler to announce general availability of public MI300X instances in the quarter.\nThe new Azure VMs leverage the industry-leading compute performance and memory capacity of MI300X in conjunction with the latest ROCm software to deliver leadership inferencing price performance when running the latest frontier models, including GPT-4. Hugging Face was one of the first customers to adopt the new Azure instances, enabling enterprise and AI customers to deploy hundreds of thousands of models on MI300X GPUs with 1 click.\nOur enterprise and cloud AI customer pipeline grew in the quarter, and we are working very closely with our system and cloud partners to ramp availability of MI300 solutions to address growing customer demand. Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Super Micro all have Instinct platforms in production, and multiple hyperscale and Tier 2 cloud providers are on track to launch MI300 instances this quarter.\nOn the AI software front, we made significant progress enhancing support and features across our software stack, making it easier to deploy high-performance AI solutions on our platforms. We also continued to work with the open source community to enable customers to implement the latest AI algorithms. As an example, AMD support for Flash Attention 2 algorithm was upstreamed, providing out-of-the-box support for AMD hardware in the popular library that can increase training and inference performance on large transformer models.\nOur work with the model community also continued accelerating, highlighted by the launches of new models and frameworks with day 1 support for AMD hardware. At Computex, I was joined by the co-CEO of Stable Diffusion to announce that MI300 is the first GPU to support their latest SD 3.0 Image Generation LLM. Last week, we were proud to note that multiple partners use ROCm and MI300X to announce support for the latest Llama 3.1 models, including their 405 billion parameter version that is the industry's first frontier-level open source AI model.\nLlama 3.1 runs seamlessly on MI300 accelerators. And because of our leadership memory capacity, we're also able to run the FP16 version of the Llama 3.1 405B model in a single server, simplifying deployment and fine-tuning of the industry-leading model and providing significant TCO advantages. Earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Silo AI, Europe's largest private AI lab with extensive experience developing tailored AI solutions for multiple enterprise and embedded customers, including Allianz, Ericsson, Finnair, Karber, Nokia, Philips, T-Mobile, and Unilever. The Silo team significantly expands our capability to service large enterprise customers looking to optimize their AI solutions for AMD hardware. Silo also brings deep expertise in large language model development, which will help accelerate optimization of AMD inference and training solutions.\nIn addition to our acquisitions of Silo AI, Mipsology, and Nod.ai, we have invested over $125 million across a dozen AI companies in the last 12 months to expand the AMD AI ecosystem, support partners, and advance leadership AMD computing platforms. Looking ahead, from a road map perspective, we are accelerating and expanding our Instinct road map to deliver an annual cadence of AI accelerators, starting with the launch of MI325X later this year. MI325X leverages the same infrastructure as MI300 and extends our generative AI performance leadership by offering twice the memory capacity and 1.3x more peak compute performance than competitive offerings.\nWe plan to follow MI325X with the MI350 series in 2025 based on the new CDNA 4 architecture, which is on track to deliver a 35x increase in performance compared to CDNA 3. And our MI400 series powered by the CDNA Next architecture is making great progress in development and is scheduled to launch in 2026.\nTurning to our AI solutions work. Broadcom, Cisco, HP Enterprise, Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, all joined us to announce Ultra Accelerator Link, an industry standard technology to connect hundreds of AI accelerators that is based on AMD's proven Infinity Fabric technology. By combining UALink with the widely supported Ultra Ethernet consortium specification, the industry is coming together to establish a standardized approach for building the next generation of high-performance data center AI solutions at scale.\nIn summary, customer response to our multiyear Instinct and ROCm road maps is overwhelmingly positive and we're very pleased with the momentum we are building. As a result, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the $4 billion we guided in April.\nTurning to our Client segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 49% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our prior generation Ryzen processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 5 processors. In PC applications, Zen 5 delivers an average of 16% more instructions per clock than our industry-leading previous generation of Ryzen processors. For desktops, our upcoming Ryzen 9000 series processors dropped into existing AM5 motherboards and extends our performance and energy efficiency leadership across productivity, gaming, and content creation workloads.\nFor notebooks, we announced our Ryzen AI 300 series that extends our industry-leading CPU and GPU performance and introduces the industry's fastest NPU with [ 50 tops ] of AI compute performance for Copilot+ PCs. The first Ryzen AI 300 Series notebooks went on sale over the weekend to strong reviews, and more than 100 Ryzen AI 300 Series premium, gaming, and commercial platforms are on track to launch from Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, and others over the coming quarters. Customer excitement for our new Ryzen processors is very strong, and we are well positioned for ongoing revenue share gains based on the strength of our leadership portfolio and design win momentum.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 59% year-over-year to $648 million as semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections. Semi-custom demand remains soft as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle, and we expect sales to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. In gaming graphics, revenue increased year-over-year, driven by improved sales of our Radeon 6000 and 7000 Series GPUs in the channel.\nTurning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 41% year-over-year to $861 million. The first quarter marked the bottom for our Embedded segment revenue. Although second quarter revenue was flattish sequentially, we saw early signs of order patterns improving and expect Embedded revenue to gradually recover in the second half of the year. Longer term, we are building strong design win momentum for our expanded Embedded portfolio. Design wins in the first half of the year increased by more than 40% from the prior year to greater than $7 billion, including multiple triple-digit million-dollar wins, combining our Adaptive and x86 compute products.\nWe announced our Alveo V80 accelerators that deliver leadership capabilities in memory-intensive workloads and entered early access on next-generation edge AI solutions with more than 30 key partners on our upcoming 2nd Gen Versal Adaptive SoCs.\nLast week, we also announced Victor Peng, President of AMD, would retire at the end of August. Victor has made significant contributions to Xilinx and AMD, including helping scale our Embedded business and leading our cross-company AI strategy. On a personal note, Victor has been a great partner to me, ensuring the success of our Xilinx acquisition and integration. On behalf of all of the AMD employees and Board, I want to thank Victor for all of his contributions to AMD's success and wish him all the best in his retirement.\nIn summary, we delivered strong second quarter results and are well positioned to grow revenue significantly in the second half of the year, driven by our Data Center and Client segments. Our Data Center GPU business is on a steep growth trajectory as shipments ramp across an expanding set of customers. We're also seeing strong demand for our next-generation Zen 5, EPYC, and Ryzen processors that deliver leadership performance and efficiency in both Data Center and Client workloads.\nLooking ahead, the rapid advances in generative AI and development of more capable models are driving demand for more compute across all markets. Under this backdrop, we see strong growth opportunities over the coming years and are significantly increasing hardware, software, and solutions investments with a laser focus on delivering an annual cadence of leadership data center GPU hardware, integrating industry-leading AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, enabling full stack software capabilities, amplifying our ROCm development with the scale and speed of the open source community, and providing customers with turnkey solutions that accelerate the time to market for AMD-based AI systems.\nWe are excited about the unprecedented opportunities in front of us and are well positioned to drive our next phase of significant growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter. We are very pleased with our overall second quarter financial results that came in above expectations. On a year-over-year basis, Data Center segment revenue more than doubled, Client segment revenue grew significantly and we expanded the gross margin by 340 basis points.\nFor the second quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segments was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segment. Revenue increased 7% sequentially, primarily driven by growth in the Data Center and Client segments revenue. Gross margin was 53%, up 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher Data Center revenue. Operating expenses were $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year as we continue to invest in R&D to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us and enhanced go-to-market activities. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $138 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69, an increase of 19% year-over-year.\nNow turning to our reportable segments. Starting with Data Center, Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115%, a $1.5 billion increase year-over-year. The Data Center segment accounted for nearly 50% of total revenue, led primarily by the steep ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs and a strong double-digit percentage EPYC server revenue growth. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 21%, driven primarily by strong momentum in AMD Instinct GPUs.\nData Center segment operating income was $743 million or 26% of revenue compared to $147 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up more than 5x from the prior year, driven by higher revenue and operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven primarily by AMD Ryzen processor sales. Client segment operating income was $89 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $69 million a year ago.\nGaming segment revenue was $648 million, down 59% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to semi-custom inventory digestion and the lower end market demand. Gaming segment operating income was $77 million or 12% of revenue compared to $225 million or 14% a year ago.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $861 million, down 41% year-over-year as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels. On a sequential basis, Embedded segment revenue was up 2%. Embedded segment operating income was $345 million or 40% of revenue compared to $757 million or 52% a year ago.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $593 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $439 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $339 million to $5 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of Data Center GPU products. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $5.3 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $352 million to shareholders, repurchasing 2.3 million shares, and we have $5.2 billion of authorization remaining. During the quarter, we retired $750 million of debt that matured this past June, utilizing existing cash.\nNow turning to our third quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow approximately 15%, primarily driven by strong growth in the Data Center and Client segment. We expect Embedded segment revenue to be up and the Gaming segment to decline by double-digit percentage. Year-over-year, we expect revenue to grow approximately 16%, driven by the steep ramp of our AMD Instinct processors, and a strong server and client revenue growth to more than offset the declines in the Gaming and the Embedded segment.\nIn addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.9 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. Also during the third quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Silo AI for approximately $665 million in cash.\nIn closing, we made significant progress during the quarter toward achieving our financial goals. We delivered record MI300 revenue that exceeded $1 billion and demonstrated solid traction with our next-gen Ryzen and EPYC product. We expanded gross margin significantly and drove earnings growth while increasing investment in AI. Looking forward, the opportunity [indiscernible] will remain focused on executing to our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.\n\nMitchell J. Haws\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Skyworks Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jane. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions."

Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nWith that, I will hand the call over to Lisa.\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry as the widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets. Under this backdrop, we are executing very well as we ramp our data center business and enable AI capabilities across our product portfolio.\nLooking at the first quarter, revenue eased to $5.5 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 2 percentage points and increased profitability as Data Center and client segment sales each grew by more than 80% year-over-year. Data Center segment revenue grew 80% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. The substantial year-over-year growth was driven by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct MI 300x GPU shipments and a double-digit percentage increase in server CPU sales. We believe we gained server CPU revenue share in the seasonally down first quarter led by growth in enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments.\nIn cloud, while the overall demand environment remained mixed, hyperscalers continue adopting fourth-gen EPYC processors to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. There are now nearly 900 AMD-powered public instances available globally as Amazon, Microsoft and Google all increased their fourth-gen EPYC processor offerings with new instances and regional deployments.\nIn the Enterprise, we have seen signs of improving demand as CIOs need to add more general purpose in AI compute capacity while maintaining the physical footprint and power needs of their current infrastructure. This scenario aligns perfectly with the value proposition of our EPYC processors. Given our high core count and energy efficiency, we can deliver the same amount of compute with 45% fewer servers compared to the competition, cutting initial CapEx by up to half and lowering annual OpEx by more than 40%. As a result, enterprise adoption of EPYC CPUs is accelerating, highlighted by deployments with large enterprises, including American Airlines, DBS, Emirates Bank, Shell and ST Micro.\nWe're also building momentum with AMD-powered solutions powering the most popular ERP and database applications. As one example of the latest generation of Oracle Exadata, the leading database solution used by 76 of the Fortune 100 is now powered exclusively by fourth-gen EPYC processors. Looking ahead, we're very excited about x-gen family of EPYC processors featuring our Zen 5 core. We're widely sampling turn and the silicon rate. In the cloud, the significant performance and efficiency increases of turn position us well to capture an even larger share of both first and third-party workloads.\nIn addition, there are 30% more turn platforms in development from our server partners compared to fourth-gen EPYC platforms, increasing our enterprise SAM with new solutions optimized for additional workloads. Churn remains on track to launch later this year.\nTurning to our broader data center portfolio. We delivered our second straight quarter of record data center GPU revenue as MI300 became the fastest ramping product in AMD history, passing $1 billion in total sales in less than 2 quarters. In cloud, MI 300x production deployments expanded at Microsoft, Meta and Oracle to power generative AI training and inferencing for both internal workloads and a broad set of public offerings.\nFor the Enterprise, we're working very fly with Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others as multiple MI300x platforms enter volume production this quarter. In addition, we have more than 100 enterprise and AI customers actively developing or deploying MI300X. On the AI software front, we made excellent progress adding upstream support for AMD hardware in the open AI Triton compiler, making it even easier to develop highly AI software for AMD platforms.\nWe also released a major update to our ROM software stack that expand support for open source libraries, including VLLM and frameworks, including JAKs, adds new features like video decode and significantly increases generative AI performance by integrating advanced attention algorithm support for sparsity and FPA.\nOur partners are seeing very strong performance in their AI workloads. As we jointly optimize for their models, MI300X GPUs are delivering leadership inferencing performance and substantial TCO advantages compared to H100. For instance, several of our partners are seeing significant increases in Token beckon when running their flagship LLMs on MI300x compared to each H100.\nWe're also continuing to enable the broad ecosystem required to power the next generation of AI systems including as a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet consortium working to optimize the widely adopted Ethernet protocol to run AI workloads at data center scale. MI300 demand continues to strengthen. And based on our expanding customer engagements, we netback data center GPU revenue to exceed $4 billion in 2024, up from the $3.5 billion we guided in January. Long term, we are increasingly working closer with our cloud and enterprise customers as we expand and accelerate our AI hardware and software road maps and grow our data center GPU footprint.\nTurning to our client segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 85% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our latest generation resin mobile and desktop processors with OEMs and in the channel. Client segment revenue declined 6% essentially. We saw strong demand for our latest generation Ryzen processors in the first quarter. Ryzen desktop CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and Ryzen mobile CPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year as new Ryzen 80-40 notebook designs from Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo and others ramped.\nWe expanded our portfolio of leadership enterprise PC offerings with the launch of our Ryzen Pro 8000 processors earlier this month. Ryzen Pro 80-40 mobile CPUs delivered industry-leading performance in battery life for commercial notebooks. And our Ryzen Pro 8000 series desktop CPUs are the first processor to offer dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators in commercial desktop PCs. We see clear opportunities to gain additional commercial PC share based on the performance and efficiency advantages of our Ryzen Pro portfolio and an expanded set of AMD-powered commercial PCs from our OEM partners.\nLooking forward, we believe the market is on track to return to annual growth in 2024, driven by the start of an enterprise refresh cycle and AI PC adoption. We see AI as the biggest inflection point in PC since the Internet with the ability to deliver unprecedented productivity and usability gains. We're working very closely with Microsoft and a broad ecosystem of partners to enable the next generation of AI experiences powered by Ryzen processors, with more than 150 ISVs on track to be developing for AMD AI PCs by the end of the year.\nWe will also take the next major step in our AI PC road map later this year with the launch of our next-generation Ryzen mobile processors, coding strict. Customer interest in strict is very high based on the significant performance and energy efficiency uplifts we are delivering. Design win momentum for premium notebooks is outpacing generations as strict enables next-generation AI experiences in laptops that are thinner, lighter and faster than ever before. We're excited about the growth opportunities for the PC market. And based on the strength of our Ryzen CPU portfolio, we expect to grow revenue share this year.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 48% year-over-year and 33% sequentially to $922 million. First quarter semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle. In Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year and sequentially. We expanded our Radeon 7000 Series family with the global launch of our Radeon RX 7900 GRE and also introduced our driver-based AMD fluid motion frames technology that can provide large performance increases in thousands of games.\nTurning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $846 million as customers remain focused on normalizing their inventory levels. We launched our Spartan Ultrascale+ FPGA family with high I/O counts, power efficiency and state-of-the-art security features, and we're seeing a strong pipeline of growth for our cost optimized embedded portfolio across multiple markets.\nGiven the current embedded market conditions, we're now expecting second quarter embedded segment revenue to be flat sequentially with a gradual recovery in the second half of the year. Longer term, we see AI at the edge as a large growth opportunity that will drive increased demand for compute across a wide range of devices. To address this demand, we announced our second generation of Versal adaptive SoCs that deliver a 3x increase in AI tops per watt and a 10x greater scaler compute performance compared to our prior generation of industry-leading adaptive SoCs.\nVersal Gen 2 adaptive SoCs are the only solution that combine multiple compute engines to handle AI preprocessing, inferencing and post processing on a single chip, enabling customers to rapidly add highly performant and efficient AI capabilities to a broad range of products. We were pleased to be joined at our launch by Subaru, who announced they adopted Versal AI Edge series Gen 2 devices to power the next generation of their iSIGHT ADAS system.\nEmbedded Design win momentum remains very strong as customers adopt our full portfolio of PGAs, CPUs, GPUs and adaptive SoCs to address a larger portion of their compute needs.\nIn summary, we executed well in the first quarter, setting us up to deliver strong annual revenue growth and expanded gross margin driven by growing adoption of our instinct, EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios.\nOur priorities for 2024 are very clear: accelerate our data center growth by ramping instinct GPU production and gaining share with our EPYC processors. Launch our next-generation Zen 5 PC and server processors that extend our leadership performance and expand our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions.\nLooking further ahead, AI represents an unprecedented opportunity for AMD. While there has been significant growth in AI infrastructure build-outs, we are still in the very early stages of what we believe is going to be a period of sustained growth driven by an insatiable demand for both high-performance AI and purpose compute. We have expanded our investments across the company to capture this large growth opportunity from rapidly expanding our AI software stack to accelerating our AI hardware road maps, increasing our go-to-market entities and partnering closely with the largest AI companies to co-optimize solutions for their most important workloads. We are very excited about the trajectory of the business and the significant growth opportunities ahead.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth in our Data Center and Client segments in the fourth quarter and grew 230 basis points of gross margin expansion. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segment was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segment.\nRevenue declined 11% sequentially as higher data center revenue resulting from the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs was offset by lower gaming and Embedded segment revenues. Gross margin was 52%, up 230 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher revenue contribution from the Data Center and Client segment, partially offset by lower Embedded and Gaming segment revenue contribution.\nOperating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year as we continued investing aggressively in R&D and marketing activities to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us. Operating income was $1.1 billion, representing a 21% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $120 million. For the fourth quarter of 2024, diluted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 3% year-over-year.\nNow turning to our Reportable segment, starting with the data center. Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.3 billion, up 80%, a $1 billion increase year-over-year. Data Center accounted for more than 40% of total revenue, primarily led by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs from both cloud and enterprise customers and a strong double-digit percentage growth in our server process revenue as a result of growth across our sample products.\nOn a sequential basis, revenue increased 2%, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs, partially offset by seasonal decline in server CPU sales. Data center segment operating income was $541 million or 23% of revenue compared to $148 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up 266% year-over-year due to operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D.\nClient segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up 85% year-over-year, driven primarily by Ryzen 8000 series processors. On a sequential basis, Client revenue declined 6%. Client segment operating income was $86 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $172 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $922 million, down 48% year-over-year and down 33% sequentially due to a decrease in semi customer and Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $151 million or 16% of revenue compared to $314 million or 18% a year ago.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $846 million, down 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially as customers continue to manage their inventory levels. Embedded segment, operating income was $342 million or 41% of revenue compared to $798 million or 51% a year ago.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $521 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $379 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $301 million to $4.7 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of data center and client products in advanced process node.\nAt the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment was $6 billion. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing this June. Given our ample liquidity, we plan to retire that utilizing existing cash.\nNow turning to our second quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect data center segment revenue to increase by double-digit percentage, primarily driven by the data center GPU ramp. Client segment revenue to increase. Embedded segment revenue to be flat. And in the Gaming segment, based on current demand signals, revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage.\nYear-over-year, we expect our Data Center and Client segment revenue to be up significantly driven by the strength of our product portfolio. The Embedded and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage. In addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.8 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares.\nIn closing, we started the year strong. We made significant progress on our strategic priorities, delivering year-over-year revenue growth in our data center and the client segment and expanded the gross margin. Looking ahead, we believe the investments we are making will position us very well to address the large AI opportunities ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.\n\nMitchell J. Haws\n\nVice President, Investor Relations, Skyworks Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jean. Paul, we're happy to poll the audience for questions."

With that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa.\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We finished 2023 strong as data center sales accelerated significantly throughout the year despite the mixed demand environment. As a result, we delivered record data center segment annual revenue and strong top line and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp of Instinct AI accelerators and robust demand for EPYC server CPUs across cloud, enterprise and AI customers.\nLooking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, driven by significant double-digit percentage growth in our data center and client segments. On a full year basis, annual revenue declined 4% to $22.7 billion as record data center and embedded segment annual revenue was offset by lower client and gaming segment revenue. Importantly, Data Center and Embedded segment annual revenue grew by $1.2 billion and accounted for more than 50% of revenue in 2023 as we gained server share, launched our next-generation Instinct AI accelerators and maintained our position as the industry's largest provider of adaptive computing solutions.\nTurning to the fourth quarter business results. Data center segment revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. Server CPU and data center GPU sales both set quarterly and annual revenue records as sales of our data center products accelerated throughout the year. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter, driven by significant double-digit percentage growth in fourth Gen EPYC processor revenue and demand for our third-gen EPYC processor portfolio.\nIn cloud, while the overall demand environment remains soft, server CPU revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth gen EPYC processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances. Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft and Oracle brought more than 55 AMD-powered AI HPC and general-purpose cloud instances into preview or general availability in the fourth quarter. Exiting 2023, there were more than 800 EPYC CPU-based public cloud instances available. We expect this number to grow in 2024 based on the leadership performance, efficiency and features of our EPYC CPU portfolio.\nIn Enterprise, sales accelerated by a significant double-digit percentage in the quarter as we built momentum with Forbes 2000 customers. We closed multiple wins with large financial, energy, automotive, retail, technology and pharmaceutical companies, positioning us well for continued growth based on expanded production deployments planned for 2024. A growing number of customers are adopting EPYC CPUs for inferencing workloads where our leadership throughput performance delivers significant advantages on smaller models like LLaMA-7b as well as to power head nodes in large training and inference clusters.\nLooking ahead, customer excitement for our upcoming Turin family of EPYC processors is very strong. Turin is a drop in replacement for existing fourth-gen EPYC platform that extends our performance, efficiency and TCO leadership with the addition of our next-gen Zen 5 core, new memory expansion capabilities and higher core counts. Internal and end customer validation work is progressing to plan, with Turin on track to deliver overall performance leadership as well as leadership on a per core or per watt basis across a wide range of workloads when it launches later this year.\nTurning to our broader data center portfolio. Our data center GPU business accelerated significantly in the quarter, with revenue exceeding our $400 million expectation, driven by a faster ramp for MI300x with AI customers. We launched our MI300 Accelerator family in December with strong partner and ecosystem support from multiple large cloud providers, all the major OEMs and many leading AI developers. MI300X GPUs deliver leadership generative AI performance by combining our high-performance CDNA 3 architecture with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. Customer response to MI300 has been overwhelmingly positive, and we are aggressively ramping production to support the dozens of cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers deploying Instinct accelerators.\nIn cloud, we are working closely with Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and other large cloud customers on Instinct GPU deployments, powering both their internal AI workloads and external offerings. For enterprise customers, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and other server vendors are on track to launch differentiated MI300 platforms later this quarter with strong demand from multiple enterprise customers. In HPC supercomputing, we shipped the majority of AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators for the El Capitan supercomputer in the fourth quarter and expect to complete shipments this quarter for what is expected to be the world's fastest supercomputer when it comes online later this year.\nWe also closed new Instinct GPU wins in the quarter, including the flagship system at the German High-Performance Computing Center, HLRS, as well as what is expected to be one of the world's most powerful enterprise supercomputers for energy company, Eni. On AI software development, we made significant progress expanding the ecosystem of AI developers working on AMD platforms with the release of our ROCm 6 software suite. The ROCm 6 stack significantly increases performance in key generative AI workloads, adds expanded support and optimizations for additional frameworks and libraries and simplifies the overall developer experience.\nThe additional functionality and optimizations of ROCm 6 and the growing volume of contributions from the open source AI software community are enabling multiple large hyperscale and enterprise customers to rapidly bring up their most advanced, large language models on AMD Instinct accelerators. For example, we are very pleased to see how quickly Microsoft was able to bring up GPT 4 on MI300X in their production environment and roll out Azure private previews of new MI300 instances aligned with the MI300X launch.\nAt the same time, our partnership with Hugging Face, the leading open platform for the AI community now enables hundreds of thousands of AI models to run out of the box on AMD GPUs, and we are extending that collaboration to our other platforms. Looking ahead, our prior guidance was for data center GPU revenue to be flattish from Q4 to Q1 and exceed $2 billion for 2024. Based on the strong customer pull and expanded engagements, we now expect data center GPU revenue to grow sequentially in the first quarter and exceed $3.5 billion in 2024. We have also made significant progress with our supply chain partners and have secured additional capacity to support upside demand.\nTurning to our client segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 62% year-over-year and flat sequentially. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 8000 Series notebooks and desktop processors in January, including our Ryzen 8040 Mobile Series that combine leadership compute performance and energy efficiency with an updated MPU that delivers up to 60% more AI performance compared to our prior generation that was already industry-leading. Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, MSI and other large PC OEMs will all offer notebooks powered by our Ryzen 8000 series processors, with the first systems expected to go on sale in February.\nTo further our leadership in AI PCs, we launched our Ryzen 8000G series processors earlier this month which are the industry's first desktop CPUs with an integrated AI engine. Millions of AI PCs powered by Ryzen processors have shipped to date and Ryzen CPUs power more than 90% of AI-enabled PCs currently in market. Our work with Microsoft and our PC ecosystem partners to enable the next generation of AI PCs expanded significantly in the quarter. We are aggressively driving our Ryzen AICP road map to extend our AI leadership, including our next-gen Strix processors that are expected to deliver more than 3x the AI performance of our Ryzen 7040 Series processors. Strix combines our next-gen Zen 5 core with enhanced RDNA graphics and an updated Ryzen AI engine to significantly increase performance, energy efficiency and AI capabilities of PCs.\nCustomer momentum for Strix is strong, with the first notebooks on track to launch later this year. Looking at 2024, we are planning for the PC TAM to grow modestly year-on-year, weighted towards the second half as AI PCs ramp. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for our client business as we ramp our current products, extend our AIPC leadership and launch our next wave of Zen 5 CPUs. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $1.4 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections in the quarter.\nGoing forward, we now expect annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year as supply caught up with demand in 2023, and we entered the fifth year of what has been a very strong console cycle. In Gaming Graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by strong demand in the channel for both our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs. We expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series with the launch of new RX 7600 XT Series [indiscernible] desktop GPUs earlier this month that offer leadership price performance for 1080p gaming. We also launched new open source Fidelity FX Super Resolution 3 software that can deliver significantly higher gaming frame rates on both GPUs and APUs.\nTurning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.1 billion as customers focused on reducing their inventory levels. We expanded our embedded portfolio in the quarter with new leadership solutions for key markets. We launched new Versal Prime adaptive SoCs for the aerospace, test and measurement, health care and communications markets that deliver industry-first support for DDR5 memory and increased [ DSP ] capability compared to our prior generation. In automotive, we launched new Versal SoC solutions that bring industry-leading AI compute capabilities and advanced safety and security features to next-generation vehicles.\nWe also launched Ryzen embedded processors with unmatched performance and features for industrial automation, machine vision, robotics and edge server applications. Looking at 2024, we expect overall embedded demand will remain soft through the first half of the year as customers continue to focus on normalizing their inventory levels. Longer term, we're very confident in the growth trajectory of our embedded business as our expanded product portfolio drove more than $10 billion of design wins in 2023, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2022.\nIn summary, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For 2024, we expect the demand environment to remain mixed, with strong growth in our data center and client segments, offset by declines in our embedded and gaming segments. Against this backdrop, we believe we will deliver strong annual revenue growth and expand gross margin, driven by the strength of our Instinct EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios. Taking a step back, we believe AI is a once-in-a-generation transition that will reshape virtually every portion of the computing market, starting in the data center and then expanding into PCs and across multiple embedded markets.\nWe have built excellent customer traction based on the strength of our multiyear AI hardware and software road maps, and we see clear opportunities to drive our next wave of growth as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our portfolio. In the data center, we see 2024 as a start of a multiyear AI adoption cycle with the market for data center AI accelerators growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027. Customer deployments of our Instinct GPUs continues accelerating, with MI300 now tracking to be the fastest revenue ramp of any product in our history, and positioning us well to capture significant share over the coming years based on the strength of our multi-generation instinct GPU road map and open source ROCm software strategy.\nIn PCs, we are focused on delivering our long-term road maps with leadership Ryzen AI NPU capabilities to enable differentiated experiences as Microsoft and our other software partners bring new AI capabilities to PC starting later this year. At the same time, we are rapidly driving leadership AI compute capabilities across the full breadth of our embedded product portfolio. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry and even more exciting time for AMD as our leadership IP, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships position us well to deliver significant revenue growth and earnings expansion over the next several years.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. AMD executed well in 2023 despite mixed market demand environment, delivering revenue of $22.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.65. We drove year-over-year revenue growth in our embedded and data center segments. In addition, we successfully launched our AMD Instinct MI300 GPUs, positioning us for a strong ramp in 2024 in the AI market. .\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was $6.2 billion, growing 10% year-over-year as revenue growth in the data center and the client segments was partially offset by the lower revenue in our Embedded and Gaming segment. Revenue was up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs across several leading customers and higher revenue from EPYC server processors, partially offset by the decline in Embedded and Gaming segment revenues. Gross margin was 51%, flat year-over-year, with higher revenue contribution from the data center and the client segments offset by lower Embedded segment revenue.\nOperating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year as we invest in R&D and marketing activities to support our significant AI growth opportunities. Operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 23% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $163 million. For the fourth quarter of 2023, diluted earnings per share was $0.77, an increase of 12% year-over-year.\nNow turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $2.3 billion, up 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially driven by strong growth of both AMD Instinct GPU and the fourth generation AMD EPYC CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $666 million or 29% of revenue compared to $444 million or 27% a year ago. Higher operating income was primarily due to operating liability driven by higher revenue. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 62% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen 7000 Series CPU sales. Client segment operating income was $55 million or 4% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $152 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially due to a decrease in semi customer revenue, partially offset by increase in Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $224 million or 16% of revenue compared to $266 million or 16% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $1.1 billion, down 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Embedded segment operating income was $461 million or 44% of revenue compared to $699 million or 50% a year ago.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $381 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $242 million. Inventory decreased sequentially by $94 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares and returned $233 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares and returned [ $985 ] million to shareholders. We have $5.6 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization.\nNow turning to our first quarter of 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.4 billion plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect data center segment revenue to be flat, with the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong data center GPU ramp. Embedded revenue to decline as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Client segment revenue to decline seasonally. And in the gaming segment as we enter the fifth year of what has been a very strong gaming cycle and given current customer inventory levels, we expect revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. Year-over-year, we expect data center and client segment revenues to increase by strong double-digit percentage given the strength of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities.\nEmbedded Segment to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. In addition, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.73 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. While we are not providing specific full year guidance for 2024, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, for the year, we expect the 2024 data center and the client segment revenue to increase driven by the strengths of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities. Embedded Segment revenue to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. We expect to expand gross margin in 2024 and continue to invest to address the large AI opportunities while driving operating model leverage to deliver earnings per share growth faster than top line revenue growth.\nIn closing, we delivered solid financial results in 2023. We further strengthening our product portfolio and establishing ourselves as a leading provider of data center GPUs for AI. We are very well positioned to build on this momentum and deliver strong financial performance in 2024 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.\n\nMitch Haws\n\nVP of IR, Skyworks Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jean. John. We're happy to poll the audience for questions. ."

And our fourth quarter 2023 quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, December 15.\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of today and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering strong top line and bottom line growth, achieving multiple milestones on our AI hardware and software road maps and significantly accelerating our momentum with customers for our AI solutions. In PCs, there are now more than 50 notebook designs powered by Ryzen AI in market, and we are working closely with Microsoft on the next generation of Windows that will take advantage of our on-chip AI Engine to enable the biggest advances in the Windows user experience in more than 20 years.\nIn the Data Center, multiple large hyperscale customers committed to deploy Instinct MI300 accelerators, supported by our latest ROCm software suite and the growing adoption of an open hardware-agnostic software ecosystem. Looking at the third quarter financial results, revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $5.8 billion, driven by record server CPU revenue and strong Ryzen processor sales.\nTurning to the segment results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.6 billion was flat year-over-year and up 21% sequentially as solid demand for both 3rd and 4th Gen EPYC processor families resulted in record quarterly server processor revenue. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter as 4th Gen EPYC CPU revenue grew more than 50% sequentially, crossing over to represent a majority of our server processor revenue and unit shipments.\nIn cloud, while the demand environment remained mixed in the quarter, EPYC CPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially as hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal workloads and public instances while optimizing their infrastructure spend. Nearly 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent and others, including multiple general instances that deliver leadership performance for general purpose, HPC, bare metal and memory optimized workloads.\nIn enterprise, while overall demand remains soft, we are seeing strong indications that the significant performance and TCO advantages of Genoa and our expanded go-to-market investments are paying off as enterprise revenue grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple new wins with leading automotive, aerospace, financial services, pharmaceutical and technology customers, and the number of enterprise customers actively testing EPYC platforms on-prem increased significantly quarter-on-quarter.\nWe also expanded our 4th Gen EPYC processor portfolio with the launch of our Ciena processors that deliver leadership energy efficiency and performance for intelligent edge and telco applications. Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others launched new platforms that expand our EPYC CPU TAM to address telco, retail and manufacturing applications. With the launch of Ciena, we now offer the industry's most performant and most energy-efficient portfolio of server processors across cloud, enterprise, technical, HPC and edge computing.\nI am very pleased with the momentum we have built for our EPYC CPU portfolio. We are building on this momentum with our next-gen Turin server processors based on our new Zen 5 core that delivers significant performance and efficiency gains. Turin is in the labs of our top customers and partners now, and customer feedback has been very strong and we're on track to launch in 2024. Looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, we made significant progress in our Data Center GPU business in the third quarter as the multiyear investments we have made in our hardware and software road maps resulted in significant customer traction for our next-generation Instinct MI300 accelerators and particularly our Instinct MI300X GPU that delivers leadership inferencing and training performance.\nOn the hardware side, bring-up and validation of our MI300A and MI300X accelerators continue progressing to plan with performance now meeting or exceeding our expectations. Production shipments of Instinct MI300A APUs started earlier this month to support the El Capitan Exascale Supercomputer, and we are on track to begin production shipments of Instinct MI300x GPU accelerators to lead cloud and OEM customers in the coming weeks.\nOn the software side, we further expanded our AI software ecosystem and made great progress enhancing the performance and features of our ROCm software in the quarter. In addition to ROCm being fully integrated into the mainline PyTorch and TensorFlow ecosystems, Hugging Face models are now regularly updated and validated to run on Instinct accelerators and other supported AMD AI hardware. AI start-up, Lemon.ai announced they achieved software parity with CUDA for LLMs running on Instinct MI250 GPUs, enabling enterprise customers to easily deploy production-ready LLMs fine-tuned for their specific data on Instinct MI250 GPUs with minimal code changes.\nWe also strengthened our AI software capabilities with the strategic acquisitions of Mipsology and Nod.ai. Mipsology is a long-standing partner with proven expertise delivering AI software and solutions running on top of our adaptive SoCs for data center, edge and embedded markets. Nod.ai adds a highly experienced team with a track record of substantial contributions to open-source AI compilers and industry-leading software already used by many of the largest cloud enterprise and AI companies. Nod's compiler-based automation software can significantly accelerate the deployment of highly performant AI models optimized for our Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Versal and Radian processors.\nBased on the rapid progress we are making with our AI road map execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter and exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue ramps throughout the year. This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at our December AI event.\nTurning to our Client segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year and 46% sequentially to $1.5 billion. Sales of our Ryzen 7000 processors featuring our industry-leading Ryzen AI on-chip accelerator, grew significantly in the quarter as inventory levels in the PC market normalized and demand began returning to seasonal patterns. Revenue for our latest-generation client CPUs powered by our Zen 4 core more than doubled sequentially as we saw strong demand for our Ryzen 7000 Series notebook and desktop processors that deliver both leadership energy efficiency and performance across a wide range of workloads.\nIn commercial, we launched our first Threadripper Pro workstation CPUs based on our Zen 4 Core that deliver unmatched performance for multi-threaded professional design, rendering and simulation applications. Dell, HPE and Lenovo announced an expanded set of workstations powered by new Threadripper Pro processors as we focus on growing this margin-accretive portion of our client business. Looking forward, we are executing on a multiyear Ryzen AI road map to deliver leadership compute capabilities built on top of Microsoft's Windows software ecosystem to enable the new generation of AI PCs that will fundamentally redefine the computing experience over the coming years.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $1.5 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Although semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections for this point in the console cycle, overall revenue for this console generation continues tracking significantly higher than the prior generation based on strong demand for Microsoft and Sony consoles.\nIn Gaming Graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by increased demand in the channel. We expanded our Radeon 7000 series with the launch of new RX 7000 Series enthusiast desktop GPUs that offer leadership price performance for 1440p gamers.\nTurning to our Embedded segment. As we expected, revenue decreased 5% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 15% as lead times normalized and customers focused on reducing inventory levels. We expanded our leadership Versal SoC portfolio in the quarter with the launches of our first adaptive SoCs with on-chip HBM memory that deliver significant performance and efficiency for memory-bound data center, network, test and aerospace applications. We also announced our next-generation space-grade Versal SoC that integrates an enhanced AI Engine and is the industry's only solution that supports unlimited reprogramming during development and after deployment.\nFor the fintech market, we launched our latest Alveo Accelerator card that delivers a 7x improvement in latency compared to our prior generation and has already been deployed by multiple trading firms in their ultra-low latency training platforms. Since closing our acquisition of Xilinx a little over 1.5 years ago, our Embedded business has grown significantly, driven by our leadership products. Looking ahead, based on our current visibility, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline sequentially as customers continue working through elevated inventory levels through the first half of 2024. Over the medium term, we see strong growth opportunities for our Embedded business based on our significant design win traction and our broad and differentiated portfolio of embedded FPGAs, CPUs, GPUs and adaptive SoCs that can address a larger portion of our customers' compute needs.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our third quarter financial results, driven by the significant acceleration of Zen 4 server and client processor sales. Looking at the next couple of quarters, we expect strong growth in our Data Center business, driven by both EPYC and Instinct processors. This growth will be partially offset by softening demand in our Embedded business and lower semi-custom revenue, given where we are in the console cycle. As the PC market returns to seasonal patterns, we believe we are well positioned to gain profitable share in the premium and commercial portions of the market based on the strength of our product offerings.\nWe are focused on accelerating our leadership AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, executing on our hardware and software road maps and expanding our enterprise computing footprint. I look forward to sharing more details on our AI progress in a few weeks at our together we advance_ AI event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our third quarter results and our outlook for Q4. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We delivered better-than-expected third quarter results with revenue of $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.70. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% as growth in the Client segment revenue was partially offset by lower Gaming and Embedded segment revenue.\nRevenue was up 8% sequentially, driven by growth in both the Client and the Data Center segment. Gross margin was 51%, up approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year primarily driven by stronger Client segment revenue and product mix. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher R&D investment to support our significant AI growth opportunity. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $141 million. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.70 compared to $0.67 in the same period last year.\nNow turning to our reportable segment. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in the EPYC processor sales was offset by a decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Data Center revenue grew 21% sequentially, primarily driven by strong sales of our 4th Gen EPYC processors to both cloud and enterprise customers. Data Center segment operating income was $306 million or 19% of revenue compared to $505 million or 31% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to increased R&D investment to support future AI revenue growth and product mix.\nClient segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen mobile processors. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 46% as PC market conditions continued to improve, and we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series to meet strong demand. Client segment operating income was $140 million or 10% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue and a disciplined OpEx management. We are pleased that the Client segment returned to profitability in the third quarter.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by increase in Radeon GPU sales. On a sequential basis, Gaming segment revenue declined 5%, in line with our expectations as we are now in the fourth year of the console cycle. Gaming segment operating income was $208 million or 14% of revenue compared to $142 million or 9% a year ago, primarily driven by higher Radeon GPU revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower sales to the communication market. On a sequential basis, embedded segment revenue declined 15%, primarily due to inventory correction at customers in several end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $612 million or 49% of revenue compared to $635 million or 49% a year ago.\nTurning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $421 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $297 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes, primarily due to previously deferred taxes from California disaster relief efforts made available by the IRS. Inventory decreased sequentially by $122 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. We returned $511 million to shareholders, repurchasing 4.8 million shares and we have $5.8 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the Data Center and the Client segments to be up by strong double-digit percentage, the Gaming segment to decline, given where we are in the console cycle, and the Embedded segment to decline due to additional softening of demand in the embedded market. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment to grow by strong double-digit percentage, Client segment revenue to increase and the Gaming and Embedded segment to decline by double-digit percentage.\nWe expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.74 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our execution in the third quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue, gross margin and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, we expect to benefit from strong Data Center and Client momentum, driven by MI300 AI accelerated ramp and the strength of our high-performant leadership Zen 4 family of products despite lower sales in the Gaming segment and additional softening of demand in the embedded market.\nLooking ahead, the investment we are making in AI across our Data Center, Client, Gaming and the Embedded segment enable us to offer one of the best industry's broadest portfolio, targeting the most compelling opportunities and positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.\n\nMitch Haws\n\nVP of IR, Skyworks Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jean. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions."

Lisa?\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the second quarter, launching multiple leadership products, significantly expanding our AI engagements and ramping our latest EPYC and Ryzen product families. .\nSecond quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. Sales were flat sequentially as client and data center segment growth was offset by expected declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments. AI customer engagements grew by more than 7x sequentially as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future of instinct MI250 and MI300 hardware and software at scale.\nLooking at the second quarter business results. Data center segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 11% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Although market demand remains mixed, the fourth gen EPYC CPU adoption accelerated in the quarter with revenue nearly doubling sequentially as cloud providers expanded deployments to power their internal infrastructure and public instance offerings. In cloud, 30 new AMD instances launched in the second quarter with multiple Genoa instances announced by AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft and Oracle.\nGenoa delivers up to 1.9x more performance in enterprise and cloud applications and 1.8x more performance per watt than the competition making it by far the industry's highest performance and most efficient server processor. As an example, AWS announced its M7a Genoa instance, which is the highest performance and best price performance down purpose x86 instance they offer.\nIn total, there are now more than 670 AMD-powered cloud instances publicly available, and we expect that number to grow 30% to nearly 900 by the end of the year, driven largely by new Genoa deployments. We also expanded our Zen 4 server product portfolio in the quarter with the launches of Bergamo and Genoa X.\nMicrosoft Azure announced the first general Genoa X HPC instances that offer more than 5x higher performance in technical computing workloads compared to their prior generation. With Bergamo, we delivered more than double the performance than competitive offerings for cloud native applications while offering full x86 software compatibility.\nWe were excited to be joined at our launch event by Meta, where they announced plans to deploy Bergamo broadly across their global data center infrastructure to power applications, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Looking ahead, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Super Micro and other large server providers are on track to begin launching their new Bergamo platforms in the third quarter.\nIn enterprise, while macroeconomic uncertainty resulted in weaker demand year-over-year, Sales of EPYC processors for enterprise servers grew sequentially as we closed multiple wins with large energy, technology, financial services and health care companies.\nOverall, pull from large enterprises continue to grow. For example, Banco do Brasil, BNP Paribas, Petronas, Uber and other large enterprises all adopted EPYC processors in the quarter, and SAP selected EPYC processors to power rises with SAP applications hosted on Google Cloud.\nWe expect EPYC revenue to grow by a double-digit percentage sequentially in the third quarter, led by the expanding 4th Zen EPYC. In addition, Ciena, our first EPYC processor optimized for leadership, edge server and telco infrastructure is on track to launch this quarter.\nTurning to our broader data center business. In networking, the largest cloud providers expanded their adoption of Pensando DPUs in the quarter, highlighted by new deployments with Alibaba and Oracle Cloud. In supercomputing, EPYC and instinct processors continue to be the solutions of choice for the most powerful supercomputers in the world, powering 121 of the fastest systems on the latest top 500 list and 7 of the 10 most efficient systems on the Green 500 list.\nIn AI, we made strong progress in the second quarter as we met key hardware and software milestones to address the growing customer pull for our data center AI solutions. Our AI strategy is focused on 3 areas: First, deliver a broad portfolio and multigeneration road map of leadership GPUs, CPUs and adaptive computing solutions for AI inferencing and training; second, extend the open and proven software platform we have established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and easily; and third, expand the deep and collaborative partnerships we have established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale.\nWe delivered on all 3 fronts in the second quarter. On the software and partnership side, Hugging Face announced plans to optimize thousands of their models for AMD Instinct Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon Versal and LBO platforms. To make it easier for developers to tap into the full performance and features of our AI hardware, we delivered a significant performance and feature update in our latest ROCm software and expanded support for AMD silicon across the leading frameworks, including Pietorch, TensorFlow, Onex and technologies like open AI Triton.\nWe are receiving positive feedback on the improvements and the new capabilities of our latest ROCm software stack from our AI customers and ecosystem partners. As an example, leading AI software company, Mosaic ML recently highlighted that our instinct MI250 accelerator delivers competitive trading performance with minimal or no changes to the underlying AI software.\nOn the hardware side, we announced our new instinct MI300X GPUs designed to be the world's most advanced accelerators for generative AI. MI300x combines our next-gen CDNA 3 architecture with the industry's largest memory footprint and fastest memory bandwidth. These are critical factors in AI inferencing performance.\nCustomer interest in our instinct MI300A and MI300X GPUs is very high. Engagements with top-tier cloud providers, large enterprises and numerous leading AI companies significantly expanded in the quarter. We are providing early system access and sampling both products with our lead AI, HPC and cloud customers now and remain on track to launch and ramp production in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to our client segment. Revenue declined 54% year-over-year to $1 billion. Client segment revenue increased 35% sequentially as Ryzen 7000 Series CPU sales grew significantly, led by the launches of new notebooks from the largest OEMs. We also launched new commercial offerings with our first Ryzen Pro notebook and desktop processors powered by our leadership Zen 4 architecture. More than 100 AMD-powered commercial PC platforms are on track to launch this year from HP, Lenovo and other leading OEMs as we grow this important part of our client business.\nWe expect our client segment will grow in the seasonally stronger second half of the year based on the strength of our product portfolio and increased adoption of our Ryzen 7000 CPUs, including the ramp of our Ryzen 7040 mobile CPUs that deliver leadership performance and energy efficiency and are the industry's first x86 processors with a dedicated AI engine.\nGoing forward, we see AI as a significant PC demand driver as Microsoft and other large software providers incorporate generative AI into their offerings. We are executing a multigenerational Ryzen AI processor road map, which, together with our ecosystem partners will fundamentally change the PC experience.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was more than offset by lower gaming graphics sales. Sequentially, segment revenue declined 10%. The Semi-custom SoC sales were strong in the quarter as Microsoft and Sony had healthy console demand based on improved retail availability globally and the launches of new AAA games.\nIn gaming graphics, we expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series in the second quarter with the launch of our mainstream Rx 7600 cards for 1080p gaming. We are on track to further expand our RDNA 3 GPU offerings with the launch of new enthusiast class 7000 Series cards in the third quarter. Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 7% as solid demand with industrial vision and health care, automotive and broadcast customers was offset by softness with communications customers as some operators slowed their infrastructure upgrades.\nWe expanded our leadership adaptive computing product portfolio in the quarter, launching our new Versal premium VP1902, and adaptive SoC with advanced chiplet packaging, the industry's largest and most performing solution for emulating and verifying next-generation ASICs and SoCs.\nIn the low end, we announced our Spartan Ultrascale+ FPGA family to address a new range of cost optimized industrial, computer vision, health care and robotics applications. We also released enhanced versions of our Vivado and Vitis software platforms that make it easier for customers to develop highly performing applications for our Versal adaptive SoCs.\nEmbedded CPU sales grew in the quarter with the launches of new AMD-powered security, storage and networking solutions from HPE, Fortinet and other leading vendors. Looking into the second half of the year, after delivering 6 quarters of very strong year-over-year growth, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline in the back half of the year as lead times normalize and some customers reduce their inventory levels.\nWe continue to be very pleased with our embedded design win momentum and in particular, the growing revenue synergy opportunities we see based on our combined adaptive and embedded processing product portfolio. In summary, we executed well in the quarter against our strategic priorities.\nLooking at the second half of the year, we expect the PC market to grow seasonally with more normalized inventory levels across the supply chain. In the data center market, we see a mixed environment as AI deployments are expanding. However, cloud customers continue optimizing their data center compute and enterprise customers remain cautious with new deployments.\nAgainst this backdrop, we expect strong growth driven by higher fourth Zen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processor sales and initial shipments of our instinct MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter. Longer term, while we are still in the very early days of the new era of AI, it is clear that AI represents a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity for AMD across cloud, edge and an increasingly diverse number of intelligent endpoints.\nIn the data center alone, we expect the market for AI accelerators to reach over $150 billion by 2027. We have increased our AI-related R&D, ecosystem enablement and go-to-market investments to capture a significant share of this emerging market. The strong progress we are making executing our AI road maps and the rapid pace at which we are expanding our ecosystem of AI hardware and software partners makes us very confident we can deliver leadership training and inference solutions powered by our instinct EPYC, Ryzen AI, Versal and platforms for our customers and partners.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our second quarter results and our outlook for Q3. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We are pleased with our second quarter results with revenue of $5.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.58. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 18% as growth in the Embedded segment revenue was more than offset primarily by lower client segment revenue. .\nRevenue was flat compared to the first quarter as growth in both the client and the data center segments was offset by expected declines in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Gross margin was 50% down approximately 4 percentage points from a year ago, primarily driven by lower client segment performance, partially offset by strong segment performance.\nOperating expenses were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher R&D investments. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $940 million year-over-year, and the operating margin was 20%. Interest expense, taxes and other was $120 million. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.58 compared to $1.05 in the same period last year.\nEPS declined on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to client segment performance. Now turning to our reportable segments for the second quarter. Starting with the data center segment. Revenue was $1.3 billion, down 11% year-over-year mainly due to lower third-generation EPYC processor sales as enterprise demand was softer and the inventory levels were elevated at certain MDC customers.\nData center revenue grew sequentially with strong sales of our fourth-generation EPYC processors, specifically Genoa, partially offset by decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Data Center segment operating income was $147 million or 11% of revenue compared to $472 million or 32% a year ago.\nLower operating income was primarily due to lower revenue and increased R&D investment to support future growth. Client segment revenue was $998 million, down 54% year-over-year due to reduced process shipment resulting from a weaker PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain.\nOn a sequential basis, revenue grew 35% as we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series processors and the PC market conditions improved. Client segment operating loss was $69 million compared to operating income of $676 million a year ago primarily due to lower revenue. We expect the client segment to return to profitability in the third quarter. Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Semi customer revenue grew year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue.\nOn a sequential basis, gaming revenue declined 10%, in line with our expectations. Gaming segment operating income was $225 million or 14% of revenue compared to $187 million or 11% a year ago, primarily due to higher semi customer revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in the industrial vision, health care, automotive, test and emulation market.\nOn a sequential basis, Embedded revenue declined 7%, primarily due to weaker communication market demand. Embedded segment operating income was $757 million or 52% of revenue compared to $641 million or 51% a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow.\nDuring the quarter, we generated $379 million in cash from operations. Free cash flow was $254 million. Inventory increased by $332 million to support the continued ramp of advanced technology products. We expect inventory to decline as we ship this product to customers in the second half of the year. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment was strong at $6.3 billion.\nNow turning to our third quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 2.5% year-over-year and approximately 6.5% sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the client segment to be up. Data center segment to be flattish and the Gaming and Embedded segments to decline. Sequentially, we expect the client and the data center segment to each grow by a double-digit percentage and the Gaming and Embedded segments to decline.\nNon-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.65 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our second quarter top line and bottom line execution. We expect our new product ramps across the data center and client segment to drive sequential growth into the third quarter. Importantly, our leadership product portfolio, data center and AI investment priorities and the financial strength position us well for long-term growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for Q&A session.\n\nMitch Haws\n\nVP of IR, Skyworks Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jean. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ruth Cotter. Please go ahead, Ruth.\n\nRuth Cotter\n\nSenior Vice President of Marketing, Human Resources & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome to AMD's First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and accompanying slideware. If you've not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of amd.com. .\nWe will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press release and slides posted on our website.\nParticipants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jean Hu, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.\nBefore we begin today's call, we would like to note that Jean Hu will attend the JPM Annual Technology, Media and Communications Conference on Tuesday, May 23; Dan McNamara, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Server Business Unit, will attend the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on Tuesday, June 6. And our second quarter 2023 quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, June 16.\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of today and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nNow with that, I'll hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\n\nLisa T. Su\n\nDirector, President & Chief Executive Officer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings in a mixed demand environment, launched multiple leadership products across our businesses and made significant progress accelerating our AI road map and customer engagements across our portfolio.\nFirst quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Sales of our data center and embedded products contributed more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter as cloud and embedded revenue grew significantly year-over-year.\nLooking at the first quarter business results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.3 billion was flat year-over-year with higher cloud sales, offset by lower enterprise sales. In cloud, the quarter played out largely as we expected. EPYC CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year but declined sequentially as elevated inventory levels with some MDC customers resulted in a lower sell-in TAM for the quarter.\nAgainst this backdrop, we were pleased the largest cloud providers further expanded their AMD deployments in the quarter to power a larger portion of their internal workloads and public instances. 28 new AMD instances launched in the first quarter, including multiple confidential computing offerings from Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud that take advantage of the unique security features of our EPYC processors. In total, we now have more than 640 AMD-powered public instances available.\nEnterprise sales declined year-over-year and sequentially as end customer demand softened due to near-term macroeconomic uncertainty. We continued growing our enterprise pipeline and closed multiple wins with Fortune 500 automotive, technology and financial companies in the quarter. We made strong progress in the quarter, ramping our Zen 4 EPYC CPU portfolio. All of our large cloud customers have generally running in their data centers and are on track to begin broad deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances in the second quarter.\nFor the enterprise, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and other leading providers entered production on new general server platforms that complement their existing third-gen EPYC platforms. We are on track to launch Bergamo, our first cloud-native server CPU and Gena X, our fourth Gen EPYC processor with 3D chiplets for leadership in technical computing workloads later this quarter. Although we expect server demand to remain mixed in the second quarter, we are well positioned to grow our cloud and enterprise footprint in the second half of the year based on the strong customer response to the performance and TCO advantages of Genoa, Bergamo and GenX.\nNow looking at our broader data center business. In networking, Microsoft Azure launched their first instance powered by our Pensando DPU and software stack that can significantly increase application performance for networking intensive workloads by enabling 10x more connections per second compared to non-accelerated instances.\nWe expanded our data center product portfolio with the launch of our first ASIC-based Alveo data center media accelerator that supports 4x the number of simultaneous video streams compared to our prior generation. In supercomputing, the MAX Plug Society announced plans to build the first supercomputer in the EU, powered by fourth-gen EPYC CPUs and instinct MI-300 accelerators that is expected to deliver a 3x increase in application performance and significant TCO improvements compared to their current system.\nOur AI activities increased significantly in the first quarter, driven by expanded engagements with a broad set of data center and embedded customers. We expanded the software ecosystem support for our instinct GPUs in the first quarter, highlighted by the launch of the widely used Pie Torch 2.0 framework, which now offers native support for our software. In early April, researchers announced they used the LUMI supercomputer powered by third-gen EPYC CPUs and instinct MI250 accelerators to train the largest finished language model to date.\nCustomer interest has increased significantly for our next-generation instinct MI300 GPUs for both AI training and inference of large language models. We made excellent progress achieving key MI300 silicon and software readiness milestones in the quarter, and we're on track to launch MI300 later this year to support the El Capitan exascale supercomputer win at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and large cloud AI customers.\nTo execute our broad AI strategy and significantly accelerate this key part of our business, we brought together multiple AI teams from across the company into a single organization under Victor Peng. The new AI group has responsibility for owning our end-to-end AI hardware strategy and driving development of a complete software ecosystem, including optimized libraries, models and framework expanding our full product portfolio.\nNow turning to our client segment. Revenue declined 65% year-over-year to $739 million as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. As we stated on our last earnings call, we believe the first quarter was the bottom for our client processor business. We expanded our leadership desktop and notebook processor portfolio significantly in the quarter. In desktops, we launched the industry's fastest gaming processors with our Ryzen 7000 X3D series CPUs that combine our Zen 4 core with industry-leading 3D chiplet packaging technology.\nIn mobile, the first notebooks powered by our Dragon range CPUs launched a strong demand, with multiple third-party reviews highlighting how our 16 core Ryzen 9 7945HS CPU is now the fastest mobile processor available. We also ramped production of our Zen 4-based Phoenix Ryzen 7040 series CPUs in the first quarter for ultrathin and gaming notebooks to support the more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins on track to launch this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo.\nLooking at the year, we continue to expect the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023 to approximately 260 million units. Based on the strength of our product portfolio, we expect our client CPU sales to grow in the second quarter and in the seasonally stronger second half of the year.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $1.8 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was offset by lower gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for premium consoles remain strong following the holiday cycle.\nIn gaming graphics, channel sell-through of our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs increased sequentially. We saw strong sales of our high-end Radeon 7900 XTX GPUs in the first quarter, and we're on track to expand our RDNA 3 GPU portfolio with the launch of new mainstream Radeon 7000 series GPUs this quarter.\nLooking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.6 billion. We saw strength across the majority of our embedded markets, led by increased demand from industrial, vision and health care, test and emulation, communications, aerospace and defense and automotive customers. Demand for our adaptive computing solutions continues to grow as industrial vision and health care customers actively work to add more advanced compute capabilities across their product lines.\nWe also released new Vitis AI software libraries to enable advanced visualization and AI capabilities for our medical customers and launched our next-generation platform that provides a turnkey solution to deploy our leadership adaptive computing capabilities for smart camera, industrial and machine vision applications.\nIn Communications, we saw strength with wired customers as new infrastructure design wins ramped into production. We also launched Zinc RF SoC products to accelerate 4G and 5G radio deployments in cost-sensitive markets and formed our first telco solutions lab to validate end-to-end solutions based on AMD CPU, adaptive SoCs, FPGAs, DPUs and software.\nIn automotive, deployments of our adaptive silicon solutions for high-end ADAS and AI features grew in the quarter, highlighted by Subaru rolling out its AMD-based iSIGHT 4 platform across their full range of vehicles. In addition, we expanded our embedded processor portfolio with the launches of Ryzen 5000 and EPYC 9000 embedded series processors with leadership performance and efficiency as we focus on growing share in the security, storage edge server and networking markets.\nLooking more broadly across our embedded business, we are making great progress in bringing together our expanded portfolio and scale to drive deeper engagements with our largest embedded customers.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our operational and financial performance in the first quarter. In the near term, we continue to see a mixed demand environment based on the uncertainties in the macro environment. Based on customer demand signals, we expect second quarter revenue will be flattish sequentially with growth in our client and data center segments, offset by modest declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments.\nWe remain confident in our ability to grow in the second half of the year, driven by adoption of our Zen 4 product portfolio, improving demand trends in our client business and the early ramp of our instinct MI300 accelerators for HPC and AI.\nLooking longer term, we have significant growth opportunities ahead based on successfully delivering our road maps and executing our strategic data center and embedded property priorities, led by accelerating adoption of our AI products. We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history.\nAnd as the recent interest in generative AI highlights, bringing the benefits of large language models and other AI capabilities to cloud, edge and endpoints require significant increases in compute performance. AMD is very well positioned to capitalize on this increased demand to compute based on our broad portfolio of high-performance and adaptive compute engines, the deep relationships we have established with customers across a diverse set of large markets, and our expanding software capabilities.\nWe are very excited about our opportunity in AI. This is our #1 strategic priority, and we are engaging deeply across our customer set to bring joint solutions to the market, led by our upcoming instinct MI300 GPUs, Ryzen 7040 Series CPUs with Ryzen AI, Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, LVO V70 data center inference accelerators and Versal AI adaptive data center and edge SoCs. I look forward to sharing more about our AI progress over the coming quarters as we broaden our portfolio and grow the strategic part of our business.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nCFO, Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, first quarter 2022 results included the only partial quarter financial results from the acquisition of Xilinx, which closed in February 2022.\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year as Embedded segment strength was offset by lower Client segment revenue. Gross margin was 50%, down 2.7 percentage points from a year ago, primarily impacted by Client segment performance.\nOperating expenses were $1.6 billion, increasing 18% year-over-year, primarily due to inclusion of a full quarter of expenses from Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $739 million year-over-year, and the operating margin was 21%. Interest expense, taxes and other was $128 million. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.60 due to better-than-expected revenue and operating expenses.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the first quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, flat year-over-year, driven primarily by higher sales of EPYC processors to cloud customers, offset by lower enterprise server processor sales.\nData Center segment operating income was $148 million or 11% of revenue compared to $427 million or 33% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to product mix and increased R&D investments to address large opportunities ahead of us.\nClient segment revenue was $739 million, down 65% year-over-year as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. We expect an improvement in second quarter Client segment revenue and a seasonally stronger second half. Client segment operating loss was $172 million compared to operating income of $692 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Semi customer revenue grew double-digit percentage year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming segment operating income was $314 million or 18% of revenue compared to $358 million or 19% a year ago. Decrease was primarily due to lower gaming graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up $967 million year-over-year, primarily due to full quarter of Xilinx revenue and the strong performance across multiple end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $798 million or 51% of revenue compared to $277 million or 46% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Xilinx.\nTurning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $486 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong financial model despite the mixed demand environment. Free cash flow was $328 million. In the first quarter, we increased inventory by $464 million, primarily in anticipation of the ramp of new Data Center and Client product in advanced process node. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and such short-term investment were $5.9 billion, and we returned $241 million to shareholders through share repurchases. We have a $6.3 billion in remaining authorization for share repurchases. In summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the AMD team executed very well, delivering better-than-expected top line revenue and earnings.\nNow turning to our second quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 19% year-over-year and approximately flat sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect the Client, Gaming and the Data Center segment to decline, partially offset by Embedded segment growth. Sequentially, we expect Client and Data Center segment growth to be offset by modest Gaming and Embedded segment decline.\nIn addition, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion. Effective tax rate to be 13%. And the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our strong top line and bottom line execution. We have a very strong financial model, and we'll continue to invest in our long-term strategic priorities, including accelerating our AI offerings to drive sustainable value creation over the long term.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for Q&A session.\n\nRuth Cotter\n\nSenior Vice President of Marketing, Human Resources & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jean. And Kevin, we're happy to pull the audience for questions."

Lisa?\n\nLisa Su\n\nPresident, CEO & Chair of the Board, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Before discussing our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments about our CFO transition. I'd like to start by thanking Devinder for all of his contributions to AMD over the last 39 years. During his tenure as CFO, we built a strong financial foundation that has enabled AMD's significant growth and success. On a personal note, his partnership and expertise have been invaluable to me. I know I speak for all of AMD when I say we appreciate all he has done for the company and wish him the best in his upcoming retirement.\nI also want to welcome our new EVP and CFO, Jean Hu, to our first AMD earnings call since joining us earlier this month. Jean's more than 14 years of public company CFO experience and proven track record of financial leadership make her an excellent addition to our team. I look forward to working closely with her as we continue to transform and scale our business.\nNow turning to the business results. 2022 was a strong year for AMD as we navigated the challenging macro environment to deliver best-in-class growth and record profitability driven by our Embedded and Data Center segments. We also transformed the company. We accelerated our Data Center business and closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and Pensando, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financial model as our Data Center, Embedded product sales grew from $3.9 billion in 2021 to $10.6 billion in 2022.\nLooking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded and Data Center segments, which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue 44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment revenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition.\nTurning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led by increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now power more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others in the quarter.\nIn Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expanding our pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and aerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest top 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTo build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in cloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. We are seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and capabilities.\nInitial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023.\nFor Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and others, an increase of 40% compared to the prior generation.\nNow looking at our broader Data Center portfolio. We had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by strong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand. We are very pleased with the customer reception of the Pensando technology with good long-term growth opportunities as DPUs become a standard component in the next generation of cloud and enterprise data centers.\nData center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had shipments supporting the build-out of multiple Instinct MI250 accelerator supercomputer wins. In January, we previewed our next-generation MI300 accelerator that will be used for large model AI applications in cloud data centers and has been selected to power the 2-plus exaflop El Capitan exascale supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. MI300 will be the industry's first data center chip that combines a CPU, GPU and memory into a single integrated design, delivering 8x more performance and 5x better efficiency for HPC and AI workloads, compared to our MI250 accelerator currently powering the world's fastest super computer. MI300 is on track to begin sampling to lead customers later this quarter and launch in the second half of 2023.\nTurning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth quarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased sequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our Ryzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated on-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of AMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition.\nWe also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a chiplet design that delivers significantly higher performance than the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks planned to go on sale in February.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher semi-custom revenue. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming graphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon RX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new RDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design.\nIn January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell, Alienware, ASUS and others that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023.\nLooking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number of our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In communications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with Tier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple customers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale+ platforms with some of the largest vehicle equipment suppliers including Aisin next-generation Automated Parking Assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can improve the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x.\nWe also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter, driven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes.\nTaking a step back, as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely well, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our business. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and 6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale.\nIn summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming businesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with the second half stronger than the first half. In the PC market, we are planning for the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect to continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance.\nIn our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of our competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and more differentiated set of products to drive future growth.\nOver the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry service and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our broad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can address the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?\n\nJean X. Hu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had a record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we generated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying our business portfolio.\nFourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx OpEx and additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of our revenue growth.\nOperating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income was $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client operating income.\nNow turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors. Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $369 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth.\nClient segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million a year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-customer product sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment of $5.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization to share repurchases. Free cash flow was $443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year.\nFree cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products.\nNow let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data Center and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022 pro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segment, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue.\nOperating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56% from a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion. Net income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior year, primarily due to Data Center growth and addition of Xilinx.\nFull year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term supply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share.\nLet me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and Gaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected to decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers.\nIn addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the macro environment. However, let me provide some color.\nDirectionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected share gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improves. For modeling purpose, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares.\nIn closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our business. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. We believe our leadership of products, growing customer momentum and strong financial foundation position us well for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for a Q&A.\nsession.\n\nRuth Cotter\n\nSVP of Marketing, HR & IR, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jean. Operator, if you could poll the audience for questions now, please."

And our fourth quarter quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, December 16.\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of today, and as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nNow with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?\n\nLisa Su\n\nPresident, CEO & Chair of the Board, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ruth. And good afternoon to all those listening in today.\nOur third quarter revenue and gross margin came in below our expectations due to softening PC demand and substantial inventory reduction actions across the PC supply chain. Despite the macro backdrop, overall revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $5.6 billion as our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments each delivered significant year-over-year growth and performed in line with our expectations. We also expanded gross margin and grew net income year-over-year, highlighting the strength of our business.\nTurning to the business results. Starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 45% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $1.6 billion. We delivered our 10th straight quarter of record server processor sales, driven by strong demand for third-gen EPYC processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Genoa CPU to select customers. Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased sequentially as multiple hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal properties and more than 70 new AMD instances were launched by Microsoft Azure and Amazon, Tencent, Baidu and others in the quarter.\nIn enterprise, OEM revenue was down sequentially as server OEMs continued working through match set issues, and some business load the pace or scale of their purchases based on the macro uncertainties.\nLooking at the broader competitive landscape, our third-gen EPYC CPUs in market today are the highest performance and most energy-efficient x86 server CPUs available. And we expect to further extend that lead with our next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa processors, which deliver significant performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages for both hyperscale and enterprise workloads.\nWe will publicly launch Genoa next week and are ramping production to support initial cloud deployments and the introduction of fourth-gen EPYC processor platforms by HP Enterprise, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others.\nLooking at our broader data center portfolio. As expected, Data Center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had substantial shipments supporting the build-out of the Frontier exascale supercomputer. We made good progress with our Data Center GPU software enablement work in the quarter, including announcing our role as a founding member of the PyTorch Foundation. We look forward to working closely with the largest cloud providers as we drive a standards-based approach to the development of popular PyTorch deep learning software framework.\nDemand from data center customers for our adaptive SmartNIC and DPU products was strong during the quarter. We had record sales of our Xilinx FPGA and networking data center products led by demand from cloud and financial customers.\nSales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter driven by cloud adoption. The addition of Pensando DPUs to our product portfolio has been very well received by customers, highlighted by our enterprise customer pipeline doubling in the few months since the acquisition closed.\nWe were excited to support VMware's launch of its next-generation cloud virtualization platform in the quarter. Our Pensando DPUs will be included in the first validated server and HCI solutions, supporting the new VMware virtualization offerings from Dell, HPE and others that will make it much easier for enterprise customers to build more performance and secure data centers powered by our industry-leading DPUs.\nTaking a step back, we have built significant momentum in our Data Center business as we have consistently executed our server CPU road map and expanded our solutions capabilities with the addition of the Xilinx and Pensando products to our portfolio. We remain on track to further expand our product portfolio in 2023 with the launches of our edge and telco optimized Siena and cloud optimized Bergamo processors.\nWith 128 cores and 256 threads per socket, we expect Bergamo will first end our performance and energy efficiency leadership in cloud workloads. Customer response has been very strong based on the performance, features and software compatibility Bergamo delivers. We believe our broad family of leadership CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs and DPUs position us well for long-term growth and share gains in the Data Center.\nNow into our Client segment. Revenue declined 40% year-over-year to $1 billion. Our Client processor shipments were below PC consumption in the third quarter as we worked closely with our customers to reduce downstream inventory. Desktop channel sell-through increased from the prior quarter, driven by increased demand for our Ryzen 5000 Series CPUs and the launch of our Ryzen 7000 Series processors and AM5 platform in September. We launched our 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 Series processors with strong reviews based on delivering leadership performance in gaming, productivity and content creation applications. We expect Ryzen 7000 CPU sales to ramp this quarter aligned with the launches of a broader range of mainstream and enthusiast AM5 motherboards.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as strong semi-custom sales offset a decline in gaming graphics. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of record semi-custom SoC sales as demand for the latest game consoles remained strong and Sony and Microsoft prepare for the holiday season.\nGaming graphics revenue declined in the quarter based on soft consumer demand and our focus on reducing downstream GPU inventory. We will launch our next-generation RDNA 3 GPUs later this week that combine our most advanced gaming graphics architecture with 5-nanometer chiplet designs. Our high-end RDNA 3 GPUs will deliver strong increases in performance and performance per watt compared to our current products and include new features supporting high resolution, high frame rate gaming. We look forward to sharing more details later this week.\nLooking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.3 billion, driven by growth from aerospace and defense, industrial and communications customers. Demand across our core markets remain very strong. We had record sales to aerospace and defense and automotive customers who are increasingly using our FPGA and adaptive SoC products to enable differentiated capabilities and features in their products.\nRecord communications market revenue was driven by growth from both wired and wireless customers. We saw a particular strength in North America led by new 5G wireless installations and expanded wired infrastructure deployments.\nOverall demand for our Xilinx products remain strong as we continue to leverage AMD's scale to secure additional supply to address this demand. Longer term, we're very excited about the growth opportunities in our Embedded business. We closed multiple high-revenue design wins in the quarter with automotive, networking, emulation and prototyping, communications and aerospace and defense customers. We're also seeing new design win opportunities and deeper engagements with many of our Embedded customers based on the expanded breadth of our adaptive SoC, FPGA, CPU, GPU and DPU product portfolio.\nIn summary, we are well positioned to navigate the current market dynamics based on our leadership product portfolio, strong balance sheet and growth in our Data Center and Embedded segments.\nWe have 3 clear priorities guiding us. First and foremost, we're focused on executing our road maps and delivering our next generation of leadership products. Second, we're building even deeper relationships with our customers as we make AMD a fundamental enabler of their success. And lastly, we remain very disciplined in how we manage the business. We will continue to invest in our strategic priorities around the data center, embedded and commercial markets while tightening expenses across the rest of the business and aligning our supply chain with the current demand outlook.\nThe secular trends driving increased demand for high performance and adaptive computing in the cloud, at the edge and across intelligent end devices remain unchanged and provide a strong backdrop for long-term growth.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?\n\nDevinder Kumar\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. .\nAMD reported third quarter results in line with the preliminary results we announced last month. While we are pleased with the performance of our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each of which grew significantly year-over-year, our third quarter results also reflect lower-than-expected Client segment revenue. Third quarter revenue was $5.6 billion, up 29% from a year ago. Gross margin was 50%, up 150 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client revenue and $160 million of inventory, pricing and related charges in the graphics and client businesses.\nOperating expenses were $1.5 billion compared to $1 billion a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income was up 20% from a year ago to $1.3 billion, driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 23% compared to 24% a year ago due to higher operating expenses. Net income was $1.1 billion, up $202 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.67 per share compared to $0.73 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower Client segment revenue.\nNow turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.6 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue. Data Center operating income was $505 million or 31% of revenue compared to $308 million or 28% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nClient segment revenue was $1 billion, down 40% year-over-year due to reduced process shipments resulting from a weak PC market and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $26 million compared to operating income of $490 million or 29% of revenue a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales, partially offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming operating income was $142 million or 9% of revenue compared to $231 million or 16% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue and inventory pricing and related charges.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx' embedded product revenue. Embedded operating income was $635 million or 49% of revenue compared to $23 million or 30% a year ago, driven primarily by higher revenue.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we repaid the 7.5% senior notes totaling $312 million that matured in August and deployed $617 million to repurchase common stock. We have $6.8 billion in remaining authorization for stock repurchases.\nCash from operations was $965 million, and free cash flow was $842 million compared to $764 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $3.4 billion, up approximately $721 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by client products and new products ramping in the second half of the year.\nNow turning to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the near-term macroeconomic environment. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth is driven by Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by a decline in the Client and Gaming segments. On a sequential basis, Embedded and Data Center segments are expected to grow, offset by declines in the Client and Gaming segments.\nIn addition, for Q4 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.55 billion or 28% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $175 million based on a 13% effective tax rate; and diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year, we expect revenue to be approximately $23.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 43%, led by growth in the Embedded and Data Center segments. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%.\nIn closing, we continue to focus on executing our long-term strategy while navigating current market conditions. We will prioritize the key investments for our product road maps and long-term growth while taking several near-term cost management actions, including prudently controlling operating expenses and headcount growth while actively managing inventory in line with our revenue expectations.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Ruth for our Q&A session. Ruth?\n\nRuth Cotter\n\nSVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Devinder. Kevin, if you could please poll the audience for questions."

Lisa?\n\nLisa Su\n\nPresident, CEO & Chair of the Board, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. This was an excellent quarter for our business as we delivered record revenue and profitability based on our strong execution, leadership product portfolio and diversified business model. Each of our segments grew significantly year-over-year led by higher data center and embedded sales as we continue expanding our presence across a broader set of markets and customers. Revenue grew 70% year-over-year to a record $6.6 billion. We also expanded gross margin 6 percentage points year-over-year to 54% and set records for operating and net income, both of which more than doubled from the prior year.\nTurning to the business results. Starting in the second quarter, we updated our financial segment reporting to align with our 4 strategic end markets: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded. Let me start with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 83% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.5 billion led by record server processor sales. EPYC processor demand was strong in the quarter with significant year-over-year growth across both cloud and enterprise customers.\nIn cloud, more than 60 new instances powered by 3rd Gen EPYC processors launched in the quarter from AWS, Baidu, Google, Microsoft Azure and Oracle, including the industry's first cloud-based, Software as a Service solution for chip design for Microsoft Azure and Synopsys powered by our Milan-X processors with 3D stacked chiplets. In enterprise, OEM adoption accelerated in the quarter as Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco and others brought tailored solutions to market that deliver leadership performance and TCO across many enterprise workloads. Recent examples include Lenovo's AMD-powered ThinkSystem setting a price performance world record for transaction processing and AMD-based HPE ProLiant servers delivering record-setting virtualization performance.\nWe made progress further establishing our data center GPU footprint in the quarter, highlighted by the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer debuting in the #1 spot on both the TOP500 list of the world's fastest supercomputers and the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers. I am extremely proud of our work with HPE and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build the world's first exascale supercomputer. Breaking the exaflop barrier is a significant computing milestone, and the fact that it was made possible by EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators highlights AMD's unique ability to push the envelope in computing further and faster than anyone else.\nLooking at our broader data center opportunities, we saw strong growth year-over-year for our industry-leading FPGA and networking products with cloud and financial customers. We closed our acquisition of Pensando in the quarter, further expanding our data center solutions capabilities with the addition of a world-class team and an industry-leading DPU and software stack that complement our existing products. With the additions of Xilinx and Pensando, AMD now provides the industry's broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to enable the best performance, security, flexibility and TCO for leading-edge data centers.\nLooking ahead, customer pull for our next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa server CPU is very strong. We are on track to launch and ramp production of Genoa as the industry's highest performance, general-purpose server CPU later this year, positioning our data center business for continued growth and share gains.\nTurning to our Client segment. Revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $2.2 billion based on record mobile processor sales. We believe we gained client processor revenue share for the ninth straight quarter led by strong adoption of our latest-generation Ryzen mobile processors. Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and others are on track to significantly expand their portfolio of AMD-based notebooks as they bring almost 300 new designs to market this year powered by Ryzen processors.\nWe also saw strong demand in the quarter for our latest-generation Ryzen PRO processors that deliver leadership performance and battery life for professional notebooks. Commercial client processor revenue grew significantly year-over-year as HP, Lenovo and others launched more than 50 AMD-based commercial notebooks and Dell announced its first AMD-based precision workstation. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch our all-new 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 desktop processors and AM5 platforms later this quarter with leadership performance in gaming and content creation. Taking a step back, while there has been additional softness in the PC market in recent months, we believe we are very well positioned to navigate through the current environment based on the strength of our existing product portfolio and upcoming product launches.\nNow turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $1.7 billion as semi-custom growth more than offset a decline in gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC sales continue outpacing the prior generation, and we remain on track for record semi-custom annual revenue in 2022. Gaming graphics declined in the quarter as macro conditions impacted discretionary spending. New AMD Advantage gaming notebooks that combine Ryzen and Radeon processors to enable outstanding gaming experiences launched recently to strong reviews, highlighted by the Alienware m17 receiving multiple Editor's Choice awards from leading industry publications.\nWhile we expect the gaming graphics market to be down in the third quarter, we remain focused on executing our GPU road map, including launching our high-end RDNA 3 GPUs later this year. Our next-generation RDNA 3 architecture is another major step forward for our graphics road map, delivering more than a 50% generational improvement in performance per watt by combining our most advanced gaming architecture with 5-nanometer chiplet manufacturing.\nLooking at our Embedded segment. Revenue grew significantly year-over-year to $1.3 billion led by robust demand across all markets and nodes for our FPGA and adaptive computing products. Xilinx products are deployed in virtually every market, powering mission-critical applications for thousands of customers. We accelerated Xilinx product sales in the second quarter with the benefit of the additional manufacturing scale and resources of AMD.\nWe delivered record core markets revenue led by Aerospace and Defense, Industrial Vision and Health and Test and Measurement. Communications growth was led by higher demand in Wired from multiple Tier 1 system vendors, while Wireless demand was driven by multiple ramping ORAN deployments in North America. Embedded CPU revenue also grew significantly in the quarter based on higher automotive sales and the ramp of new networking and storage design wins. As we highlighted at our Financial Analyst Day in June, we have identified greater than $10 billion in long-term revenue synergy opportunities as we bring the AMD and Xilinx assets together. Our largest opportunity is in AI, and we've already started executing new hardware and software road maps to capture the significant opportunity we see to drive pervasive AI across cloud, Edge and endpoints.\nIn summary, our work over the last several years has placed AMD on a significant growth trajectory. AMD has never been stronger and the markets for our products have never been as large or diverse. As a result, we have now delivered 8 straight quarters of record revenue as our strong execution and leadership products have driven increased adoption across an expanded set of markets and customers.\nDespite the current macroeconomic environment, we see continued growth in the back half of the year highlighted by our next-generation 5-nanometer product shipments and supported by our diversified business model. We remain laser-focused on executing our product and technology road maps, further deepening our customer relationships and investing strategically across the company to drive our next phase of growth across the $300 billion high-performance and adaptive computing market.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?\n\nDevinder Kumar\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD reported excellent second quarter results. Strong demand for our leadership products drove record quarterly revenue and continued gross margin expansion. The second quarter includes the first full quarter of Xilinx' financial results, and we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Pensando in the quarter.\nSecond quarter revenue was $6.6 billion, up 70% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue across all segments and the inclusion of Xilinx' revenue. Gross margin was 54%, up 640 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by higher Data Center and Embedded revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $909 million a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to record $2.2 billion driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 30%, up from 24% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.7 billion, up $929 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $1.05 per share compared to $0.63 per share a year ago.\nNow turning to our reportable segments. As previously communicated, we modified our segment reporting to align with our strategic end markets and the way we now manage the business. The Data Center segment includes server CPUs, data center GPUs, Pensando and Xilinx data center products. The Client segment includes desktop and notebook PC processors and chipsets, while the Gaming segment includes discrete graphic processors and semi-custom game console products. The Embedded segment includes both AMD and Xilinx embedded products.\nStarting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 83% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in 3rd Gen EPYC server processor revenue. Data Center operating income was $472 million or 32% of revenue compared to $204 million or 25% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nClient segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year, driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Client operating income was $676 million or 32% of revenue compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nGaming segment revenue was $1.7 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales. Gaming operating income was $187 million or 11% of revenue compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by higher semi-custom revenue, which was partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses.\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, driven primarily by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $641 million or 51% of revenue compared to $6 million or 11% a year ago driven by higher revenue.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $6 billion at the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we deployed $920 million to repurchase common stock and have $7.4 billion in remaining authorization. Cash from operations was a record $1 billion. Quarterly free cash flow was $906 million compared to $888 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $2.6 billion, up approximately $220 million from the prior quarter in support of second half revenue and the inclusion of Pensando. During the quarter, we established AMD in the investment-grade debt market by issuing debt of $1 billion.\nTurning to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macroeconomic environment and customer demand signals. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 55% year-over-year primarily led by growth in the Data Center and Embedded segments.\nIn addition, for Q3 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.64 billion or 24.5% of revenue; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on the 13% effective tax rate; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue of approximately $26.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 60% at the midpoint led by growth in Data Center and Embedded segments. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%.\nIn closing, we had an excellent second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth across all segments, margin expansions and record profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our product and financial objectives while continuing to monitor market signals and work closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions. We are confident that we are well positioned for long-term growth driven by our revenue diversification, financial model and earnings power.\nBefore we transition to the Q&A, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank Laura Graves for all her service to AMD and wish her every success on her retirement later this month. Thank you, Laura.\nWith that, let us begin the Q&A portion of our call.\n\nLaura A. Graves\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Devinder.

We will also discuss AMD results on a stand-alone basis for the first quarter of 2022.\nWe will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial measures during this call. The full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today's press release and in the slides posted on our website. Participants on today's conference call are Dr. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Victor Peng, President of AMD's Adaptive & Embedded Computing Group, will also join us for Q&A. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.\nBefore we begin, I would like to note AMD will host its 2022 Financial Analyst Day on Thursday, June 9, and our second quarter quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, June 17. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of today and, as such, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Lisa Su. Lisa?\n\nLisa Su\n\nPresident, CEO & Chair of the Board, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. For the last several years, we have been on a journey to both scale and transform AMD. We have consistently executed our strategy, expanded our portfolio of leadership products and diversified our business all while driving best-in-class growth. We reached a significant inflection point in our journey during the first few months of 2022 as we took several major steps that fundamentally reshaped our business.\nIn addition to delivering record financial results, we closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and announced our plans to acquire Pensando. The strategic importance of the Xilinx acquisition to our long-term goals cannot be overstated. As the industry's #1 provider of FPGA and adaptive computing solutions, Xilinx significantly expands our technology and product portfolio. Xilinx also adds multiple high-margin long-term revenue streams, spanning a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. Importantly, Xilinx has successfully executed its own growth strategy in recent years with the increased adoption of adaptive silicon across data center, communications, automotive and other large embedded markets.\nWith Pensando, we will further expand our data center solutions capabilities. Pensando will add a proven team that has developed an industry-leading DPU and software stack already deployed with key customers, including IBM, HPE, Microsoft, Oracle and Goldman Sachs. Pensando's differentiated technology further expands our product portfolio and will enable AMD to innovate at the silicon, software and platform levels to deliver leadership solutions for our cloud, enterprise and edge customers.\nNow turning to our first quarter financial performance. We started the year very strong with record quarterly revenue and net income. First quarter revenue, including the contributions from 6 weeks of Xilinx, grew 71% year-over-year to a record $5.9 billion. We expanded gross margin 7 percentage points to 53% and more than doubled both operating and net income year-over-year. Excluding Xilinx, revenue grew 55% year-over-year to a record $5.3 billion, gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 51% and operating income more than doubled to a record $1.6 billion.\nTurning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 33% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, driven primarily by the ramp of our latest Ryzen and Radeon products. Client Compute revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year based on higher Ryzen mobile and desktop processor sales. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share for the eighth straight quarter. In desktop, we expanded our processor portfolio with the introduction of 7 new Ryzen CPUs, including the Ryzen 5800 X3D CPU, which is the industry's fastest gaming CPU and first desktop processor featuring 3D stack chiplets.\nIn notebooks, record mobile processor revenue was driven by the launch of our Rembrandt Ryzen 6000 mobile processors that extend the leadership compute, gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors. In commercial, we recently introduced our latest Ryzen 6000 Pro processors with leadership performance and battery life and modern security and manageability features. We are well positioned to accelerate our growth in commercial notebooks in 2022 based on the expanded number of design wins on track to launch.\nAlthough the PC market is experiencing some softness coming off multiple quarters of near-record unit shipments, our focus remains on the premium, gaming and commercial portions of the market where we see strong growth opportunities, and we expect to continue gaining overall client revenue share.\nIn Graphics, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year with record desktop graphics channel sales. Desktop GPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year as sales of our Radeon 6000 Series graphics cards were strong. In mobile, the first notebooks featuring our latest Radeon 6000 mobile GPUs launched in the quarter, and we expect sales to ramp over the coming quarters. Data center graphics revenue was flat year-over-year as we launched our Instinct MI210 accelerators. We expanded our engagements with large cloud customers in the quarter and launched our ROCm 5 software suite targeting exascale-class HPC and AI applications.\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 88% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by record server semi-custom and embedded processor sales. Semi-Custom sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year based on strong demand for Sony and Microsoft consoles as well as Valve's new Steam deck. Sales for this game console generation continued to outpace all prior generations, and we expect 2022 to be a record year for our Semi-Custom business.\nTurning to our Embedded business. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year, led by growth in automotive. We also secured multiple design wins in next-generation security and firewall devices from Tier 1 networking providers. Turning to Server. We had another record quarter as revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We have more than doubled server processor revenue year-over-year in 8 of the last 10 quarters, highlighting the growing demand for our EPYC processors with cloud, enterprise and HPC customers.\nCloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscalers expanded their internal infrastructure deployments, and 70 new AMD-powered instances launched from Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google and others. There are now more than 460 AMD-based cloud instances available from the largest hyperscalers, with additional instances on track to launch in the coming quarters.\nIn Enterprise, revenue more than doubled year-over-year with strong growth in key verticals, including IT infrastructure, financial services and database applications. Our sales pipeline continues to be very strong, and we saw our win rate grow in the first quarter across a broad set of Enterprise end customers. We launched our first EPYC processors with 3D-stacked chiplets in the quarter. This technology extends our performance leadership in technical computing workloads by up to 66% compared to our prior generation. Atos, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro all launched servers featuring the new CPUs in the quarter.\nExcitement for our next-generation Genoa server processors continues to grow as we expanded customer and partnering sampling in the quarter. We expect Genoa will be the industry's highest-performance general-purpose server CPU, further extending the performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages of our EPYC processors. We remain on track to launch Genoa in the second half of the year and expect to continue our share gain trajectory based on expanded cloud, enterprise and HPC customer adoption. In addition, development of our higher core count Bergamo processors optimized for high throughput cloud workloads continues to progress well, with shipments on track to begin in the first half of 2023.\nTurning to the Xilinx business. For the 6 weeks following acquisition close, Xilinx revenue was $559 million. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx delivered its fourth straight quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth and the second straight quarter of greater than $1 billion of revenue. In data center, first quarter demand was led by expanded FPGA-as-a-Service and SmartNIC deployments at Tier 1 hyperscalers as well as low latency networking solutions with fintech companies.\nWe saw strength in communications led by wired demand and access and optical transport. In wireless, Versal-based 5G deployments continue ramping in multiple regions, and we secured a strategic design win with a Tier 1 communications equipment provider to power their next-gen baseband solutions with a Versal ACAP solution. We saw strong demand across the Xilinx embedded markets, led by record pro forma full quarter revenue in automotive, industrial, vision and health care and consumer. Looking forward, we see very strong demand across all of the Xilinx end markets and are focused on increasing supply.\nTurning to our integration work. In the first few months since close, we have seen tremendous excitement from our customers, partners and employees, and we expect to see significant product and revenue synergies. We now have the best portfolio of high-performance and adaptive computing engines in the industry, and we see multiple opportunities to leverage our expanded technology portfolio to deliver even stronger products.\nAs one example, we're integrating Xilinx's differentiated AI engine across our CPU product portfolio to enable industry-leading inference capabilities with the first products expected in 2023. We have also identified significant additional revenue synergy opportunities with some of our largest customers as we can now address a larger portion of their compute needs with our expanded product portfolio.\nIn summary, the start of 2022 is a significant inflection point for AMD, marked by record top and bottom-line financial results, driven by our leadership product portfolio and strong execution and the close of our Xilinx acquisition. We have now delivered greater than 45% year-over-year revenue growth for 7 straight quarters and increased net income by more than 60% year-over-year for the last 10 quarters. Based on higher AMD organic growth as well as the addition of Xilinx with strong demand across multiple end markets, we now expect annual revenue to grow by approximately 60% year-over-year, up from approximately 31% growth we guided at the beginning of the year.\nLonger term, I'm incredibly excited about our additional growth opportunities as we add the Xilinx and Pensando teams. We now see a significantly larger TAM opportunity for AMD across a diverse set of end markets based on our broader portfolio of leadership compute engines and expanded solutions capabilities. I look forward to sharing more about the products and technologies that will enable the next stage of our growth journey at Financial Analyst Day in June.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?\n\nDevinder Kumar\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was an excellent start to the year with strong demand for our leadership products resulting in record quarterly revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability and record cash flow generation. In addition, we are very pleased to have closed the Xilinx transaction and announced our intention to acquire Pensando.\nFirst quarter consolidated revenue was $5.9 billion, up 71% from a year ago, driven by significant growth across all businesses and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue for the partial period. Excluding the Xilinx contribution, AMD revenue was $5.3 billion, up 55% from a year ago, with data center revenue doubling year-over-year. Gross margin was 53%, up 660 basis points from a year ago, driven by higher server processor revenue and high-margin Xilinx revenue. Gross margin for AMD, excluding Xilinx, was 51%, up 480 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher server processor revenue.\nOperating expenses were $1.3 billion compared to $830 million a year ago as we increased investments in our long-term product roadmaps to support the future growth of our business. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to a record $1.8 billion, up $1.1 billion, primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 31%, up from 22% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.6 billion, up $947 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $1.13 per share compared to $0.52 per share a year ago.\nNow turning to first quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year, driven by higher client and graphics processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $723 million or 26% of revenue compared to $485 million or 23% of revenue a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $2.5 billion, up 88% from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by higher Server, Semi-Custom and Embedded revenue. EESC segment operating income grew significantly to $881 million or 35% of revenue compared to $277 million or 21% of revenue a year ago. The higher operating income and margin were driven by increased revenue, richer product mix and an $83 million licensing gain.\nXilinx revenue for the partial quarter was $559 million with operating income of $233 million or 42% of revenue. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx generated over $1 billion of revenue, up 22% compared to a year ago, with growth across all Xilinx' major end market categories. We are on track to achieve our cost synergy goals for the acquisition and expect the addition of Xilinx to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for 2022.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. We deployed $1.9 billion to repurchase common stock in the first quarter. To date, we have utilized $3.7 billion of our initial $4 billion stock repurchase program. We also announced a new $8 billion share repurchase program during the quarter. In total, we had $8.3 billion in remaining authorization at the end of the first quarter. Quarterly free cash flow was a record $924 million compared to $832 million in the same quarter last year and $736 million in the prior quarter.\nWe successfully executed a 5-year, $3 billion sustainability-linked credit facility to replace our existing $500 million facility. This further demonstrates our commitment to our corporate ESG goals. Inventory was $2.4 billion, up $476 million from the prior quarter due to the addition of Xilinx inventory.\nBefore I turn to our financial outlook, let me cover our financial segment reporting. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we plan to change our segment reporting to the following 4 segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded, which will align our financial reporting with our strategic end markets. I look forward to sharing further details with you at our Financial Analyst Day.\nToday's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 69% year-over-year and approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by the addition of Xilinx revenue plus higher server, semi-custom and client revenue. The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be primarily driven by Xilinx revenue plus higher server revenue.\nIn addition, for Q2 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.56 billion or 24% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on the 13% effective tax rate and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. For the full year [2022] (corrected by the company after the call) we now expect revenue to be approximately $26.3 billion, an increase of approximately 60%, driven by Xilinx and higher Server and Semi-Custom revenue. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 10% due primarily to U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits in 2022. Fiscal year 2022 will be a 53-week year and include an additional week in the fourth quarter.\nIn closing, we had an excellent start to 2022 with strong revenue growth across all businesses. We are pleased to have completed the Xilinx acquisition, which strengthens our business model with revenue diversification, accretive gross margin and increased cash generation. We are very delighted to welcome the Xilinx team to AMD. Looking ahead, AMD is very well positioned for long-term growth, margin expansion and cash generation, driven by our leadership products and roadmaps. With that, I will turn the call back over to Laura to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Laura?\n\nLaura A. Graves\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Devinder. Operator, we're ready to go ahead and begin our first question."

Su\n\nPresident, CEO & Non-Independent Director, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2021 was an outstanding year for AMD as we exceeded our aggressive growth goals and delivered another record year. Each of our businesses grew significantly and set new annual revenue record, highlighted by data center revenue more than doubling year-over-year.\nAnnual revenue grew 68% to a record $16.4 billion, and we expanded gross margin for the sixth straight year. We also delivered record net income and EPS, both of which more than doubled year-over-year.\nLooking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year exceptionally strong with our sixth straight quarter of greater than 45% year-over-year revenue growth. Fourth quarter revenue grew 49% from a year ago to a record $4.8 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 5 percentage points and doubled operating income year-over-year.\nTurning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, driven by growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. Record client computing revenue grew by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, led by record notebook sales. We saw strong demand for premium AMD notebooks and our higher-end desktop CPUs in the quarter as Ryzen 5000 processor unit shipments grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share for the seventh straight quarter.\nWe launched our Ryzen 6000 series notebook CPU at CES last month, featuring our new Zen 3+ core that further extends the leadership compute, gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors. We increased the number of premium gaming and commercial design wins from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other major PC providers to more than 200, including more than 20 AMD Advantage notebooks that combine Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs and Radeon Software to deliver the ultimate gaming experience.\nWe also provided the first public demonstration of our upcoming Ryzen 7000 desktop processors at CES. Ryzen 7000 series desktop GPUs provide a significant performance increase compared to our current Ryzen processors by combining our high-performance 5-nanometer Zen 4 core with our next-generation memory and I/O technologies in the new AM5 socket.\nThere's a lot of excitement in the market for our next-gen Ryzen desktop processors and we're on track to launch in the second half of 2022.\nIn Graphics, revenue more than doubled year-over-year for the third straight quarter. Radeon 6000 series GPU unit shipments and revenue both grew by double-digit percentages sequentially, led by strong demand across our RDNA 2 desktop family. At CES, we announced that we expanded our Radeon 6000 series GPU portfolio with our first mainstream RDNA 2 desktop GPU priced at $199.\nWe also introduced new mobile GPUs that deliver up to 20% more performance than our prior generation and our first mobile graphics chips for thin and light gaming notebooks. Data center graphics revenue more than doubled year-over-year, driven largely by HPC wins for our latest instinct MI200 accelerators. We are seeing growing customer engagements for our data center GPUs based on the leadership AI and HPC performance of our new MI200 accelerators, highlighted by multiple supercomputing wins and an expanded set of platforms on track to launch from Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, SuperMicro and others starting later this quarter.\nTurning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 75% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, driven by record EPYC processor and semi-custom sales. Semi-custom sales increased year-over-year as the current game console cycle continues outpacing all prior generations. We expect revenue to grow this year driven by continued strong demand for the latest Microsoft and Sony consoles.\nTurning to Server. We had another outstanding quarter. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by demand across both cloud and enterprise customers. In cloud, revenue more than doubled year-over-year as the largest providers expanded internal deployments and more than 130 new AMD-powered instances launched from Amazon Web Services, Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure and others.\nMicrosoft Azure previewed a new HPC instance, powered by our third-gen EPYC processors with 3D stack memory that delivers up to 80% more performance than currently available instances. Our differentiated 3D stacking technology further extends the leadership performance of EPYC processors and technical computing workloads like EDA, fluid dynamics and complex simulations. We started volume production of EPYC processors with 3D stacked memory earlier this quarter in advance of OEM platform launches with all our major server partners.\nIn Enterprise, revenue doubled year-over-year, driven by the ongoing ramp of more than 100 third-gen EPYC platforms available from Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, SuperMicro, Cisco and others. In HPC, EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the November top 500 fastest supercomputers list, tripling year-over-year to 73. EPYC processors also dominated the Green500 list and are now powering 8 of the top 10 most efficient supercomputers in the world.\nTurning to our overall data center business. We made outstanding progress in the last year. We exited 2021 with data center revenue contributing a mid-20 percentage of overall revenue, and we expect 2022 to be another year of significant growth based on the strong customer demand signals for our current and next-generation products.\nIn November, we provided first details of our next-generation EPYC processor, codenamed Genoa, that will feature up to 96 Zen 4 cores and next-generation memory and I/O technologies including breakthrough memory expansion capabilities. Customer excitement for Genoa is extremely high as it extends our performance leadership across a broad range of workloads.\nWe also announced the addition of Bergamo to our server road map, featuring a version of our Zen 4 core called Zen 4c that has been specifically optimized for cloud-native computing. Bergamo is a high core talent power-efficient CPU that can be used in the same platforms as Genoa. It will feature up to 128 CPU cores and deliver significant performance and power efficiency advantages for cloud workloads. We are sampling Genoa processors to customers now and are on track to launch later this year with Bergamo shipments planned to follow in the first half of 2023.\nTurning to our Xilinx acquisition. We were pleased to announce that China's State Administration for Market Regulation approved the transaction on January 27. The only remaining regulatory approval required is FTC approval of our HSR refiling, and we expect to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2022. I am more excited than ever about the benefits of the acquisition for both AMD and Xilinx stakeholders. Customer excitement is also high as they look forward to the opportunity to deepen their strategic engagements with AMD based on our expanded technology and solutions portfolio.\nIn summary, I am incredibly proud of our performance in 2021. Our record annual results highlight our strong execution over multiple years to establish the technical, operational and strategic foundation to position AMD as a high-performance computing leader. Each of our businesses performed extremely well in 2021 with growth significantly ahead of the long-term financial model we outlined at our Financial Analyst Day in 2020. I want to take a moment to recognize and thank the AMD employees whose passion, dedication and execution have enabled this success.\nTurning to 2022. Demand for our product is very strong, and we look forward to another year of significant growth and share gains as we ramp our current products and launch our next wave of Zen core CPUs and RDNA 3 GPUs. We have also made significant investments to secure the capacity needed to support our growth in 2022 and beyond.\nLooking out over the long term, we are confident in our ability to continue growing significantly faster than the market based on our expanded road map investments and the deep relationships we have established with a broad set of customers who view AMD as a strategic enabler of their success.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. Devinder?\n\nDevinder Kumar\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Treasurer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a very strong 2021 with increased demand for our products. Excellent execution resulted in record annual revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability and significant cash flow generation.\nFor fourth quarter 2021, revenue of $4.8 billion was our sixth consecutive quarterly record, up 49% from a year ago driven by strong revenue increases across all businesses. Gross margin was 50%, up 560 basis points from a year ago, driven by a richer mix of products and data center revenue growth. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion compared to $789 million a year ago as we increased investments in our long-term product road maps to support the significant growth trajectory of our business. Operating income doubled from a year ago to a record $1.3 billion, up $665 million primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 27%, up from 20% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.1 billion, up $486 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $0.92 compared to $0.52 per share a year ago. This includes a 15% effective tax rate compared to a 3% rate a year ago.\nNow turning to fourth quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by higher graphics and client poster revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $566 million or 22% of revenue compared to $420 million a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 75% from $1.3 billion the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by significantly higher EPYC processor and Semi-Custom sales. EESC segment operating income grew significantly to $762 million or 34% of revenue compared to $243 million or 19% a year ago. Operating income growth was driven primarily by higher revenue and richer product mix, partially offset by higher R&D and go-to-market expenses.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion at year-end. As we continue returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased $756 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and closed out the year with $1.8 billion of repurchases. Additionally, we have repurchased $1 billion to date in the first quarter of 2022 and have $1.2 billion remaining under the authorized $4 billion share repurchase plan. Quarterly free cash flow was $736 million compared to $480 million in the same quarter last year and $764 million in the prior quarter. Inventory was $2 billion, up $53 million from the prior quarter.\nNow let me turn to our full year financial results. 2021 revenue was $16.4 billion, up 68% year-on-year, driven by strong growth across all businesses. Gross margin was 48%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, driven by the strength and competitiveness of our EPYC, Radeon and Ryzen processors. Operating expenses were 24% of revenue compared to 28% in 2020. 2021 operating income was up 146% from a year ago to $4.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 25% compared to 17% in 2020. Net income was $3.4 billion, up 118% from the prior year. Full year free cash flow was a record $3.2 billion, resulting in free cash flow margin of 20% for the year. In addition, we invested approximately $1 billion during 2021 in long-term supply chain capacity to support our expectations for future revenue and market share growth.\nLet me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer signals and does not contemplate the addition of Xilinx as that transaction has not yet closed. First quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be approximately $5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 45% year-over-year and approximately 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth across all businesses. The quarter-on-quarter increase is expected to be driven by higher server and client revenue. In addition, for Q1 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50.5%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.2 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $207 million based on a 15% effective tax rate; and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.22 billion shares. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $21.5 billion, an increase of approximately 31%, driven by growth across all businesses. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%. And non-GAAP cash tax rate to be approximately 9% due primarily to the U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits in 2022.\nIn closing, we had an outstanding quarter and an excellent year with very strong revenue growth and numerous financial records. As we enter 2022, our leadership products and growing customer momentum continue to position us very well for long-term growth. I look forward to AMD delivering another year of very strong financial performance. With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?\n\nLaura A. Graves\n\nCorporate VP of IR, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Devinder, and thank you, Lisa. Operator, we're ready for our first question."

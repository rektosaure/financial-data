[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jordan Tanner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. .\n\nR. Jordan Tanner\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rocco. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sunil Mathew, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Richard Jackson, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Dillon, Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to take a moment to recognize Veterans Day and express our deep gratitude to all veterans and their families for their service. Today, I will address our recently announced sale of OxyChem outlined a strategic rationale and highlight our third quarter performance. Richard will provide details on our oil and gas operations and Sunil will review our third quarter financials, fourth quarter guidance and considerations for the year ahead.\nThe sale of OxyChem is a pivotal step in our transformation. The decision was driven by the scale, quality and diversity of the oil and gas portfolio we have built over the last decade. Since 2015, we have more than doubled our total resource potential and our production going from a total resource of 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 16.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent and from production of 650,000 BOE per day to over 1.4 million BOE per day. We now have a higher quality portfolio with Oxy's lowest-ever geopolitical risk as we have shifted the percentage of our oil and gas production from 50% domestic to 83% domestic.\nAnd our portfolio has a development runway of 30-plus years that includes high return, short cycle, higher decline, unconventional assets complemented by a solid return, lower decline, mid-cycle development opportunities in our conventional oil and gas assets. Our substantial oil and gas runway, along with our demonstrated expertise in maximizing resource recovery created the foundation for accelerating value to our shareholders through the divestiture of OxyChem. The proceeds will be used to immediately strengthen our balance sheet, allowing us to significantly deleverage and achieve our principal debt target of less than $15 billion. This will reinforce our financial resilience and agility to navigate changing market conditions.\nWith greater financial flexibility, we can broaden our return of capital program and accelerate shareholder returns. This will enhance our approach to delivering value to our shareholders by increasing cash returns and continuing to rebalance enterprise value through net debt reduction. Our strengthened financial foundation will enable us to accelerate the development of our industry-leading oil and gas portfolio by focusing capital on our Permian unconventional assets, including unconventional [ CO2 floods ], along with our Gulf of America waterfloods and in the future, our [ Bakia ] gas and condensate discovery in Oman. We're excited about all the opportunities ahead to apply our subsurface expertise for greater resource recovery and the opportunities to advance our various low-decline enhanced oil recovery projects, particularly our CO2 EOR projects.\nNow turning to the third quarter. Our teams delivered another strong quarter of operational performance, generating $3.2 billion in operating cash flow and $1.5 billion of free cash flow before working capital. Notably, we exceeded last year's third quarter operating cash flow despite WTI prices that were more than $10 per barrel lower in the third quarter of this year. Our team's continued focus on cost management and efficiency improvements also led to our lowest quarterly lease operating expense per barrel across our full Oil and Gas segment since 2021.\nOngoing improvement in portfolio and operational performance underscores the quality of our resources and the exceptional caliber of our teams who continue to bring [indiscernible] value by delivering more with less. In the third quarter, our oil and gas business produced approximately 1.47 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. The Permian Basin contributed 800,000 BOE per day, which is the highest quarterly Permian production in Oxy's history.\nThe Rockies also posted outstanding results, thanks to strong new well performance and stable base operations. Additionally, our Gulf of America assets outperformed the high end of guidance, benefiting from favorable weather and achieving the highest uptime in our operating history. Our Midstream & Marketing segment delivered another incredible quarter, generating positive adjusted earnings and surpassing the high end of guidance. Our team's expertly navigated market volatility to maximize margins through strategic gas marketing, helping to offset challenging gas price realizations.\nHigher sulfur prices in Al Hosn further contributed to the quarter's results. As shown in our third quarter results, we remain focused on generating free cash flow at lower oil prices and maintaining flexibility in our capital and development programs to support near- and long-term value creation. Richard will now provide more details on our third quarter operational highlights and how we are positioned to generate stronger returns and higher free cash flow.\n\nRichard A. Jackson\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Vicki. I appreciate the opportunity to share the progress we are making in our operations and how we are positioning our plans going into 2026. In all parts of our oil and gas business, we are making significant advancements through a focus on 3 key areas: resource improvement, cost efficiency and operating ability to generate free cash flow across a range of oil price scenarios. .\nToday, I will focus on our Permian operations where there have been several meaningful updates across these 3 areas. I look forward to sharing more from our other teams in future calls. First, let me begin by highlighting our strong third quarter results. As Vicki noted, domestic production exceeded guidance with strong contributions from all business units in the Permian, Rockies and Gulf of America. This strong performance and record results were achieved while sustaining our outlook for lower capital and improved operating costs for the year.\nCompared to our original 2025 guidance, we have reduced capital expenditures by $300 million and operating costs by $170 million. We appreciate our team's continued efforts to exceed expectations. Importantly, this performance is part of our continued track record of cost efficiency. We recently highlighted that since 2023, we have realized $2 billion in annualized cost savings across our U.S. onshore operations driven by continuous operational improvements in drilling, completions and operating expense categories as well as a value-focused supply chain management approach.\nWe are seeing similar improvements across all of our operating teams and look forward to these efficiencies continuing into 2026. Building more on Vicki's introductory comments, we have made important progress in our organic oil and gas resource improvement across the portfolio. Today, I will focus on the Permian as it plays an essential role in our near and long-term results. We have recently expanded our Permian resource base by 2.5 billion BOE, which now represents approximately 70% of Oxy's total resources of approximately 16.5 billion BOE.\nWe achieved this organic resource expansion through subsurface characterization and the application of advanced recovery and technologies. Our deep Permian resources, both low cost and provides operational flexibility to support free cash flow across a wide range of oil price scenarios. When combined with our ongoing cost efficiencies and technical recovery advancement, this places the Permian as a core value driver for Oxy's feature.\nTo start in the Delaware Basin, we continue to be a leader in new well performance across both our primary and secondary benches. Importantly, our secondary bench wells outperformed the industry average by 10% when compared to all benches, primary and secondary in the basin. In addition to improving productivity, these secondary benches also enable us to efficiently utilize existing infrastructure that was built to support our primary development.\nAs a result, we have extended our resources through increased secondary bench development while lowering our overall development costs, leading to a 16% lower capital intensity since 2022. Additionally, over the last few years, we have significantly transformed our position and performance in the Midland Basin. Today, these development projects are incredibly competitive in our Oxy portfolio. This process began with a basin-wide subsurface characterization initiative and targeted development program to more fully understand the resource potential in the basin. We then strengthened our acreage position and achieve the scale needed for operational efficiencies through the CrownRock acquisition.\nToday, the combined Oxy and legacy CrownRock teams are delivering industry-leading low cost and performance. driven by both continued operational improvements and refined subsurface designs.\nSince 2023, our new wells have shown a 22% increase in 6-month cumulative oil production per 1,000 feet, while the industry average has declined about 5% over the same period. We have also reduced well costs by 38% since 2023. These step changes have created an expanded deep bench opportunity, allowing us to organically add top-tier Barnett resources across 115,000 acres in our Midland and Central Basin platform operating areas.\nAgain, we highlight that our new well performance in the Barnett is outperforming the industry average by 18% since 2020. Another resource opportunity and key differentiator for Oxy is the expansion of enhanced oil recovery into our unconventional shale. As a leader in conventional CO2 EOR, we are leveraging our decades-long investment and expertise into these assets. Since 2017, we have advanced unconventional EOR in our Permian U.S. Permian and Rockies business units completing multiple demonstrations where we have achieved positive and consistent results.\nThese projects have delivered over 45% oil uplift, but we believe with continued optimization, our commercial projects have the capability to deliver up to 100% production uplift. We are now moving into commercial development with 3 initial projects and a current pipeline of 30 more ready for development. These mid-cycle projects offer low decline rates and competitive returns.\nOur unique and sizable Permian Basin CO2 infrastructure gives us an advantage as we scale these developments over time. Today, this represents a resource opportunity of over 2 billion BOE. We also continue to advance our existing conventional EOR assets with approximately 2 billion BOEs of undeveloped resources with low development costs. These mid-cycle projects are also meaningful as part of our future resources. Recent improvements in cost structure, including $80 million of our 2025 domestic operating cost reductions continue to improve the returns and investment priority within our portfolio.\nBeyond CO2 EOR, we are progressing a suite of complementary recovery technologies, including infill drilling, precision well placement and spacing, next-generation frac and other methods of EOR. We believe our ability to organically expand our low-cost resource base through subsurface characterization, continued cost efficiency and advanced recovery technologies give us a competitive advantage to deliver long-term value.\nAs we look ahead to 2026, we continue to actively manage our operational scenarios for a disciplined approach for resilient free cash flow, even if in challenging oil price environment. Our approach begins with a focus on operational and cost efficiency over activity reductions to preserve future free cash flow and to maintain optimized activity across our assets. A key part of this approach is working closely with our service company partners to capture supply chain savings, improving value for both parties.\nBeyond that, we selectively defer multiyear facilities and construction projects, allowing us to invest opportunistically in these projects when conditions are more favorable. We also regularly review and optimize our operating expense activities to enable us to scale and time activities for maximum free cash flow. Finally, we evaluate capital and development activity adjustments, always with a focus on achieving the most efficient capital to cash flow outcome.\nAt much lower oil prices, capital flexibility becomes critical, and we remain committed to investing wisely, preserving optionality and delivering value through efficient execution. As we enter 2026, we are targeting a $55 to $60 WTI plan, with flexibility to adapt to market conditions, while continuing to improve cost efficiency to deliver our free cash flow needs without impacting operational performance.\nLooking ahead, we have a deep portfolio of short cycle, high return and mid-cycle low-decline assets that can deliver strong cash flow. We are focused on sustaining momentum by driving cost efficiency, advancing recovery technologies and optimizing our operations.\nLastly, I'd like to thank all of our teams for their continued performance and especially safety as we looked at in the year strong. I also look forward to working closer with many of you for the first time or again in my new role. Thank you for your time today, and I'll now turn the call over to Sunil for the financial discussion.\n\nSunil Mathew\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Richard. In the third quarter, we generated a reported profit of $0.65 per diluted share. Strong operational performance and a continued focus on capital efficiency enabled us to generate approximately $1.5 billion in free cash flow before working capital. We had a negative working capital change, primarily driven by the timing of semiannual interest payments on our debt and payments within our Oil and Gas segment.\nDuring the quarter, we repaid $1.3 billion of debt, bringing our total year-to-date debt repayment to $3.6 billion and reducing Occidental's principal debt balance to $20.8 billion. Our strong financial performance can largely be attributed to higher volumes across our U.S. portfolio, which more than offset slightly lower than expected production from our international assets.\nNew well and base production outperformance in the Permian and Rockies as well as higher uptime and favorable weather in the Gulf of America enabled us to exceed the high end of guidance across all of our domestic oil and gas assets. This production outperformance and a continued focus on delivering operational cost efficiencies led to lower domestic lease operating expenses in the quarter notably outperforming guidance at $8.11 per BOE.\nPart of the outperformance also reflected the timing of certain offshore production engineering activities, which shifted into the fourth quarter. In the midstream and marketing segment, we continue to capture value through optimizing our gas marketing positions out of the Permian Basin and higher sulfur pricing in Al Hosn. Both were significant catalysts in the segment, generating positive earnings on an adjusted basis of $153 million, above the midpoint of guidance.\nLooking ahead, we are increasing our full year guidance for our oil and gas and midstream and marketing segments as a result of our strong third quarter outperformance and improved expectations for the fourth quarter. In oil and gas, we are raising our fourth quarter total company production guidance from last quarter's implied guidance to a midpoint of 1.46 million BOE per day. This is driven by the expectation for continued strong performance across all 3 domestic assets, which should more than offset impacts from a scheduled turnaround at Al Hosn also in the fourth quarter.\nOther midstream and marketing pretax income guidance assumes that our teams will capture gas marketing optimization benefits from the wider Permian to Gulf Coast spread observed already in the fourth quarter. We expect full year pretax income from the segment to come in approximately $400 million above our original guidance, largely due to those gas marketing opportunities and stronger-than-anticipated sulfur pricing from Al Hosn.\nDue to continued softness in the global chlorovinyls market, our third quarter OxyChem pretax income came in below guidance at $197 million. We are guiding to $140 million for the next full quarter. Beginning in the fourth quarter, OxyChem will be classified as discontinued operations. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of OxyChem's classification on our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate, and we will provide a further update early next year.\nTotal company capital spend, net of noncontrolling interest of approximately $1.7 billion was in line with our expectations for the third quarter, and we expect to remain within our previously guided range for 2025 capital. As Vicki said, the OxyChem transaction marks a significant milestone for our company. Asset will strengthen our financial position and enhance our ability to return capital to our shareholders.\nThe all-cash nature of this transaction will enable us to accelerate our debt reduction efforts and achieve our post CrownRock principal debt target of less than $15 billion. Of the roughly $8 billion in transaction net proceeds, we plan to use approximately $6.5 billion to reduce debt. Our initial focus is on the $4 billion of debt maturing in the next 3 years. This includes $1.3 billion of term loans maturing in 2026, which we can call at par and for the remaining $2.7 billion, we may largely use make-whole provisions to ensure certainty.\nBeyond that, we will be opportunistic taking into consideration redemption prices and the impact on our maturity profile. This will meaningfully improve our credit metrics and is expected to lower our annual interest expense by more than $350 million, while providing a very manageable near-term debt maturity schedule. The remaining $1.5 billion in net proceeds will go to cash on the balance sheet. By significantly lowering our debt burden and building cash on hand, we will create a stronger, more resilient balance sheet.\nWith the achievement of our first CrownRock principal debt target, Oxy will be positioned to broaden our return of capital program and adopt a more flexible framework for delivering value to our shareholders. We will be opportunistic with the share repurchase program. Our decisions and priorities will be driven by a range of factors, including the macro conditions, commodity prices, market valuations relative to Oxy's intrinsic value, cash on the balance sheet and the time line to August 2029. We plan to resume the redemption of the preferred in August 2029, when the preferred equity becomes callable with a lower redemption premium and does not have the $4 per share return of capital trigger.\nNow I would like to share how we're approaching our capital program for 2026. Last quarter, we discussed the potential to allocate capital to mid-cycle conventional oil assets. We are planning to increase investment in the Gulf of America waterflood projects and in Oman, given both projects high oil weighting and favorable base decline rates, combined with the enhanced economics in Oman, following our [indiscernible] contract extension.\nApproximately an additional $250 million could be allocated to these areas as capital rolls off in our LCD portfolio. Considering the recent commodity price volatility and oil market outlook, we are evaluating multiple capital scenarios across our U.S. onshore portfolio. With the OxyChem sale, our U.S. onshore capital will comprise an even greater proportion of the total company investment program, which provides flexibility should the macro environment deteriorate.\nAs Richard mentioned, we have an incredible runway of high-quality oil and gas opportunities and sustained momentum in delivering value through greater capital efficiency. We plan to reallocate up to $400 million to these short-cycle high-return projects, primarily in the Permian. Any additional allocation of capital next year will be undertaken in a thoughtful manner with an eye to the oil market given oversupply concerns. The quantum of that reallocation will depend on the macroeconomic environment, and we plan to share more on our 2026 capital budget during our fourth quarter call pending Board approval. I will now turn the call over to Vicki for closing remarks.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Sunil. As we highlighted, the OxyChem sale represents more than just a business decision and marks the final major milestone in the strategic transformation that we've been pursuing for years. With this step, we are accelerating opportunities to extend our advantaged low-cost resource position and leveraging integrated technologies to deliver differentiated recovery and superior value. .\nWe are confident that these actions will further strengthen our competitive position. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. And as Jordan mentioned, Ken Dillon is joining us today for the Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jordan Tanner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nR. Jordan Tanner\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sunil Mathew, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Richard Jackson, President Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management; and Ken Dillon, Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to first thank our teams for another quarter of strong performance, delivering $2.6 billion of operating cash flow in the second quarter. This helps to generate more operating cash flow in the first half of 2025 than we did in the first half of 2024, despite much lower oil prices in the first half of 2025. In fact, WTI averaged $11 per barrel lower than the first half of 2025. And for reference, those cash flows are talking about cash flows before working capital.\nNext, I'd like to congratulate our teams for their ability to optimize our portfolio in a way that strengthens our future development plans while creating divestment opportunities that along with cash flow made it possible for us to repay $7.5 billion of debt and less than a year from closing the CrownRock acquisition, that's well ahead of target. This equates to almost a 70% reduction of the debt raised for the acquisition.\nAlso, I'm pleased to report that STRATOS has achieved a significant milestone, and we're on track to start capturing CO2 this year. This timing is perfect as there is growing momentum behind direct air capture to generate meaningful value from CO2 enhanced oil recovery or EOR in carbon dioxide removal credits or CDRs.\nBefore I turn the call over to Sunil, I'll now provide a little more detail on operations, debt reduction and STRATOS. In the second quarter, our oil and gas business produced 1.4 million BOE per day, exceeding the midpoint of our production guidance. This reflects both the operational strength of our teams and the caliber of our diverse portfolio, with outperformance in the Rockies and an uplift to our Oman volumes due to the Mukhaizna contract extension, more than offsetting production impacts primarily due to third-party constraints in the Gulf of America.\nBack to cash flow generation. Despite much lower oil prices, the teams achieved higher CFO or cash flow from operations this year versus the same period last year, due in part to the additional production from CrownRock as well as some production growth from legacy Oxy. But important to note is that our oil and gas teams were able to achieve enough operating cost reductions to offset the operating costs associated with the incremental 180,000 BOE per day of production. In other words, despite oil production rates of 1.395 million BOE per day in the first half of this year versus 1.215 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first half of 2024 absolute operating cost in those 2 periods were essentially the same.\nI'll highlight some of those activities that have contributed to reductions in our total cost structure. In our onshore U.S. operations, we announced in our first quarter earnings call, $150 million in expected operating cost savings this year through significant cost reductions.\nAs I just highlighted, holding absolute cost level with increased production resulted in a meaningful reduction of per barrel cost to $8.55. By integrating automation, field sensors and artificial intelligence to prioritize lease operating routes, we have transitioned approximately 40% of our onshore production to routeless operations. And in our EOR business, increased field interconnectivity has enabled us to optimize our use of recycled CO2 and advanced subsurface modeling has helped to improve the effectiveness of each molecule we inject thus enabling us to reduce our purchased CO2 volumes.\nIn our international operations, we have implemented similar efficiencies to reduce CapEx -- I'm sorry, OpEx for the year by an estimated $50 million. We are confident in the sustainability of these cost reductions as the majority are structural in nature. Across the Permian, our teams have consistently driven down well costs through enhanced efficiencies, enabling us to reduce the midpoint of our capital guidance by an additional $100 million this quarter.\nIn the Delaware Basin, drilling times have improved by 20%, bringing well cost below our 2025 target. Meanwhile, in the Midland Basin, our best of the best workshops have facilitated the rapid sharing of valuable well design and operational insights across the organization, yielding impressive results. In the first half of this year, well costs for both our legacy Midland Basin assets and our CrownRock assets were lower than the expectations we set earlier this year. Collectively, these advancements have resulted in a 13% reduction in year-to-date Permian unconventional well costs compared to 2024.\nThe capital efficiencies, along with continued improvements in recoveries have yielded robust economics from secondary benches and has helped to sustain year-on-year improvements in our capital intensity.\nWe also delivered strong well performance offshore. I'd like to highlight 2 recent standout wells in the Gulf of America with one of the best at Horn Mountain in 22 years and the best at Caesar Tonga in 13 years. Both are on production down and ramping up through the end of the year. This is due to the success of our subsurface engineering and the resource potential across our existing fields, which will be enhanced by future water flooding that will unlock significant value going forward.\nOur Midstream and Marketing segment had another impressive quarter, generating positive earnings on an adjusted basis and outperforming the high end of guidance. This was largely due to improved crude marketing margins, gas marketing optimization and higher sulfur pricing. We also benefited from new oil transportation contracts that began during the second quarter.\nTurning now to low quarter -- Low Carbon Ventures business. In just 2 years since groundbreaking, STRATOS has achieved a significant milestone with Trains 1 and 2 now moving over to operations. We've commenced wet commissioning with water circulation and are on track to start capturing CO2 this year. We are immensely proud of the achievements to date and the exceptional record of safety performance as we advance towards commercial startup.\nAs I've shared in the past, we see immense value from taking a phased approach to STRATOS development. Even though this is a first-of-its-kind facility at this scale, we're already benefiting from continuous evaluation and learnings along the way. For example, we've been able to capture lessons from commissioning as we move into operations and are incorporating the latest R&D out of our carbon engineering innovation center into Phase 2. Not only will this improve the project's economics when the full capacity is online, but it will accelerate the cost down curve for future DAC projects.\nSince the first quarter, we signed 2 additional commercial agreements for carbon dioxide removal cells with JPMorgan and Palo Alto Networks. The majority of volumes through 2030 from STRATOS are now contracted, demonstrating the strength of the growing CDR market and increasing appetite for durable carbon removal technologies.\nWe also announced an agreement to evaluate a potential joint venture to develop a DAC facility in South Texas with XRG, which is the UAE's investment company and gas, chemicals and low carbon energy solutions. Agreements like this, along with the U.S. Department of Energy, support and highlight Oxy's unique capabilities and signal confidence in DAC as an investable technology to provide both high integrity carbon removal and support energy development through enhanced oil recovery in the United States.\nThe recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill included a number of provisions that will help Oxy continue to deliver differential value to our shareholders. One of these is the extension and expansion of the 45Q credit driven by the recognition of the need to capture CO2 for use in EOR to support U.S. energy security.\nThe new law levels the playing field between carbon storage and utilization pathways like DAC to EOR. Both can and likely will play an important role across global energy supply chains and carbon manage. We believe that carbon capture in DAC in particular, will be instrumental in shaping the future energy landscape.\nFirst, captured CO2 can be used for enhanced oil recovery in conventional and shale reservoirs. We believe this proven technology could recover an additional 50 billion to 70 billion barrels of oil in the United States which could extend our energy independence by 10 years.\nSecond, CO2 removed from the atmosphere via DAC can be used today to address submissions related to products or services, specifically CDRs from DAC can be paired with any fuel or energy source to provide a low-cost, scalable solution for growing low carbon intensity fuel or energy markets.\nOxy is uniquely positioned to deliver both through our leadership in DAC technology, sequestration and EOR operations. We have over 50 years of experience in carbon management and nearly 3 billion barrels of Permian EOR conventional resources along with extensive CO2 infrastructure in the Permian. In addition, we have our expanded U.S. unconventional runway and our well-positioned sequestration hubs.\nAs the largest acreage holder in the Permian, we have the scale, along with the ability to add secondary benches and EOR to provide lower emission barrels and further support U.S. energy security.\nBefore turning to Sunil, I'd like to highlight the recent success of our portfolio high-grading efforts. Since the end of the first quarter, we announced $950 million of additional divestitures, selling noncore largely nonoperated assets in our U.S. onshore business. This brings our total of announced divestitures to nearly $4 billion since January of 2024, enabling us to accelerate our debt repayments and improve our balance sheet.\nThrough our high-grading efforts, we have strengthened our portfolio, divesting assets with limited near-term opportunities and growing our inventory of competitive high-margin opportunities.\nWe have seen tremendous success so far across our CrownRock acreage, realizing significant improvements in well cost and efficiencies, and it keeps getting better. We expect value creation to expand as we continue to harness cross operational synergies throughout our Permian operations.\nI'll now hand the call over to Sunil to review our financial performance and discuss our second half guidance in more detail.\n\nSunil Mathew\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vicki. In the second quarter, we generated an adjusted profit of $0.39 per diluted share and a reported profit of $0.26 per diluted [indiscernible] investment income, partially offset by positive mark-to-market adjustments. Strong operational performance and a continued focus on capital efficiencies, enabled us to generate approximately $700 million in free cash flow before working capital despite lower realized oil prices and high market volatility.\nWe had a positive working capital change primarily driven by reductions in commodity prices, fewer battle shipments on the water and lower interest payments, which is typical for the second and fourth quarters. These impacts were partially offset by a $110 million tax payment related to 2024. After warrant proceeds and debt repayments, we exited the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet.\nOur effective tax rate increased in the second quarter due to a shift in the jurisdictional mix of income driven by lower anticipated full year oil prices compared to original expectations. We are guiding to an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 32% for the third quarter with our full year effective tax rate in a similar range based on current commodity prices.\nOur strong operational and financial performance can largely be attributed to higher volumes across our U.S. onshore and international portfolio, offsetting lower-than-expected production out of the Gulf of America. New well and base production outperformance in the Rockies and the net production uplift in Oman from the Mukhaizna contract extension, enabled us to outperform the midpoint of guidance.\nOur domestic lease operating expense in the second quarter notably outperformed guidance at $8.55 per barrel. This outperformance was due in large part to early success in delivering U.S. onshore operating cost improvements plus timing impacts of offshore production engineering work shifting from the second to third quarter.\nAs Vicki shared, this reflects our commitment to achieving operational efficiencies and continuous improvement with notable savings realized in the Permian. Looking ahead, the outlook for the second half of the year remains strong. In the third quarter, we expect our total company production range to increase to 1.42 million to 1.46 million BOE per day as we sustain operational momentum and anticipate higher volumes in all of our main operating areas.\nThough we expect a quarter-on-quarter increase in produced volumes in the Gulf of America, the recent curtailments and the shift in program timing will have lingering effects prompting a reduction in our offshore second half production guidance. We are maintaining total company production guidance for the year as a stronger outlook on new well and base performance across our U.S. onshore assets and increased production in Oman from our Mukhaizna contract extension are expected to offset lower volumes in the Gulf of America. This modified production mix is expected to slightly reduce annual total company oil cuts.\nAs Vicki said, our Midstream & Marketing segment performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, generating positive earnings on an adjusted basis of approximately $206 million above the midpoint of guidance. This was largely driven by enhanced crude marketing margins due to timing impacts of cargo sales and fluctuations in commodity prices.\nWe also benefited from gas marketing optimization and higher sulfur prices at Al Hosn during the quarter. Given the strong second quarter performance, we have raised full year Midstream and Marketing guidance by $85 million. We anticipate a more muted third quarter, assuming the [indiscernible] to Gulf Coast natural gas strip continues to narrow and we'll be prepared for any marketing optimization opportunities as they arrive.\nOur second quarter OxyChem pretax income came in below guidance due to weaker-than-anticipated pricing for caustic and PVC. Demand [indiscernible], but excess supply in both the global and domestic markets compressed margins. While the domestic PVC demand is typically the strongest in the third quarter, it is not expected to be strong enough to offset the oversupply in the market. Based on these market conditions, we are lowering OxyChem's full year guidance range to $800 million to $900 million.\nTurning now to our capital program. We expect the remaining 2025 capital spend to be more weighted to the third quarter due to the timing of oil and gas activities and the construction schedule for the [indiscernible] expansion. Continued momentum in operational efficiencies across our Permian assets has enabled us to further reduce our 2025 capital guidance range by $100 million without impacting total company production.\nTogether with the $50 million in operating cost reductions from our international assets and the cost reductions of $350 million announced in May, we now expect $500 million in total reductions relative to the original plan.\nIn the first quarter earnings call, we highlighted several key non-oil and gas items contributing to incremental pretax free cash flow in 2026. Another impactful driver is the recent passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill. In addition to the benefits Vicki highlighted, from the preservation of 45Q credits and EO parity, the bill will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy for the remainder of 2025 and 2026 relative to prior law.\nBased on our preliminary assessment, we estimate a potential $700 million to $800 million reduction in cash taxes with roughly 35% expected to be realized in 2025 and the remainder in 2026. These benefits are primarily due to changes to bonus depreciation, R&D expensing and limitations on interest deductibility.\nBefore I close, I would like to provide an update on our strengthening financial position. As Vicki shared, our portfolio high-grading efforts are progressing with the announcement of $950 million of additional divestitures since the end of the first quarter. Of this, $370 million as closed and we expect the remaining $580 million to close in the third quarter. This brings the total of announced divestitures to nearly $4 billion since the first quarter of 2024.\nThe success of our divestiture program to date, coupled with warrant proceeds and strong free cash flow have enabled us to be ahead of the schedule on the debt reduction targets outlined when we announced the CrownRock acquisition. In the last 13 months, we repaid approximately $7.5 billion of debt, far exceeding our near-term goal of paying down $4.5 billion of debt within 12 months of closing the CrownRock acquisition. This reduces annual interest expense by approximately $410 million and also results in a much more manageable debt maturity profile.\nWe are extremely pleased with the progress of our divestiture program and the trajectory of our debt reduction plans. Together with recent step changes in operational efficiency and key non-oil and gas catalysts, our continued focus on strengthening the balance sheet will support a stronger foundation for delivering long-term shareholder value.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Sunil. To close, I'd like to reiterate the strength of our upstream portfolio. I believe we have built Oxy's best-ever portfolio of high-quality complementary assets. These are a diversified mix of short-cycle, high-return unconventional assets along with lower decline, solid return conventional reservoirs. And we have the best talent and capabilities in our history and with our team's continued focus on performance and innovation, enabling us to deliver outstanding results and to position us for the future.\nWe have an incredible runway in front of us with over 14 billion barrels in total resources, much of which is well suited for EOR application. Our industry-leading experience in carbon management and EOR operations is a key differentiator for Oxy and will enable us to unlock additional resources and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions. As Jordan mentioned, Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are here with us today for the Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions]\nPlease also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Jordan Tanner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Tanner\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sunil Matthew, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management; and Ken Dillon, Senior Vice President, and President, International Oil and Gas Operations.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We will also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. 2024 was a year of strategic execution for Oxy. We positioned the portfolio to maximize value by increasing our exposure in short-cycle, high-return assets, while also advancing major projects aimed at delivering sustainable returns through the cycle. Our team's relentless focus on performance and commitment to safe and reliable operations enabled us to progress our cash flow priorities delivering on our near-term deleveraging targets while growing value for our shareholders.\nI'll begin today by covering our 2024 financial and operational achievements as well as our strategic advancements that will position us for success in the years ahead. Then I'll discuss our priorities and capital plans for 2025. Sunil will follow with a review of our fourth quarter performance, and we'll provide guidance for the first quarter and the full year ahead.\nOXY outperformed across all 3 segments in 2024 and we generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow, enabling us to pay approximately $800 million of common dividends and to increase the quarterly dividend by more than 22%. As we announced yesterday, we also made significant progress on our cash flow and shareholder return priorities. Through a combination of asset sales and organic cash flow, we achieved our near-term debt repayment target of $4.5 billion 7 months ahead of schedule. Our steadfast commitment to improving our balance sheet is coupled with our drive to invest in our future and generate long-term shareholder value.\nCapital improvements and operational efficiencies driven by our teams resulted in a capital spend of $6.8 billion, which was the low end of our guidance. Our midstream team also successfully revised key domestic crude transportation contracts to further enhance future cash flows. Now moving to operational excellence. The combination of execution efficiencies, along with strong new well deliverability and enhanced base production enabled us to achieve the highest annual U.S. oil production as well as record total company production at 1.33 million BOE per day for Oxy in 2024.\nThis exceeded the upper end of the full year guidance. The U.S. record production was driven by continued well performance leadership across our operated U.S. onshore positions in the Delaware, DJ, Midland and Powder River Basins, and Al Hosen contributed to the overall company record. In 2024, our teams reduced domestic lease operating expenses per barrel by approximately 9% and lowered well costs by roughly 12% across all unconventional basins. A key differentiator for Oxy is our ability to replace reserves to fortify the long-term sustainability of our business.\nIn 2024, we increased our year-end proved reserve balance to 4.6 billion BOE, which is the highest in Oxy's history. This represents an all-in reserve replacement ratio of 230% for 2024 and an organic reserve replacement ratio of 112%, extending our over 20-year track record of replacing reserves year after year with the exceptions of the downturn in 2015 and the pandemic in 2020. It's also notable that we have been replacing higher cost production with a higher volume of lower cost new reserves.\nAnnually, our capital spend for oil and gas development is less than our annual DD&A cost. This is driving increased earnings per barrel and increased earnings per share. In addition, our U.S. onshore inventory continues to get better, which is a testament to the portfolio's incredibly rich resources and our team's dedication to continuous improvement. Even after accounting for wells drilled and divestitures, we increased our operated inventory of U.S. unconventional well locations with subsea breakevens.\nAt the same time, we improved our average well breakeven by 6%. Our OxyChem business also outperformed exceeding the original guidance midpoint to achieve over $1.1 billion in pretax income in 2024. And our midstream segment also performed exceptionally well with our gas marketing optimization efforts offsetting lower in-basin gas realizations in the Permian and contributing to meaningful outperformance against our original guidance.\nLooking back to 2024, we advanced our strategy across all of our businesses, and I want to highlight a few of them. We closed on the [indiscernible] acquisition, adding Midland Basin scale and high-margin inventory as well as increasing our access to high-quality unconventional oil assets in the U.S. This is an asset that continues to demonstrate value with both our financial and production results exceeding expectations.\nAs construction in West Texas moved forward on Stratos, our teams in Squamish, British Columbia, focused on enhancing DAC technology. Some of their innovations are being implemented [indiscernible]. We believe DAC will deliver long-term value as well as help achieve U.S. energy security by developing the carbon neutral fuels the world needs. We have the flexibility to use DAC CO2 for both EOR and sequestration and some customers are focused on securing carbon removal credits. CDRs are important to help us prove up the technology and get the cost down. To advance those objectives, we signed several foundational CDR agreements last year.\nWe accelerated the pace of DAC R&D through the integration of our carbon engineering and Oxy teams, which has resulted in an open exchange of ideas that has expanded our culture of innovation. We are looking forward to bringing these learnings to the development of DAC facilities at the South Texas DAC hub, which was awarded funding from the U.S. Department of Energy.\nNow, I'd like to share a few highlights from our fourth quarter, which demonstrated continued strength in our financial and operational performance to close out a successful year. All 3 of our business segments also outperformed in the fourth quarter, delivering robust financial returns and generating $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Our OxyChem business generated $280 million in adjusted income, benefiting from better realized prices and volumes in both the domestic and international markets.\nIn our Midstream business outperformed through continued gas marketing transportation optimization during the fourth quarter and from higher sulfur pricing for Al Hosn production. In our Oil and Gas segment, global production during the fourth quarter was 1.46 million BOE per day, outperforming the midpoint of guidance by 13,000 BOE per day. and setting a record for Oxy's highest ever U.S. quarterly production. Our teams ended 2024 with strong performance and momentum going into 2025.\nLooking to 2025, our strategic priorities reflect an extension of 2024. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and believe strengthening the balance sheet is paramount to achieving this. Our first priority is to continue our deleveraging progress from last year and deliver sustainable dividend growth. Our announced $1.2 billion of divestiture proceeds will be used for debt reduction. The savings from the reduced interest payments will be allocated to the dividend as this week, our Board of Directors authorized a 9% increase in our common dividend.\nWe recognize the need to balance reducing debt and financial risk today while preserving tomorrow's development opportunities and associated cash flow. To accomplish this, our second priority is to advance our major projects safely and reliably, bringing Stratus online this year and keeping the battleground modernization and expansion project on track for completion next year. Stratus is progressing on schedule to be commercially operational this year.\nWe completed construction of trains 1 and 2 in December and have been thoroughly impressed by the work of our teams and our construction partner Worley. Construction on the central processing facilities is expected to be completed in the second quarter with commissioning on trains 1 and 2 in parallel. We expect start-up operations to continue in the third quarter with a ramp-up of the initial capacity through year-end.\nOur battleground project is also advancing with completion expected in mid 2026 and commercial operations to begin later that year. The project is expected to increase cash flow through improved margins and higher product volumes generating a strong return while improving OxyChem's market position for key ingredients used in producing clean drinking water, medicine and soaps. Our third priority is to maintain our culture of innovation and commitment to operational excellence. Our team's relentless drop for improvement and focus on continuing learning have delivered great results to date, enabling us to outperform targets and deliver more with less.\nThis is most recently demonstrated across our Crown Rock acreage, where in just a few months since close, we've identified numerous opportunities to deliver more production, lower well costs and accelerate returns. This year, we expect a 10% improvement in time to market compared to last year, and we expect a 7% decrease in well cost, which represents a 15% improvement relative to 2023. The teams are continuing to share best practices and innovate through best and best workshops, which we expect will drive continued efficiency and performance improvements throughout the year.\nIn addition, we see meaningful opportunities to leverage our competitive position, expanded scale and enhanced capabilities across our full Midland Basin operations. Through the integration, we have identified scale efficiencies and design improvements with the potential to lower well costs across our remaining Midland Basin program by more than $1 million per well through drilling and completion savings. These reverse synergies were a key driver behind the extension of our Midland Basin JV with Ecopetrol, which will enable additional development in the basin.\nThe agreement further highlights the vital role investment in U.S. oil and most notably the Permian plays in the global market. Our teams are also leveraging innovative ideas to unlock greater resources, achieve cost savings and improve recoveries. Within our Permian operations, we are pushing the technical limits of well deliverability deepening reservoir characterization and simulation efforts and conducting field trials to further advance enhanced oil recovery in unconventional reservoirs.\nIn our Gulf of America and international portfolio, we are utilizing advanced seismic to uncover new opportunities and provide a rich data set for AI applications. In Algeria, we recently completed the country's largest seismic data acquisition, which was also the largest ever onshore acquisition for Oxy. This will play a key role as we look to enhance value through future development opportunities. We also have an ambitious set of artificial intelligence initiatives ongoing to maximize value and improve margins.\nOur Gulf of America operations are utilizing AI to improve supply chain management, asset integrity, and reservoir characterization. Additionally, we created an AI center of excellence to align all intercompany AI initiatives and accelerate business value. Within our LCV portfolio, we are also at the forefront of direct lithium extraction technology. Working with our JV partner, we are progressing from a pilot to demonstration plant to explore the commerciality of our subsidiary [indiscernible] lithium's patented DLD technology.\nTurning now to our 2025 capital plan. We aim to maximize cash flow by investing primarily in short-cycle, high-return assets while making measured investments to advance our mid-cycle projects to provide future cash flow resilience. This year, we plan to invest between $7 billion and $7.2 billion in our Energy & Chemicals business. The oil and gas capital program is roughly equivalent to 2024 when adjusting for a full year of Crown Rock in our portfolio. We expect full year production to average approximately 1.42 million BOE per day. This represents relatively stable production from 2024 when accounting for a full year of CrownRock, though with modest oil growth.\nSimilar to years past, we anticipate production in the first quarter to reflect a low point for the year with a significant uplift expected from the second half. Sunil will provide more detail on this in our 2025 guidance. Investments in OxyChem are expected to increase to $900 million this year, with 2025 representing the peak year for construction at [indiscernible]. Battleground spend is expected to decrease substantially as the project nears completion in 2026 with Oxygen's capital reverting to maintenance levels the following year. The increase in battleground spend is largely offset by a decrease in our LCD spend in 2025, which we set at approximately $450 million.\nThe majority of this capital will be for the continued build-out of Stratos with the remainder directed towards our South Texas DAC [indiscernible] and Gulf Coast sequestration projects. We built our 2025 capital plan to focus on projects that we believe best position Oxy for long-term success. As in past years, we retain a high degree of flexibility with more than 75% of our oil and gas capital allocated to our U.S. onshore portfolio. This allows us to adapt to commodity price fluctuations and efficiently respond to market conditions.\nIn addition, our focus on short-cycle, high-return unconventional development will help to facilitate our near-term debt reduction, supporting our cash flow priorities and commitment to enhance shareholder returns.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Sunil.\n\nSunil Mathew\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vicki. I will begin today by reviewing our fourth quarter results. We announced an adjusted profit of $0.80 per diluted share and a reported loss of $0.32 per diluted share. The difference was primarily due to an increase in long-term environmental remediation liability based on a recent unfavorable Federal Court ruling. We have appealed the ruling and will seek cost recovery from all potentially responsible parties. Annual remediation and potential cash outlays are not expected to materially increase over the next several years and are expected to extend over multiple decades.\nOur fourth quarter financial and operational outperformance delivered a strong close to the year with all 3 business segments exceeding guidance. We generated approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow benefiting from higher global production volumes despite lower realized oil prices. As Vicki mentioned, our U.S. portfolio achieved record quarterly production driven largely by high operability and improved well performance across the Delaware and Midland basins. New well performance in our operated Rockies assets also exceeded expectations. Together, this more than offset lower production volumes from our domestic offshore and international assets due to respective weather events and PSC-related impacts.\nNotably, our 2024 production was achieved with less capital coming in at the low end of guidance. We had a positive working capital change in the quarter primarily due to timing of interest payments, impacts from lower oil prices and fewer barrels on the water at year-end. This together with our strong operational performance and disciplined capital program enabled us to exit the quarter with over $2.1 billion of unrestricted cash after repaying $500 million of debt.\nNow turning to our business plan and guidance. Total capital for the year is expected to be between $7.4 billion and $7.6 billion with investment front weighted to the first half of the year. Our capital plan represents a strategic mix of investments, balancing short-cycle, high-return assets with investments in no decline non-oil and gas projects to provide diversification and cash flow stability. Our capital weighting towards a higher proportion of short cycle U.S. onshore assets will enable significant cash flow velocity that can be applied to debt reduction.\nIt will also allow us to retain significant flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. In 2025, we expect full year production to average approximately 1.42 million BOE per day, representing mid-single-digit growth from 2024. After adjusting for a full year of CrownRock, total production volumes are expected to remain relatively flat, though with a nearly 3% increase in oil volumes.\nAs was the case in 2024, our first quarter production is expected to decrease from the prior quarter due to reduced fourth quarter activity levels and a lower working interest in recently drilled Permian wells. Severe winter weather in January also impacted Permian production. In addition, volumes will be impacted by plant maintenance and platform life extension at Horn Mountain as well as turnarounds at Al Hosn and Dolphin.\nWhile we expect lower volumes during the first half of the year, production is expected to ramp up in the second half. Much of this increase is coming from the Permian, which is expected to grow by more than 15% in 2025 due to a full year of Crown Rock and modest growth across our legacy positions. As Vicki mentioned, our Crown Rock assets continue to outperform and expected to average over 170,000 BOE per day, representing more than 5% growth.\nOur guidance for Rockies volumes is lower for 2025, driven by the decision to adjust our gas processing to ethane rejection in the DJ Basin. This is expected to increase revenues and improve margins, delivering greater value from our Rocky assets. Additionally, our announced divestiture of nonoperated Rockies interest will lower full year production from the region. When accounting for these items and reduced outside operated activity, our 2025 Rockies production is expected to be essentially flat from last year.\nDespite [indiscernible] maintenance during the first quarter, full year production in our U.S. offshore portfolio is expected to increase relative to 2024. This, coupled with our growth out of the Permian is expected to increase our total company oil cut to 52% in 2025. Looking to the chemicals business, OxyChem ended 2024 with a strong operational performance, generating $280 million in adjusted pretax income in the fourth quarter and exceeding guidance by $50 million.\nThis was driven by better-than-expected pricing in both the domestic and international markets as global supply disruptions kept prices higher and demand else strong through most of the fourth quarter. OxyChem's first quarter income is expected to be lower than the prior quarter, primarily due to 3 short-term events. Our operations were affected by the winter storm in January, which temporarily impacted production and restricted access to market. We also had an unplanned outage at our Ingleside facility that lasted approximately 2 weeks. And we are seeing an increase in raw material costs following higher-than-expected ethylene plant outages during the first quarter.\nThese temporary cost pressures should ease early in the second quarter once the ethylene suppliers are backed online. For the full year, we expect a slight decrease in OxyChem's earnings and are guiding to a midpoint of $1 billion of pretax income. This is driven in part by the events of the first quarter, forecasted higher natural gas prices and expectations for a slightly oversupplied market for the first half of the year, following late 2024 domestic capacity additions.\nRationalizations are expected to occur in the second half, which should help to rebalance the market and improve pricing. Our Midstream segment had a strong end to the year with adjusted pretax income outperforming guidance by $104 million. The bulk of this was due to gas marketing optimization in the Permian with our teams once again expertly managing market volatility to maximize margins. Higher sulfur prices for Al Hosn also contributed to these earnings. All in, our midstream segment demonstrated exceptional performance throughout the year with adjusted pretax income surpassing the midpoint of our original full year guidance by approximately $600 million.\nWe expect slightly lower midstream earnings in 2025 as the opportunities for gas transportation optimization narrow with increased takeaway capacity now online. While we may see fewer pricing dislocations and opportunities to capitalize on market spreads, we expect our upstream businesses to benefit from improved realized prices in the Permian. Reduced opportunities to optimize gas marketing will be partially offset by improvements in our crude marketing out of the Permian.\nAs we mentioned previously, we expect to benefit from the revision of 2 crude transportation contracts at lower rates this year. One of these will be realized at the end of the first quarter, with the second coming into effect at the end of the third quarter. Given the timing, we expect to see an approximate $200 million benefit this year and expect approximately $400 million in annual savings in 2026.\nTurning to our LCV business. We are extremely excited about Stratos progress to date and our expected start-up of operations this year. Due to the timing and ramp-up period associated with bringing the first phase online, we are assuming a minimal contribution from Stratus in our midstream guidance.\nWe expect a negative working capital change during the first quarter, which is typical for this time of year, driven by interest payments, property tax and compensation plan payments. Additionally, there are 2 upcoming 2024 tax payments as part of the Federal Disaster Relief Program following Hurricane Beryl, which will further impact working capital in the first and second quarters of the year.\nI would like to close today by reiterating our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet, which will position us to generate greater shareholder returns. As Vicki shared at the start, we are pleased to announce that we successfully achieved our near-term debt reduction target by repaying $4.5 billion in 2024. We are continuing this momentum into 2025 and and announced $1.2 billion in divestitures in the first quarter.\nProceeds from these sales will be applied to our 2025 maturities and excess cash flow after common dividends will be available to further reduce our 2026 and beyond debt maturities. By reducing the amount of cash committed to interest payments today we will place Oxy in a stronger position to deliver an expanded return of capital program in the future.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Sunil. As I shared at the start, 2024 was a pivotal year for Oxy. We strengthened our portfolio delivered on our near-term deleveraging commitments and advanced our major growth projects. While we delivered exceptional financial and operational results, what excites me the most is the way our teams propelled our business forward with passion, industry leadership and a continued focus on innovation and learning and most importantly, a focus on safety underpinned at all.\nIn 2024, our employees achieved [indiscernible] safety performance ever in our history. That's across oil and gas, midstream and OxyChem. The commitment of our people to safe and sustainable operations is embedded in Oxy's core values and helps enable our long-term success. This will be an exciting year for us. Our technical capabilities and portfolio of assets have never been better and the combination of our 3 business segments, uniquely positions us to capitalize on shared learnings and operational synergies. Bringing Stratus online will be a testament to this. and demonstrating the differentiated strategy and compelling value proposition that Oxy brings to the table.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions. And as Jordan mentioned, Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are here with us today for the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jordan Tanner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Tanner\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sunil Matthew, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Richard Jackson, President Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management; and Ken Dillon, Senior Vice President and President International Oil and Gas Operations.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today by highlighting another quarter of exceptional execution across our business segments. Our teams delivered strong operational performance during the second quarter. Our technical and operational excellence, paired with a high-quality asset portfolio continued to deliver value across our businesses. .\nLast week, we further strengthened our portfolio through the addition of Crown Rock's assets in the Midland Basin. We were also pleased to announce that our strategic divestiture program is progressing, and we have clear line of sight to meeting the debt reduction targets we set out when we announced the deal last December. This afternoon, I'll cover our second quarter results and operational performance as well as our CrownRock integration plans. Sunil will then review our financial results and guidance, including an increase in full year guidance for our midstream earnings.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered Oxy's highest quarterly production in 4 years for both total company and U.S. onshore. This exceeds the midpoint of total company production guidance generating $1.3 billion in free cash flow before working capital. This was driven by exceptional execution across our business segments with notably strong Permian new well performance and higher production uptime along with outperformance in the Gulf of Mexico. We're exceeding our production expectations for onshore new wells across all our basins and are continuing to achieve operational efficiencies as we execute our capital program.\nThis year-to-date, we've seen approximately 10% improvement in our unconventional well costs compared to the first half of last year, putting us ahead of our planned well cost savings. These savings have been achieved through lower nonproductive time, increased frac utilization, operational efficiency gains and facilities optimization as part of our focused program to lower well cost, decrease time to market and increased free cash flow.\nWe anticipate further acceleration in time to market in the second half of the year. Importantly, we continue to deliver industry-leading performance and secondary bench development, supporting long-term economics and inventory replenishment. The momentum we are generating on development costs across many facets should translate to capital efficiency improvements as we look toward the end of the year and into 2025.\nIn addition to improved capital efficiency and continued well performance leadership, our teams have driven down lease operating expenses across our domestic assets to enhance our cash margins. In the second quarter, our per BOE lease operating expenses decreased over $0.60 a barrel, a 6% improvement relative to the average of the prior 3 quarters. We have several more optimization initiatives planned for the second half of the year, which should give us a favorable outlook toward year-end. For example, in our Permian EOR business, we are finding ways to utilize CO2 more efficiently in our reservoirs.\nWe're also optimizing our artificial lift, which has led to reduced failure rates and associated downhole maintenance costs. In the Delaware Basin, we've decreased water disposal costs by doubling the volume of water recycled relative to the first half of last year. Water stewardship remains a key priority in our operations, and I'm pleased to highlight a recent milestone in which we recycled a cumulative 50 million barrels in our Midland South Curtis Ranch treatment facility.\nIn addition, we have now recycled over 150 million barrels in our New Mexico operations in 2019. Overall, we have built solid oil and gas segment momentum as we move into the second half of 2024. This gives us confidence to maintain our full year production guidance, excluding CrownRock for our total company and Permian assets despite the expected divestiture of 15,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter. Our midstream business significantly outperformed in the second quarter with an adjusted pretax income more than $180 million higher than the guidance midpoint. Our domestic gas marketing teams followed up on the success of their first quarter by utilizing their extensive market intelligence and transportation capability to benefit from regional pricing dislocations.\nFurthermore, as healthy storage levels and stable Permian output continued from earlier in the year, the second quarter presented abnormally high planned and unplanned maintenance on takeaway pipelines. Our teams capitalized on this opportunity highlighting the value the diversity of our asset base provides.\nAs we look ahead to the second half of the year, we anticipate fewer opportunities for optimization after the Matterhorn pipeline is placed in service, which is expected in the coming months. However, our teams will be prepared to act if additional bottlenecks arise. Looking now at our low carbon businesses. We're excited by the advancements we are making. As construction of Stratus, our first director capture facility moves forward, our low carbon invites team continues to demonstrate that demand for carbon dioxide removal credits is growing.\nIn July, we announced an agreement with Microsoft for the sale of 500,000 metric tons of CDR credits over 6 years from Stratus. The agreement is the largest single purchase of direct air capture CDR credits to date and highlight the increasing recognition of carbon engineering technology as a solution to help organizations achieve their net 0 goals.\nI would now like to talk about how pleased we are to integrate CrownRock into the Greater Oxy portfolio. We closed the acquisition on August 1, and we continue to be impressed with CrownRock's efficient operations and employee talent. As we have discussed previously, this acquisition complements and enhances our premier Permian portfolio with the addition of high-margin production and low breakeven undeveloped inventory.\nWe're excited about the subsurface and geologic potential of these assets and our technical teams are eager to apply their subsurface expertise and workflows to generate maximum value. We're also looking forward to leveraging our newfound scale in the Midland Basin. Over the years, we've seen how scale has driven significant technical advancements and operational efficiencies in our other basins. We are confident that as we integrate our Midland Basin assets, we'll unlock meaningful efficiencies through infrastructure sharing, resource utilization and by bringing together best practices from each of our organizations.\nOur combined teams have made great strides in the past several days getting to know each other and integrating Crown Rock into Oxy's organization. On our next call, we're looking forward to telling you more about our post CrownRock Enhanced portfolio and how the integration is advancing. One of the many benefits of this acquisition was the opportunity to high-grade Oxy's existing portfolio of assets.\nIn December, we laid out plans for our $4.5 billion to $6 billion divestiture program to be completed within 18 months of the acquisition's close. Given the inventory depth of our onshore portfolio, we welcome the opportunity to monetize some of these assets at an attractive price. And as we announced last week, the divestiture program is progressing well. Since the start of the year, we have closed or announced approximately of $1 billion of Permian Basin divestitures. The proceeds from these sales will go directly towards debt reduction.\nThis progress on divestitures, coupled with a robust organic cash flow underpinned by our steady focus on operational excellence has positioned us well to reduce our debt in the near term. Sunil will address this in more detail, but we're excited that we're on track to retire approximately $3 billion of debt during the third quarter, which means what speaks to both the quality of our assets and our future cash flow potential.\nNow, I'll hand the call over to Sunil to provide more details about our second quarter financial results, our guidance and progress on strategic financial action.\n\nSunil Mathew\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vicki. We are excited with the recent progress we have made in executing the portfolio high-grading plan we outlined in December. Oxy has realized an immediate announcement of our U.S. onshore portfolio with low breakeven inventory and expansion of free cash flow generation potential upon the closing of CrownRock last week. The opportunity to build scale in the Midland Basin made this transaction a strategic fit for Oxy and the newly acquired assets will immediately compete for capital.\nIn late July, we issued $5 billion of senior unsecured notes. We used the net proceeds of the offering and term loans to fund the cash consideration of the CrownRock acquisition. Overall, we were highly pleased with the investor demand for the bond offering. We placed notes maturing in 5 tranches at 3, 5, [indiscernible] 7, 10 and 30 years at a weighted average coupon rate of less than 5.5%, creating a manageable debt maturity profile given our deleveraging plans.\nOur efforts to strengthen our balance sheet remain a top priority, and we are achieving early success in debt reduction.\nIn July, we retired $400 million of debt at maturity and our strong organic free cash flow is enabling further deleveraging progress in the coming weeks. By the end of August, between additional Oxy maturities and the early redemption of CrownRock's notes we will have prepaid an additional $1.9 billion of debt, bringing the total to $2.3 billion. Add to this, the proceeds from the Barilla Draw divestiture and we expect to have repaid over $3 billion in debt by the end of the third quarter, which is almost 70% of our near-term reduction commitment of $4.5 billion.\nWe will continue to prudently advance deleveraging via free cash flow and proceeds from our divestiture program. We were pleased last week to announce the agreement to sell certain Delaware Basin assets for approximately $818 million. The core of this divestiture centers around approximately 27,500 net acres in the Barilla Draw field of the Texas Delaware Basin. While these assets have been go to Oxy's Southern Delaware position for over a decade, the remaining inventory is longer dated in our current development plans.\nWe anticipate closing the sale late in the third quarter and estimate a 15,000 BOE per day reduction in fourth quarter Permian production. Separate from this transaction, we also announced additional completed disposal ships from earlier the year, involving several smaller undeveloped acreage positions throughout the Permian approximately $152 million in total. This brings total year-to-date closed or announced divestments to $970 million. Consistent with our cash flow priorities, all net proceeds from these sales will be allocated to debt reduction.\nWe are satisfied with the progress of our divestiture program and the trajectory of debt reduction plans. We are ahead of schedule on our near-term debt reduction commitments, and we will continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet through a combination of divestitures and excess cash flow until we reach our principal debt target of $15 billion or less. In the second quarter, we generated both an adjusted and reported profit of $1.03 per diluted share and exited the second quarter with $1.8 billion of unrestricted cash.\nAs Vicki highlighted earlier, we generated over $1.3 billion of free cash flow before working capital, driven by sustained success across our diversified business segments. More specifically, the second quarter was marked by strong production performance in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico, driving high oil volumes. In the Midstream segment, substantial value capture was realized, particularly in gas marketing as evident through the greater than $180 million adjusted pretax income outperformance when compared to the midpoint of guidance.\nWe are delighted with our operational excellence drove financial results in the second quarter and continue to benefit from a complementary asset base that positions us for success through a wide range of pricing environment. Our second quarter capital was largely in line with the first quarter, consistent with our business plan of a front half AV and domestic oil and gas activity.\nWe reported a negative working capital change in the second quarter, primarily due to higher oil volumes and increased barrel shipments on the water at quarter end. Rockies related property tax payments, which are based on a 2-year revenue lag and incorporates a period of higher oil and natural gas prices from 2022 also played a contributing factor.\nNow looking ahead to the second half of 2024. We have provided pro forma guidance based upon the following assumptions. We included CrownRock in our guidance beginning August 1, and and we excluded from guidance the 15,000 BOE per day of 4Q production associated with the Permian divestment as we expect the transaction to close late in the third quarter. Even after adjusting for this disposition, Oxy's total and Permian full year production, excluding CrownRock, is expected to remain flat due to higher Permian outlook. Including Crown drag, the midpoint of our total company production and guidance has increased from 1.25 million to approximately 1.32 million BOE per day.\nBuilding on the operational momentum generated in the first and second quarters, we anticipate an improving production trajectory in the back half of the year in all our domestic assets. This includes the Gulf of Mexico even after incorporating some downtime for potential disruptive tropical weather in our guidance. Excluding CrownRock, the midpoint of our 3Q production guidance would represent a new record for the highest quarterly production in over 4 years.\nIn the appendix, we have summarized some of the key full year guidance changes associated with consolidating CrownRock into our portfolio. Aside from the production benefits, we anticipate a notable improvement in domestic operating costs from adding these high-margin barrels. Excluding CrownRock, we are also pleased with Oxy's improvement and favorable trajectory of operating costs and capital efficiency across our U.S. onshore assets, as highlighted by Vicki earlier.\nOxyChem's 2024 business is performing well. with results largely in line with the plan we laid out at the start of the year. However, challenging economic conditions in China, combined with the continued deferral of interest rate reductions have dampened OxyChem's trajectory for the year. As a result, we are revising OxyChem's full year guidance down to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.\nWe continue to anticipate that 2024 will be another strong year for OxyChem by historical standards. With midstream and marketing strong second quarter, we have raised full year guidance by $220 million. We anticipate a more muted third quarter as additional Permian gas takeaway capacity is expected to come online, reducing gas marketing optimization opportunities. We continued to execute our 2024 capital program as scheduled. While the legacy Oxy capital will decrease in the second half as a result of taper domestic activity, maintaining CrownRock's 5-rig program will reshape the investment profile as we increased the full year total company net capital range to $6.8 billion to $7 billion.\nIn closing, I want to discuss how Oxy is delivering on the financial milestones we laid out in December. A sustainable and growing dividend is the foundation of our shareholder return priorities. Earlier this year, we followed through on a commitment we made when we announced the CrownRock acquisition and raised our quarterly common dividend by over 22%. The free cash flow accretion that we anticipate from CrownRock along with the expected improvements from our non-oil and gas segments of our portfolio provided us with the confidence to raise the dividend.\nMaintaining our investment-grade credit rating is a key priority. In recent weeks, we received ratings [indiscernible] from all 3 rating agencies, including our investment-grade credit ratings from Moody's and Fitch. We are focused on our deleveraging strategy, and we remain on track to return at least $4.5 billion of debt well before next August. We are off to a promising start with our divestiture program. We will continue to evaluate our high-quality asset portfolio for divestment opportunities and will apply those proceeds to further debt reduction. -- thereby strengthening our balance sheet. Oxy is methodically delivering on this key financial commitments. The strategic and financial actions we have taken over recent quarters are converging to benefit our portfolio increased cash flow generation capability and ultimately accelerate shareholder value.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Sunil. Before we move on to the Q&A, I would like to close by focusing on a few of Oxy's differentiated value catalyst. Our subsurface expertise, technical excellence and operational strength allow us to continuously achieve basin-leading well performance while simultaneously driving efficiency and savings. The addition of CrownRock further enhances what I believe is OXY's strongest portfolio in our century-long history, and it kicks off another phase of Oxy's cash flow growth with future upside through improved resource recovery and lower cost opportunities.\nI can't wait to see the value that the newly combined teams deliver given the quality and depth of development opportunities coming with this new asset. Beyond oil and gas, we expect our OxyChem and midstream businesses to continue to provide material cash flow durability in the years ahead. And finally, LCV continues to develop practical decarbonization solutions that are solidifying our leadership in this important emerging market. These businesses together position Oxy's common shareholders to benefit financially for decades to come. We will now open the call for questions.\nAs Jordan mentioned, Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are on the call with us today for the Q&A session."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jordan Tanner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Tanner\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sunil Mathew, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management; and Ken Dillon, Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report on a strong start to 2024, driven by our persistent focus on operational execution. As we will detail in today's call, our oil and gas business delivered robust production results essentially offsetting an extended third-party outage, while our midstream and OxyChem businesses outperformed our first quarter guidance.\nToday, I'll start by discussing our first quarter performance, including highlighting our Delaware appraisal success and its contribution to Permian's development runway. Then I'll discuss what's on the horizon for Oxy, and how these initiatives are expected to generate significant value for our shareholders.\nOperational excellence is fundamental to everything we do at Oxy, and our capabilities were evident during the first quarter as our teams generated over $2.4 billion in operating cash flow before working capital. Though the third-party outage in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico made it a challenging start to the year, our teams delivered excellent performance in all areas of our portfolio. We concluded the first quarter by approximating the midpoint of our production guidance, and we restarted production from our Gulf of Mexico platforms affected by the outage in mid-April.\nTaking a closer look at our production results, the first quarter benefited from strong new well performance in the Permian Basin and the Rockies, overcoming the impact of winter weather early in the year. In the Permian, we exceeded the midpoint of our production guidance due in part to better-than-expected secondary bench performance in the Delaware Basin. Our Delaware teams are achieving impressive performance by results -- performance results by applying the same proprietary subsurface workflows that have generated remarkable success in our primary benches and applying that to secondary benches.\nThrough utilization of fit for purpose, well design and reservoir characterization expertise, performance in our secondary benches is nearly matching Oxy's record-setting 2023 program average. Not only that, first year cumulative production from Oxy's 2023 secondary wells exceeds the Delaware industry average for all horizontal wells for the same period by more than 30%.\nWe are driving financial returns for our shareholders by improving our ability to high grade our near-term inventory and by extending our runway of Tier 1 locations. Meanwhile, use of our existing infrastructure yields meaningful capital efficiencies. We expect these efficiency benefits to become more impactful in secondary benches become a more substantial part of our development program.\nOur Rockies assets outperformed the high end of our first quarter production guidance, partly driven by strong new well performance in the DJ Basin, better production uptime, higher-than-expected outside operating volumes. And then internationally, we achieved record gross daily production in Oman North, driven by new well performance and production uptime.\nOur teams continue to improve capital efficiency through a combination of innovative well design, exceptional execution, proactive supply chain and management practices. In the DJ and Powder River Basins, our teams optimized facing and cementing plans, completion stage design and profit utilization. These fit-for-purpose well design enhancements resulted in tangible first quarter well cost reductions of between $700,000 and $1 million per well compared to the first half of last year.\nWe're also starting to see cost reduction progress in the Delaware Basin. Our continuous drive for improvement not only leads to innovations that increased operational efficiencies, but in many instances, we're also able to reduce emissions and advanced progress toward our net zero goals.\nI'm proud of our team's involvement in another oil and gas industry first, the deployment of a fully electric well service rig. Oxy and Axis Energy Services deployed the first of its kind rig and to our Permian Basin operations. Expanding electrification is integral to Oxy's strategy because it increases operational efficiency, generates cost savings, improve safety and helps reduce our emissions.\nOur midstream business significantly performed at the high end of our guidance for the first quarter. Outperformance was partly driven by gas marketing optimization across our portfolio where our teams captured value in regional pricing disparities. Mover than expected weather, combined with various third-party midstream infrastructure maintenance resulted in disjointed prices in some regions. Midstream's first quarter performance demonstrates how our teams realized value from these pricing [indiscernible] by leveraging Oxy's rich market intelligence along with our product storage and transportation portfolio.\nLooking back over multiple quarters, our marketing teams have frequently demonstrated the ability to outperform, with our transportation optimization capabilities playing a major role. Over the longer term, we anticipate similar marketing opportunities, but we generally exclude those opportunities from our guidance because of the difficulty in predicting the events occurs. Not only does our midstream business provide us with flow assurance for our marketed products, it also offers great diversification during periods of commodity price volatility as we saw in early 2024.\nAlong with being 1 of the top performers for the products at manufacturers, OxyChem is a consistent cash flow diversifier within our business, due in part to its renowned focus on operational efficiency.\nDuring the first quarter, OxyChem benefited from improved demand from our marketed products, including PVC and vinyl chloride as well as lower ethylene costs. This performance demonstrates how our diversified asset portfolio is well positioned to deliver financial results for our shareholders throughout the commodity cycle.\nIn prior calls, we have reiterated our drive to increase value for our investors on an absolute and per share basis through cash flow and earnings growth. Today, I'd like to provide an update on the specific projects that we mentioned in our last quarterly call.\nSome aspects of the OxyChem plant enhancement projects are complete, but there is more to be done, including the battleground project where the team held a groundbreaking ceremony on April 4, the kickoff to site work. Employees, contractors, community partners, city leaders and elected officials attended in support of the project. The completion of the OxyChem projects and reductions in crude oil and transportation rates from the Permian to the Gulf Coast are expected to deliver incremental cash flow of approximately $725 million per year.\nIn our Midstream business, we expect that our ownership stake in Western Midstream or West, we'll also enhance our financial results. In February, West announced an increase of over 50% to their distribution. Based on the current distribution, we anticipate that West will contribute over $240 million of additional cash flow per year to Oxy.\nAdditionally, we intend to increase free cash flow by repaying debt as it matures. Repayment of existing debt maturities through 2026 will result in approximately $180 million of annualized incremental cash flow from interest savings that can then be applied to further strengthen our balance sheet.\nOverall, we expect more than $1 billion of cash flow improvements that are independent of commodity cycles. That figure does not include our oil and gas business, which is also poised for continued financial success.\nAs most of you know, at the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to strategically enhance our Midland Basin portfolio with the acquisition of CrownRock. The free cash flow accretion and portfolio high grading to be enabled by the CrownRock acquisition are expected to provide the potential for equity appreciation and acceleration of our shareholder return priorities.\nIn our low carbon ventures businesses, we expect to generate cash flow detached [indiscernible] and further strengthen Oxy's cash flow [indiscernible]. Construction of our first direct air capture plant at is advancing on schedule. And during the first quarter, we were pleased to announce the multitude of carbon dioxide removal credit agreements with customers across a variety of sectors. [indiscernible].\n\nSunil Mathew\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vicki. In the first quarter of 2024, $0.33 per diluted share and a reported profit of $0.75 per diluted share. The difference between adjusted and driven by our litigation settlement gain related to the Andy's arbitration and gains on sales included in equity income, partially offset by derivative losses.\nWe exited the first quarter with nearly $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash. We had a negative working capital change, which is typical for the first quarter, and is largely due to semiannual interest payments on our debt, annual property tax payments and payments under our compensation plan.\nDuring the first quarter, we delivered over $700 million of free cash flow before working capital. despite third-party outage impacts to portions of our oily high-margin production in the Gulf of Mexico. First quarter free cash flow was underpinned by outperformance in our onshore domestic portfolio and our midstream and OxyChem segments.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, total company production is expected to increase to a range of 1.23 million to 1.27 million BOE per day compared to the first quarter annual low of 1.17 million BOE per day. The midpoint of second quarter production guidance will be the highest quarterly production in over 3 years.\nThe production increase is mainly due to U.S. onshore activity levels, the completion of annual plant maintenance at Dolphin and the return of production in mid-April from the Gulf of Mexico outage.\nOur second quarter Gulf of Mexico production guidance includes third-party outage impacts in April as well as plant maintenance in the Central Gulf of Mexico.\nThough we revised fully Gulf of Mexico production guidance down as a result of the extended outage, it is fully offset by outperformance in the Rockies, and we are maintaining our total company production guidance for the year. The modified production mix is expected to impact annual total company oil cut.\nWe had a strong start to 2024 in our chemicals business and anticpate [indiscernible] demand. Those lower gas prices are unfavorable elsewhere in our portfolio, OxyChem benefits from reduced energy costs and our midstream teams are well positioned to capitalize on the gas marketing opportunities that Vicki highlighted. Solid outperformance enabled us to raise Midstream's full year guidance range by $110 million.\nOxy's first quarter performance demonstrates the benefits of our differentiated portfolio. Our diversified assets and distinguished operational capabilities offer our shareholders' cash flow resiliency throughout the commodity cycle.\nIn terms of capital spending, our first quarter results were in alignment with the 2024 business plan and the capital program that is weighted towards the first half of the year.\nOn the last earnings call, we stated that approximately 40% of Rockies capital for the year is associated with built and uncompleted wells, or DUS, added in from 2023. We intend to continue completing these wells in the first half of the year. Similarly, Permian capital is weighted towards the first half of the year due to working interest variability and the desire to high-grade rigs and increased utilization rates into the second half of the year. This U.S. onshore capital profile, combined with [indiscernible] ramp-up, is expected to result in second quarter being the highest quarterly capital for the year.\nI would like to close today by touching on the CrownRock acquisition. Our teams are working constructively with the FTC, and we anticipate that the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, Oxy will benefit from CrownRock's activity between the transaction's January 1, 2024, effective date and close, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.\nConcurrent with the CrownRock acquisition, we announced a $4.5 billion to $6 billion divestiture program to be completed within 18 months of the transactions close. The high-quality assets within our portfolio have garnered much interest, and our teams have commenced the early stages of the divestiture process. Sales proceeds will be applied to deleveraging until we reduce our principal debt to $15 billion or below.\nThe near-term cash flow enhancements that Vicki highlighted are expected to deliver significant free cash flow growth per diluted share for our common shareholders, and to enable us to accelerate the achievement of our debt target. After our debt target is met, we intend to resume our share repurchase program and provide even greater value per common share. As we have discussed on today's call, we are well positioned to build on a strong first quarter of 2024 and deliver a differentiated long-term value proposition to our shareholders. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Sunil. Before we move to Q&A, I want to tell you about a milestone our team celebrated last quarter. Oxy began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 3, 1964. On that day, our operations consisted of 252 oil and gas wells in 6 states. Today, we're in international energy, chemicals and carbon management company with the best portfolio in our history. But I believe that Oxy's employees are a true differentiator. Their expertise and drive to outperform continue to stretch the limits of what is achievable in our industry. Our employees are hard at work executing our strategy through superior operations and best-in-class assets. Their efforts result in long-term shareholder value, and I look forward to showcasing more of their achievements on future calls. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\nAnd as a reminder, as Jordan mentioned, Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are with us today for the Q&A session."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sunil Mathew, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and carbon management; and Ken Dillon, Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon.\nWe'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules for our earnings release and on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Jordan, and good afternoon, everyone. 2023 was a great year for us, thanks to the performance of all of our teams in Oxy. I'm going to start by discussing our financial performance, operational excellence and our strategic advancements in 2023, then I'll review our capital plans for 2024. [indiscernible] continue to position us to deliver sustainable and growing returns for our shareholders through our premier asset portfolio, advanced technology and robust commercial runway. First, I'll begin by reviewing our financial performance in 2023.\nLast year, our talented and committed teams across the company applied advanced technical expertise, operating skills, leading-edge technologies and innovation to our exceptional portfolio, and they delivered results, $5.5 billion in free cash flow, which enabled us to pay $600 million of common dividend, repurchased $1.8 billion of common shares and redeeming $1.5 billion of preferred shares, while also investing $6.2 billion back into the business.\nNext, I'll comment on our operational excellence in 2023. Last year, our production in our global oil and gas business exceeded the midpoint of our original full year production guidance by 43,000 BOE per day. This was driven by record new well productivity rates across our domestic assets in the Delaware, Midland and DJ Basins, and internationally by record production from Block 9 in Oman, and in addition, we safely completed the expansion of the Al Hosn plant in the UAE, which also delivered record annual production.\nDespite negative price revisions, well performance across our portfolio enabled us to achieve an all-in reserve replacement ratio of 137% in 2023, and a 3-year average ratio of 183%. Our track record from prior years of consistently replacing produced barrels continues and added F&D cost that is below our current DD&A rate. At these year-end 2023 worldwide proved reserves increased to 4.0 billion BOE from 3.8 billion BOE in 2022.\nOxyChem performed exceptionally well in 2023. It exceeded guidance and achieved $1.5 billion in pretax income for the third time in its history, due largely to lower energy costs and an efficient planned turnaround at our Ingleside plant, even as product markets soften compared to 2022. In addition, construction on STRATOS, our first direct air capture facility, is progressing on schedule to be commercially operational in mid-2025.\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 was an exciting way to conclude a successful year. In oil and gas, we delivered our highest quarterly production in over 3 years, and outperformed the midpoint of our production guidance despite a third-party interruption in the Gulf of Mexico. Our Rockies business outperformed in the fourth quarter, that's consistent with its year-long trends. Innovative artificial lift technology continued to maximize base production. Well design optimization in the DJ Basin that we presented in our second quarter earnings call contributed to a 32% productivity improvement from 2022. We also continued to deliver robust well performance in the Permian Basin, where our Delaware teams drove results to the high end of the Permian's fourth quarter production guidance. Our top spot well, which we also discussed in our second quarter earnings call, continued its strong performance trajectory and delivered the highest 6-month cumulative production of any horizontal well ever in the New Mexico Delaware Basin. In fact, Oxy has drilled 8 of the top 10 horizontal wells of all time across the entire Delaware based on this production metric, and 3 of those wells came online last year.\nSince mid-2022, our teams outperformed the Delaware Basin industry average 12-month cumulative oil production by nearly 50%. Our team aims to extend our leadership in the New Mexico Delaware Basin this year.\nA significant portion of the 2024 Delaware program will develop the same horizon as the record top spot well. Further south in the Texas Delaware Basin, our teams continue to deliver success with a couple of notable appraisal wells in the Second Bone Spring and Third Bone Spring line. These wells drove incredibly early time volumes, and accordingly, we secured additional capital in our 2024 Delaware program. Our appraisal programs are positioning us us for success by adding horizons in the Delaware Basin and moving Tier 2 and Tier 3 wells to Tier 1. But we're also improving our current Tier 1 intervals, for example, with our top spot well.\nOutside the Delaware Basin, we're also making strides in some of the basins that we expect will begin to play a more consequential role. In the Midland Basin, technical excellence, including the basin-leading Barnett wells, drove a 1-year cumulative improvement in well productivity of over 30% compared to the prior year. In the Powder River Basin, Oxy [indiscernible] state initial production and early cumulative production pad record of 1.5 million barrels of oil produced in only about 7 months.\nAs we highlighted, our unconventional technical teams continue to expand and improve inventory across all of U.S. onshore basins. While our subsurface modeling, innovative well designs and enhanced artificial lift technology have driven improvements in well recovery, new well designs have also resulted in record drilling times for both 2- and 3-mile Texas Delaware Basin laterals. And Similarly, in the Powder River Basin, our teams drilled an average 1,650 feet per day, and we drilled a 10,000-foot well in only 11 days, both achieving Oxy basin records.\nOur successes are not limited to our onshore U.S. portfolio. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are continuing to leverage technology to drive even stronger production results. In our subsea pumping system on the K2 field achieved first lift 4 months ahead of schedule. This is Oxy's first deployment of this technology in deepwater. We expect to unlock future production enhancement opportunities and longer distance subsea tiebacks.\nNext, I'll shift to discussing how we advanced our strategy last year. In 2023, we high-graded our oil and gas portfolio, launched the expansion of our OxyChem [indiscernible] facility and announced strategic commercial transactions that we expect will deliver sustainable multiyear value to our shareholders. These steps strengthened our portfolio and make it unique in our industry. We have high-quality, short-cycle, high-return oil and gas shale development in the U.S. along with conventional lower decline oil and gas development in Permian EOR, Megan, Oman, Algeria and Abu Dhabi. These developments are complemented by our strong and stable cash flow from our chemicals business and the cash flow and carbon reduction we expect our low carbon ventures to provide in the future.\nIn addition to high grading our oil and gas portfolio through organic development and appraisal work last year, we also announced the strategic acquisition of Crown Rock, which will add high-margin, low-breakeven inventory, while increasing free cash flow per diluted share. The incremental cash flow will support our cash flow priority of delivering a sustainable and growing dividend, along with deleveraging and share repurchases after reducing the principal debt to $15 billion.\nWe are working constructively with the FTC in its review of the transaction and expect to receive regulatory approval and close in the second half of this year. The capital plan we will review in a moment excludes Crowd Rock because we'll continue to operate as to 2 separate companies until we obtain regulatory approval and close the acquisition. In our LCV business, we completed many pivotal transactions that provided technology advancement, third-party capital, revenue certainty and commercial optionality. We closed the acquisition of direct air capture technology [indiscernible] carbon engineering last quarter. This was a landmark achievement in our direct air capture development path. We're excited also about our [indiscernible] venture with BlackRock, which we believe demonstrates the DAC is becoming an investable asset for world-class financial institutions.\nIn addition, our teams signed on several more flagship carbon dioxide renewable credit customers.\nNow I'd like to reiterate our cash flow priorities and discuss our capital plans for 2024. On our December call, we discussed how we will focus on our cash flow and shareholder return priorities in 2024 on dividend growth, debt reduction and the capital allocation program that generates strong free cash flow throughout the commodity cycle. As we discussed regarding CrownRock, we intend to complete at least $4.5 billion in debt repayments for both pro forma cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture program. We intend to prioritize debt reduction until we achieve a principal debt balance of $15 billion or below, including repaying debt as it matures.\nAs a result of the acquisition, we expect to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our resilience and lower commodity price environments and free up cash from interest payments to support future sustainable dividend growth and share repurchases. Every year, we designed our capital plan to support our strategic initiatives via projects that maximize our returns and best position Oxy to deliver long-term and resilient returns to our shareholders.\nOur 2024 capital plan continues a bifurcated investment approach that balances short-cycle, high-margin investments with measured longer-cycle cash flow growth investments. In 2024, we plan to invest $5.8 billion to $6 billion in our Energy and Chemicals businesses, resulting in slightly less capital for our unconventional assets this year. However, we expect our unconventional assets to return more cash to the business, and we continue to expect year-over-year production growth and continued success across our premier unconventional portfolio, including some of the emerging horizons.\nWe intend to complement our unconventional exposure with increases to our mid-cycle investments, including lower decline conventional reservoirs, which are expected to drive longer cycle cash flow resiliency. Our 2024 mid-cycle capital investments will position us to continue the exciting projects that we started last year.\nInvestments in OxyChem are expected to increase this year as progress continues on the battleground expansion and the plant enhancement project. We also added a second drillship in the Gulf of Mexico to support what we believe could become a future growth asset for Oxy. Lower decline oil production from our enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, is an important part of our long-term strategy. This year, we're investing in gas processing expansions for our Permian EOR business that supports longer-term growth in many of our core CO2 [indiscernible]. Our EOR business will continue to be a key part of our future oil and gas development as we believe that carbon dioxide captured by direct air capture facilities is a sustainable way to develop the 2 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil remaining in our Permian EOR operations.\nIn our emerging low-carbon businesses, much of Oxy's planned $600 million 2024 investment will be directed to STRATOS. We have also allocated capital to continue preparations for a second direct air capture and sequestration [indiscernible] in South Texas, along with subsurface and well permitting investments needed at our Gulf Coast sequestration hubs. Capital received from financial partners for our LCV businesses will add to our $600 million investment. This includes capital contributions from our joint venture partner, BlackRock, for STRATOS. BlackRock investment totaled $100 million in 2023, and we expect that figure will increase in 2024.\nWe're making great progress towards advancing our net zero pathway as we develop direct air capture and other exciting technologies. We see tremendous potential in LCV to increase Oxy's cash flow resilience and generate solid long-term returns for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sunil for a review of our fourth quarter financial results and 2021 guidance.\n\nSunil Mathew\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vicki. I will begin today by reviewing our fourth quarter results. We announced an adjusted profit of $0.74 per diluted share, and a reported profit of $1.08 per diluted share, with the difference between adjusted and reported profit primarily driven by the after-tax fair value gain related to the acquisition of Carbon Engineering. Our teams exceeded the midpoint of guidance across all 3 business segments during the fourth quarter, and we delivered outstanding operational performance. Higher-than-expected production in our domestic onshore and international assets enabled us to overcome production losses caused by an unplanned third-party outage in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.\nThis outage led to a lower-than-expected company-wide oil cut and a higher-than-anticipated domestic operating cost per BOE. It is also expected to impact production into early next month and is reflected in the guidance that I will soon cover. We had a positive working capital change, primarily due to receipt of the environmental remediation settlement, timing of semiannual interest payments on debt and decreases in commodity prices.\nWe exited the quarter with over $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash.\nTurning now to guidance. Last month, Oxy and Crown Rock each received a request from the FTC for additional information related to the acquisition. The FTC's request for additional information will impact the timing of closing, which we expect to occur in the second half of the year. Oxy will receive the benefit of Crown Rock's activity between the January 1, 2024 transaction effective date and close, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.\nAdditionally, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, funding of the fully committed 4.7 billion term loans and termination of the existing bridge loan facility are expected to be aligned with the transactions closing.\nIn 2024, we expect full year production to average 1.25 million BOE per day, representing low single-digit growth from 2023, with the Rockies and Al Hosn driving production growth. As Vicki mentioned, well design and operational expertise drove production outperformance in the Rockies last year. We anticipate that these results will continue in 2024 with a steadier run rate of wells coming online compared to the first quarter of last year when we have recently ramped up rig activity.\nPermian production is expected to remain largely flat, with Permian unconventional capital decreasing by approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Internationally, we anticipate continued higher production at Al Hosn following last year's plant expansion.\nTotal company production guidance in the first quarter reflects a low point for 2024, with a significant step-up expected in the remainder of the year. The expected first quarter decrease in production is primarily driven by the relatively lower activity levels and working interest in the Permian Basin in last year's fourth quarter. January winter storm impacts of approximately 8,000 BOE per day in our domestic onshore assets, annual plant maintenance at Dalton and the Gulf of Mexico unplanned downtime event. Domestic operating costs on a BOE basis in 2024 are expected to decrease due to reduced maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and improved lifting costs in the DJ Basin.\nMoving on to Chemicals. In 2023, OxyChem generated pretax income nearly matching its second highest year ever. This year, we are guiding to a midpoint of $1.1 billion of pretax income. This year's full year guidance is close to the fourth best year ever for the Chemicals segment despite potential challenging market conditions. We expect that our first quarter OxyChem results will be largely flat from the prior quarter. Our guidance for Q1 reflects the combination of PVC price erosion, largely associated with contract adjustments in Q4, typical seasonal subdued demand in both PVC and caustic and export pricing pressure on caustic from China. Our guidance assumes that in Q1, we have reached the bottom of the cycle with more stabilized prices.\nI would like to close today by looking beyond 2024 to highlight several catalysts that we expect will enhance our financial trajectory in the coming years. Our midstream business is well positioned to benefit from a reduction in crude oil and transportation rates from the Permian to the Gulf Coast by the end of the third quarter of 2025. We expect annualized savings from these rate reductions of $300 million to $400 million, with approximately 40% of the savings starting in 2025 and the full annual savings anticipated in 2026. The OxyChem battleground at plant enhancement projects are expected to generate incremental benefits to EBITDA of $300 million to $400 million per year once complete.\nIn combination, these improvements to midstream and chemicals are expected to deliver an incremental annualized run rate EBITDA of $600 million to $800 million. As Vicki discussed, we also expect the planned mid-cycle investments in our conventional Gulf of Mexico and Permian EOR assets to provide cash flow resiliency through lower decline conventional production.\nAs we continue to execute on high grading our premier portfolio, we are committed to meeting our deleveraging targets that I outlined in December. We believe that our strengthened balance sheet and Oxy's premium portfolio will enable future increases to our common dividend and rebalance enterprise value in favor of our common shareholders. Our teams are focused on extending Oxy's track record of operational excellence and solid execution on our path to delivering, growing and sustainable shareholder returns over the long term.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Sunil. 2023 was a significant year for Oxy on both operational and commercial fronts. Our teams skillfully navigated through the dynamics, and I want to recognize our employee's ingenuity and hard work, their efforts generated the exciting achievements we covered today as well as the great progress that is underway to position us for a successful 2024. With that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Jordan mentioned earlier that Richard Jackson and Ken Dillon are also on the call, and they will participate in the Q&A session. We'll now take your calls."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Neil Backhouse, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNeil S. Backhouse\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Jackson, President Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management; Rob Peterson, Executive Vice President, Essential Chemistry; Ken Dillon, Senior Vice President and President, International Oil and Gas Operations; and Mike Avery, President and General Manager of 1PointFive.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made all this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Neil, and good afternoon, everyone. The team and I would like to discuss 2 key topics today. First, how our portfolio of assets managed by excellence teams once again drove record performance this quarter which flowed to the bottom line. And second, as we promised an update on 1PointFive and Direct Air Capture, which we expect to play an increasingly important role in our portfolio over time.\nOne important note before we begin, Rob Peterson, Executive VP of Essential Chemistry will cover our financial results and guidance today. Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer, Sunil Matthew, is unfortunately attending to a family emergency. We send our thoughts and prayers to Sunil and his family.\nI'll begin by reviewing our third quarter performance. Our teams again performed exceptionally well with our assets this quarter and delivered strongest earnings and cash flow from operations that we've had to date this year. This positions us to further advance our shareholder return framework and established a strong trajectory for the fourth quarter. Let's follow the molecules from producing oil and gas to moving and marketing it to where it is most valued to our Occidental team making the products that the world needs to improve lives and finally, returning the molecules back underground as we capture emissions and sequester them forever.\nFirst, let's review the exceptional results in Oil and Gas. Strong third quarter operational performance in oil and gas production exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by 34,000 BOE per day, enabling us to increase full year production guidance by 11,000 BOE per day. Our third production guidance increase this year. Production outperformance was driven by strong [indiscernible] performance in the DJ and Delaware Basins as well as higher uptime due to favorable operating conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Permian and Rockies, our high-quality inventory, combined with our team's subsurface expertise continued to drive record cumulative well performance improvements. This exceptional well performance and our activity plans for the remainder of the year drove our full year production guidance increase.\nIn the third quarter, our Delaware operations team set a record with a continuous pumping time of over 88 hours, doubling the previous and at that time, audacious record in the second quarter. Our teams are hyper-focused and diligent. Advancements are continuing to drive high performance.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter in the DJ Basin, we began deploying a new and innovative natural gas hybrid frac pump with Liberty Energy. We believe that [indiscernible] this forward-looking technology, which is in the e-frac alternative will reduce completion costs over time as well as emissions. Our midstream business performed better than expected due to the timing of cargo sales amidst rising commodity prices.\nAnd finally, to OxyChem, which exceeded earnings guidance for the quarter, largely due to improved PVC and caustic soda export demand. I can't say it enough, OxyChem provides so much synergy and cash flow generation to our portfolio. And as you'll hear, [indiscernible] a large role in our Direct Air Capture story.\nDuring the third quarter, we repurchased $600 million common shares and have now completed 60% of our $3 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases and our dividend enabled additional redemptions of the preferred equity. We have now redeemed over 15% of the preferred equity outstanding.\nNow I'd like to turn to the second big topic for our call, an update on the progress that our subsidiary is experiencing with Direct Air Capture or DAC. The DAC technology we are using leverages the skills and expertise of our chemicals business and our enhanced oil recovery business. Our team's achievements in DAC will drive benefits to Oxy in 3 ways. First, it will advance DAC for commercial use. Second, it will increase Oxy's low resilience and generate solid returns to our shareholders over the long term. And third, it will broaden our pathway to carbon neutrality and help others to achieve the same.\nSome of the team's recent achievements include the agreement we announced last night with BlackRock as a partner in our first DAC plant, STRATOS. This is a huge signal to the marketplace that we are attracting capital as well as customers to this exciting technology. We are very happy to have BlackRock as our partner.\nOur team also reached a memorandum of understanding with our long-standing partner, ADNOC, to explore opportunities with DAC and carbon dioxide sequestration hubs in the U.S. and the UAE. And in just 8 weeks, we announced our first initiative together, a preliminary engineering study with ADNOC for a [indiscernible] scale DAC facility and the UAE.\nAnd shortly after the second quarter earnings call, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it has selected 1PointFive to receive the [indiscernible] development of our South Texas DAC Hub. And just this morning, Oxy Oman announced an agreement with [ OQ Gas Networks ], the sole transport of natural gas in Oman and jointly study potential carbon capture utilization and sequestration projects in this [indiscernible].\nI'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will delve deeper into the momentum and progression of the carbon dioxide removal market and our DAC development plans.\n\nRichard A. Jackson\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Vicki. Today, I'm glad to provide a business update focused on Direct Air Capture and the carbon dioxide removal credit market. I also want to reiterate Vicki's comments on how thankful we are to welcome BlackRock as our initial investment partner for STRATOS, our first DAC facility. This is the most recent milestone in our DAC development strategy and is aligned with our execution approach, which we will discuss today.\nAcross [indiscernible], we are determined to solve challenges to both improve our business and provide essential resources for the world. Our low carbon business is an expansion of that strategy, and it's positioned to be a key value differentiator for Oxy in emerging markets.\nI will begin by highlighting several of our key DAC related accomplishments. As we advanced our local [indiscernible] business strategy, Direct Air Capture was recognized as both a necessary and valuable technology. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere provides a required solution for businesses across hard to abate emissions sectors. Near term, we believe our DAC technology can provide carbon dioxide removal credits or CDRs at a lower cost and a larger scale than other product solutions especially for businesses in the heavy-duty transportation sector that are working to hit decarbonization targets this decade. Longer term, cost-effective access to [ atmospheric ] CO2 to create innovative new fuels or other products can provide [indiscernible] to lower carbon materials and commodities for many industries.\nFrom strategy to development, our team has been forward-thinking and deliberate with a road map to advance technology, partnerships and markets. We continue to view technology [indiscernible] commercial product with the wins of capabilities, scale and systems thinking. In the case of DAC, we believe carbon engineering created a unique and innovative large-scale carbon removal process that has a strong fit to our OxyChem capabilities. This process uses equipment and materials that are ready to deploy at scale. Additionally, capturing large volumes of cost-effective CO2 improves Oxy's larger integrated oil and gas, CCUS and low-carbon businesses for today and tomorrow.\nEarly team work with carbon engineering led to a more advanced innovation center at [ CE ] and the U.S. development partnership with an exclusive license for Oxy. The formation of 1PointFive followed to allow more partnerships focused on market development for CDRs.\nCarbon removals reached critical momentum, both through early voluntary market leaders like Airbus purchasing CDRs and through new policy support measures by the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act [indiscernible] catalyze early commercial development for technologies, including DAC. This progress was recognized worldwide and enabled new global development and CDR demand scenarios for 1PointFive to begin to take shape. Meanwhile, measurable project progress was being made with CE process innovations, the groundbreaking for STRATOS, our DAC [indiscernible] plant, and with key zero emission power and emissions measurement actions to support a durable and a well-defined CDR product.\nOur DAC development took another step forward through the partnership with the King Ranch, that enables a 30 mega ton hub in South Texas, both to improve future DAC costs and to provide a more certain supply of CDRs for an increasing demand. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $3.5 billion regional Direct Air Capture hubs program. In August of this year, we were notified that $1.5 million was selected by the DOE for a program grant to develop our second DAC in the South Texas Hub. This follows strong [indiscernible] policy momentum over the last several years for CCUS through U.S. 45Q tax credit enhancements including specific recognition for the role of carbon removals in the recent inflation Reduction Act.\nRecently, we've seen major project momentum with ADNOC support for the UAE DAC development, especially BlackRock's key investment in STRATOS, which bolsters our ability both to build and capitalize our plans. Further support comes from recent CDR purchase agreements with ANA, a key aviation partner [indiscernible], which purchased 250,000 metric tons of carbon removals and with TD Bank Group with one of the largest purchases of CDRs by financial institution. These further showcase the growing appreciation for the necessity of CDRs from leaders in core industry sectors and the need to scale them in the near term.\nFinally, the acquisition of carbon engineering comes at a time where the need to accelerate DAC innovation is critical. We were excited to fully support CE as they advance DAC technology while also rapidly integrating next generation of innovations into our DAC plant builds. This helps [indiscernible] we maximize value across our partnerships and supports our ability to meet this growing CDR demand.\nOur DAC strategy has been visionary and deliberate on investment with advancements with technology, partnerships, policy and CDR markets. This approach has enabled Oxy to deploy capital responsibly while establishing leadership in this critical technology and growing CDR market.\nOur accomplishments to date have positioned us as a DAC technology and market leader. The next phase of our DAC strategy is focused on growth through accelerating cost reduction and expanding partnerships. With full ownership of carbon engineering technology now in-house, we expect to supplement and support the highly talented Carbon Engineering team to accelerate the innovations that ultimately reduce the cost to capture years earlier than initially anticipated by pairing the strengths of Carbon Engineering, Oxy major projects and OxyChem, we will continue to reduce cost for the life of the plant.\nEarly in [indiscernible] could reduce the cost of DAC include improvements to air contactor geometry where we believe we can materially reduce the number of air contactors per facility. We are also designing air contactor fan motors that consume less power. Additionally, our teams are leveraging OxyChem's electrochemical and core alkali expertise to evaluate advanced sorbents and improvements to chemical reaction rates that could increase DAC efficiency.\nOxy has a proven track record of innovation, improving operational efficiencies and large-scale project development, the application of the core competency will be key in the successful deployment of large-scale DAC.\nBoth the CDR demand [indiscernible] development opportunities continue to increase. By accelerating the cost reduction of DAC, we aim to provide a low-cost [indiscernible] supply of CDRs that we believe we can provide a cost-effective solution to help businesses achieve their climate [indiscernible] and improve the value proposition for DAC developers. We believe that DAC generated CDRs will play a significant role in corporate emissions reduction strategies and specifically for several hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and marine and markets like low carbon fuels.\nFuture regulatory and compliance frameworks that cap emissions growth are driving companies in certain sectors to purchase measurable and durable CDR credits like DAC CDRs. As we reduce the cost of DAC, [indiscernible] companies will increase the share of DAC CDRs in their portfolio of solutions.\nWe have included 3 market demand scenarios in our earnings presentation to illustrate how the DAC CDR market may grow rapidly through the end of this decade as the cost of capture is reduced. Reducing costs will enable us to offer CDRs to an expanding market at lower price points. In a scenario where the cost capture remains at $450 per ton, we still expect the market for generated CDRs to be significantly undersupplied. Demand for CDR credits from the aviation industry is expected to reach an inflection point in 2027 when the International Civil Aviation Organization begins requiring airlines to reduce or offset their annual emissions through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, also known as CORSIA.\nOperational improvements by airlines present limited opportunities for emissions reductions. We expect that emissions reductions from sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, will also be constrained as SAF demand is anticipated to exceed supply once CORSIA and other SAF mandates come into effect. While we recognize the importance of SAF and aviation's pathway to decarbonization, SAF remains a partial solution that is currently unable to reduce emissions to true net zero. Already DAC CDRs can be priced lower than SAF while also having the ability to scale, meet demand and deliver a true net zero solution. We expect DAC CDRs will be an essential cost-effective solution for several [indiscernible] industries to achieve targets within these compliance markets.\nThe pace at which we will develop DAC facilities will be driven by market demand and our ability to reduce costs. If the CDR market developed slower than expected, we will have the flexibility to refocus our efforts on R&D with the goal [indiscernible] bringing costs down faster. If the CDR market develops in line with the medium or high cases we've laid out, then we intend to continue executing on our cost down plan and to be positioned to secure development partners for capital. This capital flexibility becomes the most valuable at the CDR market growth in line with our high demand forecast.\nA high demand for DAC CDRs would likely shift our focus towards licensing DAC technology with other developers to increase CDR supply more rapidly. The CE acquisition helps unlock this development optionality as we can integrate our learnings into a DAC technology license. Regional development partners can then support the build-out with local knowledge, technical and operational resources and capital, while Oxy can support through a technical heavy but capital-light development approach.\nBased on our current plan, we anticipate that the LCV program capital, excluding third-party funding, will be up to $600 million per year through 2026.\nMoving on to the DAC 1 and 2 developments. We are again excited to announce BlackRock will invest $550 million in STRATOS for [ DAC ] facility through a fund managed by its diversified infrastructure business. BlackRock's investment demonstrates that DAC is becoming an investable asset class for world-class financial institutions. STRATOS construction is progressing well, and it's approximately 30% complete. Additionally, the ongoing work at the carbon engineering innovation center has already identified several promising opportunities to lower costs on future debt. We expect several of these ideas can be implemented into STRATOS to help demonstrate the improvements at scale and to be ready for future DAC builds.\nTo accommodate these process improvements, we are optimizing the construction schedule for the 2 process trains. This ensures STRATOS remains on schedule to be commercially operational in mid-2025, while also ensuring we are implementing the latest technical advancements earlier than previously planned. This may face some [indiscernible] capacity into 2026, but optimize our development plan and future costs.\nOur South Texas DAC Hub has commenced front-end engineering design and stratigraphic well testing is in progress. We are very appreciative of our recent selection for a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy and the meaningful work we are doing through that process. So the timing and the amount of the DOE grant are not yet known. We look forward to the final agreement and announcement of additional details.\nWe have continued to work within a framework of DAC investments [indiscernible] that will enable us to advance development while delivering returns for our shareholders and value to our customers and partners. We are focused on accelerating reduction and the cost to capture with expected to increase market demand for CDRs and in turn, attract additional development partners. These factors will drive future development pace of DAC and final investment decision of DAC 2.\nWe will also continue to advance collaboration with companies like BlackRock, ADNOC and Oman's OQ Gas Networks who share our long-term vision for Direct Air Capture and our broader low-carbon product ecosystem. Across it all, we appreciate these partnerships that are enabling this business for OxyChem and we are focused on delivery of this solution that can supply essential lower carbon products for the world.\nI will now turn the call over to Rob for our financial discussion.\n\nRobert Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Richard. We posted an adjusted profit of $1.18 per diluted share and a reported profit of $1.20 per diluted share. The difference between adjusted and reported earnings was primarily driven by gains on sales of noncore upstream assets partially offset by driven losses in the premium paid on preferred equity redemptions. During the third quarter, strong operational execution enabled us to generate over $1.7 billion of free cash flow before working capital, and we concluded the third quarter with over $7 million of unrestricted cash.\nWe experienced a modest negative working capital change during the period, partially driven by an increase in commodity prices. In October, we received $341 million in cash in the environmental remediation settlement we mentioned in the last earnings call.\nAs Vicki highlighted, each of our domestic assets exceeded the midpoint of third quarter production guidance including in the Gulf of Mexico, where favorable weather contributed to production exceeding the high end of guidance and a higher-than-expected company-wide oil cut. [indiscernible] outperformance, coupled with a portion of Gulf of Mexico planned maintenance moving into the fourth quarter, resulting in better-than-expected domestic operating expenses of $10.20 per BOE for the third quarter.\nCapital spending in the third quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, representing a slight decrease from the second quarter. We further advanced our shareholder return framework during the third quarter through the repurchase of $600 million of common shares, including $175 million, which settled at the start of the fourth quarter. Additionally, we have now redeemed over 15% equity with $342 million referred to equity redemptions triggered and redeemed during the third quarter. As of November 7, rolling 12-month common shareholder distributions totaled $3.12 falling below the $4 preferred equity reduction trigger. It is unlikely that cumulative distributions to common shareholders will be above the $4 per share trigger again this year primarily due to the concentration of share repurchases in the second half of 2022. However, we remain committed to the per share earnings and cash flow accretion benefits derived from our share repurchase program, and we intend to continue repurchasing shares at a pace that is largely driven by commodity prices.\nAs Vicki mentioned, we are raising our full year production guidance through our outperformance in the third quarter. We are guiding to 1.226 million BOE per day in the fourth quarter, our highest quarterly production for the year despite hailstorms on Delaware Basin that caused power [ interruptions ] early in October. The damage for these Permian storms and Gulf of Mexico maintenance are expected [indiscernible] result in the fourth quarter domestic operating costs of approximately [indiscernible] per BOE.\nFourth quarter OxyChem guidance reflects typical seasonality as well as the impact of a planned turnaround at our Ingleside [indiscernible] and [ DCM ] plant. This turnaround was the first ever of the ethylene crakcer and the first total plant outage in the Ingleside complex in over a decade. We are beginning to see early indications that PVC and caustic soda prices may have bottomed. However, may not have full clarity on the fundamentals of the growth of the upcoming business cycle until early next year as challenges remain, including global macroeconomic uncertainty and demand impacts from rising interest rates.\nOur performance across our domestic businesses resulted in lower-than-anticipated corporate adjusted effective tax rate during the third quarter, which we expect a rebound of approximately 30% in the fourth quarter as a proportion of international [indiscernible] income increases during the period.\nMoving on to capital. Third quarter Permian capital spending was elevated as a result of program mix and activity optimization. In certain areas, we developed higher working interest projects than originally planned as we sought to balance OBO or operated by other production. Company-wide capital spending to date and planned spending in the fourth quarter are likely to result in full year spending at the higher end of our guidance range.\nOur teams are finalizing our 2024 capital plan, which we look forward to now on our next call following Board approval. Today, I would like to revisit several points from previous calls regarding our expected 2024 capital plan.\nIn the Upstream business, we expect similar domestic onshore activity levels to [indiscernible] on average to 2023. We all anticipate no material change in spending for our international assets. Additionally, we expect to run 2 drillships in the Gulf of Mexico next year as part of our mid-cycle investment program.\nOxyChem commenced work on the modernization expansion of [indiscernible] plant this year. As construction advances, we anticipate an incremental $100 million of capital spending starting in 2024 compared to 2023 guidance, [ increasing ] the battlegrounds to continue through 2025.\nTo summarize, the third quarter of 2023 represented a strong operational and financial quarter for Oxy. As we are near the conclusion of this year, we are preparing for 2024 with a continued focus on operational excellence and delivering on our shareholder term framework. We are pleased with the progress of the framework to date and in addition to retiring the debt that matures in 2024, we intend to continue prioritizing share repurchases in our use of cash flow. The timing of when we may exceed the [indiscernible] preferred equity instant trigger again, will be determined by the pace of our share repurchase program, which were largely driven by the macro [ environment ]. I look forward to next quarter's call where we expect to report on completing another strong year for Oxy.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Rob. As Richard explained earlier, we expect DAC to play a more important role in our premier and diverse portfolio of assets. We believe tremendous additional potential exists there.\nJoining us today for the Q&A session, as Neil had mentioned earlier, will be Ken Dillon, who is Senior VP and President of International Oil and Gas operations but also manages our major projects part of the -- of our business -- the major projects group. So he can answer questions with respect to the construction of the DAC. And Mike Avery, President, General Manager of 1PointFive, as was mentioned earlier. He will answer questions about the business aspects of how we're running and we'll run the DAC and some of the other projects surrounding 1PointFive.\nSo with that, I'll now turn the call over to the moderator for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Neil Backhouse, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNeil S. Backhouse\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Peterson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Neil, and good afternoon, everyone. There are 3 things I'd like to drive home today. First, our portfolio of assets continue to set the table for record results. Second, our teams outperformed last quarter's and last year's excellent operational metrics. And I want to make sure our investors see how that flows to the bottom line. Third, our strategic and operational improvements continue to support our ability to take actions to drive even better shareholder returns.\nI'll begin with the portfolio. We had the highest quality and most complementary assets that Oxy's ever had. They are a unique blend of short-cycle, high-return shale assets in the Permian and the Rockies along with lower decline, solid return conventional reservoirs in the Permian, GOM and our international assets. 60% of our oil and gas production is from shale reservoirs and 40% from conventional. More than 80% of our production is in the United States. The international oil and gas assets that we operate are in only 3 countries, Oman, Abu Dhabi and Algeria. Our worldwide full year 2023 production mix is expected to be approximately 53% oil, 22% NGLs and 25% gas and 70% of the gas is in the United States.\nOur conventional oil and gas sets, along with OxyChem provides support during low price cycles while the shale assets provide the opportunity for growth during moderate and high price cycles, and the flexibility to adjust activity levels quickly if needed. This combination of assets has generated record cash flows for Oxy over the last couple of years versus the cash flow generated by the portfolio that we previously had in a similar price environment from 2011 to 2014. The midstream business provides flow assurance and has done so with exceptional performance during catastrophes and emergencies. The low carbon ventures business will help Oxy and others decarbonized at scale in a way that provides incremental value to our shareholders. To summarize, we have a deep and diverse portfolio, providing the cash flow resilience and sustainability necessary to support our shareholder return framework throughout the commodity cycles.\nLet's shift now to operational excellence. Strong second quarter operational performance exceeded the midpoint of our production guidance by 42,000 BOE per day, enabling us to again raise full year production guidance. In the Rockies, outperformance was driven by improved base production and new well performance, along with higher-than-expected nonoperated volumes and the receipt of accumulated royalties. Our Rockies teams drilled 32% faster on a foot per day basis than they did in the first quarter. The team's diligent work set several new Oxy records, including company-wide record of drilling over 10,400 feet of lateral in only 24 hours. Just 10 years ago, it took the industry an average of 15 days to drill 10,400 feet.\nOur Permian production delivered higher operability and better-than-expected new well performance, particularly in our 2 new drilling space units in New Mexico, top spot in precious. Our Delaware completions team shattered Oxy's previous record for continuous frac pumping time by nearly 12 hours for a total of 40 hours and 49 minutes. Four years ago, the same job would have taken about 84 hours. 40 hours back then was unthinkable, but our teams have made this a reality. We expect that the efficiencies generated by advancements in drilling and completions pumping will result in lower cost and reduce time to market.\nOffshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we safely completed seasonal maintenance activities focused on asset integrity and longevity. Excluding the impact of this planned maintenance, we delivered higher base production and benefited from improved uptime performance across multiple platforms. Internationally, our teams continued to deliver strong results. The Al Hosn expansion came online 2 months earlier than planned. as a result of great teamwork with our partner, ADNOC. This means that together, we have now successfully expanded the plan in stages from 1 Bcf a day to 1.45 Bcf a day or a very small incremental capital investment.\nIn Oman Block 65, we drilled a near-field exploration well, which delivered 6,000 BOE per day and a 24-hour initial production test, and it is now on production to sales in less than a month from completion. This was our highest Oman initial production test in the decade, and we continue to show the benefits of our subsurface characterization techniques worldwide. We were awarded the block in 2019 and in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy, we are positive about opportunities in the country where we are the largest independent producer. OxyChem also outperformed during the second quarter due to greater-than-expected resilience in the price of caustic soda and reductions in feedstock prices. OxyChem is one of our valuable differentiators. It provides rich diversification to our high-quality asset portfolio by consistently generating quarterly free cash flow which provides a balance of our oil and gas business throughout the commodity cycle.\nNow I'd like to talk about how our focus on operational excellence is enhancing our portfolio and extending our sustainability to maximize near- and long-term shareholder returns. Oxy's wells are getting stronger and are supported by our deep inventory, which continues to get better. In the Permian, we have improved well productivity in 7 of the last 8 years. And with the application of our proprietary subsurface modeling, we're starting to see the same results in the DJ Basin, where improved well designs have delivered reserves at roughly 20% less cost. The improved well design has resulted in about 25% improvement in single well 12-month cumulative volumes over the last 5 years. And we are on pace to significantly exceed that rate in 2023.\nIn addition, our teams are continuing to advance our modeling expertise, which has led to upgrades of secondary benches to top-tier performers. This was the key for our 2,000 -- sorry, 212% U.S. organic reserves replacement ratio last year. Let me try to make that point again. Last year, because of these upgrades to our secondary benches to our top-tier benches, we were actually able to replace our production by 212% with reserve adds. Secondary bench upgrades are progressing in 2023. Overall, in 10 of the last 12 years, we have replaced 150 to 230% of our annual production. The only exceptions being in 2015 with a price downturn in 2020 with a pandemic.\nConverting lower-tier benches to top tier will further extend our ability to achieve high production replacement ratios. Not only are we adding more reserves than we are producing each year, we're adding the reserves at a finding and development cost that is lower than our current DD&A rate, which will drive DD&A down and earnings up. Our differentiated portfolio and the strong results delivered by our teams provided support for execution of our 2023 shareholder return framework. During the second quarter, we generated significant free cash flow, repurchased $425 million of common shares and have now completed approximately 40% of our $3 billion share repurchase program. Common share repurchases, along with our dividend enabled additional redemptions of the preferred equity. To date, we've redeemed approximately $1.2 billion of preferred equity.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert L. Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Vicky, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we posted an adjusted profit of $0.68 per diluted share on a reported profit of $0.63 per diluted share. Difference between our adjusted reported profit was primarily driven by impairments for undeveloped noncore acreage and deferred tax impacts from the Algeria production sharing contract or PSC renewal, partially offset by an environmental remediation settlement.\nIn the second quarter, strong operational execution enables to are over $1 billion of free cash flow for working capital despite planned maintenance activities across several of our oil and gas businesses. Following nearly $1 billion of preferred equity redemptions and premiums, $445 million of settled common share repurchases and approximately $350 million relate to LCVs investment net power, we concluded the second quarter of approximately $500 million of unrestricted cash. We experienced a positive working capital change during the second quarter primarily driven by reductions in commodity prices and fewer barrels in shipment over quarter-end. Interest payments on debt are generally paid semiannually in the first and third quarters, which also contributes to a positive second quarter working capital change.\nDuring the second quarter, we made our first U.S. federal cash tax payment this year of $210 million and state taxes of $64 million, which were netted out of working capital. We anticipate a similar federal cash taxes will be made in subsequent quarters this year, those state taxes are paid annually. Our second quarter effective tax rate increased from the prior quarter due to a modest change in our income jurisdictional mix. The proportion of international income, which is subject to a higher statutory tax rate grew during the second quarter. We are therefore guiding to a minimum adjusted effective tax rate of 31% for the third quarter as we expect our effective tax rate going forward will be more closely aligned with the second quarter rate.\nI will now turn to our third quarter and full year guidance. As Vicki just discussed, our technical and operational excellence continues to drive outperformance across our oil and gas businesses. This enables us to raise our full year production guidance midpoint to just over 1.2 million BOE per day in anticipation of a strong exit to the year. Rockies outperformance serves the largest catalyst to our full year production guidance raised and is also a primary driver of the slight change to our full year oil mix guidance. Reported production in Rockies is expected to reduce to its lowest point this year in the third quarter before beginning to grow in the fourth quarter.\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, we were guiding slightly lower production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to a contingency for seasonal weather. The third quarter weather contingency as well as planned maintenance opportunities brought forward to reduce oral downtime are expected to result in our highest domestic operating costs on a BOE basis this year when normalizing to less than $9.50 per BOE in the fourth quarter. Internationally, we expect higher production compared to the first half of 2023 due to plant turnaround and expansion project timing Al Hosn as well as impacts from various international production sharing contracts. As we have previously mentioned, the increased international production will be slightly offset by the new Algeria PSC, which decreased reported production, but the reduction in imported barrels is not expected to have a material impact on operating cash flow.\nOverall, the first half of 2023 was characterized strong production in Gulf of Mexico, Permian and Rockies, with latter 2 businesses also benefiting from nonrecurring production events. We have better anticipated wells and time-to-market momentum year-to-date, which we expect it to be benefiting from in the second half of the year, the third quarter will be the only quarter in the year where we production average is below 1.2 million BOE per day. Reduced production is mainly driven by the previously mentioned weather contingency implies to the Gulf of Mexico. The decrease in third quarter production will likely result in total company production is lower in the second half of the year when compared to the first However, the change in expected production does not represent a shift in our volume trajectory. We anticipate fourth quarter production will be similar to the first 2 quarters of 2023, and we expect to enter 2024 with a strong production cadence. Furthermore, our full year guidance implies our fourth quarter output of approximately 53%, largely due to improved GOM production [ asset ] the third weather contingency.\nShifting now to OxyChem. As anticipated in original guidance, we continued to see weakening in the PVC and caustic soda pricing during the second quarter. However, our full year guidance remains unchanged at a pretax income midpoint of $1.5 billion, which will represent our third highest pretax income ever in another strong year for OxyChem. We also expect our chemicals business to return to a more normalized seasonality compared to recent years, meaning that the fourth quarter will represent the lowest earnings for the year. As we have mentioned on previous calls, the fourth quarter is typically not a reliable roll forward for the year ahead through the inherent seasonality of the business. We revised our full year guidance from Misery and marketing due to expected market changes over the second half of this year. The margins generated by shipping crude from Midland to the U.S. Gulf Coast are expected to compress further following the annual FERC tariff revision, which has increased our pipe cost approximately $2.55 a barrel. Over the same period, the price we market long-haul capacity is expected to decrease. Additionally, we anticipate fewer gas market opportunities as spreads across multiple basins have continued to narrow and find opportunities generated in the first quarter. Also, pricing for sulfur produced a holding is expected to soften in the second half of the year.\nCapital spending during the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion. We expect capital to decrease slightly in the third quarter with a more pronounced reduction in the fourth quarter. The expected decrease was primarily driven by reduced working interest and gross activity in the Permian, which is in alignment with our original business plan. We anticipate receiving $350 million during the fourth quarter associated with the second quarter environment aviation settlement. While this settlement will drive our reported overhead down, our full year guidance to overhead expense on an adjusted basis remains unchanged.\nTurning now to shareholder returns. As Vicki mentioned, we further advanced our shareholder return framework during the second quarter through the repurchase of $425 million of common shares, which enabled additional preferred equity redemptions. After a strong start in the first quarter, we triggered the redemption of over $520 million of preferred equity in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we've been approximately $1.2 billion or 12% of preferred equity that was outstanding at the beginning of the year with 10% premium payments to the preferred equity holder of approximately $117 million. Preferred equity redemptions to date have resulted in elimination of over $93 million of annual preferred dividends. As of August 2, rolling 12-month common store distributions totaled $4.08 per share. due primarily to the concentration of share repurchase in the third quarter of 2022, coupled with the current commodity price curve, it is likely that the cumulative distributions will fall below the $4 per common share during the third quarter. If we drop below the $4 redemption trigger, our ability to begin redeeming the preferred equity, again, will heavily be influenced by commodity prices. The EPI prices would likely need to be higher than what the forward curve presently indicates for us to remain above the trigger for the remainder of 2023.\nEven if we aren't able to continue redeeming the preferred equity for a period of time, we remain committed to our shareholder term program, including our $3 billion share purchase program. Our basic common share count is at the lowest since the third quarter of 2019, resulting in per share earnings and cash flow accretion to our common shareholders. Sustained efforts to significantly deleverage over the past several years have improved our credit profile, culminating a return to investment-grade status when the Fitch ratings upgraded Oxy in May. We believe that our investment grade credit range reflect our exceptional operations, diversify the high-quality asset portfolio and our commitment to pay down debt as a mature. Our second quarter results and our full year guidance demonstrates solid progression towards another strong year for Oxy. We look forward to reporting on additional progress in the year advances.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Rob. Before closing today, we'd like to briefly mention 2 low carbon ventures announcements that we made this week. We were glad to announce that Japan's ANA Airlines became the first airline in the world to sign a carbon dioxide removal credit purchase agreement from our subsidiary, 1.5. We're excited about that and happy to work with them. We're also pleased to announce a first-of-its-kind agreement with our long-standing partners, ADNOC, to evaluate investment opportunities in director capture and carbon dioxide sequestration hubs in the U.S. and the UAE. With this agreement, we intend to develop a carbon management platform that will accelerate our shared net zero goals. We have many exciting developments taking place in LCV, and we look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update towards the end of this year.\nWith that, we will now open the call for questions."

Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Neil, and good afternoon, everyone. The operational and financial successes we achieved last year continued into 2023 as I will detail in our first quarter call. Our operational excellence and disciplined approach to capital spending enabled us to meaningfully progress our shareholder return framework. Our continued efforts to strengthen our balance sheet culminated in regaining an investment-grade credit rating from Moody's.\nThis afternoon, I will begin by covering our first quarter performance, followed by an update on several accomplishments in our oil and gas business. In light of recent market volatility, I will then go over the cash flow priorities established during our last call and highlight the progress made in transferring enterprise value to our common shareholders. Then Rob will detail the commencement and status of the preferred equity redemption before covering our financial results and guidance, including an increase to full year oil and gas production and an OxyChem pretax earnings.\nOur operational success even in the first quarter's lower commodity price environment enabled us to generate approximately $1.7 billion of free cash flow before working capital. Excess cash was primarily allocated towards approximately $750 million of common share repurchases in the quarter, accounting for over 25% of our $3 billion share repurchase program and triggering the redemption of nearly $650 million of preferred equity.\nOperationally, we exceeded our production guidance midpoint by approximately 40,000 BOE per day following a prolific first quarter across our premier asset portfolio. In the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved our highest quarterly production in over a decade. This outperformance was partially driven by higher uptime in the Horn Mountain and the outperformance following the successful Caesar Togo Subsea system expansion project, which was completed in December.\nOur Permian production benefited from strong new well performance and higher operability primarily in the Texas Delaware. In the Rockies, strong base and new well performance, and higher operated by other volumes in the DJ Basin resulted in higher-than-expected production. Internationally, our businesses performed well. Most notably, the Al Hosn gas expansion project is ahead of schedule because of the team's ability to integrate expansion work with annual turnarounds. The production ramp-up has commenced earlier than anticipated and has already led to a daily production record. These achievements demonstrate how our high-quality assets and talented teams provide the strongest foundation for free cash flow generation in Oxy's history.\nOur global oil and gas teams continue to perform exceptionally well in the first quarter, achieving several milestones and accomplishments. Domestically, in our onshore unconventional businesses, we delivered strong well performance and established new operational records in the Rockies and Permian. Our Rockies team drilled the industry's longest DJ Basin well ever at over 25,000 feet in just 8 days. This well also set a new lateral length record for Oxy at over 18,000 feet. In addition, we delivered a single well production record in the DJ Basin by utilizing a new well design. We plan to roll out this enhanced design as we further develop our inventory across the DJ Basin.\nIn the Permian, our Delaware subsurface teams continued to optimize and unlock inventory, as demonstrated by success in the deeper Wolfcamp horizon, with a single well generating 30-day initial production rate of 6,500 BOE per day and an Oxy record for this interval.\nOur Delaware completions team also achieved a continuous pumping time of approximately 28 hours on another set of wells, far exceeding our previous record of about 22.5 hours. We expect that increasing efficiencies such as faster completions pumping will contribute to lower cost and a faster time to market. Though certain products and services utilized in our operations will likely incur price increases this year compared to 2022, we are seeing some early signs of tempered inflation. Our teams are working towards partially offsetting inflation impacts through various operational efficiencies and supply chain competencies. For example, in the Delaware Basin, we've optimized frac designs to reduce assets and water utilization for an average savings of around $240,000 per well. Our Rockies team has successfully integrated artificial intelligence into our [indiscernible] program, helping to maximize base production and reduce operating costs.\nOn a broader scale, our supply chain team is continuously pursuing opportunities to manage pricing across our business portfolio through partnerships that thoughtfully balance contractual flexibility with cost management. These capabilities are more important than ever in the current inflationary environment as we strive to continuously deliver value to our shareholders.\nWith these points in mind, I will now review our 2023 cash flow priorities.\nAs we discussed last quarter, our 2023 cash flow priorities incorporate a disciplined capital strategy largely agnostic to the short-term volatility exhibited in commodity prices this year. Our 2023 capital plan remains on track and focused on sustaining our high-quality portfolio of assets, while securing our long-term cash flow resilience. We continuously monitor the macroeconomic landscape and intend to maintain our capital plan in the current environment. Should a sustained downturn in commodity prices occur, we possess the flexibility to rapidly reduce activity levels through our short-cycle, low-breakeven projects. We demonstrated our nimble approach during the last global downturn, and we are prepared to do so again should market conditions dictate.\nIf oil prices follow an upward trajectory, we do not expect notable changes to our cash flow priorities, though the pace of our share repurchase program and the preferred equity redemption may be accelerated.\nWe have previously spoken about how potential future production growth is expected to be in the low single digits. However, we have many opportunities to grow cash flow outside of production growth. We anticipate that the mid-cycle investments we are making this year will result in meaningful contributions to our future cash flow. For example, our new OxyChem projects are expected to contribute $300 million to $400 million in incremental annual EBITDA, with benefits expected to start in late 2023 and full project benefits expected in early 2026.\nAdditionally, near-term investments in our low-carbon debentures businesses are expected to enable the commercialization of exciting decarbonization technologies with the potential to generate cash flow detached from oil and gas price volatility. We believe that the combination of our low cash flow breakeven, high-return assets and emerging low-carbon businesses uniquely position us at the forefront of our industry to create value for our shareholders.\nValue creation for our common shareholders governs our cash flow priorities. The allocation of excess cash toward debt reduction over the past 2 years was key in positioning us to initiate the next phase of our shareholder return framework. Our balance sheet improvement efforts reduced interest and financing costs, which contributed to an increase in our sustainable and growing dividend and the completion of last year's share repurchase program.\nBuilding on this success, we've already completed over 1/4 of our current share repurchase program, enabling us to trigger the redemption of approximately $650 million of preferred equity in the first quarter.\nAs dictated by our 2023 cash flow priorities, we intend to continue allocating excess free cash flow towards share repurchases, which, in turn, may trigger additional preferred equity redemptions. We expect that these measures will be accretive to cash flow on a per share basis. In combination, we believe that these actions will further our goal of continued enterprise value rebalancing for our common shareholders and serve as a catalyst for future common equity appreciation.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert L. Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Vicky, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to begin today by highlighting our March credit rating upgrade and positive outlook for Moody's Investor Service. Gaining the Moody's investment grade rating is a significant milestone that acknowledges Oxy's recent financial transformation. continued redemption of preferred equity, combined with opportunistic debt reduction tells a compelling developing story that we hope will facilitate future upgrades. The execution of our cash flow priorities over the last several quarters enabled us to begin redeeming the preferred equity. We have redeemed or have given notice redeem approximately $647 million of preferred equity so far this year at a cost of approximately $712 million, including a 10% premium payment of close to $65 million.\nTo date, we have eliminated approximately $52 million of annual preferred dividend, while also transfer enterprise value to our common shareholders.\nDuring last quarter's call, we reviewed how the mandatory redemption of preferred equity is triggered when rolling 12-month common shareholder distributions reached a cumulative $4 per share. The preferred stock agreement requires at least a 30-day notice for each redemption. By the end of this week, all $647 million of preferred equity triggered for addition during the first quarter will be fully redeemed. As of May 9, we have distributed $4.57 per share to common shareholders over the rolling 12-month period. We intend to continue repurchasing common shares in part to remain above the $4 trigger per share for as long as we are able.\nWe recognize that staying above the $4 trigger will become more challenging in the latter half of this year due to the timing and pace of our prior share repurchase program. Our ability to remain above the $4 trigger will be heavily influenced by commodity prices. But even if we fall below the trigger, we plan to continue repurchasing common shares so that the distribution is required to surpass the trigger in future quarters are more evenly spread throughout the year.\nDuring a period where we may be below the $4 trigger, we may also seek to retire debt opportunistically, which would achieve a similar result of transferred enterprise value to common shareholders and further enhancing our credit profile.\nTurning now to our first quarter results. We posted an adjusted profit of $1.09 per diluted share and a reported profit of $1 per diluted share. The difference between our adjusted and reported profit for the quarter was primarily driven by the premium paid to redeem the preferred equity.\nWe concluded the first quarter with nearly $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash, but had not yet made payments to preferred equity holder as of March 31 due to the 30-day redemption notice requirement. However, the first quarter call on the preferred equity is reflected in our balance sheet as an accrued liability and will be captured in future cash flow statements as payments to the preferred equity holder made.\nDuring the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.7 billion of free cash flow before working capital, which was accomplished despite a lower commodity price environment as compared to prior quarter, lower domestic oil utilization as a cone and lower sales and production due to the quarter-end timing of cargo lipids in Algeria. We experienced a modestly negative working capital change during the period, which is typical for the first quarter, and was primarily driven by a similar annual [indiscernible] payments on our debt, annual property tax payments and payments under compensation and pension plans. These items, which are largely classified as accounts payable and accrued liabilities were partially offset by a net decrease in receivables, driven by lower commodity prices.\nWe see the potential for working capital partly reverse in the second quarter since many of these payments are made annually in the first quarter, but accrued throughout the year. As discussed in the last call, we expect to be a full U.S. federal cash taxpayer in 2023, which is reflected in our financials by the reduced deferred income tax provision and our cash flow statement compared to prior quarters.\nWe are pleased to update our full year guidance for oil and gas in OxyChem as a result of excellent first quarter performance in both businesses. Vicki reviewed many of the highlights in our oil and gas business that contributed to our production outperformance across our high-quality assets portfolio. These factors enabled us to surpass our first quarter guidance and some are expected to continue having positive impact on production throughout the year. Specifically, the acceleration of the Al Hosn gas expansion project and new well performance in our domestic onshore businesses are expected to yield higher production than originally planned. These positive results provided us with the confidence to increase our full year production guidance midpoint to 1.195 million BOE per day.\nLooking ahead, we anticipate that the second quarter production will be in the lowest of the year, primarily driven by the timing of domestic onshore activity and optimization of our maintenance schedule to reduce planned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. As discussed on our last call, we expected that the first quarter of 2023, will have the fewest wells come online in our U.S. onshore business all year. This proved to be the case at the Rockies and Permian unconventional businesses turned 6 and 53 wells to production, respectively, in the first quarter.\nIn the second quarter, we expect to [indiscernible] significantly higher number of wells on production the benefits of which will be fully realized in the second half of the year. [indiscernible] timing fluctuations are bringing wells online, and the resulting production impact are typically and primarily driven by the optimization of resources and pad development timing.\nInternationally, we expect production compared to prior first quarter -- we expect higher production compared to the first quarter as our annual scheduled turnarounds were completed and production [indiscernible] is ramping up. Increased international production will be slightly offset by the just finalized Algeria production sharing contract, which decreases reported production but is not expected to have a material impact on operating cash flow. We anticipate that our second quarter oil mix will reduce to approximately 52% due to lower oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and Algeria, compounded by increased gas production at Al Hosn. While our oil mix will be lower in the second quarter, we expect that it will rebound in the second half of the year and be more in line with our full year guidance once maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico is complete.\nMaintenance work and the associated lower volumes in the second quarter will also contribute to a domestic price operating cost increase of $9.85 per BOE before [indiscernible] on a BOE basis in the latter half of the year.\nIn summary, our impressive first quarter production and activity plans for the remainder of the year provide us with the confidence to raise full year production guidance despite anticipated reduced production levels in the second quarter. OxyChem approximated guidance in the first quarter. Due to the seasonality of customers' [indiscernible] inventory orders, we anticipate the first half of the year reflects stronger results in the latter half of 2023. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, margins for OxyChem's [indiscernible] products remain robust, and lead us to expect another year of strong results, providing us with the confidence to raise OxyChem's 2023 pretax income guidance midpoint to $1.5 billion.\n[indiscernible] generated pretax income of $35 million in the first quarter, following within our guidance range. First quarter results were primarily impacted by the timing of crude oil sales as well as favorable gas margins due to transportation capacity optimization in the marketing business. These items were partially offset by lower equity method investment from income from West.\nCapital spending in the quarter approximately $1.5 billion and close to 25% of our 2023 capital plan, which remains at $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion. We expect higher capital spending in the second quarter compared to the first due to development timing in Rockies and Permian and advancement of the OxyChem better ground modernization and expansion project. We also anticipate that capital spending in the third and fourth quarters will be below the second quarter and in line with full year guidance.\nOverall, the first quarter represents an excellent start to 2023. As we look ahead in the rest of the year, we are favorably positioned to execute on our cash flow priorities and advance our shareholder return framework. We aim to continue shifting our capital structure in favor of our common shareholders in the near and long term.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corp.\n\nThank you, Rob. We're now ready for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Neil Backhouse, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNeil Backhouse\n\nVP of IR, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Rocco. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Peterson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon. We'll also reference a few non-GAAP financial measures today. Reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in the schedules to our earnings release and on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Neil, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I'll begin with highlights of our 2022 achievements, including an oil and gas update followed by our fourth quarter performance. Next, I'll discuss our 2023 cash flow priorities, our enhanced shareholder return framework and our 2023 capital plan. Rob will then provide an update on the status and mechanics of Oxy's preferred equity redemption before reviewing our fourth quarter financial results and 2023 guidance.\nIn 2022, our record net income of $12.5 billion, generated a return on capital employed of 28%, which is the highest return we have achieved since before 2005. We also delivered record free cash flow before working capital of $13.6 billion, which enabled us to retire more than $10.5 billion of debt and to repurchase $3 billion of common shares.\nOur return on capital employed was enhanced by exceptional performance as our team set multiple operational and productivity records across our U.S. onshore, Gulf of Mexico and International businesses. OxyChem generated record earnings and our Midstream business approximated guidance.\nAlso in 2022, our high-return Permian production grew by 90,000 BOE per day, propelled by outstanding well results. We delivered our best year ever in Delaware new well productivity, making 2022, the seventh year in a row that we were able to increase our average well productivity, as shown in our presentation's appendix on Slide 29. Our teams accomplished this by applying our proprietary service modeling and completion designs to our high-quality reservoirs.\nWell performance, along with our Oxy Drilling Dynamics and logistics efficiencies, enabled us to achieve reserves replacement ratio driven by our capital programs of over 140% at a cost of $6.60 per BOE, which was less than half of our current DD&A per barrel. With price revisions included, the total reserves replacement ratio was 172%, which increased our year-end 2022 reserves to approximately 3.8 billion BOE.\nExcept for the years of the price collapse in 2015 and the pandemic in 2020, we have replaced more than 100% of our production for at least the last 20 years. With the depth and quality of our shale well inventory and 2 billion barrels of remaining potential in our Permian enhanced oil recovery business, we have the scale to continue our history of reserves replacement. A deep inventory, along with our unique portfolio of short-cycle, high-return unconventional assets paired with low-decline conventional assets, OxyChem and our Midstream businesses, we have the capability for long-term sustainability and the flexibility to allocate capital to maximize returns for our shareholders.\nIn 2022, we also made significant progress in developing the capabilities and assets needed to secure a low-carbon future, which is the other key to our sustainability. We started site preparation on our first direct air capture plant and executed several exciting agreements to sell carbon dioxide removal credits to prospective purchasers in diverse industry sectors. We also secured over a quarter million acres of land or approximately 400 square miles to develop carbon sequestration hubs.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 was a fitting way to wrap up a year of continued operational and financial success. We generated over $2.6 billion of free cash flow, which supported nearly $1.6 billion of balance sheet improvements. We also repurchased $562 million of common shares in the quarter, completing our 2022 share repurchase program.\nIn our business segments, Oil & Gas approximated the midpoint of guidance, despite Winter Storm Elliott's impact. Outperformance from the Gulf of Mexico and Al Hosn partially offset storm impacts experienced in the Permian and Rockies. OxyChem exceeded guidance, driven by stronger-than-expected market dynamics, while Midstream and Marketing earnings were within guidance.\nIn December, Oxy participated in the recapitalization of NET Power. This is a technology that generates emission-free power generation and has the potential to accelerate emissions reduction efforts in our existing operations and to supply electricity to our direct air capture plants and sequestration hubs. Ultimately, NET Power could be an important emission-free power generator anywhere that has access to natural gas.\nAmong the records set in 2022 were lateral lengths in the Delaware Basin, DJ Basin, Oman, and most notably in the Midland Basin where our well Lulu 3641DP exceeded 18,000 feet to become our longest lateral on record. Remarkably, this well was drilled in slightly over 12 days. Milestones like this showcase our teams' focus on safely and efficiently expanding the boundaries of drilling technology.\nOur teams also achieved an Oxy Delaware Basin record for wedge productivity, averaging a 30-day initial production rate of over 3,000 BOE per day from all wells that came online in 2022. We believe that two of our wells in the 1st Bone Spring in New Mexico and six of our wells in the Barnett formation of the Midland Basin achieved initial 30-day production records amongst all operators in their respective formations.\nIn addition, we are continuing to consolidate acreage via trade that enable more capital-efficient, longer laterals, which help to optimize the required infrastructure. The longer laterals, exceptional well productivity and optimized infrastructure, partially offset inflation impacts in 2022, and we expect similar benefits as we progress through 2023.\nAfter highlighting two of our Gulf of Mexico assets, Horn Mountain and Caesar-Tonga on previous earnings calls, I'm pleased to announce another Oxy production record in our offshore operations. Our Lucius platform surpassed 150 million BOE of gross production in less than eight years from first oil, becoming the fastest Oxy-developed Gulf of Mexico platform to reach this milestone.\nInternationally, we, along with our partner, ADNOC, achieved record quarterly production at Al Hosn with 85,500 BOE per day net to Oxy. The Al Hosn expansion project is progressing well and remains on track for mid-2023 completion. We expect Oxy's Al Hosn net production to ultimately reach approximately 94,000 BOE per day.\nWe are pleased with the total value we've created for shareholders in 2022, including the debt reduction of $10.5 billion and the $3 billion of share repurchases, along with a successful capital program of $4.5 billion. With our debt from outstanding bonds down to less than $18 billion and consistent with our shareholder framework, we will shift our focus to share repurchases, dividend growth and a capital program that further strengthens our sustainability.\nOver the long-term, we intend to repay maturities and opportunistically retire debt to further reduce our cost structure and strengthen our balance sheet. In future years, we will seek to grow our cash flow and earnings to support increases of our dividend and the continuation of our share repurchase program. While we do intend to grow the absolute value of the company, as part of our value proposition, we also want to increase value per share for our shareholders through dividend growth and the reduction of outstanding shares.\nAccordingly, our Board of Directors authorized an over 38% increase in our common dividend and a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization, which will trigger a redemption of a portion of the preferred equity.\nFuture cash and earnings growth opportunities could come from our shale and conventional oil and gas assets as well as our chemicals business and ultimately, our low carbon ventures business.\nTurning now to 2023. Our business plan is designed to maximize return on capital and return of capital to our shareholders while also strengthening our future sustainability by prioritizing asset-enhancing investments to support the resilience of Oxy's future cash flows. These investments include $500 million for low decline mid-cycle projects, including the previously announced modernization and expansion of OxyChem's Battleground chlor-alkali plant and a new OxyChem plant enhancement along with Permian EOR and the Gulf of Mexico.\nOf the $500 million that I just mentioned, we plan to spend $350 million on OxyChem projects, which upon completion, we expect will generate a combined annual EBITDA of $300 million to $400 million. We expect the Battleground project to be online in early 2026. The other OxyChem plant enhancement will deliver higher production volumes, enhanced operational efficiency and improved logistics costs. We look forward to providing more detail about this project on a future call. The remainder of the $500 million will be spent in EOR and the Gulf of Mexico.\nEOR remains a core component of Oxy's asset portfolio and will be essential for our future strategy, so we are glad to return to sustaining capital investment levels this year. In the Gulf of Mexico, infrastructure projects, including subsea pumping initiatives to increase the tie-back radius and productivity of the existing platforms, will drive higher capital spending compared to recent years.\nWe're also focused on our high-return short-cycle businesses. Our return to a two-rig program in the DJ Basin late last year requires additional investment but should begin to moderate production decline by the middle of 2023.\nIn our Permian unconventional business, we intend to run an activity program similar to the second half of last year. Our Permian unconventional assets are best placed to deliver production growth to offset marginal declines elsewhere in our portfolio. Overall, 2023 Permian unconventional capital is expected to decline slightly from 2022 due to the initial capital inflow from the Delaware Basin JV.\nWe anticipate that inflation will continue to be a challenge for our industry this year. In 2023, we expect approximately 15% inflation impact on our domestic Oil & Gas business compared to 2022. As always, we will continue our efforts to reduce and offset inflation by leveraging our supply chain competencies and focusing on continued capital efficiency.\nAnother important aspect of sustainability is the carbon intensity of our operations and what we're doing to address it. We focus on reducing emissions every day as we progress our pathway to net zero, and we've made significant progress over the past few years. Since 2020, our emissions reductions projects have focused on capturing methane and reducing venting and flaring. These projects resulted in a 33% decrease in our estimated company-wide methane emissions from 2020 to 2021 and a 24% decrease in methane emissions intensity of our marketed gas production.\nWe were the first U.S. oil & gas company to endorse the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, and I'm pleased to announce that our U.S. Oil & Gas operations achieved Zero Routine Flaring eight years ahead of that target. That was a major achievement. Our international operations have implemented projects to significantly reduce routine flaring, and we're on track to meet the World Bank's target well ahead of 2030.\nIn 2023, we also intend to invest in several unique and compelling low-carbon business opportunities to advance our net zero pathway. Ongoing construction of our direct air capture facility in the Permian and the development of our large Gulf Coast sequestration hubs, including pore space certification, will be among our expected investments.\nWe anticipate that our first direct air capture, or DAC, plant will complete commissioning and begin to capture carbon in late 2024 and be commercially operational in mid-2025. This timing is a few months later than our original target as we navigate the current supply chain environment and focus on construction sequencing to support faster optimization and the application of new technologies and innovation.\nOur 2023 capital investment in these low-carbon businesses is expected to total $200 million to $600 million, subject to third-party funding optionality for the DAC and the timing of projects. We mentioned on our prior call that our net zero ambitions will require funding outside of Oxy's historical capital allocation program. However, we are prepared to fund our first DAC ourselves if utilizing our capital preserves the most value for our shareholders.\nOur capital plan includes investments in our carbon sequestration business, both through the development of the Gulf Coast hubs we previously announced and through drilling appraisal wells. Investments in other projects that reduce Oxy Scope 1 and 2 emissions will also continue.\nAs part of our strategy to develop Gulf Coast sequestration hubs, we're pleased to announce that we will be working with Energy Transfer Low-Carbon Development to build a pipeline network from point source emitters in the Lake Charles area to our Magnolia sequestration site in Allen Parish, Louisiana. This pipeline will support our point source carbon capture and sequestration business, which we intend to develop, along with our DACs, to help meet medium- and long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction goals for Oxy and our customers.\nBefore turning over to Rob, I want to reiterate that our 2023 capital plan focuses on projects that best position Oxy for long-term success. As in past years, we retained a high degree of flexibility, which allows us to adapt to commodity price fluctuations and reduce spending if necessary. Now I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert L. Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Vicki, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year, we repaid over $10.5 billion of debt and retired all remaining interest rate swaps strengthening our balance sheet and improving our credit metrics as we seek to regain investment-grade ratings. The completion of our $3 billion share repurchase program moved us closer to returning over $4 per share to our common shareholders, which will begin to trigger redemption of the preferred equity. Our vastly improved financial position, even compared to one year ago, enables us to begin allocating a greater proportion of excess free cash flow to our shareholders in 2023.\nToday, I'll begin by explaining where we are in terms of partially redeeming the preferred equity. I'll then detail the redemption mechanics in a scenario where the $4 trigger is met.\nA mandatory redemption of preferred equity is triggered when the rolling 12-month common shareholder distributions reach a cumulative $4 per share. This trigger is evaluated daily based on shares outstanding on the day capital is returned. As of today, we have distributed $3.78 per share, so an additional $0.22 per share is required to reach the $4 trigger.\nIn our presentation, we have included an illustrative example of a $100 million distribution to common shareholders after the $4 share trigger is reached. In conjunction with the common distribution, a $100 million mandatory matching distribution to Berkshire Hathaway will be made, of which $91 million will redeem preferred equity principal with a $9 million or 10% premium. In this example, Oxy would incur a $200 million total cash outlay. This process of mandatory redemption repeats as long as the per share trailing 12-month distribution to common shareholders is greater than $4. There is no limit to exceeding the $4 per share trigger through additional distributions to common shareholders. Consequently, even if the trailing 12-month distribution declines, additional distribution to common shareholders will still trigger partial preferred equity redemption.\nWe expect our refreshed share repurchase program to combine with our $0.18 per share quarterly dividend to enable us to exceed the $4 per share trigger to begin redeeming the preferred equity. While the magnitude and pace of the partial preferred redemption and resulting enterprise value rebalancing will ultimately be driven by commodity prices, we expect our shareholders to benefit in a similar way to the value created in 2022 through debt reduction.\nI'll now turn to our fourth quarter results. We posted an adjusted profit of $1.61 per diluted share and a reported profit of $1.74 per diluted share. The difference between adjusted and reported profit was largely driven by a non-cash tax benefit related to a reorganization of legal entities.\nAs Vicki mentioned, our Board recently authorized a renewed $3 billion share repurchase program following the repurchase of approximately 47.7 million shares last year for a weighted average cost of below $63 per share.\nWe exited the quarter with approximately $1 billion of unrestricted cash after paying $1.1 billion of debt and retiring $450 million in notional interest rate swaps. For the year, we completed over $10.5 billion of debt repayments, which eliminated 37% of outstanding principal and resulted in a sizable reduction in interest burden. We estimate that the balance sheet improvements executed in 2022 will reduce interest and financing costs by over $400 million per year.\nOur proactive debt reduction efforts leveled the company's profile of future maturities, so that we have less than $2 billion of debt maturing in any single year for the remainder of this decade. Going forward, we intend to repay debt as it matures and may also reduce debt opportunistically. We repaid approximately $22 million in January and do not have additional maturities until the third quarter of 2024, providing us with a clear runway to focus on returning cash to shareholders and partially redeeming the preferred.\nIn the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $2.6 billion of free cash flow, even with inflation continuing to pressure costs and capital spending. Domestic operating expenses were higher than expected, primarily due to the impact of Winter Storm Elliott, equipment upgrades and platform life extension work in the Gulf of Mexico, and inflation. Overhead increased as a result of higher accruals related to compensation and annual environmental remediation. Capital spending in the quarter was higher than expected due to inflationary impacts, investments in attractive OBO projects, schedule changes leading to activity in higher working interest areas, and rig startups for our Delaware JV.\nWe further improved our liquidity position this month when Oxy became the first company ever to securitize offshore oil and gas receivables in an amendment that increased our accounts receivable facility by 50% to $600 million.\nIn 2022, we paid U.S. federal cash taxes of approximately $940 million, in line with our previous estimate. As we move into 2023, we expect to be a full U.S. federal cash taxpayer as we've utilized all our NOLs and U.S. general business carryforward credits.\nWe expect our full year production to average 1.18 million BOE per day in 2023. As was the case last year, production in the first quarter is expected to be lower than the preceding quarter due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds, primarily in our international operations. We'll have fewer wells come online in our U.S. onshore business in the first quarter, with only about 15% of our Permian wells and 6% of our Rockies wells for the year turning over to production. That said, our overall production trajectory is expected to be smoother in 2023 than in the prior year.\nThroughout 2022, we worked with Colorado regulators and local communities to successfully navigate the permitting process. Our work positioned us to add back two rigs in the DJ by the end of 2022. Given the reduced activity levels over the last few years, our Rockies production is likely to be lower in 2023 than last year. Production is expected to stabilize in the second half of 2023 once the benefits from the additional rig picked up in the fourth quarter of last year fully materialize. Setback rules in Colorado typically lead to a pad development approach with a linear time-to-market cycle as compared to simultaneous operations in other shale plays. This operating environment creates negligible additional costs for our development, but this year is expected to have a noticeable impact on time-to-market as our activity ramps up. The DJ Basin remains an exceptionally high-return asset for Oxy, and we welcome the return of sustaining capital levels to that business, which was predicated by the regulatory certainty and permitting efficiency we are now experiencing in Colorado.\nThe production sharing contract we announced last year with Algeria is expected to take effect in March. Once the agreement is in place, net barrels to Oxy will decrease by approximately 15,000 BOE per day, which is reflected in our 2023 guidance. We do not expect a material change in operating cash flow because the tax rate will also reset under the new PSC.\nOperating costs across our Oil & Gas business are expected to approximate the second half of 2022 as inflationary pressures remain and our lower-cost DJ Basin production declines. In the Gulf of Mexico, maintenance work to further reduce planned downtime and extend platform lives will impact operating costs. We are also increasing EOR downhole maintenance work and CO2 purchases. On a BOE basis, operating costs may increase internationally due to lower reported barrels from the new Algeria contract.\n2022 was an exceptional year for OxyChem as the business exceeded $2.5 billion in income. We expect 2023 to be another strong year by historical standards, though it is unlikely to match 2022. Caustic soda prices reached all-time highs in the fourth quarter of 2022, but we are now facing downward pricing pressures as the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. PVC pricing fell sharply in the second half of 2022, but has begun to stabilize. As I've mentioned before, OxyChem's integration across multiple chlorine derivatives enables us to optimize our production mix to what the market demands. We remain optimistic about the business, and our capital investments will further strengthen our margins and competitive position.\nLooking forward to the rest of 2023 and beyond, we remain dedicated to extending the success of 2022 and advancing our enhanced shareholder return framework. I will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nWe're now ready to take your questions."

Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter operationally and financially, enabling us to further advance our shareholder return framework as we made meaningfully -- meaningful progress toward completing our $3 billion share repurchase program. We achieved our goal of reducing the face value of our debt to the high teens and plan to continue repaying debt through the remainder of this year before allocating a higher percentage of cash flow to shareholder returns next year.\nThe excellent operational performance of our businesses was a key driver of our strong financial results, including generating the cash flow required to advance our shareholder return framework and further strengthen our balance sheet. OxyChem delivered strong earnings following a record second quarter, while our Gulf of Mexico, International, Rockies and Permian teams set new operational records.\nThis afternoon, I will cover our third quarter operational performance and the exciting progress our Low Carbon business has made since our investor update in March. Rob will cover our financial results as well as our updated guidance, which includes an increase in full year guidance for all 3 of our business segments.\nOur businesses all performed well in the third quarter, enabling us to generate $3.6 billion of free cash flow before working capital, with total company-wide capital spend of approximately $1.1 billion. Our oil and gas business delivered production of nearly 1.2 million BOE per day, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by approximately 25,000 BOE per day. Outperformance from the Rockies and Gulf of Mexico were key drivers of our production exceeding third quarter guidance.\nThe Rockies' success was driven by better-than-expected base production and higher NGL recoveries. In the Gulf of Mexico, we benefited from unseasonably calm weather during most of the third quarter and better-than-expected performance from Horn Mountain West. Our ability to generate substantial free cash flow, even as oil prices declined compared to the previous quarter, positioned us to complete approximately $2.6 billion of our $3 billion share repurchase program through November 7.\nOver the last 12 months, we have returned approximately $3.21 per share to common shareholders moving us closer to potentially being able to begin redeeming the preferred equity in 2023. We also repaid approximately $1.5 billion of debt in the third quarter and in the period ending November 7. Providing commodity prices remain supportive, we intend to reduce the face value of our debt approximately $18 billion by the end of this year, meaning that we will have repaid over $10 billion of debt in 2022.\nAs we enter 2023, we expect that our free cash flow allocation will shift significantly towards shareholder returns. We intend to reward shareholders with a sustainable dividend supported by an active repurchase program, continued rebalancing of our enterprise value in favor of common shareholders, and a reduction in our cost of capital as the preferred equity is partially redeemed.\nTurning to OxyChem and Midstream. Both businesses benefited from supportive market conditions during the third quarter. OxyChem exceeded its guidance since chlor-alkali prices continued to strengthen and the expected softening in the PVC markets did not materialize to the extent that we had forecast.\nWe continue to be highly encouraged by well performance across our portfolio. In the Delaware Basin, we delivered our best quarter to date for early well performance with the 46 wells online averaging peak 30-day rates of over 3,600 BOE per day, demonstrating the superior quality of our inventory and subsurface expertise. And in the Texas Delaware, we recently brought online a new Silvertip well with the highest initial oil production of any horizontal well previously drilled in the lower 48.\nThe Python 13H well posted a 3-stream IP of almost 20,000 BOE per day and averaged over 11,000 BOEs per day over its first 30 days online, which we believe to be the strongest performance ever for a Permian well. Overall, the Python development has outperformed expectations, and we're looking forward to developing the offsetting areas over the next few months.\nWe're beginning to see additional progress in Colorado's new permit approval process. In August, we received approval from the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission for the state's first comprehensive area plan under the recently implemented regulations. This plan has paved the way for us to complete more than 200 new wells in Wells County over the next few years. Also, several drilling permit applications that had been pending for a period of time were recently approved, allowing us to add back a rig in the DJ Basin after reallocating 1 earlier this year.\nWith the permits we have in hand and our expectations for future approvals, we have enhanced our flexibility as we formulate our activity for next year. Last quarter, we celebrated first oil from our new discovery field in the Gulf of Mexico, Horn Mountain West. While it's exciting to realize production from new discoveries, our existing fields have abundant potential that we continue to unlock with innovative technical solutions like subsea expansions.\nFor example, our Caesar-Tonga field recently reached a production milestone of 150 barrels of cumulative oil production since the start-up 10 years ago. Caesar-Tonga is a subsea tieback to the Constitution spar and is one of the largest fields in the Outer Continental Shelf. This impressive achievement is the result of the collaboration and hard work across Oxy's Gulf of Mexico business unit including the asset development teams and offshore personnel, who focus on delivering safe and efficient barrels every day.\nIn the years ahead, we plan to continue maximizing production capacity through projects like this one. The Caesar-Tonga subsea expansion, which is scheduled for start-up in the first quarter of next year, will address facility bottlenecks and maximize production capacity from the field, while signaling a transition into the next phase of field development.\nIn the second quarter, I highlighted new production records at Al Hosn in the UAE and Block 9 in Oman. I'd like to congratulate our Al Hosn and Oman teams again this quarter for breaking those recently set records. We're beginning to benefit from incremental production from Al Hosn and are pleased the expansion project is on track for completion in the middle of 2023.\nTurning to our Low Carbon business, I'm pleased to share that we broke ground on the world's largest direct air capture plant in Ector County, Texas. The first stage of construction, which includes site preparation and road work began in September. Plant start-up is expected in late 2024.\nDuring our March LCV Investor Update, we provided an overview of the expected revenues and costs for both direct air capture and point source capture projects. Just then, we had experienced progress on legislative and commercial fronts. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains several enhancements to the 45Q tax credit that will incentivize the development of carbon capture projects. Additionally, strong interest from potential customers has provided us with a clearer picture of the market for carbon dioxide removal credits or CDRs, and net zero oil in addition to other products.\nWe believe our low carbon strategy, combined with the ability to leverage direct air capture or DAC, for the benefit of ourselves and others, uniquely positions us to lead the market in supplying CDRs to the thousands of businesses that have established net zero ambitions. We are encouraged by the passage of the IRA and previously highlighted the potential for the 45Q enhancements to accelerate our low carbon strategy. We expect the 45Q enhancements to jump start the voluntary market for CDRs, which gives us confidence to increase the number of DACs in our current development scenario from 70 online by 2035 to approximately 100.\nEqually as important, we expect the accelerated development of direct air capture will enable us to reduce plant capital and operating costs at a faster pace. In March, we provided a capital cost for the first DAC plant of $800 million to $1 billion. Given the inflationary pressures felt across the economy, especially for construction materials and labor, we now expect the first plant to cost approximately $1.1 billion. The current inflationary environment will not last forever, and we will leverage our supply chain and major projects expertise wherever possible, to lower the cost of our first direct air capture as well as the ones to follow.\nThe U.S. has taken a leadership role in moving towards net zero making it more accessible for companies to meet their net zero commitments through the utilization of CDRs. Our long-term view on the potential of direct air capture has not changed, but to reach the net zero development scenario of 135 DACs described in our March update, the rest of the world will need to rise to the challenge in the form of global policy support. We're already seeing evidence of this, such as the PACE program recently announced in the UAE, which will catalyze $100 billion in financing and investment.\nThe Permian location of our first direct air capture will provide us multiple options to maximize the value of captured CO2. We have the ability to inject the CO2 into a saline reservoir producing CDRs or to utilize the captured CO2 to produce net zero oil from our enhanced oil recovery assets. Our conversations with many corporate partners and potential clients have highlighted the significant demand for CDRs generated through CO2 sequestration.\nTo meet this demand and advance our own net zero ambition, we plan to develop several hubs along the U.S. Gulf Coast, where we will have the option to develop direct air capture, provide point source capture and sequestration for industrial emissions or offer both solutions. To advance our ability to provide sequestration services and generate CDRs, we have filed applications for 2 Class VI sequestration permits and plan to file applications in the near future.\nWe recently secured 2 new locations for the large-scale development of sequestration hubs. The first location covers 65,000 acres in Southeast Texas with up to 1.3 billion tons of CO2 sequestration capacity that could support up to 20 DACs. We also reached a lease agreement with King Ranch, the largest privately held ranch in the U.S., to build up to 30 DACs and develop point source capture infrastructure.\nOur agreement covers approximately 106,000 acres, which is about 166 square miles with the capability to safely and permanently sequester approximately 3 billion tons of CO2. We expect to develop our second DAC at King Ranch and plan to start the pre-feed before year-end. These 2 new locations are in addition to the 3 hubs focused on point source capture that we're also developing. We have secured almost 100,000 acres in Southeast Texas and Louisiana capable of safely and permanently sequestering approximately 1.9 billion tons of CO2.\nIn total, we have secured over 260,000 acres capable of sequestering almost 6 billion tons of CO2 compared to the target we communicated in March of securing approximately 100,000 acres by the end of the year.\nNET Power recently announced a plan to develop and build the world's first utility-scale natural gas-fired power plant with near zero atmospheric emissions. The plant will be located close to Oxy's operations in the Permian and will supply our operations with clean, low-cost on-demand power. CO2 generated by the power plant will be used -- will be captured and permanently sequestered underground using our existing CO2 infrastructure. This plant will accelerate Oxy's plans to reduce carbon emissions to help us achieve our net zero ambitions.\nThis first utility scale plant will enable both Oxy and NET Power to develop best practices that use NET Power's technology to provide emission-free power for our Permian operations and future direct air capture sites.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our third quarter results and guidance.\n\nRobert L. Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Vicki, and good afternoon. In the third quarter, our profitability remained strong as we posted an adjusted profit of $2.44 per diluted share and a reported profit of $2.52 per diluted share, even as commodity prices declined from the recent high set in the second quarter. The difference between adjusted and reported earnings was primarily driven by a gain on sale and a tax benefit related to foreign restructuring, partially offset by early debt extinguishment cost and mark-to-market adjustments.\nAs Vicki mentioned, we made substantial progress towards completing our $3 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter. We have repurchased almost 42 million shares through November 7 for approximately $2.6 billion with a weighted average price below $62 per share. We intend to complete the share repurchase program by year-end and allocate any additional cash flow this year to reducing debt further.\nDuring the quarter, approximately 7.4 million publicly traded warrants were exercised, bringing the total number exercise as of September 30 to almost 12 million with approximately 104 million remaining outstanding. The warrants were a cash exercise instrument, meaning that Oxy received a cash payment from the warrant holder upon exercise, which provides them with an additional source of cash to purchase shares and reduce debt.\nWe are very pleased to have completed our near-term debt reduction goal of lowering debt to the high teens. In addition to having repaid approximately $9.6 billion of debt year-to-date, we also retired $275 million of notional interest rate swaps in the third quarter for approximately $100 million in cash.\nWe exited the third quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet and as of November 7 have reduced the face value of our debt below $19 billion. We have provided notice that the $340 million note due in February will be called on November 15, meaning that we will have less than $23 million of debt due next year. We also intend to retire the remaining $450 million of notional interest rate swaps this year, which we expect to require approximately $150 million in cash at the current interest rate curve.\nAs I mentioned on the previous call, we believe reducing the face value of our debt to high teens will accelerate our return to investment grade. We have made outstanding progress over the past 2 years to meet this objective, but understand that we cannot determine the timing of any potential ratings change. The combined impact of improving our balance sheet and reducing debt this year alone is estimated to result in a total annual interest and financing cost savings of over $350 million on a go-forward basis.\nDebt reduction will remain a priority, but we intend to notably redirect our cash flow priorities next year from proactively reducing debt to returning additional excess cash flow to shareholders. Over time, we intend to reduce gross debt below $15 billion.\nAs Vicki mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance across all 3 business segments due to outperformance in the third quarter and improved expectations for the remainder of the year. Starting with oil and gas, we have raised our full year production guidance by 5,000 BOE per day to 1.16 million BOE per day for 2022, while our full year capital guidance remains unchanged. But we continue to expect to finish the year on the high end of our capital range.\nOur production has increased steadily each quarter of this year, which has always been expected outcome of our 2022 plan, in part due to ramp up activity in scheduled turnarounds in the first quarter. We expect this trajectory will continue in the fourth quarter with production exceeding 1.2 million BOE per day.\nOur Permian operations were impacted by higher-than-expected third-party downtime and lower OBO volumes during the quarter. Our strong well performance continues to exceed our expectations, but due to third-party issues in the quarter, our Permian production came at the low end of our guidance range.\nWe have revised our fourth quarter Permian guidance down slightly from the implied guidance we provided last quarter, as our third quarter exit rate was lower than anticipated. We expect strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico and Rockies that more than offset the updated Permian projection.\nAs our 2022 plan anticipated an increase in activity throughout the year, our fourth quarter capital spend is expected to be higher than prior quarters this year. The activity that was added in the second half of this year will place us in a strong position for 2023 as our Permian production will grow by over 100,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. Our fourth quarter production is expected to grow approximately 18% from the fourth quarter of last year.\nOxyChem continues to perform well, and we've raised our full year guidance to reflect third quarter results as well as an improvement in our expectations for the fourth quarter. Fundamentals in the caustic soda market continue to be supportive, while softening in the PVC market has occurred at a slower pace than previously expected.\nWe expect the fourth quarter to reflect seasonal trends that are typical for this business, but did not materialize in 2020 or 2021. The seasonal slowdown in construction activity towards the end of the year typically reduces demand for chlorovinyl products, which we have reflected in our guidance.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob. As we said during our March investor update, achieving our net zero ambitions will require funding outside of Oxy's historical capital allocation program. As the construction phase and technology of our first stack project advances, we will continue to consider strategic capital partnerships and structures to address financing. While we are prepared to fund the first stack plant ourselves, if necessary, we are working to derisk the construction phase and commercialize the technology to attract financing structures that will retain the most value for our shareholders.\nFinally, we understand that there's a high level of interest in our 2023 capital and activity plans, which we will communicate on our next call once our plans are finalized and approved by the Board. As we formulate our plans for 2023, we will focus on retaining a high degree of flexibility in our capital and spending plans, allowing us to adapt and maximize opportunities in a changing macro environment as we do each year.\nBefore we go to our Q&A, I'd like to thank Jeff Alvarez for his leadership with our Investor Relations. I'm sure you would all agree, he's done a tremendous job to not only share our story and to help you all understand our strategy and results, he's also provided critical support to our leadership team. We appreciate what Jeff has done with Investor Relations and what he will do for us in his new role that he's recently accepted. That role is to become President and General Manager of [Sequest].\nIn this role, Jeff will lead the efforts to build our CO2 sequestration business. As you've heard in my script, this is a growing and important part of our low-carbon strategy. Jeff's 30 years of engineering and leadership experience working in domestic and Middle East operations and his proven track record of creating value will be needed for this emerging business.\nI'm happy to announce that Neil Backhouse will replace Jeff as Vice President of Investor Relations, reporting to Rob. And you all know, Neil, in addition to Investor Relations, his diverse expertise includes experience in treasury, finance and banking. Prior to joining Oxy, Neil worked as a corporate banker focused on oil and gas clients for 2 high-profile international banks. He holds BS from Colorado State University, a post graduate degree of Financial Services and a master's degree in International Business, both from the University of Manchester.\nI give tremendous thanks to Jeff Alvarez for his highly favorable contributions he's made to the finance organization, and please join me in extending your support to Neil and wishing him success as he transitions to his new role.\nWe'll now open the call for your questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Alvarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Alvarez\n\nVP of IR, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Jason. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Peterson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon.\nI'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved a significant milestone in the second quarter as we completed our near-term debt reduction goal and activated our share repurchase program. At the beginning of this year, we established a near-term goal of repaying an additional $5 billion of debt, before further increasing the amount of cash allocated to shareholder returns. The debt we completed in May brought the total debt repaid this year to over $8 billion, surpassing our target at a quicker pace than we had originally anticipated. With our near-term debt reduction goal accomplished, we initiated our $3 billion share repurchase program in the second quarter and have already repurchased more than $1.1 billion of shares.\nThe additional allocation of cash to shareholders marks a meaningful progression of our cash flow priorities as we have primarily allocated free cash flow to debt reduction over the last few years. Our efforts to improve the balance sheet remain ongoing, but our deleveraging process has reached a stage where our focus is expanding to go to additional cash flow priorities.\nThis afternoon, I'll cover the next phase of our shareholder return framework and second quarter operational performance. Rob will cover our financial results as well as our updated guidance, which includes an increase in our full year guidance for OxyChem.\nStarting with our shareholder return framework. Our ability to consistently deliver outstanding operational results, combined with our focus to improve our balance sheet, have positioned us to increase the amount of capital returned to shareholders. Considering current commodity price expectations, we expect to repurchase a total of $3 billion of shares and reduce gross debt to the high teens by the end of this year. Once we have completed the $3 billion share repurchase program and reduced our debt to the high teens, we intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in 2023 through a common dividend that is sustainable at $40 WTI as well as through an active share repurchase program. The progress we are making in lowering interest payments through debt reduction, combined with managing the number of shares outstanding, will enhance the sustainability of our dividend and position us to increase our common dividend at the appropriate time. While we expect future dividend increases to be gradual and meaningful, we do not anticipate the dividend returning to its prior peak.\nGiven our focus on returning capital to shareholders, it is possible that we may reach a point next year where we've returned over $4 per share to common shareholders over a trailing 12-month period. Reaching and maintaining returns to common shareholders above this threshold will require us to begin redeeming their preferred equity concurrently with returning additional cash to common shareholders.\nI want to be clear about 2 things. First, reaching the $4 per share threshold is the potential outcome of our shareholder return framework, not a specific target. Second, if we begin redeeming the preferred equity, this does not mean there is a cap on returns to common shareholders as cash would continue to be returned to common shareholders above $4 per share.\nIn the second quarter, we generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow before working capital, our highest quarterly free cash flow to date. Our business has all performed well, and we delivered production from continuing operations of approximately 1.1 million BOE per day, in line with the midpoint of our guidance and with total company-wide spending of capital of $972 million.\nOxyChem reported record earnings for the fourth consecutive quarter with EBIT of $800 million, as the business continued to benefit from robust pricing and demand in the caustic, chlorine, and PVC markets. Last quarter, we highlighted the Responsible Care and Facility Safety Awards that OxyChem received from the American Chemistry Council.\nOxyChem's accomplishments continue to be acknowledged. In May, the U.S. Department of Energy honored OxyChem as a Better Practice Award winner, which recognizes companies for innovative and industry-leading accomplishments in energy management. OxyChem received the recognition for incorporating an engineering, training and development program that led to process changes, resulting in energy savings that reduced CO2 emissions by 7,000 metric tons annually. It's achievements like this that make me so proud to announce the modernization and expansion of one of OxyChem's key plants, which we'll detail in just a minute.\nTurning to oil and gas. I'd like to congratulate the Gulf of Mexico team in celebrating first oil from the new discovery field, Horn Mountain West. The new field was successfully tied back to the Horn Mountain SPAR using a 3.5-mile dual flow line. The project came in on budget and more than 3 months ahead of schedule. The Horn Mountain West tieback is expected to eventually add approximately 30,000 barrels of oil production per day and is an excellent example of our ability to leverage our assets and technical expertise to bring new production online in a capital-efficient manner.\nI'd also like to congratulate our Al Hosn and Oman teams. Al Hosn achieved a recent production record following the first full plant shutdown as a part of a planned turnaround in the first quarter. Oxy's Oman team celebrated a record high daily production at Oman North Block 9, which has been operated by Oxy since 1984. Even after almost 40 years, Block 9 is still breaking records with strong base production and new development wedge performance, supported by a successful exploration program.\nWe have also been active in capturing opportunities to leverage our deep inventory of U.S. onshore assets. When we announced our Midland Basin JV with EcoPetrol in 2019, I mentioned how excited we were to be working with one of our strongest and longest-standing strategic partners. The JV has worked exceptionally well for both partners, with Oxy benefiting from incremental production and cash flow from the Midland Basin with minimal investment. We are fortunate to collaborate with a partner who has extensive expertise and with whom we share a long-term vision. This is why I'm equally excited this morning to announce that Oxy and EcoPetrol have agreed to enhance our JV in the Midland Basin and expand our partnership to cover approximately 20,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin. This includes 17,000 acres in the Texas Delaware that will utilize WES' infrastructure.\nAnd in the Midland Basin, Oxy will benefit from the opportunity to continue development with an extension to the capital carry through the end of this agreement in the first quarter of 2025. In the Delaware Basin, we have the opportunity to bring forward the development of high-quality acreage that was further out in our development plans, while benefiting from an additional capital carry of up to 75%. In exchange for the carried capital, EcoPetrol will earn a percentage of the working interest in the JV asset.\nLast month, we reached an agreement with Sonatrach in Algeria to enter into a new 25-year production-sharing agreement that will roll Oxy's existing licenses into a single agreement. The new production-sharing agreement renews and deepens our partnership with Sonatrach, while providing Oxy with the opportunity to add reserves and continue developing a low-decline cash-generating asset with long-standing partners.\nEven with 2022 expected to be a record year for OxyChem, we see a unique opportunity to expand OxyChem's future earnings and cash flow generating capabilities by investing in a high-return project. On our fourth quarter call, we mentioned a FEED study to explore the modernization of certain Gulf Coast chlor-alkali assets and diaphragm to membrane technology. I'm pleased to announce our Battleground plant, which is adjacent to Houston Ship Channel in Deer Park, Texas, is one of the sites that we will modernize. Battleground is Oxy's largest chlorine and caustic soda production facility with ready access to both domestic and international markets.\nThe project is being undertaken in part to respond to customer demand for chlorine, chlorine derivatives, and certain grades of caustic soda that we can produce with newer technology. It will also result in increased capacities for both products. The project is expected to increase cash flow through improved margins and higher product volumes, while lowering the energy intensity of the products produced. The modernization and expansion project will commence in 2023, with a capital investment of up to $1.1 billion, spread over 3 years.\nDuring construction, existing operations are expected to continue as normal, with the improvements expected to be realized in 2026. The expansion is not a prospective build as we have structurally advanced contracts and internal derivative production to consume the incremental chlorine volume, while caustic volumes will be contracted by the time the new capacity comes online.\nThe Battleground project represents the first sizable investment we've made in OxyChem since the construction and completion of the 4CPE plant and ethylene cracker that were completed in 2017. This high-return project is just one of several opportunities we have to grow OxyChem's cash flow over the next few years. We are conducting similar FEED studies for additional chlor-alkali assets and plan to communicate the results when complete.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our second quarter results and guidance.\n\nRobert L. Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Vicki, and good afternoon. In the second quarter, our profitability remained strong, and we generated a record level of free cash flow. We announced an adjusted profit of $3.16 per diluted share and a reported profit of $3.47 per diluted share, with the difference between the two numbers primarily driven by gains in early debt extinguishment and positive mark-to-market adjustments.\nWe were pleased to be able to allocate cash to share repurchases in the second quarter. To date, we have repurchased over 18 million shares as of Monday, August 1, for approximately $1.1 billion for a weighted average price below $60 per share.\nAlso, during the quarter, approximately 3.1 million publicly traded warrants were exercised, bringing the total number exercised to almost 4.4 million with 111.5 million remaining outstanding. As we said, when the warrants were issued in 2020, the cash proceeds received will be applied towards share repurchases to mitigate potential dilution to common shareholders.\nAs Vicki mentioned, we are excited to enhance and expand our relationship with EcoPetrol in the Permian Basin. The JV amendment closed in the second quarter with an effective date of January 1, 2022. To maximize this opportunity, we intended to add an additional rig late in the year to support the JV development activity in the Delaware Basin. The additional activity is not expected to add any production until 2023, as the first Delaware JV wells will not come online until next year.\nSimilarly, the JV amendment is not expected to have any meaningful impact on our capital budget this year. We expect the Delaware JV and the enhanced Midland JV and to allow us to maintain or even lower industry-leading capital intensity in the Permian from 2023 onwards. We will provide further details when we provide 2023 production guidance.\nGiven the January 1, 2022 effective date and related working interest transferred to our JV partner in the Midland Basin, we have adjusted our full year Permian production guidance down slightly. Separately, we are reallocating a portion of the capital we earmarked for OBO spending this year to our operated Permian assets. Reallocating capital operating activity will provide more certainty in our wedge delivery for the second half of 2022 and the start of 2023, while also delivering superior returns given our inventory quality and cost control. While the timing of this change has a slight impact on our 2022 production due to activity relocation in the second half of the year, the benefit of developing resources that we operate is expected to result in even stronger financial performance going forward. The updated activity slide in the earnings presentation appendix reflects this change.\nThe shift in OBO capital, combined with the JV working interest transfer, as well as various short-term operability matters all contributed to us slightly lowering our full year Permian production guidance. The operability impacts are primarily related to third-party issues, such as downstream gas processing interruptions in our EOR assets and other unplanned disruptions at third parties. For 2022, company-wide full year production guidance remains unchanged, as the Permian adjustment is fully offset by high production in the Rockies and the Gulf of Mexico.\nFinally, we note that our Permian production delivery remains very strong, with a growth of approximately 100,000 BOE per day when comparing the fourth quarter of 2021 through our implied production guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect production in the second half of 2022 to average approximately 1.2 million BOE per day, which is notably higher than the first half of the year. Higher production in the second half of the year has always been an expected outcome of our 2022 plan, in part due to ramp-up activities and scheduled turnarounds in the first quarter.\nCompany-wide third quarter production guidance includes continued growth in the Permian, but considers the potential for tropical weather impacts in the Gulf of Mexico combined with third-party downtime, and production decline in Rockies given our lower activity set as a result of relocating a rig to the Permian.\nOur full year capital budget remains unchanged. But as I mentioned in our previous call, we expect capital spending to come in near the high end of our range of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion. Certain areas that we operate in, especially the Permian, continue to experience higher inflationary pressures than others. To support activity into 2023 and address the regional impact of inflation, we are reallocating $200 million of capital to the Permian. We believe our company-wide capital budget is sized appropriately to execute our 2022 plan, as the additional capital for the Permian will be reallocated from other assets that have been able to generate higher-than-expected capital savings.\nWe are raising our full year domestic operating expense guidance to $8.50 per BOE, which accounts for higher-than-expected labor and energy costs, primarily in the Permian, as well as continued upward pricing pressure on our WTI index CO2 purchase contracts in the EOR business.\nOxyChem continues to perform well, and we have raised our full year guidance to reflect the exceptional second quarter performance as well as a slightly better than previously expected second half of the year. We still see the potential for market conditions to dampen from where we are today due to inflationary pressures, though the long-term fundamentals continue to remain supportive, and we expect third and fourth quarters to be strong by historical standards.\nTurning back to financial items. In September, we intend to settle $275 million of notional interest rate swaps. The net liability, or cash outflow required to settle these swaps, will be around $100 million at the current interest rate curve. Last quarter, I mentioned that as WTI averages $90 per barrel in 2022, we would expect to pay approximately $600 million in U.S. federal cash taxes. Oil prices continue to remain strong, increasing the possibility that WTI may average an even higher price for the year. If WTI average $100 in 2022, we would expect to pay approximately $1.2 billion in U.S. federal cash taxes.\nAs Vicki mentioned, year-to-date, we repaid approximately $8.1 billion of debt, including $4.8 billion in the second quarter, exceeding our near-term goals of paying $5 billion in principal this year. We have also made meaningful progress towards our medium-term goal of reducing gross debt to the high teens. We began repurchasing shares in the second quarter, further advancing our shareholder return framework as part of our commitment to return more cash to shareholders. We intend to continue allocating free cash flow towards the share repurchases until we complete our current $3 billion program.\nDuring this period, we will continue to view debt retirement opportunistically and we'll likely retire debt concurrently with share repurchases. Once our initial share repurchase program is complete, we intend to allocate free cash flow towards reducing the face value of debt to the high teens, which we believe will accelerate our return to investment grade. When we reach this stage, we intend to reduce the emphasis of our allocation of free cash flow from primarily reducing debt by including additional items in our cash flow priorities.\nWe continue to make incremental progress towards achieving our goal of returning to investment grade. Since our last earnings call, Fitch assigned a positive outlook to our credit ratings. All three of the major credit rating agencies rate our debt as one notch below investment grade, with Moody's and Fitch having assigned positive outlooks. Over time, we intend to maintain mid-cycle leverage at approximately 1 times debt-to-EBITDA, or below $15 billion. We believe this level of leverage will be appropriate for our capital structure as it will enhance our equity returns while strengthening our ability to return capital to shareholders throughout the commodity cycle.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nWe're now prepared to take your calls."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Alvarez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Alvarez\n\nVP of IR, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Drew. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in Occidental's First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Peterson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Richard Jackson, President of Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon.\nI will now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We're especially proud of our results this quarter as our strong operational and financial performance enabled us to generate our highest reported and adjusted earnings in over a decade, resulting in an annualized return on capital employed of 21% when calculated with adjusted earnings. We also reported a record level of free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. The increase in free cash flow compared to last quarter was achieved as we began executing on our 2022 capital plan to support our cash flow longevity.\nAs we will detail in a few minutes, we made meaningful progress towards our near-term goal of retiring $5 billion of debt. We remain focused on reducing debt this year as we advance our shareholder return framework. We repaid over $3.6 billion of debt as a part of the near-term goals we announced last quarter to repay an additional $5 billion of principal and lower net debt to $20 billion. Once the $5 billion target has been achieved, we -- our focus will expand to the $3 billion share repurchase program.\nWhen this first phase of our shareholder return framework is complete, we will continue to focus on debt reduction until we have achieved the face value of our debt to the high teens. When we have line of sight on reaching this milestone, we will detail the next phase of our shareholder return framework. During our most recent earnings call, we spoke about the importance of lowering our interest expense to support a dividend that can sustainably grow throughout the cycle. Continuing to lower debt, combined with managing the number of shares outstanding, will enhance the sustainability of our dividend while positioning us to increase it at the appropriate time.\nThis morning, I will cover our first quarter operational performance and Rob will cover our financial results as well as our updated guidance, which includes an increase in guidance for OxyChem and midstream's 2022 earnings. Our first quarter results are a great example of how Oxy's operational excellence and asset portfolio position our shareholders to benefit from a high commodity price environment. In the first quarter, we generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow. This is more than twice what we generated in the first quarter of 2021, which at that time was our highest level of free cash flow in over a decade. Our strong financial results were driven by our business delivering exceptional performance while practicing disciplined capital allocation and cost control, combined with the benefits of an improved financial position and higher commodity prices.\nSwitching to operational performance. We delivered first quarter production from continuing operations of approximately 1.1 million BOE per day, in line with the midpoint of our guidance and with total company-wide spending -- capital spending of $858 million. Our international operations successfully completed their scheduled turnarounds in the quarter and production has returned to normalized levels. Compared to the first quarter, we expect international production to increase accordingly in the second quarter. While higher prices are expected to lower our full year international guidance under our production sharing contracts, we expect the impact to be fully offset by outperformance in our Rockies and Gulf of Mexico businesses. As I mentioned during our last call, we expect company-wide production to grow from the second quarter through the end of the year as our targeted capital investments sustain 2022 average production in line with the previous year.\nOxyChem's performance continued to exceed expectations as the business benefited from robust pricing in the caustic, chlorine and PVC markets. OxyChem delivered record earnings this quarter, which we expect to contribute to 2022 being another record year for the business. Following several consecutive record quarters, we see the potential for market conditions to dampen slightly in the second half of the year, though the long-term fundamentals continue to remain supportive. I'm very proud of OxyChem's workforce who recently received 13 Responsible Care and 15 facility safety awards from the American Chemistry Council for their 2021 performance.\nMidstream and marketing's outperformance compared to guidance in the first quarter was primarily driven by higher margins from gas processing and sulfur sales and our ability to optimize gas transportation in the Permian and Rockies and the timing of export sales. While short-term opportunities in the commodity markets are difficult to predict, our midstream team excels at finding and taking full advantage of such opportunities when they arise. I'm pleased to say that our first quarter results continue to demonstrate how the quality of the assets, the talent of our teams and our improved financial position serve as catalysts for strong financial results and provide a solid foundation for free cash flow generation.\nOur teams did an excellent job of managing the planned turnarounds and maintenance projects this quarter. We completed turnarounds in Algeria, Al Hosn and Dolphin and a series of maintenance projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Completing these planned projects increase the reliability and efficiency of our assets. The Al Hosn turnaround involved the first full plant shutdown, during which time we safely completed over 500 tie-ins related to the expansion project. The expansion is progressing as planned with the capacity increase expected to be online towards the middle of next year.\nOur Rockies team brought online their largest pad ever with 23 wells and drilled their longest lateral to date at over 15,000 feet. That business continues to perform well, with strong well productivity and higher-than-expected NGL yields driving first quarter performance. Our team in the Midland Basin had similar success bringing online the 12-well 15,000-foot development we mentioned on our most recent earnings call. And in Algeria, we drilled and completed Oxy's first development well in 2022 with time to market for the completion and hookup significantly exceeding prior performance. These are just a few of the many operational achievements our teams continue to deliver each quarter.\nIn addition to focusing on operational improvements, we continue to pursue new and resourceful ways to reduce emissions. For example, in the DJ and Permian Basins, we successfully trialed a new in-house methane detection system that will help us on our net 0 pathway. We also plan to build on the success of our water recycling partnership by developing similar systems and additional locations this year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our first quarter results and guidance.\n\nRobert L. Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Vicki, and good afternoon. Our cash flow priorities continue to direct free cash flow allocation in the first quarter as we repaid an additional debt in April and paid the first distribution of our increased common dividend. On our last call, we detailed our near-term debt reduction targets, including repaying $5 billion of debt and reducing net debt to $20 billion. Our progress towards meeting these targets advanced significantly in the first quarter.\nWe repaid approximately $3.3 billion of debt and ended the quarter with net debt of $23.3 billion, reflecting the face value of our debt of $25.2 billion and the unrestricted cash balance of $1.9 billion. Repaying $3.3 billion of debt in the first quarter was accomplished through a combination of a $2.9 billion tender offer, exercising the call provision on a note and open market repurchases. Following quarter end, we retired approximately $300 million in additional debt using open-market repurchases, lowering gross debt to approximately $24.9 billion, which is the balance today.\nIt is reasonable to expect that we could meet our near-term debt targets and then initiate our share repurchase program during the second quarter. Once we complete our near-term debt reduction target and repurchased $3 billion of shares, we will continue to allocate free cash flow to repaying debt as we lower gross debt to the high teens in billions. We believe reducing debt to this level will speed our return to investment grade and better position us to sustain a greater dividend at lower prices. When we reach this stage, we intend to transition from proactively reducing debt to primarily addressing maturities as they come due.\nOur debt reduction efforts continue to receive positive recognition. Since our last earnings call, Moody's upgraded our credit rating to Ba1 with a positive outlook. All 3 of the major credit rating agencies now rate our debt as 1 notch below investment grade, which we view as recognition of the pronounced and ongoing improvement in our credit profile.\nOur consistently strong operational results in combination with the current commodity price environment are driving improved profitability on top of our already robust free cash flow generation. In the first quarter, we announced an adjusted profit of $2.12 per diluted share, our highest adjusted core EPS in over a decade; and reported profit of $4.65 per diluted share. The difference between our adjusted and reported profit for the quarter was mainly driven by the legal entity reorganization described in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. Following the completion of our large-scale post-acquisition divestiture program, a portion of the existing tax basis was reallocated to operating assets, thus reducing our deferred tax liabilities by approximately $2.6 billion, which was recognized in our reported earnings for the quarter.\nWe resumed paying U.S. federal cash taxes in the quarter, ahead of our earlier expectation. This was due in part to the strong earnings generated in the first quarter, combined with our expectations for commodity prices and earnings over the remainder of the year. Given current commodity price expectations, we now expect to exhaust our U.S. net operating losses and most of our general business credit carryforwards this year. However, the NOLs and credits that we currently have remaining are expected to limit the amount of cash taxes paid this year. For example, we would expect to pay approximately $600 million in U.S. federal cash taxes if WTI averaged $90 per barrel in 2022.\nThe increase in commodity prices certainly benefited us during the quarter, as demonstrated by our strong earnings and free cash flow generation. The commodity price environment improvement compared to the previous quarter also resulted in higher accounts receivable balances, which contributed to a negative working capital change. Negative working capital change was also driven by typical first quarter payments such as semi-annual interest payments, annual property tax payments and payments on our compensation plan. As was the case in 2021, we see the potential for the working capital change to partially reverse over the remainder of the year if commodity prices are stable and due to payments accrued during the year being made in subsequent first quarter.\nWe are pleased to be able to update our full year guidance for midstream and OxyChem, reflecting strong first quarter performance and improved market conditions. Our revised full year guidance for OxyChem now includes the expectation of a fourth consecutive record for quarterly earnings in the second quarter. We recognize the possibility of softer product prices later in the year but still expect the third and fourth quarters to be exceptionally strong by historical standards.\nAs Vicki mentioned, our Rockies business continues to perform well. Our expectation of continued strong well performance over the remainder of the year provides us with confidence to raise full year guidance for the Rockies by 5,000 BOE per day.\nOn previous calls, we've discussed how we've been working closely with Colorado communities and regulators in implementing the state's new permitting process. Our drilling permits we have in hand are sufficient to run a single rig for the remainder of 2022. It is no longer feasible for us to run a multi-rig program for Colorado this year given the current pace of state approvals. As a result, we plan to reallocate activity from the Rockies to the Permian in the second half of the year. This activity change will not impact our 2022 production and is included in domestic onshore activity slide in the appendix to our earnings presentation.\nWe plan to submit development plans in the coming months that will cover over 1,100 rig days. We are hopeful that as Colorado's new permitting process matures, it will continue to become more efficient. Regulatory certainty early on in the process would provide us with the option to add activity back in the Rockies in future years given oil and gas development plans we expect to submit for this year.\nWhile our company-wide full year guidance is unchanged, as Vicki mentioned, we have included a 6,000 BOE per day downward adjustment to our full year international guidance, reflecting the impact of higher oil prices in our production sharing contracts. Our original budget included a forecast of $73 for Brent while our revised guidance reflects a Brent average price of $95 for 2022. Inclusive of these activity changes, our 2022 capital guidance remains at $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion.\nWe mentioned on our last call that our 2022 capital guidance incorporates approximately $250 million of inflation compared to 2021. Cost of materials and services necessary for operations, especially onshore in the United States, has continued to increase. We are working to offset inflationary pressures through additional efficiency. But if price increases continue, we may spin near the top end of our capital guidance this year. Certain pricing pressures such as labor and our WTI index CO2 purchase contracts in the EOR business have become pressing, leading to a slight upward adjustment in our full year guidance for domestic OpEx.\nWe are pleased with our strong start to 2022. With one full quarter behind us, we have completed scheduled turnarounds, continued to pay down debt, established a shareholder return framework, provided a comprehensive update on our low-carbon strategy and set new quarterly records for earnings and cash flow. We will continue to focus on delivering value for shareholders this year and beyond.\nI will now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob. I would like to thank our shareholders for voting with the Board at our recent Annual Meeting and defeating a proposal that if approved, would have been counterproductive as we work towards achieving our net 0 ambition. Our quantitative short-, medium- and long-term goals for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are directly aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our competitive strengths as a carbon management leader and our strategy to achieve net 0 before 2050.\nWith our journey towards net 0 fully underway, we presented a market update in March on our low-carbon business strategy. We provided details of the market opportunity and our plans to deliver climate and business solutions that leverage our assets and capabilities in carbon management, including CCUS. We are advancing the technological solutions that can deliver large scale and rapid emission reduction throughout our value chain. Additionally, our low-carbon strategy creates value for our existing businesses while, at the same time, helping to accelerate the path to net 0 for ourselves and other leading companies in multiple industries.\nWe'll now open the call for your questions."

On the call with us today are Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Peterson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ken Dillon, President, International Oil and Gas Operations; and Richard Jackson, President, Operations, U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management.\nThis afternoon, we will refer to slides available on the Investors section of our website. The presentation includes a cautionary statement on Slide 2 regarding forward-looking statements that will be made on the call this afternoon.\nI'll now turn the call over to Vicki. Vicki, please go ahead.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter of 2021 was a fitting year -- a fitting way to end the year where Oxy's operational and financial performance advanced from strong to stronger. Our focus on consistently delivering outstanding operational results, combined with our steadfast dedication and patience in improving our balance sheet, has positioned us to begin increasing the amount of capital returned to shareholders. Our new shareholder return framework, which we will detail today, includes a dividend that is sustainable in a low price environment. We are pleased to implement this new framework, beginning with an increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.13 per share. .\nThe position of strength that we are in today stems from our team's hard work and accomplishments last year. Throughout 2021, we strived tirelessly to improve our already exceptional operational performance. We capitalized on efficiency improvements by embedding innovative techniques across our operations. Our focus on learning, implementing change, where needed, and maximizing opportunities for improvement enabled us to accelerate time to market for our products while generating notable capital saving. We will continue to maximize operational efficiencies in 2022 by executing on the capital plan that invest in our highest-return assets to generate long-term sustainable free cash flow.\nThis afternoon, I will begin by covering our fourth quarter and full year 2021 highlights and achievements, before detailing our 2022 capital budget. Rob and I will then discuss our shareholder return framework, and Rob will provide guidance for the first quarter and year ahead. Before turning to Q&A at the end, I will provide a preview of the Low Carbon Ventures investor update that we have planned for next month.\nNow to talk about delivering cash flow priorities. Those who have followed us at Oxy's journey over the past several quarters know that our cash flow priorities have centered around derisking our balance sheet and reducing debt. We diligently delivered on these cash flow priorities throughout 2021, including the repayment of approximately $6.7 billion of debt. We now expect that our net debt will be below $25 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2022, which will mark a change in how excess cash flow will be allocated going forward.\nBefore I detail our updated cash flow priorities and shareholder return framework, I would like to first touch on a few of the many operational and financial successes that enabled us to reach this significant turning point.\n2021 was a year of continuous operational improvements, which drove record free cash flow generation, rapid debt reduction and a return to profitability. One of Oxy's core strength is our ability to develop assets in a way that efficiently maximizes production and recovery while generating significant cash flow, and that is just what we did in 2021. Multiple drilling and completion records were set across our domestic and international businesses as our production for the year averaged 1.167 million BOE per day. That's 27,000 BOE per day higher than our initial guidance.\n2021 was also a more conventional year in terms of commodity prices, operations and planning, all of which was helpful in providing a reserve update that reflects a more normalized price environment. Our reserves for year-end 2021 increased to 3.5 billion BOE, representing a reserve replacement ratio of 241%. Our reserves position means that we have a vast supply of low breakeven projects and inventory available. We have included updated inventory information for our U.S. onshore operations in the appendix to this presentation.\nOver the last year, we significantly advanced our commitments toward a low-carbon future. We are proud to be one of only a few oil and gas companies with net-zero goals that are aligned with the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree Celsius pathway. In December, Oxy became the first U.S. upstream oil and gas company to enter into a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, which includes absolute reductions in our combined Scopes 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent emissions as the key performance indicator. We set additional interim emission targets to further refine our net-zero pathway, including a short-term target to reduce our CO2 equivalent emissions to approximately 3.7 million metric tons per year below our 2021 level and to accomplish that by 2024.\nWe set a medium-term target to facilitate the geologic storage or use of 25 million metric tons per year of CO2 and Oxy value chain by 2032. We also endorsed the Methane Guiding Principles and Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, a Climate and Clean Air Coalition initiative led by the United Nations Environment program. This is consistent with our commitment to enhance methane emissions reporting and reducing those emissions. Our journey towards net zero is underway, and we look forward to discussing in greater detail at our Low Carbon Ventures Investor Day next month.\nNow the fourth quarter highlights. The strong operational and financial performance that we delivered throughout last year continued in the fourth quarter. We set a fourth consecutive record for quarterly free cash flow generation before working capital, which contributed to generating our highest-ever annual level of free cash flow in 2021. We continue to apply free cash flow towards reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet, repaying an additional $2.2 billion of debt in the fourth quarter.\nOperationally, all 3 business segments excelled in driving our robust financial performance. OxyChem delivered record earnings for the second consecutive quarter as performance throughout the year culminated in 2021 being OxyChem's strongest in over 30 years. The fourth quarter, which is typically lower due to seasonality, even exceeded the record third quarter.\nAnd in our Oil and Gas segment, our Permian, Rockies and Oman teams set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks in the fourth quarter, further improving on their third quarter record.\nOur midstream business outperformed by maximizing gas margins during the fourth quarter. While short-term opportunities in the commodity markets are difficult to predict, our midstream team excels at finding and taking full advantage of such opportunities when they arise.\nNow I'm pleased to say that our fourth quarter results continued to demonstrate the commitment of all of our employees, no matter their position or location, to find ways to further create value by lowering costs, improving efficiencies and maximizing recoveries. They truly are driving our strong financial results and providing a solid foundation for free cash flow generation.\nNow on to 2021 oil and gas operational excellence. On each of our last several calls, I've enjoyed highlighting the many operational achievements our teams continuously deliver. The magnitude of these achievements is striking when viewed on a combined basis over the last year. We established record drilling cycle times in the Gulf of Mexico, the Permian, Rockies and in Oman, and set new efficiency benchmarks across our portfolio in 2021. We intend to maintain our focus on continuous improvement in the year ahead as we work to maximize the value our portfolio can generate for shareholders.\nNow our 2022 capital plan. Our 2022 capital plan invest in cash flow longevity while building on the capital intensity leadership we demonstrated in 2021. We have sized our capital plan to sustain production in 2022 at 1.155 million BOE per day, while investing in high-return projects that will provide cash flow stability throughout the cycle. We have also incorporated an expectation for inflation and a capital range to reflect the potential for fluctuations in our third-party-operated assets and our low-carbon opportunities during the year.\nOur sustaining capital, which we define as the capital required to sustain production in the $40 WTI environment over a multiyear period, remains industry-leading. Our multiyear sustaining capital is expected to increase from our 2021 capital budget of $2.9 billion, the reduced inventory of drilling uncompleted wells and additional investment in our Gulf of Mexico and EOR assets to optimize the long-term productivity of our reservoirs and facilities. If the macro environment requires spending below our multiyear sustaining capital, we have the ability to reduce it further and hold production flat for shorter periods of time as we've demonstrated.\nWe're also investing in attractive mid-cycle projects that will provide cash flow stability through the cycle in future years. For example, these projects include the Al Hosn expansion, which began last year. And OxyChem is in the process of completing a seed study to modernize certain Gulf Coast for alkali assets from diaphram to membrane technology.\nOur capital plan also includes investments to advance our net-zero pathway, including reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and developing our carbon sequestration initiative. We're allocating capital in the budget to 1.5 to begin construction on the first direct air capture facility. We continue to make progress on both the engineering and commercial needs for direct air capture development. We're improving both of these aspects and believe Oxy's capital helps retain value for our shareholders.\nAs the construction phase and technology of this new project advance, we will continue to consider strategic capital partnerships and structures to address financing. We'll provide more comprehensive update on 1.5 in direct air capture at our March 23 LCV investor update.\nWe benefited greatly from commodity price rebound last year and appreciate how swiftly the price environment can change. The optionality that our scale and asset base provide enables us to retain a high degree of flexibility in our capital and spending plans. The majority of our capital program is comprised of short-cycle investments, meaning that we have the ability to quickly adapt to changes in the macro environment. Within 6 months or less, if necessary, we can reduce capital spending to sustaining levels. And if oil prices remain supportive this year, our intent is to follow our cash flow priorities and capital framework that we will share with you today. We have no need and no intent to invest in production growth this year.\nHaving a flexible capital budget that includes investment and cash flow longevity provides us and puts us in a strong position to implement shareholder return framework that will benefit shareholders over the long term.\nWith respect to cash flow priorities, our priorities for 2022 remain largely unchanged, with a continuing emphasis on reducing debt while maintaining our asset base integrity and sustainability. The objective of strengthening our financial position remains the same. It enabled us to confidently increase the amount of capital that we may sustainably return to shareholders throughout the cycle. As we expect net debt to fall below $25 billion by the end of the first quarter, our focus has expanded to returning capital to shareholders, beginning with the increase in our common dividend to $0.13 per share and the reactivation and expansion of our share repurchase program. The increase in the dividend to $0.13 per share is consistent with our intention to initially increase the dividend to a level that approximates the yield of the S&P 500.\nWe believe establishing framework for returning capital to shareholders through a sustainable common dividend, combined with an active share repurchase program and continued debt reduction, creates an attractive value proposition for shareholders, while also improving the company's long-term financial position. With the first phase of our shareholder return framework initiated, we have the options in future years to invest in cash flow growth. We have the ability to grow oil and gas cash flow through higher production, but also have multiple investment opportunities across our other businesses. As evidenced by our guidance for 2022, we do not intend to grow production in 2022. At the point where it is appropriate to invest in future cash flow growth, we will only do so if supported by long-term demand. Any future production growth will be limited to an average annual rate of approximately 5%.\nI'll now turn the call over to Rob, who will walk you through our shareholder return framework.\n\nRobert L. Peterson\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Vicki, and good afternoon. As Vicki mentioned, the first phase of our shareholder return framework consists of the debt reduction, an increase in the common dividend [of] $0.13 per share and the reactivation expansion of our share repurchase program. With net debt expected to be below $25 billion by the end of the first quarter, we are ready to begin returning more capital to shareholders, but we'll continue to prioritize debt reduction to focus on our medium-term goal of regaining our investment-grade credit rating.\nWe place high importance on debt reduction for the reasons I highlighted last quarter, mainly that as debt is reduced, our company's enterprise value rebalance to the benefit of our shareholders. We recognize that oil prices are uncertain and may remain volatile, particularly in the current environment. We then prioritize our time of initial $5 billion of debt to drive our net debt towards our next milestone of $20 billion. When this milestone is achieved, our balance sheet will improve significantly even from where we are today.\nWe intend to provide our shareholders with a competitive common dividend while maintaining a long cycle cash flow breakeven at $40 WTI or less. The long-term sustainability of dividend will be enhanced by continued deleveraging and share repurchases as well as our best-in-class capital efficiency and a deep low-cost portfolio of assets. As debt retire, our cash interest payments will decrease for (inaudible) can be used to support future common dividend growth. In addition to the increase in the common dividend $0.13 per share, we intend to purchase approximately $3 billion of outstanding shares of common stock. Maintaining an active share repurchase program with the benefit of a healthy balance sheet will potentially enable us to grow the dividend on a per share basis at a faster rate. As evidenced by our progress reducing debt last year, debt retirement remains a higher cash flow priority than share repurchase program.\nWe intend to make substantial progress towards retiring an additional $5 billion of debt before initiating share repurchases. It is our goal to reward shareholders with a triple benefit of a sustainable common benefit, an active share repurchase program and a continuously strengthening financial position. We believe the shareholder return framework we have detailed this afternoon delivers these benefits and remaining as transparent for shareholders.\nI'll now turn to our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted profit of $1.48 and a reported profit of $1.37 per diluted share. Our adjusted income improved significantly through 2021, with the fourth quarter being the strongest quarter of the year. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices and volumes as well as OxyChem's excellent financial performance.\nOur domestic oil and gas expenses experienced a sizable reduction on a BOE basis from the previous quarter and reflect a more normalized environment, absent any significant weather disruptions. The strong performance of our businesses, combined with the benefit of a healthy commodity prices, enabled us to deliver another consecutive quarter of record free cash flow.\nOn our third quarter call, we announced the completion of our large-scale divestiture program, but reiterated our intention to continue seeing opportunities to optimize our portfolio to create shareholder value. In November, we completed a bolt-on acquisition to increase our working interest in EOR assets that we'd operate. And in January 2022, we divested a small package of Permian acreage that have yet no immediate plan to develop. The purchase and sales prices of these transactions largely offset each other, while the EOR acquisition added approximately 5,000 [BOE per day] of low decline production as well as increasing our inventory of potential CCUS opportunity.\nWe exited the fourth quarter approximately $2.8 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet after repaying approximately $2.2 billion of debt in the quarter. In total, last year, we paid approximately $6.7 billion of debt and retired $750 million of notional interest rate swaps. Our debt reduction continues to drive a pronounced improvement in our credit profile. Since our last call, both Fitch and S&P upgraded our credit ratings to BB+, 1 notch [flow] investment grade, and Moody's assigned us a positive outlook on our debt.\nReducing the amount of cash is committed to interest payments today place us in a stronger position for a sustainable return of capital in the future. We estimate that the balance sheet improvements executed in 2021 will reduce interest and financing costs by almost $250 million per year going forward, which will fund approximately half of the increase in our common dividend.\nOur business incurred a negative working capital change in the fourth quarter. It was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable balance due to higher commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, an increase in inventories, including a higher number of barrels on the water at year-end.\nThe oil and gas hedges we had in place rolled off at the end of the fourth quarter, and we are now positioned to take full advantage of the current commodity price environment. We recognize the possibility of a swoop change in commodity prices always exist. The debt maturity profile we have today is far more [mantle] than it was 2 years ago, and our liquidity profile remains robust.\nIn addition to cash on hand, we have $4.4 billion of committed unutilized bank facility. We continue to believe that reducing debt and maintaining maximum flexibility in our capital plans is the most effective long-term solution to managing risk while providing shareholders the benefits of commodity price gain.\nWe expect our full year production to average 1.155 million BOE per day in 2022. Production in the first quarter of [2022] is expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the timing impact of wells that are brought online in 2021, severe winter weather in the Permian earlier this month and the impact of significant planned international turnaround activities this quarter. Algeria, Al Hosn and Dolphin are all undergoing scheduled maintenance in the first quarter, which is reflected in international production guidance. downtime associated with Al Hosn is notably larger than typical years as the plant is undergoing the first full shutdown since its inception to substantially complete the tie-ins associated with the expansion projects and to enhance plant's sustainability and reliability.\nAdditionally, a portion of our international production is subject to production sharing contracts, where we typically receive fewer barrels in a higher price environment, the impact of which is captured in our full year and first quarter guidance.\nThe Permian activity we added late in the fourth quarter is expected to replace the production benefit received in 2021 and completed our DJ rate -- our inventory of DJ Basin of drilled uncompleted wells in the early part of last year. Our 2022 permitting capital allocation is expected to provide benefits that will last into 2023. We anticipate that our activity this year will provide us the flexibility to either hold Permian [inflection] flat at our 2022 exit rate for similar capital next year or spend less capital in 2023, the whole production relatively flat to our 2022 average. We also expect that our production in 2022 will increase throughout the year to achieve our full year guidance as our international operations will resume the normal production levels or activity in the Permian brings new production online.\nAdditionally, the trajectory of operating production is anticipated to offset lower production in Rockies this year as our activity in the DJ Basin is tapered, reflected development planning timing to ensure efficient operations as new products are obtained. Partially offsetting lower Rockies production with higher Permian production, combined with the increase in EOR activity will result in a slightly higher domestic operating expense as the DJ Basin has one of the lowest operating costs on a BOE basis in our portfolio. The increase in Permian production is expected to result in domestic cash margins improving by -- in 2022 as the company-wide oil cut increases approximately 54.5%.\nThe mid-cycle level of capital we intend to spin this year provides flexibility to sustain production in 2023 and beyond at our multiyear sustaining capital level of $3.2 billion in a $40 price environment. We expect that OxyChem's 2022 earnings will exceed even 2021. OxyChem continues to benefit from continued demand improvement at caustic soda, while PVC pricing remains strong. Additionally, as I mentioned on our last call, we expect corn markets to remain tight as chlor-alkali producers seek the highest value for their products. OxyChem's integration to cost multiple corn derivatives enables us to optimize our production mix to supply the products the market requires, whether this is for corn-to-water treatment, vinyls or PVC, for example.\nThis year, we will make an incremental capital investment as it could be the feed study for the modernization of certain Gulf Coast chlor-alkali assets from diaphram to membrane technology. Modernizing these assets would result in material energy efficiency improvements, which will also lower the carbon intensity per ton of the product produced and delivered. The project would also provide the opportunity for a significant expansion of our existing capacity to meet growing demand for our key products. We expect to reach final investment decision later this year, at which time, we will be prepared to share additional details.\nTo assist investors to reconcile our guidance with our segment earnings, we have made a change in how we guide midstream going forward. Our midstream guidance now includes income from WES, which is a change to how we've guided midstream previously. Quarterly guidance now includes Oxy's portion of WES income using the average of the previous 4 publicly available quarters. Our annual guidance now includes Oxy's portion of WES income using the sum of the previous 4 publicly available quarters.\nAs you look to the year ahead, we will work to continue to improve on the numerous operational and financial success of 2021, including making additional inroads on reducing debt, (inaudible) pluming our shareholder return framework and advancing our low-carbon aspirations.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Vicki.\n\nVicki A. Hollub\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\nThank you, Rob. When we established Low Carbon Ventures in 2018, we knew we were ahead of the curve in recognizing the opportunity and necessity of building a carbon management business, both to help reduce global emissions and to enhance our business. At that time, we were focused on key technologies and projects that would reduce Oxy's emissions and provide a more sustainable future business. .\nToday, we have advanced that vision and fully appreciate the vast scope of the carbon management opportunity as well as the cross-industry support and partnership in front of us. On past earnings calls, we had discussed several of the initiatives Low Carbon Ventures is developing and Oxy's ambition to achieve net zero before 2050. We've been working on key technology developments and important commercial needs to advance projects that are now in a position to move more fully -- and more fully detail our low carbon business and how it positions us to realize our net-zero ambition and improve our long-term business.\nOn March 23, we will host a Low Carbon Ventures investor update, where we will provide a detailed update on our low-carbon strategy with a focus on the technology and commercial development of carbon-capture projects, specifically direct air capture. The event, which we expect may last up to 2.5 hours, will be accessible through our website. As I've said before, we are excited about our unique position and capabilities as a company. We value our broader low-carbon and business partnerships that are growing, and our workforce is energized to advance this immense opportunity before us.\nWe'll now open the call for your questions."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Emerson, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nIDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn reviewing our third quarter 2025 results and updated 2025 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless otherwise noted.\n[Operator Instructions] Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Emerson.\n\nAndrew Emerson\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate and CAG Finance\n\nGood morning. I'm pleased to take you through our third quarter results and provide an updated outlook for our full year 2025 financial expectations. In terms of highlights in the quarter, IDEXX delivered strong financial results supported by outstanding commercial execution in our Companion Animal business with benefits from recently launched IDEXX Innovations. Revenue increased 13% as reported and 12% organically, supported by over 10% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting over 8% gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions.\nWe achieved another quarter of strong premium instrument placements, including over 1,750 IDEXX InVue Dx analyzers, resulting in 71% organic growth of CAG instrument revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Q3 was negatively impacted by declines in U.S. same-store clinical visits of 1.2%, driven by ongoing macro and sector pressures.\nIDEXX's operating performance was excellent in the quarter with comparable operating margin gains of 120 basis points, supported by gross margin expansion which benefited from strong recurring revenue growth. High operating profit gains enabled earnings per share of $3.40 in the quarter, resulting in EPS growth of 15% on a comparable basis.\nWe're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $43 million at midpoint, with an updated range of $4.27 billion to $4.3 billion, an outlook for overall reported revenue growth of 9.6% to 10.3%. Our updated full year overall organic revenue growth outlook is for 8.8% to 9.5%, with organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.2%. These organic growth ranges represent approximately a 1% increase at midpoint to our previous guidance, supported by strong global execution in our CAG business.\nWe're increasing our full year EPS outlook to $12.81 to $13.01 per share, up $0.33 per share at midpoint, reflecting 12% to 14% comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2025 financial expectations later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of the third quarter results.\nThird quarter organic revenue growth of 12% was driven by 12% CAG revenue gains, 7% growth in our Water business and 14% gains in LPD. Strong CAG results were supported by CAG Diagnostics reoccurring revenue growth of 10% organically, including average global net price improvement of 4% to 4.5% and benefits from CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues increasing 71% organically, aided by global placements of InVue Dx.\nU.S. organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues grew 8% in Q3, supported by solid volume gains and 4% benefit from net price realization. U.S. same-store clinical visits declined 1.2% in the quarter, reflecting an IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits of approximately 950 basis points, highlighting outstanding performance by the IDEXX teams.\nQ3 benefited from aging pets with non-wellness visits declining only 30 basis points year-over-year while wellness visits declined 2.5%. Health services continued to expand in the quarter, including increased diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit for both well and nonwellness visits as customers expand the use of diagnostics in their care protocols.\nInternational CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue grew 14% organically in Q3, including approximately a 1% benefit related to equivalent days. Revenue performance was driven by volume gains, including benefits of net new customers and same-store sales utilization. International regions have sustained strong growth on a days adjusted basis for the past 10 quarters, highlighting the significant global opportunity as we invest in global commercial capabilities and expansions.\nIDEXX innovation and commercial execution also delivered strong organic revenue gains across testing modalities globally in the third quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 16% on an organic basis in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international regions. Consumable revenue growth was supported by expansion of our premium instrument installed base and expanded testing utilization, including benefits from recent product launches.\nInVue Dx utilization is tracking well to our reoccurring revenue estimates previously provided of $3,500 to $5,500 per analyzer, and we're excited for the upcoming launch of FNA starting with mast cell tumor detection.\nCAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q3 compared to prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 5,665 units, an increase of 37% year-over-year. The quality of placements remains excellent, reflected in 1,203 global new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 347 in North America. Globally, we placed 1,753 IDEXX InVue Dx instruments as we continue to meet customer demand for this highly innovative analyzer. Ongoing progress of placing instruments combined with high customer retention levels supported the 10% year-over-year growth in our premium instrument installed base in the quarter.\nIDEXX Global Reference Lab revenues increased 9% organically in Q3, up approximately 4% growth from the second quarter, driven by solid volume growth across regions, including expanded same-store volume benefits and net new customer gains. IDEXX Cancer Dx continues to gain further traction in North America, reaching nearly 5,000 customers through October. Global rapid assay revenues declined 5% organically in Q3. Rapid assay results continue to be impacted by customers shifting pancreatic lipase testing to our Catalyst instrument platform, which we estimate to be a 6% headwind in Q3 revenue growth.\nVeterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging organic revenues increased 11%, driven by recurring revenues which grew 10% during the quarter. Solid growth in veterinary software was supported by a strong double-digit growth of cloud-based PIMS installations and adoption of related reoccurring services. We also saw continued strong double-digit year-over-year growth of diagnostic imaging system placements in the quarter.\nWater revenues increased 7% organically in Q3 with strong growth in international regions and solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 14% organically in the quarter with double-digit gains across most regions.\nTurning to the P&L, strong revenue growth enabled 16% comparable operating profit gains. Gross profit increased 15% in the quarter as reported and 13% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.8%, up approximately 80 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflect benefits from strong reoccurring revenue growth and IDEXX VetLab consumables and reference lab volumes along with operational productivity and pricing benefits, which offset inflationary cost pressures. Reported gross margin gains were moderated by 10 basis points of foreign exchange impacts, net of hedge positions.\nOn a reported basis, operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year as we advance investments in our global commercial and innovation capabilities. Q3 earnings per share was $3.40 per share, including benefit of $14 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity.\nIncome tax includes a $0.09 negative impact related to accelerating tax deductions for previously incurred research expenses allowed under the new U.S. tax legislation, which benefits cash taxes while increasing our effective tax rate in the period. Foreign exchange added $1.9 million to operating profit and $0.02 to EPS in Q3, net of hedge effects, reflecting a comparable EPS increase of 15%.\nFree cash flow was $371 million in Q3 and $964 million on a trailing 12-month basis, with a net income to free cash flow conversion rate of 94%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for free cash flow conversion to 95% to 100% of net income. This increase includes a 10% cash tax benefit primarily related to $105 million of acceleration of tax deductions for previously incurred research expenses allowed under recent U.S. tax legislation and a refined outlook for our full year capital spending of approximately $140 million.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We finished the period with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.5x net of cash. We continue to deploy capital towards share repurchases, allocating $242 million during the third quarter and contributing to $985 million on a year-to-date basis, supporting a 2.7% year-over-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding through Q3.\nTurning to our full year 2025. As noted, we're increasing our outlook for overall revenue to $4.27 billion to $4.3 billion. At midpoint, this reflects approximately $43 million of operational improvement, building on strong third quarter performance, including CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue expansion and increased InVue Dx revenue expectations.\nOur updated revenue growth outlook is for 9.6% to 10.3% growth as reported, including a 0.8% full year growth benefit and 2% growth benefit in Q4 from foreign exchange at the rates outlined in our press release. As a sensitivity, a 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce revenue by approximately $4 million and EPS by $0.01 for the remainder of the year.\nThe updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 8.8% to 9.5% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 7.5% to 8.2% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, including a consistent 4% to 4.5% benefit from global net price realization. At midpoint, during Q4, we're assuming U.S. clinical visits continue to decline at levels moderately better than the year-to-date average. We are again increasing our expectations for our InVue Dx, which we now expect to be approximately 6,000 during 2025, with instrument revenues of over $65 million as we continue to see strong demand from this exciting new platform.\nIn terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook to 31.6% to 31.8% in 2025, reflecting an increased expectation for 80 to 100 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement net of 180 basis point operating margin benefit related to the discrete litigation expense impacts and updated foreign exchange effects.\nAs noted previously, IDEXX remains well positioned to navigate the ongoing changes in the trade landscape with a largely U.S.-based manufacturing footprint. We remain focused on continuous supply to customers while actively managing cost impacts, which will continue to play out into 2026.\nOur updated full year earnings per share outlook is $12.81 to $13.01 per share, an increase of $0.33 per share at midpoint. Our EPS outlook incorporates increased projections for operational improvement of $0.22 at midpoint compared to our prior guide. We've also incorporated lower effective tax rate benefits, including $0.09 of share-based compensation activity compared to the prior outlook, partially offset by other tax impacts including the noted acceleration of research expense deductions under the new U.S. tax legislation. Updated estimates for interest expense, average share count reduction and foreign exchange impacts have also been incorporated, with additional details available in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot.\nThat concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning. IDEXX delivered very strong financial performance in the third quarter while advancing our strategic priorities globally. Our proven model of high-touch commercial engagement, combined with differentiated testing and workflow innovations continue to drive adoption of IDEXX's world-class diagnostic and software solutions. These capabilities directly support our [ customers ] [indiscernible] to deliver the highest standards of care, enabled through greater diagnostic frequency and utilization in everyday practice.\nDiagnostics remains the fastest-growing revenue stream within veterinary clinics, a durable trend reflecting the central role testing plays in determining patient health status and guiding treatment decisions. Our financial results in the quarter were underpinned by accelerating gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across major regions. Growth in recurring revenues reflects multiple execution drivers, including double-digit growth of our premium installed base, instrument installed base, sustained strong new customer gains, solid net price realization and continued momentum in cloud-based software adoption.\nImportantly, these results were supported by continued momentum in our innovation playbook, highlighted by strong placements of InVue Dx, growing adoption of Cancer Dx and benefits from the expanding Catalyst menu, including early uptake of Catalyst Cortisol. IDEXX solutions, anchored by our integrated software-enabled multi-modality approach, are well positioned to help clinics enhance efficiency, expand diagnostics reach and deliver exceptional patient care.\nBuilding on the groundbreaking innovations we launched in 2025, and as highlighted at our August Investor Day, we will further expand our Cancer Dx franchise in 2026 with the addition of mast cell tumor, another high-impact cancer biomarker to the panel. We also plan to bring Cancer Dx panel to international markets starting in Q1 2026, extending its reach and accelerating our global leadership in veterinary cancer diagnostics.\nOur commercial organization again delivered outstanding performance in Q3. Across geographies, our teams drove very strong instrument placements, with a high quality of placements supporting outstanding year-on-year growth of economic value placements, a key measure of future recurring revenue gains. Retention of our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue remained in the high 90s, reflecting the enduring loyalty and press that veterinarians place in IDEXX. This loyalty is not simply the result of world-class products. It reflects the strength of our customer engagement and support model where IDEXX representatives serve as true partners in helping practices improve medical outcomes and business performance.\nIn the U.S., growth was fueled by strong volume gains, including benefits from adoption of new innovations alongside sustained strong new and competitive Catalyst placements. Our teams are effectively engaging practices, whether start-ups outfitting their practice for the first time or established clinics seeking to upgrade and expand capabilities.\nAccelerated growth in the important diagnostics frequency metric as well as utilization per clinical visit is a critical driver of success, enhancing patient care while creating durable growth for both clinics and IDEXX.\nWe are also benefiting from corporate account relationship extensions and expansions. These relationships represent significant multiyear growth opportunities as practices transition volume into IDEXX's ecosystem of diagnostic software and services. Importantly, these partnerships are increasingly structured to elevate care at the practice level, to greater diagnostics frequency, utilization, workflow optimization and expanded menu adoption.\nInternationally, we delivered double-digit installed base growth for the 11th consecutive quarter, with the step-up in the growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth across major regions. Our commercial strategies are globally tailored to regional dynamics supported by strong reference laboratory networks and backed by an innovation approach that ensures high product market fit, such as with ProCyte One and SNAP Leishmania expanding diagnostic frequency in international regions continues to be a key growth lever, elevating the standard of care and expanding the sector opportunity.\nWe remain committed to investing in our commercial footprint where the customer readiness and growth potential are strongest. We are on track with plans to expand in 3 international countries by the start of 2026, while also enhancing our U.S. commercial footprint. These are high-return investments, reducing the number of customers per account manager, supporting more frequent engagement, strengthening loyalty and driving adoption of IDEXX solutions.\nThe commercial organization's ability to consistently deliver growth across varying geographies and macroeconomic conditions demonstrates the durability of our model. Practices continue to prioritize diagnostics and software because they are foundational to their mission, and IDEXX is their partner of choice.\nTurning to our innovation update, let me begin with Catalyst Cortisol, the newest addition to our Catalyst platform. Launched in North America in late July and at the end of the third quarter internationally, Catalyst Cortisol is already seeing strong momentum with over 1/4 of Catalyst customers in North America adopting test within the first 3 months of launch. This is among the fastest adoptions for Catalyst menu expansion, underscoring both the clinical need and the level of customer anticipation.\nCatalyst Cortisol enables veterinarians to rapidly measure cortisone levels at the point of care, supporting diagnosis and monitoring of adrenal conditions such as Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease. These conditions are often complex and require real-time insights to guide treatment decisions. With Catalyst Cortisol, veterinarians can deliver highly accurate results during the patient visit, avoiding delays, reducing callbacks and increasing confidence in treatment planning.\nThe addition of cortisol was the most frequently requested Catalyst menu expansion from customers, a clear signal of its importance to clinical practice. The rapid uptake we've seen validates the power of listening closely to our customers, and then delivering innovation that directly addresses their highest priority needs from both a testing accuracy standpoint in workflow friendly way.\nThis is also a great example of our technology for life strategy. By continually expanding the Catalyst menu, we increase both the medical and economic value of the installed base. With nearly 77,000 Catalyst instruments and practices globally, each new menu expansion represents a lever for increased utilization [indiscernible] improved care and long-term recurring revenue.\nAlongside Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase, which has already achieved adoption across over 50% of the available installed base and Catalyst Smart QC, which is simplifying quality control workflows, Catalyst Cortisol is strengthening catalyst position as the most versatile, value-creating chemistry, immunoassay and electrolyte platform in veterinary medicine.\nMoving to InVue Dx. By the end of Q3, we have placed over 4,400 InVue Dx analyzers globally year-to-date, exceeding our expectations in reinforcing the momentum that began with preorders last year. This represents one of the most successful product rollouts in IDEXX's history. This strong start gives us confidence to once again raise our full year outlook to approximately 6,000 placements.\nCustomer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with veterinarians consistently highlighting workflow transformation, diagnostic confidence and powerful clinical insight as the most meaningful benefits. The [indiscernible] cytology workflow reduces technicians' time improves consistency and delivers results while the patients are still under practice. At the same time, AI models, now trained on more than 60 million cellular images, provide reliable, high-quality insights that elevate standards of care.\nFrequent software updates, as often as every other week, continuously expand these capabilities, enhancing accuracy and ensuring clinicians always benefit from the latest advancements. A great example of this is a recent update that reduced time to result of an ear cytology to approximately 8 minutes. Utilization for ear cytology or blood morphology has been robust and well-aligned with our expectations. Both of these broad-use categories have great use cases in everyday practice, serving as high-frequency diagnostics to support patient care across a wide range of conditions. Their adoption underscores the value of InVue Dx in addressing routine, repeatable testing needs to drive workflow efficiency and strengthen clinical confidence.\nImportantly, success in these initial categories provide a strong foundation for the platform, creating natural momentum as we expand the menu into additional high-value areas, such as oncology with the addition of fine needle aspirate, which remains on track for rollout later this year.\nImportantly, InVue Dx not only driving placements in consumables, but also strengthening customer loyalty and long-term contractual relationships. Many practices adopting InVue are expanding their broader IDEXX commitments with some extending agreements ahead of schedule to secure access to this transformative platform.\nTurning to Cancer Dx. Momentum remains strong with nearly 5,000 practices to date adopting these tests within just a few quarters of launch. Utilization is tracking well with expectations and we continue to be encouraged by competitive customer adoption, now over 17% of customers. This reflects growing awareness and underscores Cancer Dx's importance as a new standard in veterinary oncology. While the majority of samples are still being used to aid in the diagnosis of canine lymphoma, the number of practices incorporating the test into wellness protocols is nearing parity, enabling early detection and improved patient outcomes.\nThe clinical need for oncology screening is clear. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among dogs, and early detection is critical to improving outcomes. Cancer Dx provides veterinarians with a cost-effective, highly sensitive tool that integrates seamlessly into a standard wellness visit. Looking ahead, our Cancer Dx road map is ambitious as we expand internationally and [indiscernible] tumor detection in one additional cancer next year. With canine lymphoma and mast cell tumor detection Cancer Dx platform will address over 1/3 of all canine cancer cases. Mast cell tumors are top of mind with pet parents because they can often feel the lumps and bumps while petting or cuddling with their dog, and early detection can significantly improve the clinical outcome for an affected dog. The upcoming availability of [ FNA ] for lumps and bumps on InVue Dx will allow for cytology results during the patient visit, helping to provide clarity to a concern to apparent.\nWe have a couple of important highlights in our software business, specifically related to the broad-based adoption of our cloud-based products, reflecting the strength of IDEXX's vertical SaaS model purpose built for animal health. Veterinarians across all stages of their careers recognize the workflow efficiencies and easy use that our solutions provide, enabling them to spend more time delivering care and less time on administrative tasks. Our cloud-native PIM platforms delivered double-digit installed base growth again this quarter, surpassing a milestone, now with over 10,000 locations, and strong adoption among both independent practices and enterprise customers with multi-location groups. Customers are choosing IDEXX for our growing vertical SaaS platform where integrated modules create seamless workflows for clinicians and connectivity with diagnostics and increasingly for pet parents with Vello.\nVello, our client engagement platform continued to expand in Q3, with active clinics growing over 20% sequentially and over half of PIMS bookings in the quarter included available subscription. Clinics using Vello report higher appointment adherence, increased diagnostics compliance and greater client satisfaction, all of which translated to higher visit volumes and revenue growth. The integration of Vello with our diagnostics and PIMS ecosystem further amplifies its value, making it an increasingly important part of IDEXX's long-term growth engine.\nAs we conclude, I want to extend my deep gratitude to our 11,000 IDEXX employees worldwide. Your commitment to innovation, customer partnership and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver results like these.\nQ3 was another quarter where innovation and commercial execution came together to drive strong financial performance and advanced veterinary care. As diagnostics sit at the center of the veterinary system of care, IDEXX will remain at the forefront of advancing standards, unlocking practice productivity and driving sustainable growth.\nNow please open the line for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions].\nToday's prepared remarks will be posted in the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Emerson.\n\nAndrew Emerson\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate and CAG Finance\n\nGood morning. I'm pleased to take you through our second quarter results and provide an update on our full year 2025 financial outlook. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered another quarter of strong financial results supported by continued strong global execution in our companion animal business with momentum building in the adoption of IDEXX innovations. Revenue increased 11% as reported and 9% organically, supported by nearly 7.5% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued gains in the U.S. and double-digit expansion in the international regions. Overall, organic revenue benefited by approximately 200 basis points from CAG instrument revenues, delivering a record quarter of premium instrument placements, including nearly 2,400 IDEXX inVue DX instruments. Partially offsetting these benefits, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was constrained by impacts from macro in sector headwinds, leading to a 2.5% decline in U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels in the quarter. IDEXX's operating performance continued to be strong in Q2, reflected in operating profit growth of 14% on a comparable basis net of approximately 27% benefit from lapping a discrete litigation expense in Q2 2024. Operating profit benefited from solid revenue growth and operating margin gains, which were led by gross margin expansion. High operating profit gains enabled earnings per share of $3.63 in the quarter, resulting in EPS growth of 17% on a comparable basis net of $0.56 EPS growth benefit related to the comparison of the prior year period discrete litigation expense and a $0.10 benefit from share-based compensation. IDEXX execution remains strong as we advance our innovation agenda in the CAG businesses while continuing to work through pressure on clinical visit levels. We're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $90 million at midpoint with an updated range of $4.25 billion to $4.29 billion. This reflects an outlook for overall reported revenue growth of 7.7% to 9.7%, including strong Q2 performance and increased inVue DX instrument revenue, along with favorable impacts from foreign exchange updates.\nOur updated full year overall organic revenue growth outlook is for 7% to 9% with organic CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 5.8% to 8%. These organic growth ranges represent 0.5% increase at midpoint to our previous outlook supported by strong global execution in our CAG business. We're increasing our EPS outlook to $12.40 to $12.76 per share, up $0.40 per share at midpoint, reflecting 9% to 13% full year comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2025 financial outlook later in my comments.\nLet's begin with a review of our second quarter results and recent sector trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 9% was driven by 10% CAG revenue gains, 8% growth in our Water business and 3% gains in LPD. Strong CAG results were supported by CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, which increased nearly 7.5% organically, including global average net price improvement of approximately 4% and benefits from CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues increasing 62% organically aided by inVue Dx placements. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by 11% organic gains in international regions, another quarter of double-digit expansion. Strong international performance continues to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in solid volume gains, benefiting from new business and double-digit year-over-year expansion of our premium instrument installed base as well as benefits from net price realization. U.S. organic CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues grew 6% in Q2, supported by solid volume gains and 3.5% benefit from net price realization. U.S. clinical visits declined 2.5% in the quarter, reflecting an IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits of approximately 800 basis points up modestly from the first quarter.\nDiagnostic frequency and utilization for clinical visit continued to expand solidly at the clinic level, highlighting the important and expanding role of diagnostics for those seeking veterinary services. IDEXX innovation and commercial execution delivered organic revenue gains in our major testing modalities globally in the second quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% on an organic basis in the second quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally. Consumable revenue expansion is supported by testing utilization across regions, including benefits from recent product launches and high customer retention levels, while our commercial teams further build our global premium instrument installed base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q2 compared to prior year levels, reaching a quarterly record aided by broad availability of inVue Dx. Total premium placements reached 6,070 units, an increase of 23% year-over-year. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 1,091 global new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 346 new and competitive placements in North America. IDEXX inVue Dx placements of 2,388 were driven by strong demand for our new highly differentiated platform. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 10% year-over-year growth in our premium instrument installed base, and we're looking forward to building on this momentum during the second half of the year.\nIDEXX Global Reference Lab revenues increased 5% organically in Q2, an increase of approximately 2% from the first quarter on a days adjusted basis. Global reference lab gains continued to be driven by solid volume growth, including initial benefits from IDEXX Cancer DX. Global Rapid assay revenues declined 3% organically in Q2, and Rapid Assay results were constrained by customers shifting pancreatic lipase testing to our Catalyst instrument platform, which we estimated to be a 5% headwind in Q2 revenue growth. Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging organic revenues increased 9%, driven by recurring revenues, reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in our cloud-based software installations.\nWater revenues increased 8% organically in Q2 with growth driven by double-digit revenue expansion in our international regions and solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 3% organically in the quarter, led by commercial execution in North America and Asia Pacific.\nTurning to the P&L. We had another quarter of strong profit gains in Q2 reflected in 130 basis points of comparable operating margin expansion, net of approximately basis points benefit from lapping a now concluded discrete litigation expense in Q2 2024. Gross profit increased 12% in the quarter as reported and 11% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 62.6%, up approximately 110 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflected benefits from IDEXX VetLab consumable growth, lab productivity and operational improvements and pricing, which offset inflationary cost effects. Reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 20 basis point negative impact related to foreign exchange changes, net of our hedge positions. On a reported basis, operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year, reflecting a 19% favorable growth rate impact from comparison to prior year levels, which included a $61.5 million expense in the now concluded litigation matter. Adjusting for this effect, operating expense growth was modestly below revenue growth at 9% as we continue to invest in innovation and commercial capabilities while supporting operating margin gains.\nQ2 EPS was $3.63 per share, including benefit of $8 million or $0.10 per share related to share-based compensation activity, and $0.07 from a discrete tax reserve release. Foreign exchange added $3 million to operating profit and $0.03 to EPS in Q2, net of hedge effects reflecting comparable EPS increase of 17%. Free cash flow was $152 million in Q2 and $360 million in the first half of 2025. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 80%, including approximately 8% unfavorable impact from the approximately $80 million judgment payment related to the now concluded litigation noted on prior calls.\nFor full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 85%, reflecting consistent outlook for full year capital spending of approximately $160 million. Our balance sheet remains strong. We finished the period with leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.6x net of cash. During the quarter, we repaid approximately $103 million of long-term notes and continued to deploy capital towards share repurchases, allocating $329 million during the second quarter. For the first half of the year, we've allocated $744 million of capital to share repurchases, supporting a 2.7% year-over-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding for this period aligned with our previously stated expectations.\nTurning to our full year 2025 outlook. As noted, we're increasing our projected range for overall revenue to $4.25 billion to $4.2 billion. At midpoint, this reflects approximately $20 million operational improvement, building on strong second quarter performance and increased InVue Dx revenue expectations along with approximately $70 million benefit from updated foreign exchange impacts at the rates outlined in our press release. Our updated revenue growth outlook is 7.7% to 9.7% as reported, including approximately 0.7% for full year growth benefit from foreign exchange. As a sensitivity, a 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce revenue by approximately $8 million and EPS by $0.03 for the year.\nOur updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 7% to 9% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 5.8% to 8% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, including consistent 4% to 4.5% benefit of global net price realization and U.S. clinical visit declines aligned with more recent trends at midpoint. We're increasing our expectations for inVue Dx to 5,500 placements during the year, with instrument revenue expected to be over $60 million, building off strong demand signals for the platform.\nIn terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook for 2025 to 31.3% to 31.6%, reflecting increased expectations for 50 to 80 basis points for full year comparable operating margin improvement, net of 180 basis point operating margin benefit related to the discrete litigation expense impacts an updated foreign exchange effects. This outlook also incorporates commercial expansions in 4 countries during the second half of the year, including a modest expansion in the U.S. to support our growing portfolio of diagnostic solutions.\nWith respect to the dynamic trade environment, we remain well positioned to navigate the changing tariff landscape with our best estimates included in our outlook. Our primary objectives and ongoing efforts remain focused on continuous supply to customers and minimizing impacts through operational planning. Our updated full year EPS outlook is $12.40 to $12.76 per share, an increase of $0.40 per share at midpoint. Our EPS outlook incorporates increased projections for operational performance of $0.11 and foreign exchange benefit of $0.22 at midpoint compared to our prior guide. We've also updated our tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, now $15 million for the full year, an increase of $0.09 per share compared to our prior estimate. This is partially offset by $0.02 per share unfavorable tax impacts compared to our prior projections including benefits from the discrete tax reserve release and updated outlook for our base rate.\nFor the third quarter, we're planning for reported revenue growth in line with the implied second half growth range, including approximately 1% growth benefit from foreign exchange. At midpoint, the organic revenue growth outlook includes U.S. clinical visit growth in line with recent trends and expanding benefits from innovation including the Cortisol slide, which began shipping last week. We're planning for modest comparable operating margin expansion aligned with advancing additional commercial investments and timing of project spend. That now concludes our financial review.\nI'll turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning. IDEXX delivered a very strong quarter of performance as reflected in solid execution across all key drivers of our strategy. Our focus on supporting our customers [indiscernible] resulted in a rapid uptake of new innovations and the broader adoption of software tools that support practice workflow and staff. The demand for diagnostics reflects its foundational role in assessing the health of the patient. While macroeconomic pressures persist in many of our key regions, veterinary practices continued to prioritize investments in diagnostics and software that enhance efficiency to deliver clinical insight and support better outcomes. At the same time, pet owners are demonstrating a strong desire for a high standard of care; particularly for an aging pet population. In Q2, diagnostics frequency, the percentage of clinical visits that included a diagnostic test sustained at 50 basis points year-on-year in growth, an important metric we track.\nThe continued growth in diagnostics use underscores pet owners focus on early detection and comprehensive treatment to support longevity welding. It also highlights the willingness to pay for advanced veterinary services where complex health issues may be of concern. IDEXX is extremely well positioned to support these broad care objectives with our expanding menu of innovative diagnostics, testing platforms and our cloud-native software solutions that provides advantages in detecting disease and supporting patient workflow, helping practices support more patient visits productively comes at a time when many still face staffing and client service challenges. Our commercial teams again demonstrated outstanding execution delivering record premium instrument placements globally and driving solid growth in recurring revenues.\nIn Q2, we delivered double-digit growth in our premium instrument installed base compared to the prior year, led by the ramping of IDEXX inVue Dx placements and high sustained momentum in our chemistry and hematology solutions. North America delivered a historic record Q2 quarter placements and economic value, supported by the unrestrained launch of inVue Dx and well over 300 competitive and greenfield catalysts. We continue to see significant engagement across new greenfield and competitive accounts, reflecting practices desire to invest in best-in-breed innovative solutions that improve patient care and clinic productivity. Supporting this, there was a strong trend in new practice formation in Q2 with IDEXX selected in a high number of instances as the partner of choice in outfitting these practices with a full portfolio of IDEXX solutions.\nInternationally, our teams achieved double-digit growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, supported by the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit installed base growth. This success is a result of peripheral strategies tailored for local country circumstances with excellent product market fit and network of reference labs supporting high service levels and an expanding commercial footprint. As Andrew mentioned in his full year guidance, we are making commercial investments to expand 3 more international country organizations as well as modestly enhancing the U.S. commercial team. These high-return investments are a reflection of the confidence we have in growing these geographies and supporting a broader portfolio of diagnostic products that are resonating strongly with customers. These expansions are key enablers to support an expanding set of innovations ranging from the launch of IDEXX Cancer Dx and inVue Dx to new additions like catalyst cortisol and pancreatic lipase. Each of these products represents a meaningful advancement in our veterinary diagnostics offering and their successful adoption supports long-term growth. There are also significant benefits to decreasing the number of customers that each account manager is responsible for. As our experience is that customers use more diagnostics as part of their care protocols when we visit them more often.\nWe expect to have these expanded organizations in place by the start of 2026. A key focus of our commercial organization is ensuring that placements are high quality and positioned to drive strong recurring revenues over time. We continue to prioritize placements and practices where IDEXX solutions can deliver the most value to both clinicians and their clients. With inVue Dx as in addition to our premium instrument offering, we are seeing very strong double-digit growth in EV amongst our field teams as they have an opportunity to place both larger dollar value suites for a single inVue Dx addition to an existing IDEXX customer. As a testament to the value we deliver, Customer retention remained in the high 90s across diagnostic modalities. This enduring loyalty reflects the confidence veterinarians place in IDEXX to be their partner in providing excellent patient care and the ongoing investments we make to keep their solutions at the leading edge. IDEXX inVue Dx continues to be a transformational platform that is reshaping point-of-care cytology testing since broad commercial availability commenced in April. Demand has exceeded expectations. We have now placed nearly 2,700 instruments globally this year through June, giving us confidence to increase our 2025 placement estimate by 1,000 units from 4,500 to 5,500.\nFeedback from early adopters remains highly positive. Practices consistently highlight the Slide 3 intuitive workflow, rapid turnaround time and diagnostics confidence provided by inVue DX in its advanced AI-powered insights. Early consumables usage driven by testing in both ear cytology and blood morphology is highly encouraging. And with our expected launch of F&A for lumps and bumps later this year, inVue Dx will play an important role in supporting our long-term recurring revenue goals. InVue Dx also playing an important role in our recontracting activity as we saw a very high number of customers in Q2 and extend their relationship with us, often in advance of the date required to do so. A cornerstone of our strategy remains delivering differentiated diagnostic insights that elevate care and strengthen our leadership in the sector. The IDEXX Cancer Dx panel launched in late March through our North American reference laboratories have continued to gain traction among general practice and areas as well as oncology specialists. Since launch, over 2,500 practices have ordered the test. Moreover, of these customers adopting the test, almost 15% of sample submissions are coming from competitive Bob customers. The broad adoption of IDEXX Cancer DX is indicative of the value clinicians see in this test and the underserved need of early cancer screening. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among dogs, and IDEXX Cancer Dx provides veterinarians with a cost-effective, highly sensitive tool to detect canine lymphoma earlier. This enables earlier intervention and the possibility of significantly improved outcomes.\nInitial utilization patterns are consistent with our expectations, with customers using the test as both in aiding diagnosis and a small but growing number of practices more broadly incorporating Cancer Dx into most wellness screening panels. As awareness grows and we brought in a test and menu over time to incorporate new cancer types, we expect a multiplier to our reference lab testing volumes. Building off this early success we've seen in North America, we are preparing for the international roll out of Cancer DX in 2026. Early excitement from veterinarians in these regions underscores a significant global need for affordable and accessible cancer diagnostics. Last week, we launched Catalyst cortisol in North America, our third new catalyst test in less than a year, underscoring our commitment to expanding the platform's menu and our technology for live promise. Catalyst cortisol enables veterinarians to measure cortisol levels rapidly at the point of care, supporting the diagnosis and monitoring of adrenal conditions such as Cushing's disease and Addison's disease. The addition of cortisol to Catalyst is the most frequently requested menu expansion from our customers. Early customer response has been highly enthusiastic, highlighting the value of real-time results to guide treatment decisions during the patient visit.\nCatalyst pancreatic lipase launched globally last year, continues to perform well and meet strong customer demand. This innovative test offers a quantitative single-side solution that delivers rapid reliable results for both canine and feline patients suspected pancreatitis, a common and often challenging condition to diagnose early. Adoption has been robust with over 40% of our global Catalyst installed base already utilizing the test where available. This strong uptake reflects the test's clinical utility the value veterinarians place on speed and accuracy and diagnostic workflows and the continued expansion of our Catalyst menu to address important unmet needs in veterinary care. The Catalyst Smart which began shipping late last year, is also seeing strong adoption. Customers value the load and go monthly quality control process that ensures accurate results and instrument reliability.\nNew innovations made meaningful contributions to the growth of IDEXX VetLab consumables in the quarter. Our software ecosystem continues to be an essential component of IDEXX' differentiated value proposition. By delivering intuitive cloud dative solutions that integrate diagnostics, imaging, client engagement and practice operations, IDEXX software helps clinics improve efficiency in patient care while driving incremental recurring revenues for our business. Our cloud-based PIMS platforms such as ezyVet and Neo delivered solid double-digit installed base growth. with particularly strong demand for multi-location practices and corporate accounts. Clinics are choosing these solutions for their modern user experience, scalability and robust integration with the IDEXX Diagnostics ecosystem.\nVello, our pet owner engagement application saw continued momentum in Q2 with double-digit sequential growth in active users compared to Q1. Bell's integrated communication tools are helping clinics approve appointment adherence and drive compliance with recommended care. Early customer data shows that practices using Vello Experience increased visit volume, higher diagnostic serialization and better treatment plant compliance positive indicators that support our thesis that digital engagement drives better clinical outcomes. Our Diagnostic Imaging business continues to demonstrate strong momentum, too. extending clinical capability and streamlining imaging workflows, our low dose, high image quality radiographic imaging systems paired with our IDEXX Web PACS software provides seamless image viewing sharing and storage fully integrated into veterinary practice workflows. In the second quarter, we surpassed an installed base of 10,000 imaging systems in North America, with a comparable number of customers subscribing to IDEXX Web PACS, highlighting strong alignment between hardware adoption and recurring software engagement. While macroeconomic and sector dynamics remain fluid, including lingering, inflationary impact, pressuring clinical visits. We are confident in the durability of the veterinary market and the resilience of pet health care demand.\nPet ownership remains elevated and the aging pet population continues to expand, supporting higher levels of diagnostics utilization over time. Our focus remains on executing with discipline, supporting our customers through innovative solutions and investing in capabilities that position IDEXX to capture our significant long-term opportunity. Diagnostics sit at the center of the system of care and pet owner expectations for quality care continues to rise. IDEXX is well positioned to lead and our focus is on exceptional execution to deliver solid growth and profit gains. As I conclude our prepared remarks, I want to express my deep appreciation for our 11,000 IDEXX employees worldwide. The commitment to innovation, customer partnership and operational excellence, it's what enables us to deliver these results quarter after quarter. I'd also like to remind you that we will be hosting our annual Investor Day on August 14 at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine. This session will be streamlined for those unable to attend in person.\nWith that, we'll conclude the prepared portion of our call and open the line for questions."

Operating margin performance enabled EPS delivery of $2.96 per share, delivering 5% growth as reported and 7% growth on a comparable basis. We're pleased with the progress in expanding our business as we work through sector and macro factors that have pressured recent visit growth at the veterinary clinic level. We're confident in the long-term growth potential of our business, supported by ongoing focus on innovation, including our recent IDEXX Cancer Dx launch starting with canine lymphoma.\nWe've updated our 2025 financial outlook to incorporate positive changes from foreign exchange and a now concluded litigation expense accrual adjustment while reinforcing consistent 2025 goals for organic revenue growth and comparable operating margin improvement.\nLet's begin with a review of our first quarter results before transitioning to our full year outlook. First quarter organic revenue growth of 5% was driven by 4.5% organic revenue gains in our CAG business, 7% organic growth in Water and 4% organic growth in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 7% organic gains in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 9% organic recurring revenue growth. CAG instrument revenues decreased 5% organically against high prior year placement levels while benefiting from initial placements of IDEXX inVue Dx, which will ramp throughout the year.\nCAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased 4.5% organically in Q1, net of a 1.5% headwind from equivalent days. Global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth reflected solid gains across all major regions. On average, global net price improvement was 4%, and on a days adjusted basis, volume gains were approximately 2%. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth was 8.5%, and on a days adjusted basis, sustained double-digit organic revenue growth, reflecting benefits from net price realization and strong volume gains building on 2024 momentum.\nInternational results continue to be driven by IDEXX's execution reflected in strong new business gains, which supported double-digit year-over-year expansion of our premium instrument installed base. U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth was 3% in Q1, net of the days headwind. This reflects a continued solid growth premium compared to same-store U.S. clinic visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2.6% over on the quarter. IDEXX's solid growth reflects increased levels of diagnostic frequency and increased diagnostic utilization per clinical visit at the practice level, along with strong execution, including solid new business gains, sustained high levels of customer retention and net price realization of 3.5%.\nModality gains in the quarter were supported by strong growth in consumable revenues. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 10% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 9% year-over-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base. During Q1, we placed 4,163 CAG premium instruments, a decline of 13% against high prior year levels. Our focus on quality of instrument placements continues to be strong, reflected in sustained levels of competitive and greenfield Catalysts, including 7% growth in the U.S. and 5% gains in Europe, along with double-digit growth in our global EVI metric. In the U.S., we placed 1,544 instruments, an increase of 12% year-over-year supported by strong competitive and greenfield Catalyst placements.\nIn North America, we placed 302 IDEXX inVue Dx analyzers as we move from a controlled to full launch of our exciting new platform. Global Rapid Assay revenues declined 2% organically in Q1. Rapid Assay results were constrained by customers shifting pancreatic lipase testing to our Catalyst instrument platform, which we estimated to be a 5% headwind in Q1 revenue growth. Global Lab revenues increased 1% organically. When adjusting for equivalent days effects, international regions drove solid growth in the quarter with the U.S. at low single-digit growth. Global growth was supported by modest volume gains aided by new business.\nIn Q1, net pricing gains in our reference lab line of business were moderated by impacts from previously highlighted major new customer agreements, which we will begin lapping during Q2. Veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 9% as reported, including benefits from a software acquisition last year. 7% overall organic gains were driven by recurring revenues, reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements.\nWater revenues increased 7% organically in Q1 against high prior year levels. Growth was driven by double-digit revenue expansion in our European region. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 4% organically. Solid gains in the U.S. built off a momentum in the second half of 2024.\nTurning to our P&L. Q1 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 5% in the quarter as reported and 6% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 62.4%, up 80 basis points on a comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from business mix, including lab consumable growth and instrument mix. Reported gross margin gains benefited by approximately 10 basis points related to foreign exchange impacts net of hedge positions.\nOperating expenses increased 4% year-over-year as reported in the quarter and 8% on a comparable basis. This was net of a $9 million or 3% operating expense growth offset related to a favorable adjustment to the discrete litigation expense accrual and 1% from foreign exchange impacts. Q1 OpEx growth was driven by increases in R&D and commercial spending aligned with advancing our innovation road map.\nEPS was $2.96 per share in Q1, an increase of 5% as reported and 7% on a comparable basis, net of a 3% EPS growth benefit related to the adjustment of a discrete litigation expense accrual. Foreign exchange reduced operating profit by $4 million and EPS of approximately $0.04 per share in the quarter, net of a $4 million hedge gain.\nFree cash flow was $208 million in Q1, reflecting normal seasonality. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 95%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for net income to free cash flow conversion of 80% to 85%, reflecting the impact of the now concluded litigation matter and estimated impacts as a result of tariff planning.\nOur balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.6x net of cash. We look to maintain full year gross leverage ratios at similar levels. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 2.4% reduction in diluted shares outstanding, and we allocated $415 million in capital to share repurchases during the first quarter.\nTurning to our 2025 guidance. Our outlook reinforces consistent full year goals for solid organic revenue growth, comparable operating margin improvement and EPS gains. We revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar and Q1 discrete litigation expense accrual adjustment. In terms of our revenue outlook, we've updated our full year guidance for reported revenues to $4,095 billion to $4,210 billion, an increase of $40 million or approximately 1% growth rate improvement related to foreign exchange at the rates published in our press release.\nWe've maintained a full year organic growth outlook of 6% to 9%, supported by 5% to 8% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, including global net price realization of 4% to 4.5% at midpoint and expectations for 4,500 IDEXX inVue Dx placements. We're increasing our outlook for reported operating margins to 31.1% to 31.6% for the full year. This outlook maintains consistent 30 to 80 basis points of comparable operating margin expansion for the full year, net of a 180 basis point operating margin benefit related to the discrete litigation expense accrual adjustment and updated for foreign exchange effects.\nWith respect to the dynamic trade environment, we're well positioned to navigate the changing tariff landscape. As previously highlighted, we captured high-level tariff estimates for internationally sourced materials in our initial outlook. We have revised these estimates based on the current U.S. pronouncements and have incorporated estimates for China's retaliatory tariffs. Our primary objectives are focused on maintaining continuous supply to customers and minimizing tariff impacts through effective operational planning and balance sheet leverage.\nOur updated full year EPS outlook is $11.93 to $12.43 per share, an increase of $0.19 per share at midpoint driven by $0.11 per share from foreign exchange and $0.08 per share from a favorable adjustment to the discrete litigation expense accrual. We now estimate foreign exchange will have a negative $0.10 per share full year EPS impact. Operationally, we're maintaining consistent outlook for 8% to 12% comparable EPS growth.\nFor our second quarter, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 5% to 7.5%, net of approximately a 1% growth headwind from foreign exchange. This operational outlook aligns with overall organic revenue growth of 6% to 8.5% and organic CAG Diagnostics revenue growth of 5% to 7.5%. At midpoint, the second quarter organic revenue growth outlook includes U.S. clinical visit growth in line with our full year estimates. We're planning for reported operating margins of 32.9% to 33.4% in Q2, reflecting expansion of 40 to 90 basis points on a comparable basis.\nThat concludes our financial review, and I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning. 2025 is off to a solid start as IDEXX's innovations gained commercial traction across the portfolio. At the end of March, we launched IDEXX Cancer Dx through our reference labs in North America. This first-of-its-kind diagnostic panel for early detection of canine lymphoma brings exceptional levels of performance and is priced to our veterinarian partners in a way that is intended to support broad inclusion and access to pet owners.\nAdding to this excitement in the quarter, we continued our rollout of IDEXX inVue Dx, our new-to-the-industry cellular analyzer. With strong preorder momentum from last year, we placed over 300 instruments in Q1 and moved from a controlled rollout in Q1 to broad availability in April. Together, these two platforms, IDEXX Cancer Dx and IDEXX inVue Dx, represent an important leap forward. They embody our vision for innovation that elevates patient care, supports our customers and fuels long-term sustainable growth for IDEXX.\nLet's now take a closer look at our commercial performance. Our commercial organization executed strongly in the quarter. We delivered solid growth in organic recurring revenue, including days adjusted double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth internationally, sustained high levels of customer retention and expanded our customer base while further expanding our commercial footprint in high-potential regions. We delivered strong premium instrument placements in the quarter, including over 1,100 new and competitive Catalysts resulting in high single-digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base and double-digit growth in future economic value.\nIn the U.S., our commercial team delivered record Q1 placements in EVI, supported by early interest in IDEXX inVue Dx. In Europe, we locked a record upgrade cycle in hematology from LaserCyte to ProCyte One while delivering solid growth in competitive and greenfield Catalyst placements. We sustained high levels of customer retention in the high 90s across our diagnostic modalities, demonstrating the ongoing value and trust our customers place in IDEXX. This loyalty is foundational to our growth model as it enables predictable recurring revenue while providing a large customer base to introduce innovations like IDEXX Cancer Dx and IDEXX inVue Dx.\nInternationally, in addition to another strong quarter with double-digit instrument installed base growth, recent innovations like Catalyst pancreatic lipase has been especially well received, benefiting the strong IDEXX VetLab consumables performance. These regions are responding favorably to our tailored commercial strategies, which combine local support with global innovation. We completed onboarding and training for commercial expansion in South Korea, where our customers are prime to adopt IDEXX's innovative point-of-care solutions while benefiting from our in-country reference laboratory capabilities. This additional investment in Korea represents another example of investing towards growth aligned with regional readiness and commercial momentum.\nAs practices continue to seek productivity improvements, our diagnostic solutions is positioned not just as medical tools but also as operational enablers. By providing fast, accurate results, our platforms help practice to see more patients, reduce callbacks and make better use of limited clinical time. Our field teams partner with customers to optimize workflows, bringing up technicians and doctors to focus on care rather than coordination.\nAltogether, the commercial performance in Q1 lays a solid foundation for the year ahead. While macroeconomic conditions remain dynamic, we're seeing strong demand signals and continued willingness by clinics to invest in diagnostics as a core part of animal health. Our commercial model rounded in partnership, flexibility and execution excellence remains a key differentiator and a critical enabler of our innovation-led growth strategy.\nThis was a landmark quarter for IDEXX's diagnostic innovation strategy as we brought some of our most ambitious, clinically impactful technologies to market. IDEXX Cancer Dx marks a major evolution in our approach to diagnostics, making complex molecular-level testing accessible to general practitioners through a simple cost-effective blood test. Veterinarians now have a tool that allows them to incorporate cancer detection into a wellness visit seamlessly alongside other blood chemistry and hematology workups. With turnaround times of just 2 to 3 days in the U.S. at a price point as low as $15 this solution provides an affordable solution that delivers powerful clinical insight. Since launch, we now have over 1,000 practices that have already ordered the test, representing broad awareness and strong initial interest.\nCancer is personal to many pet owners. The earlier we can detect cancer and determine the type of cancer, the better the chance for targeted treatments and improved outcomes, such as additional quality of months or years of life. This is only the beginning. Within 3 years, we intend to broaden the scope of our oncology menu to address the majority of canine cancer cases. With an established diagnostic footprint and strong relationships with general and specialty practitioners, IDEXX is uniquely positioned to lead in this high-impact area of veterinary medicine.\nSimilarly, IDEXX inVue Dx is poised to transform point-of-care diagnostics across several high-volume testing categories. As noted, we moved from a controlled roll-out in Q1 to broad availability entering Q2. With gating controls removed, we've seen an acceleration of placements with over 900 placements through the end of April, which supports the increase in consumables usage expected to grow throughout the year. This momentum highlights the high level of customer interest in this breakthrough, AI-empowered slide free cytology system.\nBy combining advanced optics with an AI model trained on millions of cellular images, IDEXX inVue Dx analyzes eurocytology and blood morphology in minutes while the patient is still in the practice. Seamless integration with IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS allows teams to store, view and share results with ease. Customer feedback has been especially enthusiastic around ease of use, confidence in results and the way it enhances technician workflows by simplifying and automating what was once a time-consuming manual task. We're seeing exciting utilization trends across early adopters with utilization for both eurocytology and blood morphology well aligned with our expectations. We look forward to sharing additional insights on utilization trends in the future.\nLooking ahead, we are in an excellent position for manufacturing, inventory and commercial capacity to deliver our 4,500-plus placement goal in 2025. And our R&D and operations teams continue to make great progress as we plan to introduce [ 5 needle aspirate ] capabilities for lumps and bumps on IDEXX inVue later in 2025. This high-interest menu expansion is part of our technology for life approach will unlock substantial value in oncology diagnostics as F&A is a key method for evaluating these ubiquitous lumps and bumps common to many dogs.\nOur software ecosystem continues to be an important growth driver and a source of strategic advantage with deep integrations across diagnostics, imaging, communication and practice operations. IDEXX software helps clinics unlock the full potential of their diagnostics, improve client engagement and enhance operational efficiency.\nThis quarter, we saw strong performance across our practice information management systems as well as pet owner engagement tools like Vello. Our ezyVet and Neo platforms continue to grow as we deliver double-digit placement growth in our leading cloud-native PIMS during the quarter with accelerated momentum, particularly in multi-location practices and corporate account customers. Customers are choosing our cloud-native platforms for their modern user interfaces, seamless integration with diagnostics and the ability to scale across locations with centralized data and workflows.\nVello, our cognitive client engagement platform, continued its strong growth trajectory in Q1, increasing users over 20% from Q4. Vello users have experienced enhanced communications with pet owners, increased visit frequency and improved compliance with diagnostics and treatment plans compared both to customers who are using other client engagement platforms or relying on a simple capability resident in their PIMS.\nAs we manage through ongoing uncertainty in the global trade environment, our top priority is to support our customers with uninterrupted access to the high-quality products and services they rely on IDEXX for. IDEXX is relatively well positioned with 65% of consolidated revenues and a majority of our CAG industrial base located in the U.S., while less than 1% of company revenues come from China. While situated well, we are not immune to impacts from a highly dynamic tariff environment. As Andrew noted, we captured high-level tariff estimates for internationally sourced materials in our initial outlook and have now incorporated estimates for China retaliatory tariff impacts.\nOur supply chain and operations teams are intensely focused on navigating the shifting tariff landscape and broader economic challenges. We have taken and are taking additional proactive steps to ensure staging where appropriate and implementing plans to support high product availability while also seeking to mitigate financial impacts as we look to deliver our profit goals.\nAs noted, we're operating in a challenging environment, where both the broader macro and global trade environment as well as continuing sector factors have moderated our growth. While Veterinary capacity constraints have largely stabilized, economic uncertainty continues to be a factor in pressure in clinical visits. We are pleased to share, as a point supporting the resiliency of the pet health care market, that the estimated pet population sustained in 2024 at similar levels to the prior year. Notably, this represents approximately 3% CAGR versus 2019 baseline, well ahead of historical approximately 1% annual growth rate.\nThis higher baseline of the absolute number of pets supports strong tailwinds to our business that gives us confidence in the opportunity to deliver solid organic revenue growth. Pet ownership remains high. Pets are living longer and the expanded pet population is aging, which are all positive factors for diagnostic use. Diagnostics sit at the center of the system of care. And pet owner expectations for quality care continue to arise. IDEXX is uniquely positioned to lead, and our focus is on exceptional execution to deliver solid growth and profit gains.\nI'll now conclude our prepared remarks by thanking the 11,000 IDEXX employees for your ongoing commitment and incredible passion for our purpose-driven work.\nNow let's please open the line for Q&A."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nParticipating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; Andrew Emerson, Senior Vice President, Corporate and Companion Animal Group Finance; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nIDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements noticed in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our fourth quarter 2024 results and initial 2025 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period, unless otherwise noted.\n[Operator Instructions] Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today I'm pleased to review our Q4 and full year 2024 financial results. Andrew Emerson, who will be assuming responsibility as IDEXX's CFO on March 1, will take you through the details of the company's outlook for 2025.\nIDEXX had a solid finish to 2024, reflecting fourth quarter performance ahead of our expectations. Revenue increased 6% organically, supported by 7% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Operating profits increased 7% as reported and 8% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains, which supported operating margin performance at the high end of our guidance range. We also saw positive impacts from increased stock-based compensation activity, which benefited our effective tax rate.\nThese factors support a delivery of $2.62 in EPS in Q4, up 10% on a comparable basis.\nIDEXX execution drove solid expansion of our business for the full year 2024. This is reflected in 7% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, 9% growth in our global premium instrument installed base, 11% organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and 11% organic growth in our water business.\nWe delivered excellent full year financial performance in 2024 supported by comparable operating margin gains at the high end of our long-term annual improvement goals. Full year EPS of $10.67 per share, which includes $0.56 per share of negative impact related to a discrete litigation expense accrual, increased 12% on a comparable basis, including 2% of negative growth impact from the lapping of a 2023 customer contract resolution payment.\nThese results were achieved as we successfully advanced our innovation-driven growth strategy and work through greater-than-expected sector and macro headwinds. As Andrew will discuss, this performance sets a solid foundation for our business to build upon as we enter 2025.\nLet's begin with a review of our 2024 results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 6% reflected solid gains across IDEXX's major business segments, including 6% organic growth in CAG, 7% organic gains in LPD and 9% organic growth in water. Worldwide CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q4, including benefits from improved volume growth trends. Results were supported by average global net price improvement of 4% to 4.5%, with U.S. net price realization of approximately 3.5%.\nAs noted in our last earnings call, U.S. net price realization includes impacts from the successful extension and expansion of 3 major customer agreements in 2024, which will provide long-term incremental volume growth benefits for IDEXX.\nU.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 4% organically in Q4 net of a 1% negative growth impact from fewer equivalent selling days. IDEXX execution drove approximately 2% U.S. volume growth in the quarter, normalized for equivalent days. These results were supported by sustained solid new business gains, high customer retention levels and relatively higher gains in diagnostic frequency and volume utilization per clinical visit.\nIDEXX achieved a solid 800 basis point normalized growth premium compared to U.S. clinical visit growth levels in the fourth quarter. We continue to work through pressure on U.S. same-store clinical visit levels, which declined nearly 3% in Q4 and 2% for the full year in 2024. This has been the primary constraint on IDEXX's recent growth, reflecting transitional sector macro impacts following the accelerated expansion of pet health care during the pandemic.\nInternational CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 12% in Q4, including a 1% benefit from equivalent days effects. Strong Q4 international results benefited from net price gains and improved volume growth, supported by new business expansion reflected in double-digit year-on-year growth in our international premium instrument installed base.\nIDEXX fourth quarter performance was supported by strong global growth in consumable revenues. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 12% organically, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S. and international regions normalized for equivalent days effects. Consumable gains were supported by a 9% increase in our global premium instrument installed base in 2024, reflecting solid gains across our Catalyst premium hematology and SediVue platforms.\nFor the full year 2024, we achieved approximately 18,500 premium instrument placements with excellent quality reflected in sustained high new and competitive Catalyst placements.\nIn the fourth quarter, we placed 4,625 premium instruments, down 12% from high prior year levels. Overall CAG instrument revenues also declined 12% organically in Q4. Quarterly placement results were supported by strong gains in SediVue and continued expansion of ProCyte One.\nWe also initiated shipments of IDEXX inVue Dx in the quarter supporting strong comparable EVI gains, including the projected value of inVue preorders.\nRapid assay revenue was flat on an organic basis in Q4. Rapid assay results were constrained by pressure on U.S. wellness visits as well as by the addition of the pancreatic lipase slide to our Catalyst menu, which we estimated to be a 4% headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\nGlobal Lab revenues expanded 4% organically in Q4. Reference Lab results in the quarter were supported by solid normalized volume growth in U.S. and international regions and net price gains. Reference Lab net price gains were moderated in Q4 by near-term impacts from major new customer agreements, which will benefit long-term Reference Lab growth.\nCAG veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 7% organically in Q4, compared to strong prior year levels. Results continue to be supported by solid growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements.\nIn other business segments, water revenues increased 9% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior year levels, driven by continued solid gains in the U.S. and Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues increased 7% organically in Q4, supported by solid gains in our U.S., Europe and Latin America regions.\nTurning to the P&L. Q4 operating profits increased 7% as reported and 8% on a comparable basis, supported by gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 8% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.8%, up 130 basis points on a comparable basis, adjusting for approximately 10 basis points of positive FX impact.\nGross margin gains reflected favorable business mix, supported by strong consumable growth, benefits from net price improvement and higher water gross margins.\nOperating expenses were up 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis in the quarter, reflecting increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation initiatives, including our new instrument platforms. For the full year 2024, operating margins were 29%, an increase of 60 basis points on a comparable basis, including an approximately 40 basis point negative impact from lapping a customer contract resolution payment in 2023. Full year operating margins included 160 basis points of negative impact related to a discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in the second quarter.\nQ4 EPS was $2.62 per share, up 10% on a comparable basis. In Q4, EPS benefited from a lower effective tax rate, including $0.13 per share in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.06 per share benefit from a nonrecurring tax reserve release related to lapping of an applicable statute of limitations. Foreign exchange drove a $0.03 per share EPS headwind in the quarter, net of approximately $3 million in hedge gains.\nFull year EPS was $10.67 per share, an increase of 6% on a reported basis and 12% on a comparable basis, including a 2% negative EPS growth impact related to lapping a customer contract resolution payment. 2024 full year EPS results include $0.56 of negative impact from a discrete expense accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter, $0.05 of negative impact from currency changes and $0.24 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity.\nForeign exchange had limited impact on Q4 and full year revenue growth. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $5 million and EPS by $0.05 per share, net of $6 million in hedge gains.\nFree cash flow was $808 million for 2024 or 91% of net income, aligned with our guidance and long-term goals. Capital spending was $121 million for the full year or approximately 3% of revenue.\nWe allocated $249 million to repurchase 564,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we allocated $859 million to repurchase 1,760 million shares.\nOur balance sheet is in a strong position. We ended 2024 with leverage ratio of 0.7x gross and 0.4x net of cash.\nThat concludes our financial review. Andrew will now walk you through our initial 2025 financial outlook.\n\nAndrew Emerson\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate and CAG Finance\n\nThank you, Brian. Turning to our 2025 full year outlook. IDEXX is planning to deliver solid organic revenue growth and profit gains led by strong execution and benefits from new innovation. We're providing initial guidance for revenue of $4.055 billion to $4.170 billion, an increase of 4% to 7% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, this reflects a growth range of 6% to 9% overall, supported by 5% to 8% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.\nAt current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2% negative impact on full year revenue growth.\nIn terms of key drivers for our 2025 organic growth outlook, the midpoint of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range incorporates expectations for global net price realization of 4% to 4.5% and volume gains of approximately 2%. The outlook includes assumptions for declines in U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels with the midpoint reflecting a similar rate of decline seen in 2024. These targets incorporate continued solid global growth benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including new customer gains and increases in testing utilization supported by IDEXX innovations.\nThe higher end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook captures the potential for improved sector visit and same-store growth trends, while the lower end of the range calibrates for further potential effects of macroeconomic conditions.\nOur revenue growth outlook includes approximately $50 million of projected IDEXX inVue Dx instrument revenue aligned with 4,500 placements. Jay will discuss progress against our inVue Dx launch in his comments.\nOur reported operating margin outlook for the full year 2025 is 31% to 31.5%. On a comparable basis, this reflects an outlook of 30 to 80 basis points of improvement year-over-year net of 160 basis point operating margin benefit related to the lapping of the discrete litigation expense recorded in the second quarter of 2024.\nWe're planning for solid gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2025, supported by growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, benefits from lab productivity initiatives and expansion of our high-margin cloud-based software business. This is partially offset by unfavorable business mix planned from higher levels of CAG Diagnostic instrument revenue gains and preliminary estimates for tariff risks on internationally sourced materials.\nOur 2025 EPS outlook is $11.74 to $12.24 per share. This reflects an increase of 8% to 12% on a comparable basis net of a 6% EPS growth benefit from the lapping of the Q2 2024 discrete litigation expense, and includes a $0.06 per share headwind from higher taxes related to a nonrecurring tax reserve release during the fourth quarter of 2024. Our EPS outlook also includes of net interest expense at prevailing rates.\nForeign exchange is expected to have a negative impact of $0.21 year-over-year at the rates disclosed in our press release, net of established hedge positions. In terms of sensitivities to changes in foreign exchange rates, we project a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact the full year reported revenue by $15 million and operating income by $5 million net of hedge positions.\nOur 2025 free cash flow outlook is for net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 85% to 90%, aligned with our long-term goals. This reflects estimated capital spending of approximately $160 million or about 4% of revenues. The outlook incorporates increased capital deployment aligned with $1.5 billion towards share repurchases or approximately 4% of our current equity market capitalization. This reflects our high confidence in IDEXX growth potential, including continued strong execution and advancement of our innovation agenda.\nRegarding our Q1 outlook, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, with similar gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue net of a 1% to 1.5% days headwind. This factors in U.S. clinic visit trends more aligned with Q4 2024 and pricing benefits at the low end of our full year price realization range as we work through the major customer agreements noted by Brian.\nReported revenue growth of 2% to 4% includes approximately 2% negative impact from foreign exchange at current rates.\nOur Q1 reported operating margins are planned for 30.2% to 30.6%. This reflects moderate compression in comparable margins in the quarter compared to high prior year levels and reflects investments to support recent and upcoming product launches.\nOverall, we're well positioned to build on our solid 2024 financial performance with continued strong execution and robust set of new product launches during 2025. This concludes our guidance update, and I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Andrew. IDEXX delivered another strong quarter to close out 2024, capped with the additional placements of IDEXX inVue Dx. Our results this quarter exemplified the resilience of our business model, built on the foundation of customer-centric innovation, high-touch commercial execution and a steadfast commitment to growth by advancing the standard of care in veterinary medicine. .\nThis year, we celebrated significant milestones, including the highly anticipated launch of IDEXX inVue Dx, a groundbreaking cellular analyzer, redefining slide-free point-of-care testing. We recently announced the launch of IDEXX Cancer Dx with canine lymphoma, a transformative oncology screening and aid in diagnosis panel that will expand over time to address the most common canine cancer.\nWe're also concurrently commercializing 3 new products and services as part of our Catalyst technology for life platform and test menu and enabling software. Introductions include Pancreatic Lipase Testing, a single slide solution already embraced by thousands of clinics. SmartQC, which enables very easy monthly calibration on our chemistry platform in an updated IDEXX VetLab station with a more modern, intuitive interface supporting workflow efficiencies.\nIDEXX's commercial teams continued to operate at a high level this year, supporting new business gains, solid net price realization, high 90s percent customer retention levels across major testing modalities, and sustained adoption levels of diagnostic testing utilization via post-pandemic highs. High placement levels across our core premium instrument platforms drove a 9% growth in our premium instrument installed base.\nThe team also delivered very strong year-on-year EVI gains when incorporating benefits from nearly 1,600 global preorders for IDEXX inVue Dx, which will benefit our business over the coming year.\n2024 also saw the extension and expansion of 3 major customer agreements, which will provide solid volume gains for our Reference Lab business. These important contractual renewals highlight the value IDEXX solutions bring to our customers, supporting their practice revenue growth through highly important diagnostic testing categories.\n2024 was also a pivotal year for our software business with double-digit growth in our cloud-native PIMS placements and the launch of our pet owner engagement solution, Vello, we're helping clinics bridge the gap between patient care and operational efficiency. Vello, now adopted by nearly 600 practices, has enhanced pet owner engagement by streamlining communication and driving increased clinical visits and diagnostic frequency. These advancements highlight the expanding role of software in unlocking the full potential of diagnostics while delivering a seamless experience for veterinarians and pet owners alike.\nThe strong execution was delivered in a dynamic macroeconomic and sector environment which saw continued pressure in clinical visits. For pets visiting U.S. clinics, pet owners continued to demonstrate interest in a higher standard of care, reflecting the strength of the pet owner bond and the prioritization of pet health. Diagnostics play a key central role in enabling better medical outcomes as nearly half of clinical visits include some form of diagnostic testing. The growth in the use of blood work in preventive screening highlights the value pet parents place on proactive care, driven by advancements in technology and awareness of health benefits.\nOur commercial strategy is to support this positive trend through the use of preventive care marketing programs like Simple Start and testing innovations such as IDEXX Cancer Dx, which will be included at attractive prices to inspire pull-through.\nIDEXX's commercial execution continues to be a cornerstone of our success, reflecting the deep expertise, commitment and customer focus of our teams around the globe. Our partnership approach has yielded exceptional customer retention rates of over 97%, ensuring that practices continue to see IDEXX as an indispensable partner in their growth and efficiency goals.\nCustomers trust IDEXX to help them navigate challenges of staffing and visit trends. Our nearly double-digit premium instrument installed base growth is driven by robust new placements across chemistry, hematology and SediVue platforms, as well as the first placements of IDEXX inVue Dx. We also continue to make strong progress in placing our IDEXX VetLab suites in competitive and greenfield accounts, a focus area since we get the full growth benefit of consumables usage. Customers are hungry for point-of-care technology that supports their medical mission with fast, real-time results while minimizing workflow bottlenecks with innovations such as load-and-go capability, a common easy-to-use interface, an instrument uptime measured in years.\nAn additional benefit is that our large, rapidly growing installed base of over 74,000 chemistry analyzers, for example, allow for a rapid global adoption of new testing innovations such as Pancreatic Lipase, the 10th such menu extension in a bit over 12 years. Menu extensions such as Pancreatic Lipase help support healthy volume premium to the clinic visit baseline.\nOur international region showcase strong performance in 2024, contributing significantly to our growth story. Double-digit expansion of our premium installed base outside the U.S. underscore the benefits of our targeted global commercial investments over the past 3 years. Our maturing international sales organization has not only secured high-quality placements but also driven consistent diagnostic utilization gains, particularly in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions where we continue to see untapped potential.\nSpotlighting our European region's very strong performance, we saw the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth with IDEXX VetLab consumables growth in the high teens. Customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our commercial strategy, supported by sustained sector-leading levels of engagement and trust.\nIDEXX's investment in areas such as VetConnect PLUS feature expansion that now gives the customer the ability to access reference lab sample turnaround time and order status information. This is part of our strategy to not only provide subject matter expertise and complementary testing support through our medical consulting organization, but workflow optimization that help clinics navigate the complexities of modern veterinary care. This focus on customer success not only drives loyalty, but also ensures that IDEXX remains the go-to partner for diagnostic solutions.\nThe launch of IDEXX inVue Dx has been one of the most exciting developments of 2024, marking a new era in point-of-care diagnostics. Designed as a technology for life platform, inVue Dx combines advanced optics, artificial intelligence and a slide-free workflow to deliver transformative diagnostic insights with unparalleled ease of use. The initial menu focuses on ear cytology and blood morphology, taps into 2 clinically well-understood, high-volume use cases that benefit from automation and a step-up in testing consistency and performance.\nCustomer interest for IDEXX inVue Dx continues to be exceptionally strong with nearly 1,600 preorders globally by the end of Q4, reflecting the high demand for this next-generation platform. International interest has been similarly robust as we begin taking orders in select geographies in Q4, though like the U.S., we have placed some limits on the number of preorders our account managers take. This level of enthusiasm underscores the transformative potential of inVue Dx in clinics worldwide.\nAs I mentioned previously, we initiated a controlled launch of IDEXX inVue Dx in Q4. And to ensure a best-in-class customer experience, we will gradually ramp up placements through 2025. Early feedback from customers, both in the customer experience trials and for the initial placements, have been exceptionally positive. Customers are simply amazed with how easy the analyzer is to use, eliminating the need for complex slide preparation or interpretation, with results in minutes.\nUnderpinning the financial guidance Andrew shared is a placement target for 4,500-plus inVue placements over the course of the year as we march towards our 20,000 placement goal over 5 years. IDEXX operations and supply chain teams have made outstanding progress, ramping manufacturing to support this level of placements, while our field service representative team has been expanded and trained to provide critical installation capacity to support both the inVue ramp and continued growth of our core instrument platforms. The moment is upon us to bring this transformative analyzer to our global customer base.\nLooking ahead, we remain on track to expand IDEXX inVue Dx's capabilities further with the addition of fine needle aspirate or FNA testing for lumps and bumps later in 2025, unlocking significant opportunity in oncology diagnostics.\nWe're excited to have announced the VMX, the March launch of IDEXX Cancer Dx panel with lymphoma, a pioneering advancement in veterinary oncology. This innovative screening solution represents a significant step forward in Companion Animal Healthcare, addressing a critical need for early cancer detection and as an aid diagnosis in canine patients. The IDEXX Cancer Dx panel has breakthrough cost performance and turnaround time attributes for early-stage cancer diagnostic screening and as an aid in diagnosis test. Priced for as little as $15 per test with included as part of select diagnostic panels.\nThis will change how and when canine cancer is detected and its early diagnosis will likely change how cancer care is managed, with positive patient implications for the support of longer, healthier lives. Given the performance, cost and turnaround time attributes of the Cancer Dx panel, the opportunity is to inspire a much broader inclusion of cancer screening as an essential part of the preventive care blood work.\nThe Cancer Dx panel will initially launched with lymphoma detection, one of the most common and treatable cancers in dogs. Over the next 3 years, the panel will expand to include the 6 most prevalent canine cancers, which collectively account for over 50% of cancer cases in dogs. This expanded menu will tap into an estimated $1.1 billion addressable opportunity, underscoring the potential of this diagnostic innovation.\nOur software ecosystem plays a pivotal role in supporting veterinarians by enhancing clinic efficiency, optimizing workflows and fostering deeper connections with practices and pet owners. With double-digit growth in cloud data placements, software remains a critical enabler of diagnostic adoption and practice success, reinforcing our position as a leader in vertical SaaS offerings tailored to veterinary needs.\nOne of the year's standout achievements was the expansion of Vello, our pet-owner engagement application. Designed to address the growing demand for seamless communication and improved visit outcomes, Vello has been embraced by nearly 600 practices at year-end, doubling its user base since Q3. Early results from the app deployment have been highly encouraging, with participating clinics reporting increased clinical visits, higher diagnostic usage and improved revenue. This underscores Vello's ability to address critical workflow pain points while fostering stronger relationships between veterinarians and pet owners.\nWe have meaningfully increased development resources and investment in Vello through 2024 and now in 2025. Looking ahead, Vello's development road map promises even greater value with upcoming enhancements focused on streamlining communications, expanding engagement tools, including the ability to personalize messaging, and integrating advanced analytics. Customers appreciate our commitment to an integrated diagnostics and software suite in a way that unlocks new opportunities for growth.\nBeyond Vello, we continue to expand our broader software portfolio. We placed a record number of cloud native PIMS, expanding that installed base by 20% year-over-year, as our offerings remain a top choice for clinic seeking modern, scalable solutions. We finished the year with 60% of our PIMS installed base in the cloud, ahead of our estimates shared at Investor Day in August.\nIDEXX Web PACS, our cloud native imaging workflow engine also experienced double-digit subscriber growth, demonstrating its relevance at addressing key pain points such as dental imagery workflows. These advancements not only simplify complex processes but also allow clinicians to spend more time focusing on patient care.\nThe integration of diagnostics and software remains a cornerstone of IDEXX's value proposition. By providing intuitive, efficient and comprehensive tools, we empower clinics to unlock new levels of performance while delivering superior care to their patients.\nAs we move into 2025, our focus on software innovation will continue to drive recurring revenue growth and deepen our partnerships with veterinary practices worldwide.\nAs we turn the page on 2024, IDEXX remains steadfast in its purpose: to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. I extend my deepest gratitude to our nearly 11,000 employees whose dedication and hard work have made these accomplishments possible. Together, we have delivered robust financial results while setting the stage for a promising 2025 and beyond, supported by a new wave of IDEXX innovations.\nI'd like to thank Brian McKeon for the exceptional contributions he has made over a 20-year IDEXX spanning both as a member of our Board and over the last 11 years as IDEXX's CFO. As previously announced, Brian will be stepping down from the role as CFO as of March 1. One of Brian's many contributions has been to build a world-class finance team and develop future leadership talent.\nIt's my great pleasure to welcome Andrew Emerson, who will become our new CFO as of March 1. Andrew brings more than 20 years of finance experience to the health care industry in roles of increasing responsibility, including over 9 years at IDEXX working side by side with Brian throughout this time. He is well versed in our business, our sector and our strategy, and he is set to contribute on day 1.\nBrian will remain with IDEXX in a senior advisory capacity until his retirement date of June 1 in order to help ensure a smooth and seamless transition for Andrew.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over for Q&A. Thank you."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nIDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2024 results and updated 2024 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless otherwise noted.\n[Operator Instructions] Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX delivered solid organic revenue growth and strong comparable profit gains in the second quarter. In terms of highlights, overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and 10% organic gains in our Water business.\nSolid CAG revenue growth was driven by global benefits from IDEXX execution drivers reflected in sustained solid new business gains, record second quarter premium instrument placements and double-digit growth in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. Partially offsetting these benefits, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was constrained by impacts from near-term macro and sector headwinds which contributed to a 2% decline in [indiscernible] clinical visit growth levels in the quarter.\nIDEXX's operating performance reflected in solid comparable operating profit gains continue to be strong in Q2. EPS in the quarter was $2.44, down 9% as reported, including [ $0.06 ] per share impact from a $62 million discrete expense accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter. Comparable EPS growth was 15% in the quarter, [indiscernible] expectations, supported by solid gross margin gains and benefits from lower net interest costs and shares outstanding.\nIDEXX continues to make progress expanding our business, advancing our innovation and delivering strong comparable profit gains as we work through near-term macro and sector headwinds that continue to pressure clinic visit [ results ]. We've updated our 2024 financial out to incorporate recent sector trends, which we estimate at midpoint will constrain overall organic revenue growth to the lower end of our original organic growth guidance for'244. Our updated P&L guidance maintains our outlook for solid comparable operating margin gains this year and incorporates favorable adjustments for updated foreign exchange, net interest expense and effective tax rate estimates. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments.\nLet's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 7%, [ reflecting ] 7% organic CAG gains, 10% organic growth in water and [ improved ] 3% organic growth in our LPD business. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic gains in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 12% organic growth in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 5% organically, building on high prior year placement levels.\nCAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q2, supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 5.5%, with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by 10% international organic gains, including approximately 1% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects in international regions. Strong international growth reflects benefits from net price realization and continued solid volume gains. International growth continues to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in stronger business gains and high premium instrument placements which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument installed base.\nU.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 5.2% in Q2, net of a 0.5% U.S. equivalent day growth headwind in the quarter. IDEXX growth was supported by solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and benefits from net price realization. IDEXX growth continued to expand at a high premium to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels which declined 1.8% in Q2.\nIn the U.S., diagnostic utilization per clinical visit continues to expand solidly at the clinic level. This is reflected in a 7.5% year-on-year increase in diagnostic revenue dollars per clinical visit, including diagnostics. While diagnostic frequency per clinical visit declined modestly in Q2, diagnostic frequency per wellness visit expanded 100 basis points. This partially offset lower diagnostic frequency per nonwellness visit. The decline in diagnostic frequency for nonwellness visits may reflect recent growth in follow-up clinical visits for pain management drug treatment, which may not include diagnostics. Adjusting for these effects would imply relatively softer comparable U.S. clinical visit trends and a relatively higher IDEXX growth premium.\nOverall, IDEXX continues to achieve solid organic revenue growth in CAG diagnostic revenues as we work through headwinds from broader cumulative macro impacts on consumers which are likely pressuring near-term U.S. clinical visit growth levels. While we remain highly confident in the positive long-term drivers of demand for diagnostics, including the future benefits that will flow from IDEXX innovation, we factored in expectations for continued pressure from lower U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2024 and our updated full year organic growth outlook.\nIDEXX execution drivers supported solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q2. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically, reflecting solid gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology and stoke platforms. We achieved a Q2 record 4,952 CAG premium instrument placements, an increase of 4% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. These results were supported by continued strong growth in premium hematology and SediVue placements.\nProCyte One momentum continues, with the global ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 17,000 instruments. Global catalyst placements decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels and placement mix in international regions. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 6% organically in Q2, driven by solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues also increased 6% organically, reflecting solid U.S. gains and high single-digit growth in international regions.\nVeterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 12% as reported, including benefits from our recent Greenline software and data platform acquisition. 8% overall organic revenue gains were driven by 12% organic growth in recurring revenues, reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q2, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued solid growth in Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues increased 3% organically. Continued solid gains in the U.S. and Europe offset lower Asia Pacific revenues, including impacts from reduced swine testing in China and lower herd health screening revenues.\nTurning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter as reported and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.7%, up 90 basis points on a comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflect benefits from net price realization, offsetting inflationary cost impacts software service margin gains and favorable business mix. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 28% year-on-year, including 22% of growth impact related to the $62 million discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in G&A. Excluding this impact, Q2 OpEx growth was in line with overall revenue growth driven by increases in R&D [ spending ] aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development.\nOn a reported basis, operating margins were 26.3% in the quarter, including a 610 basis point impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. On a comparable basis, excluding this impact, operating margins increased approximately 110 basis points year-on-year in the quarter. EPS was $2.44 per share in the quarter, a decrease of 9% as reported including the $0.56 per share impact related to the discrete litigation expense accrual. EPS increased 15% on a comparable basis.\nForeign exchange reduced revenues by approximately $7 million, operating profit by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter, net of a $2 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $215 million in Q2. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 99%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.4x net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively. We allocated [ $208 ] million in capital to share repurchases in the second quarter, supporting a 0.7% year-on-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to our 2024 guidance. We've updated our full year organic growth outlook to reflect expectations for continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit trends in the second half of 2024. Our P&L outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for foreign exchange impacts, net interest expense and our effective tax rate.\nOur updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3.885 billion to $3.945 billion, a reduction of $15 million at midpoint. Our updated reported revenue outlook includes a favorable [ $15 ] million adjustment related to more recent foreign exchange estimates. We've updated our full year guidance for overall organic revenue growth and CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth to 6.2% to 7.8% or approximately 7% at midpoint. Our outlook for overall organic revenue growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains supported by IDEXX execution. This includes consistent expectations for full year global net price improvement of approximately 5%.\nOur updated organic growth outlook at midpoint assumes IDEXX execution growth benefits will be partially offset by continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit levels in the second half of this year, similar to first half trends. We expect our organic revenue growth results will benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects, reflecting 1% to 1.5% organic growth rate benefits in Q3.\nIn terms of our profit guidance, our updated outlook incorporates impacts from the discrete litigation expense accrual, which we estimate will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 160 basis points and EPS by $0.56 per share. We will normalize for the effects of this accrual in setting our 2025 financial performance goals. Incorporating [ these ] effects, our updated reported operating margin outlook is 28.7% to 29.0%. This reflects consistent 40 basis point improvement in comparable operating margins at midpoint net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment.\nOur updated full year EPS outlook of $10.31 to $10.59 per share is down $0.56 per share at midpoint, reflecting the impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. Adjustments to our organic revenue growth outlook reduced our operational EPS estimates by approximately $0.08 per share at midpoint which is offset by approximately $0.04 in favorable foreign exchange adjustments and positive below-the-line [ items ] from refinements to our net interest expense and effective tax rate outlook. We now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% and EPS by approximately $0.05 per share.\nIn terms of our outlook for Q3, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 6% to 8%, net of an estimated 1% growth headwind from foreign exchange, and incorporating approximately 0.5% [ in ] growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of approximately 6.5% to 8.5% and including approximately 1% to 1.5% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects. We're planning for reported operating margins of 29.5% to 30.0% in Q3, down moderately on a comparable basis. This factors in year-on-year comparisons to relatively lower prior year sales and marketing expense levels and projections for continued high year-on-year growth in R&D spending, including support of new platform advancement.\nThat concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent performance against our strategic priorities and strong operational results in the second quarter as we drive development to the companion animal diagnostics sector through a new wave of innovation and high-quality customer engagement. These outcomes reflect high levels of execution and position IDEXX to benefit from long-term growth tailwinds, including growth in the pet population, increased pet life spans and ever strengthening bond between pet owners and their pets. These enduring dynamics combined to elevate the importance of medical services and drive global expansion of companion animal diagnostics and software.\nAs an innovation leader, IDEXX growth continues to outpace the sector as we help our customers grow faster. Our progress is reflected in solid second quarter CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. supported by key execution drivers. This includes continued solid new business gains, sustained high 97% plus customer retention rates and solid net price realization aligned with the value we deliver.\nIDEXX's focus on [indiscernible] and companion animal diagnostics has resulted in a highly compelling portfolio of products and services for our highly capable commercial teams to support our customers. This combination helped drive record second quarter global premium instrument placements, a double-digit growth at our installed base of premium instruments in 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Europe. We're delivering this performance as we work through some transitional growth headwinds that continue to pressure [ clinical visit growth ]. This includes ongoing staffing and productivity challenges as well as broader impacts on pet owners in the current macro environment.\nAs we work through these dynamics, we're continuing to deliver solid growth ahead of sector levels. Our customer engagement is helping to support gains in diagnostics frequency and wellness visits and continued expansion of diagnostics utilization per clinical visit. Our customers increasingly appreciate that healthy and sustainable clinic growth begins with diagnostics. You can't assess basic health status or treat sick patients without first diagnosing and treatments that require follow-up monitoring. This has been our long-term focus that we see significant underserved demand for an expanding pet population that will support long-term growth for our customers in support of their mission.\nToday, I'll give an update on IDEXX's commercial execution and progress against our innovation strategy. IDEXX commercial teams delivered record second quarter global premium instrument placements, growing off high prior year levels. A key driver of this growth was high interest in IDEXX products in international regions, continued solid new and competitive catalyst placements and strong placement growth of ProCyte and SediVue analyzers, coupled with high levels of retention and an excellent customer experience helped deliver double-digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument install base. Growth of our loyal installed base forms the foundation for our future recurring revenues, and a significant long-term opportunity for growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.\nProCyte is a great example of our continued momentum in expanding our customers' businesses through innovation, IDEXX sales professionals continue to support customers looking to upgrade from our legacy laser site system to ProCyte One in order to realize multiple benefits, from load-and-go reagents to simplify workflow, to a smaller footprint that frees up valuable benchtop space and inventory benefits due to its paper run model with automated fulfillment by IDEXX.\nIn addition to driving a better customer experience, IDEXX benefits from these upgrades in the form of increased loyalty and higher CAG diagnostics recurring revenues [ that ] customers who upgrade. This customer and commercial effort helped drive our ProCyte One installed base to over 17,000 in just 3.5 years since this product launch. Upgrading to ProCyte One will also position these customers to benefit from the most comprehensive point-of-care hematology result when combined with inVue Dx blood morphology.\nWhile we are gratified by the consistent high levels of placements that our commercial teams deliver, we also focus on quality placements that will drive the most incremental value to IDEXX in the form of future recurring revenues. As an example, continued high placements at greenfield accounts drive significant value as these new customers are fully incremental to IDEXX. Our commercial teams are well equipped to have these initial conversations with de novo clinics and sustained high interest that our new practice program reflects their desire to partner with IDEXX as they launched their businesses. IDEXX's commercial success reflects our long-term focus on bringing a high-touch direct commercial model that includes a broad set of complementary roles, including account managers, professional service veterinarians and the largest in-person field service workforce in the industry.\nI'm also pleased to share that the entire North American commercial team met in person for several days in July to receive in-depth training on our latest innovations including Catalyst, pancreatic lipase test and IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer as we prepare for the successful commercialization of a significant new wave of innovation. Our commercial teams are highly excited to begin taking orders for inVue Dx, the formal start of the commercialization process.\nIDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer remains on track for launch in the fourth quarter. IDEXX product development teams have moved to the infill product validation stage to ensure early customers to adopt this transformational platform can seamlessly integrate inVue into their practice workflows and have the positive user experience they have come to expect for IDEXX's products and services. We are seeing encouraging early performance and utilization metrics among the small number of analyzers currently being trialed in the field. Customers are praising the usability of inVue, with all sites commenting that the workflow is intuitive and simple and the results are consistent, which will help them see more patients that drive clinic visit volume growth. I'm excited to provide more updates on inVue Dx and IDEXX's broader innovation agenda at our upcoming Annual Investor Day later this month.\nWe're also on track to launch the recently announced Catalyst pancreatic lipase test in the U.S. in the third quarter and globally in Q4. The Catalyst pancreatic lipase test, a single slide solution for canine and feline patients suspected to [ have ] pancreatitis, represents a 10th [ menu ] addition to the Catalyst platform since 2012. Pancreatitis is a common and treatable disease among cats and dogs, which can prove fatal if not caught early. Therefore, equipping veterinarians with quantitative results during the patient visit enables them to confidently diagnose and define the treatment envelope while the pet parent is still in the examination room. Our technology for life approach and the cloud-enabled in-clinic analyzers allow us to quickly ramp this highly relevant test to our more than 70,000 global Catalyst installed base.\nIn addition to the new Catalyst lipase test, we will begin shipping the Catalyst Smart QC clip in Q4. Customers are thrilled by the ability to run monthly QCs with a plug-and-go solution [ in ] another 15 minutes. Catalyst Smart QC is a great example of how our innovation is sometimes targeted at workflow optimization versus just test menu expansion. We have also begun rolling out the next generation of our industry-leading IVLS software and expect to have our installed base transition before inVue Dx begin shipping. This next generation takes our industry-leading IDEXX [indiscernible] lab software and meaningfully improves the user interface and have the number of steps needed to perform many common tasks.\nIDEXX software solutions are another area that delivers innovation-driven growth that addresses solutions that both improve clinic workflows and support greater utilization of diagnostics. Demand for intuitive cloud-based software solution remains high among the customer base that is increasingly reflective of younger generations who are digitally native. By leaning into this trend, IDEXX is well positioned to continue to deliver a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem that provides efficiency [ gains in ] the workflow and communication solutions. Q2 practice management orders were almost entirely cloud-based, building the foundation for strong future growth of economically attractive recurring revenues.\nIDEXX's attractive cloud-based solutions extend further, benefiting many areas of the practice, facilitating payments, delivering digital workflow tools and delivering an integrated pet on our engagement solutions are just a few examples of how we're providing a robust software stack that is a win-win delivering improved clinic productivity while driving incremental recurring revenues to IDEXX. For example, our recent launch of Vello, the pet owner engagement application, provides a first-of-its-kind pet owner engagement tool that is natively integrated into the practice management system. High interest in Vello is helping fill the sales pipeline, and driving a solid increase in active customers in the first full quarter since launching the product. These customers are experiencing the benefits we saw in our early beta testers from reduced no shows to better compliance during clinical visits. As this customer base grows over the long term, we see significant opportunity for Vello to help address the productivity challenges that exist at so many busy veterinary clinics, which is a meaningful benefit to our sector.\nWe're building on the robust features of our customer engagement solution by integrating Greenline into our portfolio. acquired in the first quarter, Greenline Pet is a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions. The tool provides veterinary clinics with the ability to connect their customers with leading animal health pharmaceutical and nutrition providers, making it easier for pet owners to take exceptional care of their pets. These higher standards of care reflects the sector development that this is the center of our long-term organic growth strategy. And as the sector grows, we expect IDEXX in turn to grow even faster, disproportionately benefiting us as the leader in the space.\nAs we conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to thank the nearly 11,000 global IDEXX employees for your outstanding work and commitment to providing a better future for animals, people and our planet. Their contributions are essential to the progress we've made against our organic growth strategy and to delivering another quarter of strong financial performance. Thanks to your efforts, IDEXX is well positioned to build on this momentum through the second half 2024 and well beyond as we continue to lead the development of the companion animal diagnostics sector.\nBefore we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that we will be hosting our Annual Investor Day later this month, beginning with the management dinner on Wednesday, August 14, followed by presentations at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine, on Thursday, August 15 at 8:00 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live streamed and recorded via idexx.com, for those who cannot make it in person. This is an exciting opportunity for IDEXX leaders to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, long-term growth opportunity, innovation cycle and execution drivers.\nParticipating will be members of my senior management [indiscernible], including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations; Dr. Mike Erickson, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Point of Care Diagnostics and Telemedicine; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Reference Laboratories and Information Technology; Michael Scherck, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services; George Fennell, Senior Vice President, Chief Revenue Officer; and Bryan McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO. The event will last approximately 4 hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session.\nWith that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nIDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements noticed in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.

Today's prepared remarks will be posted to IDEXX.com Investors after the earnings conference call concludes. I would like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q1 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024.\nIn terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth and strong profit gains in the first quarter. Overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Solid revenue gains were net of negative growth effects from severe U.S. weather in January which we estimated lowered overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by 0.5% to 1% and added pressure to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels.\nIDEXX execution trends remained strong, reflected in a continued high IDEXX CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium, 8% global gains in premium instrument placements and 11% organic gains in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues.\nProfit delivery was excellent in the quarter, supported by gross margin gains. Strong operating margin performance enabled EPS delivery of $2.81 per share. EPS was up 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis, net of a 7% negative EPS growth impact for the lapping of a prior year customer contract resolution payment.\nOverall, we're pleased with our continued progress in expanding our business and delivering strong financial performance. As we continue to work through sector and macro factors that have constrained visit growth at veterinary clinics. We've updated our 2024 financial outlook to incorporate recent sector trends which we estimate will constrain the high end of our full year organic growth outlook this year.\nWe've also incorporated updated estimates for foreign exchange effects to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Building on our strong first quarter performance, we're reinforcing our operational EPS outlook at midpoint. This reflects consistent goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement this year and favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense benefiting from our strong cash flow generation. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results.\nFirst quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was driven by 7% organic CAG gains an 11% organic growth in our water business, with overall gains moderated by a 3% organic growth decline in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 11% organic gains in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 3% organically, building on high prior year placement levels.\nCAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q1, supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 6%, with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q1 reflected solid gains across our major regions. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 9% and reflecting benefits from net price realization and solid volume gains, building on 2023 2nd half momentum. International results continue to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in strong business gains and high premium instrument placements, which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument installed base.\nU.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 6.5% in Q1. [indiscernible] reflects a continued significant growth premium compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2.3% overall in the quarter, including negative impacts from severe January weather. IDEXX's solid growth results reflect sustained levels of diagnostic frequency and increased diagnostic utilization per clinical visit at the practice level. It also reflects benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and net price realization.\nExcluding estimated weather impacts, U.S. clinical visit growth levels in the first quarter were relatively softer than targeted in our midpoint outlook. These trends reflect ongoing staffing challenges at veterinary clinics and potentially pressure on U.S. consumers from broader cumulative macro impacts. While pet owner demand for health care services remains durable and resilient, and we're confident in IDEXX's ability to execute and drive continued solid organic revenue growth, we believe it's prudent to factor these near-term sector trends into our outlook. This is reflected in adjustments to the high end of our 2024 full year organic revenue growth guidance.\nIDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and double-digit organic growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,791 CAG premium instrument placements in Q1, an increase of 8% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. This was supported by strong growth in ProCyte One placements with the global ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 15,000 instruments.\nGlobal Catalyst placements decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels and shifts in placement mix in the international regions. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 5% organically in Q1 driven by high single-digit gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 6% organically, reflecting similar solid gains in the U.S. and international regions.\nVeterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 12% as reported, including benefits from our recent software and data platform acquisition, which adds to our software ecosystem. 8% overall organic gains were driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues, reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based self-replacement.\nWater revenues increased 11% organically in Q1, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S. and Europe, including benefits from higher shipment order timing. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues decreased 3% organically. Solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were moderated by lower Asia Pacific revenues, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing in comparison to higher prior year swine testing levels in China. We expect these negative growth impacts to moderate in the second half of 2024.\nTurning to the P&L. Q1 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from business mix, lower instrument costs and software service margin expansion.\nOn a reported basis, operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year including approximately 6.5% of overall growth impact related to the lapping of a prior $16 million customer contract resolution payment. Q1 OpEx growth was driven by increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development. EPS was $2.81 per share in Q1, an increase of 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis. Net of a 7% negative EPS growth rate impact related to the lapping of the prior year customer contract resolution payment. Foreign exchange had a limited impact on gross margin, operating profit and EPS in the quarter, net of a $1 million hedge gain.\nFree cash flow was $168 million in Q1, reflecting normal seasonality. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 92%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.4x net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively in the current interest rate environment. We allocated 155 million in capital to share repurchases in the first quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to prior year levels.\nTurning to 2024 guidance. We've updated our full year P&L outlook to reflect adjustments to the high end of our full year organic growth goals. Our outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense. We've also revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nIn terms of our revenue outlook, we've updated our full year guidance for reported revenues to $3.895 billion to $3.96 billion, a reduction of $55 million at midpoint. Compared to earlier estimates, our updated reported revenue outlook includes a $35 million or approximately 1% negative growth rate impact related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've also lowered the high end of our full year organic growth outlook by 1% to capture more recent trends for U.S. clinical visits, which have constrained the organic revenue growth outlook for the first half of 2024.\nOur updated full year guidance for overall organic growth is now 7% to 9%, supported by 7.5% to 9.5% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. For the full year, our outlook for overall organic growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains, supported by IDEXX execution. Our midpoint outlook aligns with expectations of approximately 1.5% declines in U.S. clinic visits in Q2, similar to late Q1 trends. The second half of 2024, our midpoint outlook continues to assume a relative flattening of U.S. clinical visit terms.\nWe expect our H2 organic revenue growth results to benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects, reflecting approximately 1% organic growth rate benefits in Q3 and with limited overall effects to full year growth. Our full year CAG diagnostic recurring revenue outlook reflects consistent expectations for global net price improvement of approximately 5%.\nIn terms of our profit guidance, we're maintaining our outlook for reported operating margins of 30.2% to 30.7% for the full year 2024, supported by continued high levels of operating execution. This outlook aligns with 20 to 70 basis points in full year comparable operating margin expansion, net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment.\nOur updated full year EPS outlook of $10.82 to $11.20 per share is down $0.08 per share at midpoint, driven by our updated foreign exchange estimates. We now estimate foreign exchange will have a negative $0.09 per share full year EPS impact, $0.11 per share unfavorable to prior estimates. Operationally, reductions to the high end of our organic revenue growth guidance are mitigated by our sustained operating margin improvement outlook by approximately $0.06 per share of net favorability from updated net interest expense projections.\nIn terms of our outlook for Q2, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 5% to 7.5%, net of an estimated 1.5% growth headwind from FX. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of 6% to 8.5% and incorporates growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. As noted, at midpoint, the Q2 organic revenue growth outlook aligns with the relatively softer U.S. clinical visit growth trends seen at the end of the first quarter.\nWe're planning for reported operating margins of 31.0% to 31.4% in Q2 and flat to down moderately on a comparable basis, factoring in projections for relatively higher quarterly R&D spending in support of new platform advancement. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to the year as we continue to advance our strategy to drive the development of the companion animal diagnostics sector through innovation and customer engagement. Our ongoing progress benefits from the durable secular growth drivers that have supported the multi-decade expansion of companion animal medical services. These drivers include growth in the pet population in the strengthened human pet bond as well as the ongoing expansion of pet health care services. Medical Services is in turn enabled by diagnostics and is a key element of clinic growth and profitability.\nIDEXX's business strategy is focused on enabling long-term sector growth by providing unparalleled diagnostic insight through our leading testing and software solutions. This is supported by a robust innovation agenda and a high-touch customer-centered commercial model that helps clinicians test with confidence in an intuitive and efficient way, supporting their mission of delivering high levels of care.\nOur strategy is brought to life by teams across IDEXX, who collectively executed at a high level in the quarter, reflected in continued global expansion of our diagnostics and software solutions and solid growth in recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues once again grew at a healthy premium to the sector, supported by solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization that reflects the increased value that our products and services deliver to our customers. IDEXX commercial teams delivered strong growth in global premium instrument placements, reflecting high interest in adopting IDEXX's point-of-care innovations including expansion of our newest platform solution, ProCyte One.\nCloud-based software placements once again expanded in the quarter, reflecting vet clinic interest in cloud native solutions and the IDEXX full stack software suite that continues to advance in scope and functionality. These gains supported double-digit organic growth in recurring software revenues as veterinarians turn to IDEXX to help them grow their practices and drive productivity. As Brian noted, we continue to work through dynamics in terms of staffing challenges and broader pressure on consumers that have impacted clinic visit growth levels.\nOur strong business performance demonstrates our ability to work through these near-term challenges while continuing to expand our business globally to deliver strong financial performance and advance key drivers of our long-term growth strategy and potential. Today, I'll provide an overview of IDEXX's progress against our strategic initiatives during the first quarter. Let's start with an update on our commercial efforts, which are key to driving the adoption and utilization of IDEXX testing and software solutions.\nIDEXX commercial teams continue to execute at a high level, bringing a customer-first mindset to their work, helping IDEXX's customers to grow faster. The intuitive point that care testing platforms are foundational to this approach. Customer adoption of IDEXX solutions remains high globally, reflected in record first quarter global premium instrument placements for the third consecutive year. This performance, combined with the ability to retain our customers at consistently high levels by delivering an excellent user experience resulted in double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, in total and individually for in-clinic chemistry, premium hematology and urinalysis platforms. This progress is aligned with the approximately 220,000 global placement opportunity we see today for our business.\nA key area of commercial focus is international regions that are at earlier stages of development than the U.S. and provide a relatively more greenfield growth opportunity. Leveraging the successful commercial playbook we have developed from our decades of experience in the U.S., our international sales teams continue to deliver high international installed base growth. Progress on this front is reflected in strong international premium instrument placement gains supported by continued global expansion of our new platform innovations such as ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides significant benefits compared to our legacy hematology analyzers from a more intuitive workflow with load and go reagents to a smaller benchtop footprint and even back-office productivity benefits due to its paper run model, all of which combined to drive greater utilization for customers to upgrade.\nA recent analysis revealed a 20-plus percent uplift in runs per day for customers who upgraded from laser site to ProCyte One with consistent benefits noted across major regions. Upgrades and adoption of new platforms also delivers multiplier benefits to our business to increase customer loyalty and retention and adoption of other IDEXX in clinic analyzers. Our continued installed base expansion in our international sector results in another quarter of strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.\nOur integrated platform solutions, including benefits from our software ecosystem are well aligned to also support the formation of new practices in regions like the U.S., which continues to contribute a net 0.5% to 1% to sector growth. High interest in IDEXX solutions among new practices in the U.S. has become an increasingly important driver of new and competitive placements. Our flexible and customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360 modified to appeal to new practice growth dynamics have attracted strong interest in full point of care suites with high attach rates of catalysts and increased testing across modalities.\nBuilding on our progress advancing adoption and leverage of IDEXX solutions, we continue to make solid progress advancing our ongoing innovation agenda, including the development of new platforms for diagnostic testing. The first of 2 such new testing platforms currently under development was announced recently at [ VMX]. The IDEXX [indiscernible] cellular analyzer, a first of its kind, Slide 3, cellular Analyzer platform. It's powered by advanced optics and enabled by AI that has been trained by IDEXX's global pathology network.\nDevelopment of this platform is proceeding to schedule and is in its final stages as we plan to begin shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of this year. Our commercial teams have begun educating busy customers on this new piece of technology while also using it to engage with customers on other IDEXX solutions that may be relevant to their practices now.\nThis is another multiplier of new IDEXX innovation, which helps support high reach to revenue metrics in the quarter which reflect the efficacy of our commercial playbook. Early feedback from customers across the globe remains highly positive, building up the enthusiasm experience at both domestic and international veterinary conferences, Customers have resonated with both the medical and workflow productivity benefits.\nClinicians are well, for example, by the powerful technological innovations that appreciate the clinical need for solutions to ear cytology a daily practice and blood morphology, a critical element of a complete hematology exam. The feedback is consistent across general practices, specialists and corporate accounts who seek cutting-edge tools from IDEXX. We look forward to building on this highly innovative menu by delivering 5 needle [ aspera ] testing that reflect IDEXX's high-performance standards.\nAt IDEXX innovation goes beyond new platforms. Our technology for life approach means that we're constantly assessing our on-market portfolio for opportunities to add value to our products to new insights, greater efficiency or improved easy use. Similar to how blood morphology insights on the IDEXX in VDX complement our premium hematology analyzers. We recently launched a new generation of our IDEXX VetLab UA platform, which complements [ DX].\nThe new UA analyzer brings a highly attractive, modernized form factor is easier to use and features enhanced integrations with IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS, saving practice team's time on commonly run urine diagnostics. In the 8 essential urine parameters provided on IDEXX VetLab UA, including PH and protein merged with results from SediVue Dx driving actionable interpretive guidance on next steps that support clinicians to make informed medical decisions. IDEXX reference labs are also benefiting from recent innovations where we see momentum building with the recently launched IDEXX STAPnB, our differentiated [ Keeby ] injury detection test that further bolsters our best-in-class renal health offering for our customers.\nWe've now launched in North America, U.K. and Australia and plan to launch in Europe later this year. Experience is growing with its important innovation with almost 500,000 tests ordered by over 13,000 customers since the December launch. Awareness of the test is solid, estimated at just over 50% of U.S. veterinarians based on recent survey work. Significant runway exists to increase awareness and deepen understanding of the clinical utility of this test.\nIDEXX's software and imaging business continues to perform well and is addressing significant unmet customer needs. Our cloud-first strategy to building a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem delivers workflow and communication advantages across a clinic that drive productivity while supporting double-digit growth of our profitable SaaS recurring revenue stream for IDEXX.\nStrong software placement growth is now virtually all via cloud-based products. It is supported by customers looking for modern tools to assess diagnostic insights, create and streamline practice workflows and communicate with an increasingly digitally native end customer by partnering with IDEXX [ SNE ] solutions customers are increasingly freed from unrewarded administrative test to pursue their care mission for patients.\nLike our diagnostic platforms and menu, we're also focused on enhancing the IDEXX software ecosystem. Our recent announcement at the Western Veterinary Conference is an example of this, where we were thrilled to announce that [ fellow], our newest pet owner engagement platform, which officially went live in late March. Veterinarians increasingly tell us that their client communication processes and tools are disjointed, high friction and time-consuming. [indiscernible] provides veterinarians with a powerful tool that is directly embedded within our IDEXX practice management software, supporting streamlined interactions and more efficient workflows.\nThe benefits of expanding IDEXX's vertical software suite are many, including deeper customer relationships and improved compliance that helps drive better health outcomes. Vello supports the growth of our profitable recurring software revenues while also delivering multiplier benefits to our Diagnostics business as early Vello adopters are benefiting from fewer customer no shows and increasing their diagnostic stabilization with IDEXX.\nAnother addition to the software ecosystem was the acquisition of GreenLine Pet a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions, which was completed in the first quarter. The Green Line digital platform enhances IDEXX' partnerships with leading manufacturers in the animal health pharmaceutical and nutrition space, supporting sector development through targeted rebating to customers. Made possible through deep integrations with IDEXX and third-party practice management systems.\nBy delivering additional relevant solutions to our software customers like Greenline and Vello, we're able to drive strong adoption of our deeply integrated vertical SaaS applications inside of our cloud practice management systems. Providing our customers with a single unified platform for payments, workflow and client communications to name a few applications, helps drive efficiency and remove the need to toggle between multiple applications and manual reconciliations. Not only does this accelerated adoption drive practice productivity, but it also supports greater diagnostics revenue growth and very high retention rates, thereby helping drive our key recurring revenue annuity.\nOverall, we're very proud of how we have advanced our strategic initiatives across multiple business areas in the first quarter, while also delivering an excellent customer experience and strong financial results. I'll now conclude our prepared remarks by thanking the 11,000 IDEXX employees for your ongoing commitment and incredible passion for our purpose-driven work. Your contribution to IDEXX not only helps deliver against our goal of providing a better future for animals, people and our planet, but also helped deliver a strong start against our financial objectives in 2024.\nThe companion animal diagnostics sector, including supporting software solutions remains highly attractive, and IDEXX teams play a critical role in providing excellent care based on diagnostic insights. As a result, we are very well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long-term horizon. So on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being pets, people and livestock. Now let's open the line for Q&A."

McKeon\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2023, reflected in our fourth quarter performance.\nRevenues increased 8% organically, supported by 10% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of a 1% growth headwind from fewer equivalent selling days. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. These factors and a lower-than-expected effective tax rate supported delivery of $2.32 per share in EPS in Q4, up 17% on a comparable basis.\nIDEXX execution enabled delivery of strong full year financial results reflected a 9% overall organic revenue growth and high comparable operating margin gains. This supported a 29% increase in EPS for the full year on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from a customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments.\nThese results were driven by a 10.5% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 11% organic gains in the U.S. and 10% organic growth in international regions, aligned with our original full year growth targets.\nWe also achieved 19% full year organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, sustained high customer retention levels, and placed a record number of CAG premium instruments, which drove an 11% expansion of our global premium installed base.\nThese strong execution trends position us well as we enter 2024 and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting 10% organic revenue growth, at the high end of our initial guidance range of 7% to 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic gains in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues.\nWe're also planning for solid comparable operating margin gains, building on our long-term track record supporting continued high comparable EPS growth. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results.\nFourth quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 9% organic gains in our CAG business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 10% organically in Q4, reflecting 9% gains in the U.S. and 12% growth in international regions, net of a 1% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth in Q4 was supported by average global net price improvement of 6% to 7%, with U.S. net price gains at the low end of this range.\nIDEXX execution drivers supported volume gains of 4% in both U.S. and international regions normalized for days effects, reflecting an improvement from Q3 volume growth levels and the strongest normalized volume growth quarter in 2023.\nIDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically, net of 1% negative growth rate impact from fewer equivalent selling days in Q4. This reflects a 1,050 basis point normalized growth premium compared to U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 0.5% in the quarter on a same-store basis.\nIDEXX execution drivers drove solid U.S. volume growth in the quarter, reflecting benefits from new business gains, high customer retention levels, and sustained diagnostic frequency levels per visit.\nInternational CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 12% in Q4, reflecting benefits from higher net price realization and improved volume gains. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in continued solid growth in premium instrument placements, which supported a 13% year-on-year increase in our international premium instrument installed base.\nIDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our major testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting double-digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by an 11% increase in our global premium installed base in 2023, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms.\nFor the full year 2023, we achieved a record 19,000 premium instrument placements with excellent quality, reflected in sustained high new and competitive Catalyst placements. In Q4, we placed 5,241 premium instruments, up 3% from high prior year levels, driven by strong gains in SediVue placements and continued expansion of ProCyte One.\nOverall CAG instrument revenues declined 3% organically in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects and global mix. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically in Q4, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the U.S. Global Lab revenues expanded 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and sustained solid organic revenue growth in international regions.\nCAG veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 6% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior year levels. Results continued to be supported by double-digit growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 11% organically, supported by 19% organic gains in recurring revenues.\nIn our other business segments, Water revenues increased 5% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior year levels, supported by continued solid gains in the U.S. and Europe. Overall growth in the quarter was moderated by lower China revenues and year-end order timing. For the full year, Water revenues grew 8% overall and 7% organically.\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 4% organically in Q4 as solid gains in the U.S., Europe and Latin America were offset by declines in herd health screening revenues and comparisons to higher prior swine testing levels in China. For the full year, LPD revenues were down 1% organically as solid gains across our core ruminant poultry and swine businesses were offset by declines in areas like herd health screening, reflecting regional macro dynamics. We expect to work through comparison issues in herd health screening post the first quarter of 2024.\nTurning to the P&L. Q4 operating profit increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, supported by solid comparable operating margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% as reported and on a comparable basis.\nGross margins were 58.4%, up 50 basis points on a comparable basis, adjusting for 70 basis points of negative FX impact, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from net price improvement, which offset inflationary cost impacts, favorable business mix impacts from strong consumable growth, and higher software service gross margins.\nOperating expenses were up 9% as reported and 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter, reflecting growth in commercial investments and increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation initiatives, including our new instrument platforms.\nFor the full year 2023, operating margins were 30%, including approximately 40 basis points of benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins increased 390 basis points, including 280 basis points of combined benefit from the customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating margin gains by 60 basis points, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains.\nQ4 EPS was $2.32 per share, up 17% on a comparable basis. In Q4, EPS benefited from a lower effective tax rate. This reflected the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, which lowered our full year effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and increased EPS by $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter EPS included $0.02 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.04 in headwind from foreign exchange changes primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. FX hedge gains were $2 million in the quarter.\nFull year EPS was $10.06 per share, an increase of 29% on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, stock-based compensation activity provided $14 million or $0.16 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 130 basis points. As noted, full year comparable EPS growth also benefited by $0.10 per share or approximately 1% from the release of tax valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions.\nForeign exchange increased Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 1% and 0%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.24 per share, primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. In 2023, full year foreign exchange hedge gains were $4 million.\nFree cash flow was $773 million for 2023 or 91% of net income. Free cash flow conversion was above the high end of earlier projections, reflecting timing and control of capital spending. Capital spending was $134 million for the full year or 3.7% of revenue.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2023 with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.4x net of cash. Our 2024 interest expense outlook incorporates recent forward interest rates and expectations for similar leverage ratios this year.\nWe allocated $38 million to repurchase 90,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, we allocated $83 million to repurchase 175,000 shares. Targeted deployment of cash to share repurchases supports our projected 0.5% to 1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2024.\nTurning to our 2024 full year outlook. We're providing initial guidance for revenues of $3.930 billion to $4.04 billion, an increase of 7.5% to 10.5% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, this reflects a growth range of 7% to 10% overall, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to have limited impact on full year revenue growth. Our reported revenue growth outlook includes approximately $15 million of projected revenue from our recent software acquisition, which Jay will highlight in his comments.\nIn terms of the key drivers of our 2024 organic growth outlook. The midpoint of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range incorporates expectations for global net price gains of approximately 5% and volume gains of approximately 4%, aligned with assumptions for relatively flat U.S. clinical visit same-store growth levels post Q1. As we'll discuss, we have seen some effects from severe U.S. weather trends in January, which we expect will impact overall Q1 clinical visit growth levels.\nOur full year outlook reflects a U.S. volume growth premium to U.S. clinical visits aligned with our trends in the second half of 2023, supported by expectations for continued solid global growth benefits from IDEXX execution drivers. The higher end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range captures the potential for improved sector visit and same-store growth trends and overall IDEXX volume growth potential. The lower end of the range calibrates for potential risk to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions.\nThe high end of our overall organic revenue growth guidance of 10% is aligned with our long-term goals. We expect overall organic growth to be constrained somewhat by expectations for modest organic growth in LPD and comparisons to strong prior year instrument placement levels.\nOur reported operating margin guidance for the full year of 2024 is 30.2% to 30.7%. On a comparable basis, this reflects an outlook for 20 to 70 basis points of improvement in comparable annual operating margins, net of a negative 40 basis point operating margin impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment.\nWe're planning for solid gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023, supported by continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, expansion of our cloud-based software business, and benefits from lab productivity initiatives.\nWe expect limited impact from foreign exchange on 2024 revenue growth and operating margin at the rates assumed in our press release. We estimate foreign exchange will increase full year EPS by $0.02 per share given current hedge positions. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the foreign exchange rates assumed in our press release, we projected that a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $30 million and operating income by approximately $4 million net of hedges.\nOur 2024 EPS outlook is $10.84 to $11.33 per share. This reflects an increase of 8% to 13% as reported and, on a comparable basis, net of a 2% EPS growth headwind from the lapping of the customer contract resolution payment and 1% of headwind related to lapping and benefits from tax valuation reserve releases in 2023.\nOur EPS outlook factors in a 1.5% increase in our overall effective tax rate to approximately 22% in 2024, reflecting these lapping impacts and lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity. Our EPS outlook captures expected benefits in 2024 from lower interest expense compared to 2023, as well as expectations for reductions in average share count.\nOur 2024 free cash flow outlook is for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 90% to 95%, aligned with our long-term goals. This reflects estimated capital spending of $180 million or approximately 4.5% of revenues. Overall, we're well positioned to deliver continued strong financial performance in 2024.\nIn terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, factoring in approximately 1% of negative growth impact from severe weather in the U.S. in January, and constraints on Q1 growth in areas like LPD related to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Reported revenue growth should be largely in line with organic revenue growth estimates.\nIn terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for reported operating margins of 29.4% to 29.8% in Q1. This reflects an outlook for flat to moderate expansion in comparable operating margins, adjusting for the lapping of the prior year $16 million customer contract resolution payment recorded in Q1 2023 as an offset to operating expense.\nThat concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, capping a year where we advanced our strategic priorities while driving strong business growth and excellent financial results. Our high-touch commercial model, the focus on the customer, and accelerated innovation drivers supported ongoing sector development. The use of growth in relevant diagnostic testing generates important clinical insights that informed veterinarians' mission to deliver better medical care while growing their businesses in a highly profitable diagnostics category.\nHigh levels of execution against our strategy drove double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. This was aligned with our original full year growth targets and reflected strong gains across our major regions. High growth in our durable high-return annuity revenues included strong growth in our recurring software and digital imaging annuity streams. These gains reflected the cumulative impact of double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, supported by high-quality instrument placements, solid new business gains, expansion of integrated cloud-based software solutions, and net price realization aligned with the value we deliver.\nIDEXX commercial teams delivered improved volume gains this quarter as we continued to work through factors constraining clinical visit levels. The solid growth momentum we carried through 2023 demonstrates that customers of all types appreciate IDEXX's purpose-built solutions and seek these tools and services to achieve sought-after efficiency gains.\nWe're excited to build on this momentum in 2024. Today, I'll highlight the key capabilities and initiatives that have advanced our strategy to address the long-term growth opportunity for our business, through direct commercial partnership and innovation to enhance care delivery. I'll start with a review of our global commercial execution and its foundational role in creating awareness, education and, ultimately, the increased use of IDEXX Diagnostics.\nIDEXX's commercial teams bring deep subject matter expertise and a partnership mindset that has resulted in gains above sector growth levels. Solid premium instrument placement growth in Q4 capped off a year of record premium instrument placements. Outstanding full year performance was reflected in sustained high levels of Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts, including record new and competitive placement levels in the U.S.\nWe also realized double-digit expansion of our premium hematology and SediVue installed bases. High-quality, high EVI placements, coupled with sustained customer retention rates in the 97% to 99% range for the U.S. and, similarly, high levels globally set a solid foundation for future CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. It also demonstrates our customers' appreciation for IDEXX is easy to use in clinic platforms that provide them with deep diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care, while managing workflow effectively in a busy and dynamic clinic backdrop.\nOur effectiveness in growing the installed base for premium instruments not only benefits our consumables' recurring revenue stream, but also drives growth across our diagnostic modalities as testing begets testing, and our customers are inspired to expand their use of IDEXX solutions. This adoption of our multi-modality offering is supported by strong customer interest and marketing programs like IDEXX 360, which makes the adoption of IDEXX technology easy and financially appealing. The adoption of these technologies help support sector diagnostics revenue growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, which benefited from diagnostic frequency expansion and wellness visits and diagnostics utilization gains overall. Diagnostics remains one of the fastest-growing areas in the veterinary practice, reflected in solid and sustained high single-digit same-store revenue growth at the practice level. Our long-term investments in commercial and R&D resources positions IDEXX well to help our customers build on this momentum.\nOur growing global direct commercial capability is an important element of this strategy to sustain strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Our most recent commercial expansion was completed in the U.S. during Q4, and is the first in 4 years as many of our territories have become very large. It complements the 7 targeted international expansions we've advanced since 2021 in countries around the world. These are attractive, high-return investments that support future growth by delivering high-touch commercial engagement in our fastest-growing regions, and our commercial teams have consistently shown the ability to complete these expansions while still delivering strong business results.\nOur international business performance is showing the benefits of our expanded global commercial capability. We continue to achieve strong new business gains, reflected in the 13% expansion of our international premium installed base this year, driven by double-digit installed base growth across our chemistry, hematology and urine sediment in clinic platforms. These gains drove improved international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, specifically for sequential quarters of volume growth normalized for days despite macro headwinds that have pressured same-store sales levels.\nThe expanded footprint of our [ VDC ] based commercial model in international regions, customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360, and an expanded international lab network gives us the right tools to successfully address the approximately 2/3 of the total opportunity estimate which exists outside the U.S.\nIn addition to growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, IDEXX also delivered very strong performance this year in expanding our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging segment. Our software and imaging solutions provide busy customers with an intuitive and efficient way to access diagnostic insights and manage important workflow and communications across our clinics.\nClinics continue to embrace the opportunity to embed software in many aspects of their business and use technology to generate diagnostic insights, eliminate pain points across back-end areas of the clinic, and open meaningful lines of communication with their increasingly younger customer demographic. By adopting these contemporary software solutions, clinicians and their staff are significantly better able to focus on providing high levels of care for their patients and reduce their time spent on unrewarded administrative activities that either help them practice medicine or help them drive business growth.\nSupported by excellent commercial engagement and performance, fourth quarter PIMS placements continue to be driven by interest in cloud native products, which represented over 90% of placements in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023, supporting strong double-digit cloud PIMS installed base growth for the year. This high adoption of IDEXX software solutions drove 19% of organic gains in our highly profitable recurring revenues in the veterinary software diagnostic imaging segment this year. These gains provide a growing attractive profit stream to the company and delivers a multiplier benefit as loyal software customers grow their diagnostic revenues faster.\nOur veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues benefit from growth in our PIMS installed base and from our focus on expanding IDEXX's subscription-based service portfolio. IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud native workflow engine for digital imaging, is a great example. We're pleased with the continued double-digit Web PACS subscriber growth which thousands of practices have adopted and fully integrated into the IDEXX software technology stack.\nWe recently added advanced dental imaging workflows to Web PACS, addressing a major pain point for the 75% of practices who regularly take dental extras. These integrated dental imaging workflows, including full dental charts and 2 specific image sorting, streamlines what is otherwise a complicated and time-intensive process for practices.\nThese results demonstrate the benefits from our innovative integrated software offering that is globally relevant to a wide variety of clinics. We're building on our momentum with existing platforms such as VetConnect PLUS and with new solutions to further drive efficiencies within the clinic. One example of which is an updated user experience for the IDEXX VetLab Station, which is a practice team's one-stop control panel and workflow engine. Announced recently at VMX and coming to our customers in the second half of 2024, this new interface will deliver 2x faster in-clinic diagnostic workflows for all instruments across the IDEXX VetLab suite.\nAdditionally, while both our diagnostics and software businesses rely primarily on organic growth, we continue to look for attractive and strategic acquisitions to deliver more value to our customers and their clients. We recently closed the acquisition of a private U.S.-based software and data platform that enhances our software ecosystem and further accelerates our growth in that business. This acquisition extends our PIMS cloud-native workflow and deliver strategic data solutions to our customers and their clients. As we integrate its capabilities deeply inside PIMS platforms, we believe there will be sector growth benefits for deeper engagement between manufacturers, customers and pet owners to drive adoption of highly relevant clinical offerings.\nInnovation is a bedrock of how IDEXX has been able to provide our customers with critical diagnostic insights that enable and drive the medical care envelope. We've invested over $2 billion over the last 20-plus years in instrument platform development, differentiated assay discovery and customer-facing software, data and connectivity. Our commitment and leadership and innovation has driven sector development through higher standards of care in global animal health.\nThe most recent example of our commitment to transformational innovation is within our point-of-care business. The IDEXX inVue cellular analyzer is an advanced optics and AI platform, cellular imaging that removes the need for clinic staff to prepare and interpret sizes, delivering clinically insightful diagnostic test results while giving valuable time back to the practice. It works by interrogating and interpreting cells in intracellular structures in their natural state, providing spectacular 3D images that enables differential diagnosis to slide-based methods.\nThe near-term menu for this new platform will address highly relevant, high-volume established categories, including ear cytology and blood morphology, both available when we begin shipping the product in Q4 of this year with fine needle asper testing on lumps and bumps to be available next.\nWith built-in advanced optics, powerful AI leveraging our global pathology expertise, and 2-way connectivity, the IDEXX inVue Analyzer allows for continued menu expansion, building off our proven track record of increasing value over time of IDEXX products and service offerings. We estimate a 20,000 global placement opportunity over 5 years from the point of shipment in Q4 of this year, driven by a highly relevant menu and intuitive time-saving workflow. Customer response to initial trials into our announcement at VMX were overwhelmingly positive.\nIn addition to the IDEXX inVue Analyzer, we also recently announced the latest addition to our fecal Dx antigen platform at our reference labs. Already the gold standard for fecal diagnostics, the Fecal Dx antigen platform now identifies Cystoisospora, a common intestinal parasite that typically impacts young dogs and cats, representing the second extension in as many years. Available at no additional costs starting next month, the addition of Cystoisospora will make the best even better and help clinicians have even greater confidence when they choose IDEXX's reference labs for one of the most common time-consuming preventive screening tests.\nIn addition to this expansion on our Fecal Dx antigen panel as planned, we have successfully launched of IDEXX Cystatin B in North America in December, adding kidney injury detection to what is already the most comprehensive menu for kidney health in the industry. Since launch, about 10,000 IDEXX customers have benefited from over 200,000 IDEXX Cystatin B test in North America.\nOverall, we're very proud of the accomplishments we've been able to advance this year in expanding our business capabilities and value-added partnerships with our customers. Our focus on attractive investment and innovation opportunities, while delivering strong financial results, helped drive exceptional return on invested capital in 2023.\nWith that, I'll conclude by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing commitment to our purpose and their strong execution against our strategy. These business results require coordinated, intensive work across the organization and IDEXX teams rose to the challenge. High levels of performance across the company, both delivered today in 2023 and set us up well to build off this growth through 2024.\nThere's a significant attractive opportunity to continue to inspire the adoption and utilization of diagnostic solutions and related products. Our IDEXX teams continue to work tirelessly to address this opportunity, while pursuing our mission to provide a better future for animals, people and our planet. It's an honor to report IDEXX's progress and results on behalf of our colleagues. So on behalf of the IDEXX management team, thank you for all your efforts this year.\nWith that, we'll now conclude our prepared remarks and open the line for Q&A."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nIDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today.\nAdditional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements noticed in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn reviewing our third quarter 2023 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2022, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. Today's prepared remarks will be posted through the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings conference call concludes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q3 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid revenue growth and strong profit gains in the third quarter. Overall revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 9% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, net of approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from pure equivalent selling days.\nOrganic revenue growth was supported by sustained benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including continued strong premium instrument placements, solid new business gains, high levels of customer retention and high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues.\nOverall CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains in the quarter were moderated by a 2% same-store decline in U.S. clinical visits. This was below our expectations for relatively flattening U.S. clinic visit trends, reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges at U.S. clinics and relatively softer wellness levels.\nOperating profit results were ahead of our expectations, supported by gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, which enabled EPS delivery of $2.53 per share, up 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Based on our strong financial results in the quarter, we're updating our full year EPS outlook aligned with the higher end of our previous guidance range. This reflects expectations for strong comparable operating margin gains this year.\nWe're also updating our full year revenue guidance ranges to incorporate our Q3 results and recent sector trends as well as to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments.\nLet's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 8% organic CAG gains and 7% organic growth in our Water business. Overall organic revenue growth was moderated by 2% organic growth in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower OPTI Medical revenues, including effects from the wind down of our human COVID testing business.\nCAG Diagnostics recurring revenue increased 9% organically, reflecting 8.3% gains in the U.S. and 10.3% growth in international regions, net of a 0.5% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth in Q3 was supported by average global net price improvement of approximately 7%, in line with our expectations for 6% to 7% gains in the second half of this year.\nOverall, organic revenue growth was supported by 13% organic growth in Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues driven by continued strong gains in Recurring Software revenues.\nCAG instrument revenues were down 10% organically, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects and global mix. IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels.\nIn the U.S., CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth was 8.3%, including approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from fewer selling days in Q3. This reflects an approximate 1,100 basis point normalized growth premium compared to same-store U.S. clinic visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2% overall in the quarter.\nIDEXX' growth results reflect continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit at the practice level and strong benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization, solid new business gains and sustained high customer retention levels.\nAs noted, same-store U.S. clinic visit declines of 2% were below our expectations for relatively flat clinic visit growth in the second half of 2023. Softer trends in Q3 appear to have been impacted by ongoing capacity management challenges at U.S. clinics, including effects from high staff turnover.\nWe also saw a relative slowdown in wellness visits in the quarter, which may reflect some macro impacts on demand at the clinic level. We've refined our full year revenue outlook to capture potential impacts from these trends in Q4, while reinforcing our strong outlook for 2023 profit performance.\nIDEXX International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth was 10.3% in Q3, reflecting continued benefits from higher net price realization and improved volume gains. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution reflected in sustained new business gains and high Q3 premium instrument placements, which supported a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base.\nDouble-digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset negative impacts from international macro conditions, which continue to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter. Globally, Q3 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.\nIDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically with double-digit gains in U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology and SediVue platforms.\nWe placed 4,571 CAG premium instruments in Q3, a decrease of 4% year-on-year compared to record prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One. The quality of the instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflected in solid global gains in EVI metrics and sustain high new and competitive catalyst placements in the U.S.\nGlobal catalyst placements decreased 2% overall, reflecting tough comparisons to high prior year international placement levels. ProCyte One installed base expansion continued at a solid pace reflected in a global installed base of over 12,000 instruments.\nGlobal Rapid Assay revenues expanded 8% organically in Q3, supported by strong growth in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and relatively improved mid- to high single-digit growth in international regions.\nIn other areas of our CAG business, Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements.\nWater revenues increased 7% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior year growth levels. Growth was driven by continued solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from net price improvement. Our TECTA-PDS acquisition integration continues to progress well and added approximately 1% to reported Water growth.\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 2% organically as strong gains in the U.S. continue to be moderated by constraints on international growth, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing.\nTurning to the P&L. Q3 profit results were supported by high comparable operating margin gains, including benefits from operating expense leverage. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.9%, up 30 basis points on a comparable basis compared to strong prior year levels.\nGross margin gains reflected benefits from higher net price realization, business mix and improvement in software service gross margins. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60 basis point negative impact related to FX driven by the lapping of prior year hedge gains. We're projecting an approximate 70 basis point gross margin headwind in Q4 related to FX, again, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains.\nOn a reported basis, operating expenses increased 4% year-on-year as reported and on a comparable basis, reflecting benefits from cost controls and lapping of prior year R&D and commercial investments. We're planning for a higher level of OpEx growth in Q4 as we advance our U.S. commercial expansion and increased R&D investments aligned with our innovation initiatives, including our planned 2024 new platform launch.\nEPS was $2.53 per share in Q3, an increase of 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $1 million and EPS by $0.01 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of $9 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023 foreign exchange hedges resulted in a $1 million gain in the quarter.\nFree cash flow was $238 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 83%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for free cash flow conversion to 85% to 90% of net income at the higher end of earlier projections, reflecting estimated capital spending of $160 million to $180 million.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.6x net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 0.1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. We allocated $35 million of capital on share repurchases in the third quarter as we continue to manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment.\nTurning to our 2023 P&L guidance. We're updating our full year outlook to incorporate our Q3 results and revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3.635 billion to $3.650 billion reflecting a 7.9% to 8.4% reported growth range.\nThe updated reported revenue outlook includes a $20 million reduction for FX impacts compared to prior estimates. We now estimate FX will reduce fully reported growth by approximately 0.5% with limited year-on-year revenue growth effects in Q4. In terms of our operational revenue growth outlook, we're updating our full year organic growth guidance to 8.3% to 8.8% supported by an outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth of 9.8% to 10.3%. This aligns with the lower end of our most recent guidance ranges in the midpoint of our original guidance for 2023.\nOur organic growth guidance assumes a level of continued pressure on U.S. same-store clinical visits and international same-store sales levels in Q4 reflecting ongoing clinic capacity management dynamics and macroeconomic impacts on demand. Consistent with earlier guidance, our outlook for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth reflects continued solid positive benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including consistent expectations for 6% to 7% net price improvement in the second half of 2023.\nIn Q4, we expect global net price improvement within this range, with U.S. net price gains of approximately 6%, reflecting the lapping of prior year price increases. Our Q4 outlook also incorporates a 1% equivalent day volume growth headwind. We're maintaining the high end of our reported EPS outlook and narrowing the full year EPS guidance range to $9.74 to $9.90 per share, an increase of $0.05 per share at midpoint.\nAt midpoint, we're maintaining a consistent operational EPS outlook as revisions to our organic revenue growth range are offset by positive adjustments to our projections for operating margins, incorporating our strong year-to-date performance. We've increased the outlook for reported operating margins to 29.6% to 29.8% for the full year. This reflects an outlook for 360 to 380 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion including approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022.\nOur updated full year EPS guidance incorporates $0.11 per share and positive revisions combined to our interest expense and tax rate outlook, including $0.04 in upside related to share-based compensation tax benefits. These gains are partially offset by $0.05 of negative impact from foreign exchange changes at updated rates.\nWe now estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by $0.25 per share for the full year and will reduce full year operating margins by approximately 70 basis points, including impacts to a lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains.\nWe provided details on our updated 2023 outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshots.\nThat concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX continued to make excellent progress in advancing our business strategy in Q3, while delivering solid organic revenue growth and strong financial performance. Our strategy of high-touch commercial engagement supported by relevant testing and workflow innovations drove continued adoption of IDEXX' world-class products and services.\nIDEXX solutions support our customers' mission to deliver high standards of care, enabled through the continued expansion of diagnostics frequency and utilization at the practice level. Diagnostics revenue remains the fastest-growing area of veterinary clinic revenues, a durable trend since the determination of a patient's health status and the best treatment path very often requires testing. IDEXX' strong financial performance in Q3 was supported by solid gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across our major regions. The expansion of recurring revenues benefit from multiple IDEXX execution drivers including solid placements of premium instruments building off high prior year levels, sustained new business gains, net price realization and continued momentum in placements of cloud-based software solutions.\nThese gains are offsetting near-term headwinds in overall clinic visit levels globally, reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges in veterinary practices as well as impacts from macroeconomic dynamics. Productivity remains a top priority for veterinary clinics who continue to refine their business approach and make trade-offs necessary to balance staffing management challenges with strong demand for medical services.\nIDEXX solutions anchored by our software-enabled multi-modality offering, give clinics the tools to address these dynamics. Today, I'll review how we're advancing our strategy focused on developing the significant long-term growth opportunity for our business while delivering strong financial performance.\nI'll start with an update on our global commercial performance and how our focus on customer engagement supports the increase in adoption and utilization of diagnostics.\nIDEXX commercial teams are highly engaged in a customer-centric model that supports both existing customers' [ use ] of diagnostics and expanding our customer base. Our commercial professionals delivered another excellent quarter of results in Q3. Solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue reflects benefits from our expanding loyal installed base and our veterinary partnership model to communicate the importance of diagnostics to clinicians.\nIt also reflects benefits from our focus on placing high-value analyzers at existing and competitive accounts in order to drive profitable future recurring revenues including 5% competitive catalyst placement growth in North America, which supported solid EVI growth.\nOur continued progress on this front reflects a relentless focus on providing busy clinicians with the products, services and the support they need to serve the high demand for veterinary services and meet the expectations of pet owners who seek and increasingly demand no compromises in the care for their pets.\nIn addition to driving the core growth in medical services in the clinic, Diagnostics are also a key profit center, continued growth in both Diagnostics frequency and utilization per clinical visit was supported by gains in wellness testing per visit, building on substantial increases due to the pandemic. This demonstrates that veterinarians continue to incorporate and expand the use of diagnostics in their care protocols, while pet owners continue to show willingness to spend on their pets.\nThis focus supported solid 7% gains in same-store diagnostic revenue gain at the practice level, growth that is being achieved despite ongoing headwinds in clinical visit growth in a resource-constrained and challenging macro environment. This performance shows that pet owners continue to prioritize health care for their pets, which reinforces the resiliency of our sector. And IDEXX customers are growing even faster supported by our direct customer engagement model and superior integrated diagnostic solutions.\nIDEXX' experienced sales professionals deep partnership with the veterinarians they serve supported sector diagnostics revenue growth that outpaced both practice revenue and clinical revenue growth by 200-plus basis points in Q3, building on our strong momentum in helping to advance pet health care through diagnostics testing.\nGrowing our commercial footprint in a disciplined way is a key element of our customer engagement strategy. As we shared at Investor Day, extensive practice data analysis shows that customers using our broader DX offering generate approximately 200 basis points higher practice clinical and diagnostics revenue growth, consistent with our execution trends. This benefits the patient, practice economics and by extension IDEXX.\nOur U.S. commercial expansion is progressing to plan, and we expect to enter the new year with an expanded team in place. This is the first U.S. expansion in 4 years and many territories have appreciably increased in size since then. Increasing reach and engagement with clinics in our largest and most developed region prepares us well to support the growing portfolio of IDEXX Innovations. Outlined in the U.S., we remain focused on deploying our commercial playbook in countries across the world and are encouraged to report that third quarter international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues benefited from another quarter of improving volume growth. Higher reached revenue metrics, strengthened relationships between IDEXX commercial professionals and in-region veterinarians. Our increased commercial presence as a result of 7 international commercial expansion since 2020 helped drive solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our international premium instrument installed base across platforms.\nThis includes record third quarter instrument placements in the Asia Pacific region, which helped drive 13% growth in our international installed base. This growth demonstrates that our highly capable sales teams have the right products at the right time and reinforce significant potential associated with the development of international regions.\nThese geographies represent an outsized portion of our long-term opportunity of over 200,000 incremental premium placements for existing instrument categories.\nTurning to our innovation agenda. Software is a key pillar in our growth strategy in an area of important focus in the clinic, a trend that we are well positioned to facilitate and enable. Clinics are embracing software to improve efficiency in all aspects of their business from patient processing and billing to diagnostics interpretation and pet owner communication. Higher software adoption is driven by the desire to realize the benefits of modern technology and applications to address these significant workflow pain points.\nIt also positions practices to incorporate solutions that increase engagement with pet owners through scheduling and other tools that they use and rely on in other aspects of their lives. The multiplier benefit to our business from the adoption of IDEXX software is significant, reflected in third quarter growth in our Software and Diagnostics Imaging segment with high-teen organic gains in our highly profitable recurring annuity stream.\nExcellent commercial execution and strong customer interest drove outstanding third quarter PIMS placements. Most notably, our cloud-based PIMS products represent 95% of total PIMS placements and as a result, now comprise over 50% of our PIMS installed base. This achievement reflects broad-based adoption of cloud-based products that reflects an inflection point in technology adoption while veterinarians earlier in their careers are more digitally native. Sales profiles indicate that customers of all career stages appreciate the workflow benefits and easy use of our wide-ranging software stack. The common denominator is that contemporary software solutions allow them to better focus on the delivery of care and minimize non-value-add administrative activities.\nOur software product offering also includes an integrated diagnostics portal, VetConnect PLUS with IDEXX DecisionIQ that not only provides testing results, but also decision support, clinical insights and next step considerations across a growing range of clinical use cases.\nIDEXX Software and Data Solutions situate us well to benefit from these trends as well as the accretion and operating margin drop-through associated with a revenue base that is increasingly recurring in nature. Our software innovation is deeply integrated with our diagnostics innovation approach as evidenced by our highly successful instrument platform strategy, enabled by cloud-based capabilities and connectivity that enhance practice insight and workflow. We're very excited about our continued progress in bringing transformative solutions to point of care, and we are on plan to announce our new platform at VMX in January.\nOur product development efforts continue to advance aligned to our timing expectations and we're excited to share more details in just a few short months and how it will add to our over 200,000 placement opportunity estimate for existing instrument categories.\nWe also continue to advance our innovation engine in other areas like advanced test menu, innovation and assays that provide new clinical insights earlier in disease states is especially valued by veterinarians, since they drive higher standards of care aligned with the goal of improving health outcomes for their patients.\nEarlier this year, we announced the launch of an important new testing assay, [indiscernible], that expands our industry-leading renal portfolio and will be available in early December, beginning with our North American lab network. This will be followed by international launches over the course of 2024. This novel marker uses IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney injury earlier and more definitively and is receiving broad support from key opinion leaders, notably, a recent article in the journal of Internal Veterinary Medicine, coauthored by multiple Renal [ Interest ] Society members highlights the beneficial insights in distinguishing progressive from stable kidney disease by detecting active injury.\nThese clinical insights represent important medical contributions, and the test will be included in close to 2 million urine panels run at IDEXX Reference Labs in our first year post launch. Looking forward, we will announce an additional expansion to our reference lab testing menu in Q1.\nIn addition to these examples of product and service innovation, we continue to advance differentiated service delivery as a key element of our expansion strategy. We made a notable advancement in this area early in the third quarter when we opened our newest reference laboratory in Perth, Western Australia.\nPerth is an economically vibrant city that is 5.5-hour flight from our Brisbane laboratory, including a 2-hour time difference, making it particularly difficult to service in the past. The addition of this new lab to our global network ensures customers will receive faster turnaround times for test results, enabling them to make timely and informed decisions for their patients' wellbeing.\nIDEXX provides the only veterinary dedicated and accredited reference laboratory network in Australia and New Zealand. So bringing this location online is an important achievement as we strive to deliver sustainable long-term value. The expansion of our global reference lab footprint is just one way we're addressing the approximately 2/3 of our estimated TAM opportunity outside of the U.S., an area of focus.\nWith that, I'll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call. Before we move to Q&A, I want to take a moment to express our heartfelt sympathy for everyone affected by the events in Lewiston, Maine last week. We are deeply saddened by the senseless active violence impacting our communities, keeping our colleagues safe, supporting each other and providing health and well-being support as a top priority during this difficult time.\nI also want to thank law enforcement and public safety personnel who are working tirelessly to keep our community safe and medical teams have continued to aid all who have been impacted.\nNow let's open the line for Q&A."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nIDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures are provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn reviewing our second quarter 2023 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2022 unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions] Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings conference call concludes.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023.\nIn terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved strong growth and financial performance in the second quarter, aligned with our full year performance goals. Overall revenues increased 10% organically, supported by 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues with double-digit gains in U.S. and international regions.\nKey execution metrics remain very strong globally, reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains and sustained high growth and recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profit results were ahead of our expectations, reflecting solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, both benefiting from strong CAG recurring revenue growth.\nFor the first half of 2023, we achieved 10% overall organic revenue growth and nearly 12% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We also achieved better-than-targeted operating margin improvement. We've made positive refinements to our full year operational outlook incorporating this performance, which we'll discuss later in my comments.\nLet's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and 9% organic growth in our Water business. Overall organic revenue growth was constrained by modest gains in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower OPTI Medical revenues, reflecting the wind down of our human COVID testing business.\nCAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 12% organically, reflecting 12% gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by global net price gains at the higher end of our targeted 8% to 9% improvement range for the first half of 2023.\nOverall, organic revenue growth was supported by 13% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 6% organically, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects and global mix. IDEXX CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels.\nIn the U.S., we achieved a consistent strong 1,370 basis point growth premium in Q2 compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 1.3% in the quarter. These results reflect benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level.\nInternational CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth improved organically to 10% in Q2, reflecting positive volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected the sustained new business gains and record Q2 premium instrument placements, which supported a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continued to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter.\nGlobally, Q2 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG Diagnostic revenues. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 15% organically with double-digit gains in U.S. and international regions.\nConsumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,740 CAG premium instruments in Q2, an increase of 7% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One.\nCatalyst placements increased 15% globally, reflecting 8% gains in the U.S. and 19% placement growth in international regions. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, demonstrated by 9% global growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements and solid gains in EVI metrics. ProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally, reflected in a global installed base of approximately 10,800 instruments.\nGlobal Rapid Assay revenues expanded 12% organically in Q2 driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S. and mid-single-digit growth in international with growth in international regions moderated by macroeconomic impacts, which pressured same-store sales.\nIn other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements.\nWater revenue increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta PDS acquisition continues to progress well, expanding our capabilities in water safety testing and adding approximately 2% to reported water growth. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue increased 1% organically as strong gains in the U.S. were offset by impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing.\nTurning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 11% in the quarter as reported and 13% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.7%, up 160 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflect benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity and operational initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix, which offset inflationary cost effects.\nAs expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60 basis point negative impact related to foreign exchange changes, including the lapping of prior year hedge gains. While foreign exchange trends have improved, we're expecting approximately 70 to 80 basis points of negative impact in year-on-year reported gross margin comparisons in the second half of 2023 as we work through lapping of $18 million of prior year foreign exchange hedge gains.\nOn a reported basis, operating expenses decreased 17% year-on-year, reflecting a 26% favorable growth rate impact from comparisons to prior year levels, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment. Adjusting for this effect, operating expense growth was modestly below revenue growth in the quarter supporting operating margin gains.\nEPS was $2.67 per share in Q2, an increase of 71% as reported. On a comparable basis, EPS increased 77%, including approximately 54% of growth rate benefit from lapping the $0.72 per share prior year impact from discrete R&D investments. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million and EPS by $0.07 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of $6 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023, foreign exchange hedges were limited in the quarter.\nFree cash flow was $173 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 75%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.9x gross and 0.7x net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding. We do not allocate capital to share repurchases in the second quarter as we manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment.\nTurning to our 2023 P&L outlook. We're refining our full year outlook to incorporate our solid first half operating results and updated estimates of foreign exchange impacts. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3.66 billion to $3.715 billion, reflecting an 8.5% to 10% organic growth range. This outlook includes a $15 million favorable adjustment for foreign exchange changes, which we now estimate will have a relatively flat full year impact on reported revenue growth at the rate shown in our press release.\nIn terms of our operational growth outlook, we're maintaining our performance goals aligned with the high end of our guidance range of 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 11% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. This reflects expectations for consistent strong levels of IDEXX execution aligned with H1 trends.\nOur outlook incorporates approximately 1% of expected H2 headwinds for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues from equivalent days effects. Consistent with earlier guidance, our high-end outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth [indiscernible] expectations for 6% to 7% net price gains and a relative flattening of the U.S. same-store clinical visit growth trends in H2.\nWe've raised the low end of our full year organic revenue growth outlook by 1% to reflect our strong first half performance. We've also made positive adjustments to our outlook for operating margin performance in 2023.\nOur updated outlook is for reported operating margins in the range of 29.3% to 29.7% for the full year. At the high end, this reflects an outlook [indiscernible] 360 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points and combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022.\nOur operating margin outlook reflects expectations for moderated year-on-year comparable gross margin gains in the second half compared to strong prior year levels. We continue to project that foreign exchange will reduce operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year primarily related to impacts from lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. We estimate that foreign exchange impacts would decrease EPS by approximately $0.21 per share for the full year with approximately $0.02 per share of negative impact in the second half, including effects from hedge gain lapping.\nOur updated EPS outlook is $9.64 to $9.90 per share. This is an increase of $0.23 per share at midpoint, reflecting $0.17 in benefit from our raised operational outlook and $0.06 in combined benefit from refined interest expense and foreign exchange estimates.\nIn terms of our operational outlook for Q3, we're planning for organic revenue growth at the lower end of our updated full year growth range incorporating expected impacts from approximately 1% of equivalent day headwinds. We expect foreign exchange to provide approximately 1.5% in reported growth rate benefit in the quarter.\nWe're planning for operating margins in the 28.5% to 29% range, reflecting expectations for relatively consistent comparable operating margin performance adjusting for unfavored foreign exchange margin impacts of approximately 50 basis points driven by hedge gain lapping. We provided details on our updated full year outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshot.\nThat concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX once again delivered strong results supported by outstanding execution in the second quarter. We advanced our strategy by engaging customers with integrated testing solutions that support their mission and address real-world clinical and practice problems.\nDemand for medical services remains high and veterinarians see diagnostics as a core enabler to guide individualized best care. As a result, we saw strong diagnostic sector revenue growth with continued gains in diagnostics testing frequency and utilization. IDEXX remains well positioned to further benefit from these trends, thanks to our decades of focus on diagnostics and the software solutions that deliver key differentiated insights into the patient's health.\nIDEXX's strong results are reflected in double-digit total company organic revenue growth, supported by expansion of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across regions. For the first time ever, U.S. revenues exceeded $1 billion in the first half of 2023.\nIDEXX execution drivers continue to fire on all cylinders as reflected in our financial results, including growth in high-quality premium instrument placements, sustained high customer retention levels, contribution from new business gains and net price realization that remains aligned with our expectations. IDEXX commercial teams delivered yet another record quarter of global premium instrument placements, building on high prior year levels and supporting solid EVI gains for the quarter.\nIDEXX diagnostics and software solutions deliver key insights and productivity improvements to workflow transformation. These results demonstrate that greater number of clinicians are partnering with IDEXX with the aim to deliver higher care standards and crucial efficiency gains. This support continues to be important given persistent clinic productivity constraints in a dynamic macro backdrop.\nToday, I'll discuss how IDEXX delivered continued strong performance through key strategic initiatives aimed at driving sector development. I'll start by providing an update on our global commercial execution. It's a key component in driving increased testing utilization of both existing customers as well as new to IDEXX accounts.\nVeterinarians around the world seek testing solutions that provide them with key diagnostic insights necessary to choosing and delivering the right care path in an efficient and intuitive way. IDEXX commercial teams as trusted advisers seek to provide the most appropriate solution given a practice's objectives. There's a deep appetite for point-of-care solutions that deliver the right performance, ease of use, workflow integration and economics. Therefore, it was gratifying to see a record second quarter of global premium instrument placements with record placements in both the U.S. and internationally.\nSecond quarter premium placements reflected growth across regions and platforms, highlighting the value that clinicians across different geographies at various stages of practice maturity see in our highly innovative platforms and the integrated ecosystem. An important dimension of this success is our menu of customer-friendly marketing programs to adopt IDEXX innovation.\nThe result was continued solid gains in EVI and excellent contribution from new business gains, including a new key U.S. corporate account. Very strong ongoing placement performance and our solid relationships with accounts of all types reinforces our confidence in future flow-through of recurring revenues and our ability to address the estimated 220,000 global instrument placement opportunities.\nOur commercial performance this year demonstrates that we have developed the right suite of innovative products to address a significant opportunity. ProCyte One is a great example of this. It's our newest, easy-to-use premium hematology platform. ProCyte One boosts efficiency gains, including load and go, reagents and pay-per-run model while still delivering uncompromised accuracy.\nIt has been a key driver of strong premium hematology placements since its launch in early 2021 and supported record second quarter premium hematology placements. Not only does the growing hematology installed base supports flow-through of recurring revenues, but also drives our broader in-clinic business. Sustained mid-90% attach rates with Catalyst provide a multiplier benefit that drives growth in our customer base and helps customers realize the benefits of an integrated IDEXX diagnostic suite within their clinics.\nThese multiplied effects supported the strong 15% global growth achieved in Catalyst placements in Q2 with strong gains globally at new and competitive accounts. ProCyte One also helps to advance our long-term growth strategy in international regions, where most veterinarians are trained to do hematology testing when assessing a patient's baseline health.\nStrong second quarter performance included double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, also benefited from the country level commercial expansions we began in mid-2020. By increasing the density of our commercial reach, IDEXX sales professionals are better able to build relationships with veterinarians and communicate the benefits of diagnostics and software solution utilization and how IDEXX can support them on that journey.\nThe global opportunity we've identified is significant. And these expanded commercial teams are the tip of the spear in our multi-modality strategy to drive continued sector development. Benefits from these investments are highly encouraged as evidenced by strong installed base growth supported by excellent placements in new and competitive accounts, revenue gains from new business and improving customer engagement levels in key international regions.\nOf additional note, we have also executed a modest expansion of U.S. territories and customer-facing professionals based on highly attractive opportunities still before us in our largest geography. We anticipate all hiring to be completed and in place by the end of this year.\nIn addition to high quality and quantity of instrument placements across regions in Q2, commercial execution helped drive continued adoption of IDEXX innovations, including within our rapid vector-borne disease screening franchise. Our VDC teams have done a great job of communicating the health benefits of a full vector-borne disease screen versus heartworm-only testing.\nWe see consequently 4Dx Plus making up a greater share of in-clinic vector-borne disease revenue. This adoption is supported by our growing installed base of SNAP Pros, which provides an integrated solution while managing workflow and ensuring charge capture. These focused commercial efforts, combined with relevant and easy-to-use products, highlights how we continue to build our customer base, which positions IDEXX well for long-term growth.\nBuilding on these commercial efforts, IDEXX growth will continue to benefit from advancement of our innovation strategy, a core component of which is expanding our highly accurate and relevant test menu. We made a significant step forward in this area during the second quarter when we announced the launch of the IDEXX [indiscernible] B test in our North American reference hub network. This novel marker leverages IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney [indiscernible], a hard-to-diagnose condition that comprises approximately 1/3 of all kidney cases seen by veterinarians.\nRenal care is a critical area for diagnostics insights since the kidneys regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance and red blood cell production while also removing toxins. By adding [indiscernible] to our renal portfolio and by pairing it with IDEXX SDMA, our customers will have access to the most comprehensive view of kidney health, helping them uncover structural injury and impaired kidney function.\nWhat's even more exciting is we will leverage our SDMA playbook to support adoption by including [ cystatin B ] and test panels for approximately 2 million patients annually at no [indiscernible] cost, helping clinicians realize the benefits of IDEXX's world-class diagnostics and deliver a higher standard of care to their patients.\nIDEXX diagnostic solutions like the innovative [ cystatin B ] test when used in an integrated way with our software portfolio can contextualize an individual patient's health status and support the veterinarian with interpretation and drawing out the appropriate clinical insights. Our software portfolio, which includes a full stack of solutions, many of which leverage cloud technology touches all areas of the veterinary clinic from enabling patient check-ins and the full diagnostics workflow dependent on our communication and chart capture, IDEXX software solutions create a connected ecosystem that supports greater diagnostic utilization while also helping our busy customers be more efficient.\nA key driver of customer interest we see in our software solutions is driven by the high demand customers are seeing for medical services. These solutions appeal to both independent and especially corporate customers, who are increasingly focused on using software to standardize their workflow at scale.\nGiven this backdrop of high demand for pet health care services, busy clinics continue to appreciate the value of cloud-based products as this intuitive and easy-to-administer products allow them to spend more time focusing on the patients that walk in the door rather than on time-consuming back-office tasks. And IDEXX cloud beta products, including our ezyVet and Neo PIMS and Web PACS imaging software continue to be in high demand as a response to this trend.\nFor example, second quarter cloud [indiscernible] once again comprised over 90% of total PIMS placements and as a result, make up nearly 50% of our PIMS installed base. This is a trend we expect to continue and are well positioned to address.\nIn our digital imaging business, record first half instrument placements supported double-digit organic growth [indiscernible] that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX to partner on this piece of their business. It helps grow our base for future high-margin recurring revenues.\nOne driver of this interest is continued innovation of our Web PACS software, which makes it even easier for clinicians to interpret and identify hard-to-detect internal abnormalities. The result of these efforts is an excellent customer experience, which helped earn a world-class NPS rating for our diagnostic imaging business, one proof point that the solid overall experience of customers of all types have with IDEXX.\nThis concludes our review of our second quarter results. I would like to extend my thanks to the nearly 11,000 IDEXX employees who helped deliver continued strong performance aligned with our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. We look forward to building on this progress.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I would like to remind you that we'll be hosting our Annual Investor Day in August, beginning with a management dinner on Wednesday, August 9 followed by presentations at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 10 at 8 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live streamed and recorded via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person.\nThis is an exciting opportunity for the IDEXX leadership team to provide updates on our strategy, execution drivers, innovation cycle and long-term growth potential. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations; Dr. Mike Erickson, Senior Vice President and General Manager; Point-of-Care diagnostics; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology; Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services and Corporate Accounts; and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe're also excited to host a live customer conversation led by Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, to provide a firsthand view of the role of diagnostics within the clinic and how IDEXX is supporting our customers in adapting to the dynamic sector backdrop. The event will last approximately 4 hours, and we'll conclude with a Q&A session.\nAnd with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions]\nToday's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. IDEXX had a solid start to 2023. In terms of highlights for the quarter, overall revenues increased 10% organically, supported by nearly 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were driven by nearly 14% organic growth in the U.S., supported by solid volume gains and benefits from a higher net price realization.\nKey execution metrics remain strong globally, reflected in record first quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains and sustained high growth and recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profits and EPS increased 18% on a comparable basis, reflecting solid organic revenue growth, better-than-expected gross margin gains and benefits from a $16 million customer contract resolution payment. These strong results reflect the durability and resiliency of the IDEX business model and benefits from our ongoing focus on execution. We've incorporated our Q1 results and positive adjustments to our full year financial outlook, which we'll discuss later in my comments.\nLet's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and solid 8% growth in Water. Overall organic revenue gains were moderated by 2% declines in our LPD business and approximately $4 million of revenue headwind related to lower -- COVID testing revenues, a business area that we winded down completely in Q1. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 12% organically, reflecting 14% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by global net price gains in the 8% to 9% range, consistent with our expectations.\nOverall organic revenue gains were also supported by 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 7% organically, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects and global mix. IDEXX CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., we achieved a 1,350 basis point growth premium compared to relatively flat same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels in Q1. These results reflected benefits from execution drivers, including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level.\nInternational CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were also supported by strong IDEXX execution reflected in higher net price realization, sustained new business gains and a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from these drivers were moderated by impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continue to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter.\nGlobally, IDEXX achieved strong organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 12% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,425 CAG premium instruments in Q1, an increase of 3% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels, building on the record placement levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflecting 7% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements.\nProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally, reflected in a global installed base that more than doubled over the last year to 9,400 units. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 12% organically, driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 11% organically, reflecting strong gains in the U.S. and mid-single-digit growth in International, with growth in key international regions moderated by macroeconomic impacts, which have pressured same-store sales.\nIn terms of other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth and recurring software and digital imaging revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting solid gains in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta PDS acquisition has progressed well, expanding our capabilities in water safety testing. Livestock Poultry and Dairy revenue decreased 2% organically as solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were offset by comparisons to high prior year sales levels in herd health screening reduced revenues from noncore food and safety products in certain regions.\nTurning to the P&L. Q1 profit results were supported by a 150 basis point improvement in reported operating margins reflecting 10% organic revenue growth, solid gross profit gains and benefits from a $6 million customer contract resolution PAMA. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.3%, up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects. Later timing of lab staffing increases and select operational upsides also supported Q1 gross profit results. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 50 basis point negative impact related to foreign exchange changes, including lapping of prior year hedge gains.\nOperating expenses increased 5% year-on-year as reported in the quarter and 7% on a comparable basis. This was net of a $16 million or 6% operating expense growth offset related to the customer contract resolution. As planned, we saw higher growth in sales rating and R&D expense in the quarter related to specific factors, including the return of in-person sales meetings this year and advancement of key innovation initiatives. EPS was $2.55 per share in Q1, an increase of 12% as reported and 18% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $12 million and EPS by $0.11 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of prior year hedge gains.\nFree cash flow was $144 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 65%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of $180 million.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 1x net of cash, modestly from Q4 levels. Share repurchases over the last -- as we manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment.\nTurning to our 2023 P&L. We're refining our full year outlook to incorporate our solid Q1 operating results and updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. We're updating our full year reported revenues to $3.615 billion to $3.7 billion. This includes a $10 million positive adjustment for foreign exchange impacts which we now estimate will provide a relatively modest full year headwind to reported revenue growth. Our updated outlook for overall organic revenue growth is 7.5% to 10%.\nOur Q1 results track towards the high end of this range, and we're maintaining consistent high-end targets for our performance this year, reflecting benefits from execution drivers and the potential for reduced clinical visit growth headwinds. As part of our financial management approach, we incorporated risk estimates to our targeted growth performance in the low end of our organic revenue growth range, including potential effects for macroeconomic conditions. We raised the low end of our full year organic revenue growth outlook by 0.5% in our updated guidance, incorporating our solid start to the year.\nWe're maintaining our outlook for solid operating margin performance in 2023 with an expectation for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5% for the full year. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. We now estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year, slightly higher than earlier projections, which included impacts from the lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains.\nOur updated EPS outlook is $9.33 to $9.75 per share, reflecting a $0.06 per share increase in our low-end estimate. We continue to estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by approximately $0.23 per share for the full year with the bulk of this impact in the first half.\nIn terms of our operational outlook for Q2, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth consistent with the midpoint to higher end of our full year growth outlook range with approximately 1% of reported growth headwind from year-on-year FX changes. In terms of Q2 operating margins, we're planning for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5%. This reflects expectations for relatively consistent operating margin performance year-on-year adjusting for about 70 basis points in negative foreign exchange impacts and benefits from comparisons to prior year results, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment.\nWe provided details on our updated outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshot. Overall, we're applying a disciplined financial approach that advances our growth strategy and mitigates potential macro risk to ensure delivery of continued strong financial performance. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nInterim President & Chief Executive Officer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX had a very strong start to 2023, driven by sustained execution of our growth strategy. Demand for companion animal medical services continues to grow, supported by IDEXX innovation and direct customer engagement. Veterinarians continue to focus on meeting these high levels of demand with the best possible medical care with diagnostics as an essential component of this care equation. IDEXX remains a chosen trusted partner to veterinarians, who appreciate how our world-class products and connected ecosystem enable high standards of care while resulting in growth of a significant profit center within their clinics. .\nIDEXX's strong execution is reflected in double-digit total company organic revenue growth, supported by strong expansion of global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Growth in this recurring revenue annuity was supported by solid contribution for new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization aligned with our expectations.\nOur commercial teams drove another record quarter for global premium instrument placements and excellent levels of cloud-based software placements. IDEXX products and services offer solutions to improve clinic productivity and support the significantly expanded and underserved demand we've seen for pet health care in recent years, including net pet additions in the U.S. of 2% in 2022, twice the pre-pandemic trend line. These efforts supported strong IDEXX growth as we continue to work effectively through the near-term sector headwinds related to clinic capacity constraints and global macro conditions.\nToday, I'll discuss how IDEXX execution against our strategy to drive the adoption and utilization of diagnostics, helped deliver continued strong financial results. First, I'll provide an update on our commercial execution, which through education and customer engagement drives relevant utilization of IDEXX's innovative solutions. IDEXX's commercial teams delivered another record first quarter global premium instrument placements to start 2023, building on very strong prior year results. Our commercial teams demonstrated a continued ability to advance placement, quantity and quality. This is reflected in strong growth in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts globally, driving solid EVI achievement. These commercial results are highly encouraging as we address the significant opportunity for an estimated 220,000 worldwide premium instrument placements and give us confidence that we have the right strategic playbook in place.\nIDEXX professionals provide world-class software-enabled products that are in high demand and supported by a wide menu of customer-friendly marketing programs that enable adoption of new technology. These results also reflect continued strong clinical interest in using IDEXX's products and services to not only meet the increased demand for pet health care but to deliver the best possible level of care.\nOur commercial execution is supported by the multiplier benefits of flow from IDEXX innovations, as evidenced by the success of our newest hematology analyzer, ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides customers with an attractive in-clinic hematology solution, its small footprint, easy paper runmodel and lower cost come without sacrificing CBC performance. IDEXX premium placements that benefited from strong ProCyte One adoption to date, thanks to sustained high attach rates with Catalyst as defined by ProCyte One placements either with a Catalyst or at an existing Catalyst customers.\nThe result is a multiplier benefit supported by clinics who choose to outfit their in-clinic suite with IDEXX products. As a result, we are nearly halfway to the incremental 20,000 premium hematology placement objective we shared at Investor Day following ProCyte One's launch, while the strong attach rate should also help IDEXX penetrate the long-term worldwide placement opportunity.\nKey to developing this long-term opportunity will be increasing customer engagement in international regions. We're leveraging our successful BDC model to build strong relationships with international customers as evidenced by sustained strong new business gains and a 19% increase in Catalyst placements. The strong performance is allowing us to deliver solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in international regions despite continued macro headwinds, which are pressured same-store clinic [indiscernible].\nCustomer engagement remains excellent, as evidenced by high reach to revenue levels in the first quarter, including benefits from our expanded commercial sales force in targeted regions. The flywheel is beginning to turn in these countries, where we've seen excellent gains from new business, strong interest in engaging with customer marketing programs and solid overall volume growth. Commercial expansion is an important early step in our international strategy, supporting recent efforts to optimize our reference lab network, roll out highly relevant products like ProCyte One and drive further adoption of software tools like VetConnect PLUS, our cloud-based diagnostics portal.\nSoftware innovation continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy globally. IDEXX software solutions are a key enabler of diagnostics utilization, creating a connected ecosystem that helps improve diagnostics workflow while providing deeper clinical insights in supporting pet owner communication. It's an attractive stand-alone business as well. Strong PIMS placements in the first quarter were supported by continued preference for cloud-native products with IDEXX well positioned to address this trend. Placements of cloud-based products maintained the strong velocity we saw coming out of 2022 and represented greater than 90% of total placements, supported by continued high interest in our ezyVet and Neo solutions, which are seamlessly integrated into our product offering. This provides customers with options when it comes to picking the best, most relevant PIM solution for their clinic size and workflow complexity.\nOur strong first quarter placement performance supported double-digit recurring revenue growth with an attractive gross margin profile, and we're on track to achieve this year a PIMS footprint that is over 50% cloud-based. This milestone is especially important in the current veterinary clinic environment, where productivity is a priority in addressing the sustained high levels of demand so the pandemic.\nBy embracing IDEXX's cloud-based ecosystem, customers gain the advantage of an easy-to-use software stack that touches every area of the veterinary clinic. And the benefit of these tools is enduring for our customers, evidenced by strong engagement metrics across applications, including increasing rates of our Web PACS user base that are power users as well as sustained rates of VetConnect PLUS users who use the software as part of their daily routine.\nAdoption and continued use of these products allow veterinarians and their staff spend more time focused on the care they deliver to their patients rather than on costly, time-intensive administrative activities. Our software strategy is to increase cloud adoption and build increased business and clinical functionality into IDEXX software solutions.\nAnother use case of our innovation agenda is our 4Dx plus test, the gold standard test for canine vector-borne disease testing. The current 4Dx plus test is our fourth version of a multiplexed canine vector-borne disease diagnostics over the past 20-plus years with improved sensitivity of anaplasma and 2x increase in the ability to store the product at room temperature. This is a true testament to our technology for life strategy and supported 12% global organic rapid assay recurring revenue growth and solid customer gains in the first quarter.\nA full vector-borne screen using 4Dxs is recommended over a heartworm-only tests, given significant increases in incidence and prevalence of vector-borne diseases over the past 10-plus years And yet, in 2022, less than 1 in every 5 dogs received this comprehensive level of testing. 4Dx plus enables [indiscernible] to deliver this higher standard of care with follow-up testing and care protocol guidance provided through Decision IQ, which aim to drive better health outcomes while encouraging increased diagnostic testing.\nFurthermore, our entire Rapid Assay franchise is supported by the SNAP analyzer. The analyzer not only simplifies the workflow when running a snap test, but also ensure the diagnostic results flow seamlessly to VetConnect PLUS and ultimately result in charge capture and invoicing at the point of sale. This is a clear case of how our products, integral components of our connected software ecosystem and proving value over time while delivering a multiplier benefit to our customers and drive IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue.\nThe sustained execution against our commercial and innovation agenda is made possible by an unrelenting focus on our customers and ensuring they have world-class experience with IDEXX. This takes multiple forms. I'll focus to ensure our customers have the resources they need to provide the best possible levels of medical care. Continued 99%-plus product availability and reliable, fast reference lab service turnaround times provide them with important business continuity and are the result of our investment in manufacturing and supply chain logistics teams, facilities and relationships. Additionally, the support of the high-touch, highly knowledgeable sales teams that we have built out over the decades ensures they have the products and services that are right for their busy clinics.\nOur customers realize the benefits of the IDEXX partnership every day. and, in turn, reward us with their business and their enduring loyalty as measured by another quarter of consistent high customer retention rates. Providing our customers with reliable, consistent support is even more essential right now given the dynamic backdrop of our sector. High demand for animal medical services, combined with sustained labor supply constraints continue to create productivity and growth challenges at the clinic level. Taking our customer support efforts a step further we recently published an empirically based study, which examined the drivers of productivity within a practice and helps customers to understand their productivity strengths and areas for opportunities.\nThrough this rigorous effort, we found 3 key drivers of practice productivity. Number one, workflow, which includes staffing models like optimized technician to veterinarian mix and staff and patient-friendly physical layout of the practice. Number two, technology or digitizing each step of the patient workflow to remove high-effort, administrative routines. And number three, the role of culture, including clarity of roles and responsibilities investments in training and staff effectiveness and aligned incentives to drive teamwork and achievement of practice goals.\nAs a result of this initiative, we believe there's still great opportunity for clinics to improve productivity measures, and we look forward to educating and supporting our customers in these efforts. Opportunities to do so could result in 30% or more incremental visit capacity, even for practices that are in the top cohort of productivity. We are integrating elements of these efforts into our strategy and commercial approaches here.\nWith that, I'll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for the commitment and passion they bring to our purpose-driven work every day. Your efforts not only help provide a better future for animals, people and our planet, but you also supported IDEXX in starting 2023 on a strong financial note. We have an attractive sector and a strong track record. And the opportunity ahead of us, which is significant, is to work with our customers to elevate the companion animal health care standards to increase diagnostics utilization.\nThe tireless work of the IDEXX team has positioned us well to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future. So on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and lifestyle. Now let's open the line for Q&A."

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2023. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2022, reflected in our fourth quarter performance. Revenues increased 7% organically, driven by 8% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and continued strong growth in our software and water businesses.\nOperating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. Combined, these factors enabled delivery of $2.05 in EPS, up 14% on a comparable basis.\nIDEXX execution drivers supported delivery of full year financial results at the high end of our updated guidance range. This performance is reflected in a 1,200 basis point U.S. CAG recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2022, driven by a solid volume growth premium and higher levels of price realization.\nWe sustained record high customer retention levels and solid new business gains globally and achieved a record level of annual CAG premium instrument placements, which drove a 13% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base.\nEffective P&L management supported sustained full year comparable operating margins adjusted for discrete R&D costs aligned with our updated 2022 goals. These performance trends position us well as we enter 2023, and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting a return to 10% organic revenue growth at the high end of our initial guidance range. This outlook is supported by continued strong IDEXX execution and net price benefits captured in our goals for double-digit CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our U.S. and international regions.\nWe're also targeting solid comparable operating margin gains, building on the higher profit levels we achieved through the pandemic. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. We'll highlight the building blocks of our growth outlook and discuss how we're factoring in expectations for overall sector trends and potential macro impacts into our planning. We'll also review estimates for effects from FX and interest rate changes on our reported results in 2023.\nLet's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 10% organic growth in water and 6% organic growth in LPD revenues.\nCAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 8% organically in Q4 compared to 13% prior year growth levels reflecting 9% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions. On a 2- and 3-year basis, Q4 results were in line with strong Q3 performance.\nWe achieved continued double-digit organic revenue growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit, including benefits from higher price realization.\nOverall organic revenue gains were also supported by 17% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues.\nCAG instrument revenue was down modestly, reflecting placement mix and comparisons to high prior year placement levels.\nIn terms of CAG sector demand drivers, we estimate same-store diagnostics revenue in U.S. veterinary practices increased 7% in Q4. These gains continue to be supported by expansion of diagnostic test frequency and utilization. Reflected in a nearly 10% increase in diagnostics revenue per clinical visit that included diagnostics.\nClinical visit levels declined 2.8% in the quarter with consistent growth trends across wellness and non-wellness categories. As we continue to work through impacts from reductions in vet clinic capacity from peak levels and lapped a significant step-up in demand we saw in 2021 including benefits from new patient growth.\nIDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 9% in Q4 continues to outpace sector growth trends. IDEXX' U.S. performance was supported by a 1,200 basis point growth benefit from IDEXX execution drivers, including approximately 7% net price gains and continued solid growth contributions from customer additions and leverage of IDEXX innovation.\nIDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Consumable gains were supported by a 13% increase in our global premium installed base in 2022, reflecting double-digit gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms.\nWe placed 5,065 premium instruments in Q4, down modestly from high prior year levels. The quality of placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 3% global gains in new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 7% gains in the U.S.\nWe also saw a 5% growth in new and competitive premium hematology placements globally leveraging strong customer interest in ProCyte One. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the U.S. Global Lab revenues expanded 8% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S., which were impacted to a degree by holiday week weather impacts and improved organic growth in international regions.\nCAG Diagnostic recurring revenue results were supported by a relatively higher levels of net price realization, including benefits from our second half price initiatives. We estimate net price changes contributed approximately 7% to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q4, reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts. As we'll discuss, we've incorporated an expectation for a 7% to 8% global net price growth benefit for the full year in 2023, building in effects from annual list price changes, which were communicated recently to our customers.\nIn other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 17% organically in Q4. Results were supported by continued strong growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year 2022, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached $251 million up 15% organically and 22% as reported. This includes benefits from the ezyVet acquisition, which continues to track above our acquisition model projections.\nTurning to our other business segments. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q4 and for the full year 2022, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from net price improvement and volume gains.\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 6% organically in Q4. Results benefited from growth in herd health screening, shipment timing and improved performance in China where we work through comparisons to high prior year levels for African swine fever and core wine testing.\nTurning to the P&L. We achieved strong operating profit and comparable operating margin gains in the fourth quarter. Operating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, driven by gross profit gains and OpEx leverage.\nGross profit increased 6% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 58.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Net price gains, higher software service gross margins, lab productivity gains and comparisons to higher prior year investment levels and business mix all contributed positively, offsetting inflationary cost effects.\nOperating expenses were flat as reported and up 4% on a comparable basis in the quarter. We benefited from investment prioritization and leverage from our prior commercial expansions as well as favorable comparisons to higher prior year OpEx levels related to incentive compensation accruals, the ezyVet acquisition and specific R&D investments.\nFor the full year 2022, operating margins were 26.7%, supported by strong second half gains. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins declined 240 basis points, driven by 230 basis points of impact from discrete R&D investments.\nQ4 EPS was $2.05 per share, up 14% on a comparable basis. Fourth quarter EPS results reflected $0.05 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.07 in headwind from foreign exchange changes net of $9 million in Q4 hedge gains.\nFull year EPS was $8.03, a decline of 1% on a comparable basis, net of approximately 9% of EPS growth impact from discrete R&D investments. For the full year stock-based compensation activity provided $13 million or $0.15 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 150 basis points.\nForeign exchange reduced Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 4% and 3%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.22 per share net of foreign exchange hedge gains of $26 million. Foreign exchange trends have improved significantly since our last call update, resulting in relatively lower projected financial impacts in 2023, which we've captured in our outlook.\nFree cash flow was $394 million for 2022 or approximately 58% of net income, net of $149 million in capital spending. This performance reflects 25% to 30% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining product availability, higher deferred R&D tax credits and investments in a major facility expansion.\nFree cash flow conversion came in modestly below our guidance outlook of 60% to 65%, reflecting higher than forecast year-end working capital levels, including impacts from timing. We're targeting improvement in inventory levels in 2023, which is reflected in our outlook for 80% to 90% and free cash flow conversion this year.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2022 with leverage ratios of 1.3x gross and 1.2x net of cash. Our 2023 interest expense outlook incorporates current forward interest rates and expectations for a modestly lower net leverage ratio this year.\nWe allocated $68 million to repurchase 199,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2022, we allocated $811 million to repurchase approximately 2 million shares. Effects from share repurchases support our projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2023.\nTurning to our 2023 full year outlook. We're providing initial guidance for reported revenues of $3.590 billion to $3.690 billion. On an organic basis, which reflects a range of 7% to 10% growth overall and 8.5% to 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.\nOur 10% overall organic growth high-end outlook is aligned with our long-term goals and reflects targets for 11.5% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. These targets incorporate a continued high-growth premium from IDEXX execution drivers, including growth benefits from our expanded global premium instrument installed base, new customer gains and increases in testing utilization supported by IDEXX innovation.\nOur high-end outlook also incorporates expectations for a relative flattening of clinical visit growth trends in the U.S. as we work through 2023. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains will be supported by an estimated 7% to 8% full year growth benefit from net price realization with expectations for 8% to 9% global net price gains in H1 and 6% to 7% net price benefit in H2.\nIn addition to benefits from solid CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, our overall growth outlook reflects goals for continued strong growth in our veterinary software and water businesses. We expect these gains will be moderated by flat-to-modest organic growth at LPD revenues in 2023 reflecting current macro trends and approximately $10 million of impact from lower human COVID testing revenues. The low end of our overall organic growth outlook of 7% incorporates potential risks to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions.\nTerms of reported revenue, we now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% at the rates assumed in our press release. FX revenue growth headwinds are projected to be approximately 3% in Q1 with relative improvement in the second half of the year. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the FX rates assumed in our press release, we projected a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $12 million and operating income by approximately $3 million to $4 million, net of currently established hedge positions.\nOur reported operating margin outlook for the full year 2023 is 29.0% to 29.6%. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable annual operating margin expansion, including approximately 230 basis points of benefit from lapping discrete R&D investments in 2022.\nWe're planning for constrained gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023 as benefits from pricing and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset product and labor inflationary cost impacts including effects on steps we've taken to ensure high levels of supply chain and service continuity. We estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 50 basis points driven by the lapping of the $26 million in 2022 hedge gains.\nOur 2023 EPS outlook is $9.27 per share to $9.75 per share, an increase of 16% to 21% as reported and 19% to 26% on a comparable basis, including approximately 10% of the EPS growth benefit from the lapping of discrete R&D investments. We estimate that foreign exchange will reduce full year EPS by approximately $0.23 per share at the rates assumed in our press release, with the bulk of this impact in the first half. We also expect the impacts in 2023 from higher interest expense of approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2022. Our EPS outlook factors in a 1% increase in our overall effective tax rate to 22% in 2023, reflecting lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity.\nOur free cash flow outlook is for net income -- net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 80% to 90%. This reflects estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million or approximately 5% of revenues including approximately $35 million of spending or about 5% of free cash flow conversion impact related to the completion of our major facility expansion.\nOverall, we're well positioned to deliver strong financial performance in 2023. In terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth closer to the midpoint of our full year guidance range as we continue to work through some effects from relatively higher prior year clinic capacity comparisons and macro impacts on demand in international regions.\nIn terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for a 50 to 100 basis point year-on-year improvement in reported operating margins in Q1. This includes benefits from a customer contract resolution payment of $16 million received in Q1 that will be recorded as an offset to operating expense as well as expectations for foreign exchange impacts and relatively higher OpEx growth in the first quarter related to specific factors such as the return of in-person sales meetings this year.\nThat concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian. And good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained high levels of execution of our growth strategy. Demand for veterinary services remained strong, resulting in increased diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit, building on accelerated gains achieved through the pandemic.\nTo address this strong demand, veterinarians look to IDEXX as their preferred partner in diagnostics and software, which supported high levels of care and helped drive our solid growth results for the fourth quarter and full year.\nFor Q4 in the full year 2022, we achieved 8% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues supported by double-digit contribution and growth from IDEXX execution drivers. This strong performance is reflected in record full year placements for both CAG diagnostics premium instruments and software practice information management systems, continued solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization aligned with our expectations.\nThese execution growth drivers helped to offset impacts from adjustments in vet clinic capacity following a period of extraordinary growth during the pandemic as well as macro impacts, which globally pressured clinical visit levels in 2022. IDEXX's ability to deliver solid organic growth with underlying strong performance in operational metrics demonstrates the attractiveness and durability of our business as well as the outstanding work by teams across our organization to deliver results every day.\nOur decade-long strategic focus on diagnostic sector development, including building strong commercial engagement and innovating to expand adoption of technologies that integrate diagnostics and information management position us to build on this momentum.\nThis morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX advanced our commercial and innovation priorities in 2022, while delivering strong financial results. I'll also discuss our areas of focus for 2023 that build on this progress, let's start with an update on our commercial execution. High levels of execution by IDEXX commercial teams who are trusted adviser to our customers continue to drive revenue gains above sector growth levels. These teams delivered fourth quarter global premium instrument placement levels that were the second highest for any quarter in company history, supporting 13% growth in our global premium instrument installed base and contributing to record annual premium instrument placements for the full year 2022.\nIDEXX is highly accurate and easy to use in-clinic platforms allow clinicians to gain -- the deeper diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care. These platforms are highly integrated into practice workflow, giving customers the tools necessary to meet higher levels of demand for pet health care services. The strong placement performance throughout 2022 highlights how IDEXX has been able to support veterinarians during this past year, capacity constraints in a highly effective way.\nNot only was the magnitude of placements impressive, but they were also of very high quality. This is reflected in strong growth for Catalyst and premium hematology placements at new and competitive accounts globally. These gains demonstrate strong clinical interest in IDEXX's products and a compelling value proposition that our multimodality strategy and customer-friendly marketing programs provide to veterinarians.\nNew and competitive placements helped drive U.S. revenue contribution from new business in the fourth quarter above historic levels, which is an encouraging signal for future growth as this new business will drive future recurring revenue flow-through supported by very high customer retention models. Customer retention rates remained at or above 97% across our major modalities throughout 2022. Another trend that highlights the strong capabilities of our commercial organization and the value that an IDEXX relationship brings to our customers.\nInternational premium placement growth was strong as well while also reflecting high-quality placements in new and competitive accounts, which supported solid net customer gains across modalities. This is a result of our global commercial teams increased leverage of our successful BDC model, which encourages a laser focus on engaging with veterinarians, educating them on the value of diagnostics in the way IDEXX can support their needs and ultimately building a loyal installed base, a key driver of our international growth opportunity.\nInstalled base growth was supported by double-digit Catalyst placement growth in European countries where we have completed expansions since 2021. Commercial expansion is a key component of our international strategy, along with an optimized reference lab network and software tools like VetConnect PLUS. These results highlight our progress executing against that strategy. Moving forward, we look forward to building on these initiatives to address the 2/3 of our global TAM represented by international regions.\nThe clinical and economic benefits of growing our installed base of premium instruments on CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue are notable. Let's take an example of Catalyst, our chemistry analyzer and our Catalyst SDMA slide or SDMA in combination with Total T4.\nIn 2022, customers were in and paid for over 5 million SDMA slides on a global basis in well over 40,000 clinics supported by VetConnect PLUS and IDEXX DecisionIQ. These are customers who have decided that SDMA and early biomarker for kidney impairment is a clinically important parameter in a wide variety of use cases. It's a great example of IDEXX brings not just highly differentiated innovations to our customers, but then invest in creating awareness, education, adoption and ultimately, continued utilization as part of our sector development strategy.\nNext, an update on our software strategy and our progress in delivering an integrated solution of information management with our reference lab and point-of-care diagnostics platforms. IDEXX's software and diagnostic imaging businesses continued to deliver high placement and recurring revenue growth. This business includes an end-to-end stack of software products that create a seamless connected ecosystem across the whole vet clinic which in turn enables deeper diagnostic insights, supports pet owner communications, creates workflow efficiencies and help support greater diagnostics usage and revenue growth.\nCustomers have never had a greater need for these solutions, as capacity constraints in some instances have limited their ability to support patient demand. This is evidenced by record PIMS placements and high teens growth in Web PACS subscribers in 2022 and which helped drive a continued shift towards recurring revenue for this business. On a full year basis, software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached over $250 million, up 15% organically. As we expand our software business, our recurring revenues are growing even faster, supporting strong gains in profit contribution and also reinforcing the value of software as a stand-alone business.\nPIMS placements continue to be driven by customer adoption of cloud-based solutions. As we highlighted at Investor Day this past year, the cloud is gaining momentum rapidly in the veterinary software space. We are in the midst of a significant shift towards these type of products and IDEXX's software portfolio is very well positioned to address this trend towards efficient, easy-to-use cloud-based solutions. Cloud-based PIMS comprise approximately 90% of placements in 2022, delivering a durable revenue stream and significant benefits to CAG gross margins over the -- given the SaaS-based model for these products.\nWe are on track for cloud-based PIMS to represent over 50% of our global footprint this year and expect this shift to accelerate over the rest of this decade. These results were achieved while our software team was tasked with delivering the rapid integration of the ezyVet solution into our business, a multiyear priority that is tracking well and driving revenue and profit delivery ahead of the expectations established during the acquisition process. This progress is a great example of how IDEXX consistently delivers high levels of return on invested capital by deploying resources in the right place at the right time and delivering seamless execution and integration.\nThis not only benefits our financial performance, but also drives the sector forward and puts world-class products and enhance of our customers. Our software business will continue to provide attractive, highly synergistic investment opportunities. The early success of our cloud-first strategy, anchored by ezyVet positions IDEXX well over the coming years as software and cloud data products increased in relevance and importance to veterinary clinics.\nIn addition to this excellent software performance, strong commercial results were also supported by IDEXX's relentless focus on innovation as a key driver of diagnostics adoption and utilization. 2022 is an exciting year of innovation for IDEXX in multiple ways, starting with continued strong adoption of our ProCyte One premium hematology analyzer, which launched in 2021. ProCyte One offers customers very high clinical performance in an efficient, lower cost and smaller footprint platform. It is critical to our efforts to address the approximately 240,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity given its relevance submitting hematology first international countries and its high attach rates of Catalyst.\nWorldwide placements grew 16% for ProCyte One in the fourth quarter, elevating the installed base of this new piece of technology to more than 8,000 units. This is very strong progress against our target for 20,000 incremental premium hematology placements by 2026, and we look forward to building on this momentum to achieve our long-term goals.\nIn terms of more recent innovation launches, we were excited to announce multiple expansions to our preventive care solutions recently at VMX. These program extensions will provide veterinarians with deeper insights and allow them to detect issues sooner and include the launch of IDEXX Nu.Q canine cancer screen now available at our U.S. reference lab network, which expands our growing oncology platform by adding a more accessible way for veterinarians to screen for a disease that impacts nearly 6 million dogs annually in the U.S. And secondly, the rollout of IDEXX Preventive Care Simple Start, formerly Preventive Care Challenge, an improved wellness program designed for the capacity-constrained practice, which includes staff training and tools for custom diagnostic profile development and client communications.\nAt VMX, we also shared an expansion to the menu for IDEXX DecisionIQ, formerly clinical decision support which now includes endocrine features in addition to the vector-borne disease and chronic kidney disease conditions we rolled out earlier in 2022. This software service applies intelligent insights, to patient-specific data and delivers next step considerations in VetConnect. Valuable insights would support veterinarians to swiftly and confidently move through a case.\nInnovation does not stop at the point of launching a new product. However, integrating new technology into practice workflows and protocols and supporting customers with our medical consulting group is an important step in driving adoption and utilization of our diagnostic solutions. We have recently seen good traction in this area with some of our products and services, which were launched in 2022. Our approved 40x plus in fecal Dx antigen test with detection of fleet tapeworms are now included with the Preventive Care Simple Start program we announced at VMX.\nAnother example is FGF-23. And a biomarker that helps determine dietary phosphate restriction in cats with kidney disease that is offered through our reference labs has now been integrated into updated International Renal Interest Society guidelines. These product rollouts are critical to our long-term efforts to develop the companion animal diagnostics and information management sector. They help drive the consistent positive contribution to sector diagnostics revenue growth for both diagnostics frequency and utilization that we saw in 2022 and continued adoption of new technologies to help build off these higher levels in 2023.\nThe relentless focus on innovation demonstrates IDEXX's commitment to developing our sector and highlights our customer-first approach, which aims to address the most pressing needs of veterinarians. In this context, diagnostics has become an integral way for veterinarians to enable the provision of medical services and to grow their practices, reflecting same-store clinical diagnostics revenue growth of 7% that is outpacing total practice and clinical revenue gains and becoming a larger contribution to practice profitability.\nOur customers are hungry for solutions that help them deliver a higher standard of care and help support workflow, client communications and staff productivity. An additional key element necessary to provide this enablement is product and service continuity and turnaround time. For these reasons, it is of great importance that IDEXX gives our customers confidence and reinsurance that the products and services they need will be available when and where they need them.\nOur supply chain teams ensured this continuity by delivering 99% product availability and on-time delivery levels again in the fourth quarter, a standard we achieved in each quarter of 2022. This performance gives us a pride to confidently say that if and when our customers ever need our help, we will help them. And in turn, our customers reward us with high retention levels and world-class NPS scores for our products and services. This customer-first mindset is fundamental to our strategy and we look forward to bringing it to our work on a daily basis in 2023.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Before we transition to Q&A, I would like to recognize our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing passion and high levels of performance, which supported solid growth in 2022 in a very dynamic external environment. Their work helps us work towards providing a better future for animals, people, our planet today, while also addressing the significant sector development opportunity ahead of us. It's an honor to report the results of this excellent execution against our strategic priorities, and it's exciting to share how IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future.\nSo on behalf of the management team, I'll say thank you to our colleagues for the enthusiasm and engagement you bring to our work every day. You are at the core of our progress we've made against our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. With that, we'll now open the line for Q&A."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements.\nListeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may be also found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn reviewing our third quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue and profit growth in Q3, building on strong prior year results. Overall, IDEXX revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 9% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics remain strong. This is reflected in record Q3 premium instrument placements, double-digit growth in veterinary software and digital imaging revenues, and 10% organic growth in U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues.\nOperating profits and EPS increased 12% and 13%, respectively, on a comparable basis, reflecting solid gross margin gains and controlled operating expense growth. Outstanding execution in the quarter has us on track to deliver strong full year financial performance aligned with our updated guidance range.\nIn terms of our full year operational outlook, we've incorporated our Q3 organic growth results and maintained a similar midpoint estimate for EPS performance, supported by strong second half comparable operating profit gains. We've also adjusted our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts.\nWe'll walk through the details of our full year outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 12% organic growth in water and 7% organic growth in LPD revenue.\nCAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions, net of a 1% equivalent day growth headwind.\nWe achieved double-digit organic growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, consistent new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and solid expansion of diagnostic revenues per clinical visit, including benefits from higher net price realization. These gains helped IDEXX deliver continued solid CAG recurring revenue growth offsetting near-term headwinds related to year-on-year declines in clinic visit levels globally, including effects from a pullback in clinic capacity this year and macro impacts in international markets.\nOverall organic revenue gains were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenue was down modestly compared to high prior year levels as strong placement gains were moderated by mix effects.\nIn terms of CAG sector demand drivers, continued healthy trends supported solid increases in diagnostic revenues at U.S. clinics. Diagnostic revenue increased 7% on a same-store basis in the U.S. in Q3 or approximately 9.5% on a per visit basis, reflecting continued solid gains in diagnostic frequency and utilization, including benefits from higher net price realization at the practice level.\nClinical visit levels in Q3 were down 2.4%, a slight improvement from Q2 trends, as we continue to work through impacts from reductions in vet clinic capacity from peak levels and the lapping of the significant step-up in demand for pet health care during the pandemic. We anticipate year-on-year visit growth headwinds will continue in the fourth quarter, which is factored into our outlook.\nIDEXX' U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 9.6% in Q3, which included a 1% equivalent days growth headwind, continues to outpace sector growth trends. The strong performance was supported by a 1,300 basis point normalized growth benefit from IDEXX execution drivers. This included consistent growth benefits from IDEXX utilization and innovation gains and customer additions and an estimated 6% net price benefit in the U.S., supported by our second half price initiatives.\nGlobally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q3. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across our catalysts, premium hematology and SediVue platforms.\nWe placed 4,737 CAG premium instrument placements in Q3, an increase of 10% year-on-year, building on the record placement levels achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 13% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements compared to strong prior year levels.\nProCyte One momentum also continues to build globally, supporting a 26% year-on-year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 7% organically in Q3 compared to high prior year demand levels, supported by benefits from net price increases. Global Lab revenue increased 8% organically in Q3 as double-digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by modest organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same-store clinic visit growth in Europe, including macroeconomic impacts.\nWe continue to achieve solid new business momentum and sustained high customer retention levels across our major modalities, supporting sustained solid volume growth. CAG recurring revenue growth included net price benefits in the range of 5% to 6% to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the quarters, reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts.\nIn other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 12% organically in Q3, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from solid volume gains and net price improvement.\nWe completed the acquisition of Tecta-PDS in the quarter, an automated microbiology testing platform which complements our existing water offering and expands our capabilities in this highly attractive business segment.\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 7% organically in Q3. Results benefited from growth in the herd health screening and improved results in China, where we work through comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever core swine testing.\nTurning to the P&L. Q3 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 7% in the quarter as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.2%, up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects.\nOperating expenses increased 6% year-on-year as reported in the third quarter and 9% on a comparable basis. As planned, operating expense growth was more in line with revenue gains as we prioritize investments and gained leverage from our prior commercial expansions.\nEPS was $2.15 per share, an increase of 13% on a comparable basis. Q3 EPS results did not include tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which were down $0.05 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million and EPS by $0.08 per share in Q3 net of $9 million in hedge gains.\nFree cash flow was $151 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 67%. For the full year, we've updated our estimate of free cash flow conversion to 60% to 65% to incorporate expectations for continued higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining high product availability.\nThe full year outlook reflects approximately 20% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels, higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D tax credits, and an investment in the major facility expansion. We've updated our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $165 million, including $40 million to $50 million in 2022 spending for our new manufacturing and warehouse project.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4x gross and 1.3x net of cash. We increased our financing flexibility with the recently completed credit facility amendment, which provides for a $250 million term loan on attractive terms with proceeds applied to reducing our revolving credit balance. In Q3, we allocated $167 million of capital to repurchase 453,000 shares. Capital allocation to share repurchases supports our projected 2% full year reduction in share count this year.\nTurning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're narrowing the organic revenue growth range to incorporate our solid Q3 performance and a consistent outlook for Q4 organic revenue growth aligned with the midpoint of our prior second half guidance. We're also maintaining our full year outlook for comparable operating margins, which sustained strong prior year levels, adjusting for the impact of the discrete $80 million R&D investment recorded in Q2.\nWe're updating our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we estimate will reduce 2022 revenue by $10 million and EPS by $0.04 per share compared to our last outlook. We're also factoring in a $0.01 per share adjustment for projected changes in interest rates.\nOverall, our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.325 billion to $3.365 billion is consistent at midpoint with earlier estimates as FX impacts offset improvements to our operational outlook. We now project FX will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 4% for the full year with approximately 6% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q4.\nOur updated full year organic revenue growth outlook is now 6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting a full year CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 7.5% to 8.5%. Our updated CAG diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies fourth quarter organic gains of 5% to 10%, aligned with earlier estimates, which factors in a 2.5% organic growth risk estimate at the low end of the range for potential macroeconomic impacts on demand.\nWe've updated our estimated full year operating margins to 26.3% to 26.8%, reflecting consistent operational outlook at midpoint and an estimated 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin impact from updated foreign exchange estimates. This outlook reflects a projected 230 to 280 basis point decrease on a comparable basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of operating margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments.\nOur updated EPS outlook is $7.74 a share to $7.98 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of approximately 5% per share at midpoint, reflecting updated estimates for FX and interest rate impacts. For the full year, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by approximately $28 million and EPS by $0.25 per share. This is net of an estimated $29 million or $0.26 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. Our outlook factors in no EPS impact from stock-based compensation tax benefits in the second half. We provided details on our updated outlook in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot.\nLooking forward, we're advancing our planning processes for 2023. We're targeting sustained strong execution that supported delivery of solid organic revenue and comparable profit growth, building on substantial financial gains IDEXX achieved through the pandemic. Given the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar this year, in 2023, we estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported revenue growth by approximately 3%, reported operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.45 per share at the rates assumed in our press release with current hedge positions.\nWe'll provide updates on these estimates as we share our 2023 guidance on the year-end conference call. That concludes our financial review.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX delivered strong results in the third quarter, as teams across the company continued excellent execution to advance our strategic priorities. Demand for Companion Animal health care remains high, building on stepped-up levels there in the pandemic supported by a continued focus on service within veterinary clinics. Veterinarians are looking for partners to support their growth while they provide high levels of care in an efficient manner.\nThese professionals continue to turn to IDEXX for the support in the third quarter. This was reflected in yet another quarter of record placements of premium capital instruments, strong momentum in PIMS placements and its continued desire for cloud-native products, consistent new business gains and sustained high customer retention levels.\nThese continued trends demonstrate that veterinarians appreciate IDEXX's integrated ecosystem, and the layers of innovation would support and improve each step of clinic workflows. The result was expansion across IDEXX execution growth drivers, including relatively higher net price realization, which drove IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth to significantly outpace clinical visit growth. This supported a solid same-store diagnostics revenue growth in the U.S. despite moderating impacts from reductions in clinic capacity levels this year.\nThis morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX continued to advance our key strategic initiatives in the quarter while delivering strong financial results. I'll begin with a review of recent trends in the companion animal sector. Third quarter CAG sector trends were supported by solid global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in pet ownership and patient visits during the pandemic. U.S. same-store diagnostics revenues grew 7% per practice during the third quarter, a sequential increase from the prior quarter and well above total same-store practice revenue growth of 4% in the quarter.\nServices remain a key focus for veterinarians. And within services, diagnostics is a key component in providing valuable health care insights, supporting practice economics and driving revenue growth. Consistent with trends through this year, diagnostics revenue growth at the practice level continues to be driven by increases in both the frequency and utilization of diagnostics, resulting in 9.5% growth in diagnostics revenue per visit for the quarter, building on the strong gains seen through the pandemic.\nIDEXX grew overall U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue at approximately 10% normalized despite recent clinic visit growth headwinds as we benefit from decades of focus and investment, which brings differentiated value to our customers. As Brian noted, IDEXX execution drivers contributed approximately 1,300 basis points to U.S. growth in Q3 on a normalized basis. This reflects benefits from continued expansion of our premium instrument installed base, adoption of IDEXX innovations, consistent new business gains, record retention levels and increased price realization.\nOn a multiyear basis, critical visit growth was healthy in the quarter with solid growth in both wellness and non-wellness visits. 3-year CAGR wellness visit growth, in particular, was in line with historic trends of 2% to 3%, demonstrating that U.S. pet owners are continuing to prioritize pet health care. This trend continues to be supported by IDEXX's turnkey Preventive Care program, which included approximately 200 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter. This is the second quarter of year-over-year increased enrollments, showing that customers continue to appreciate the simple yet comprehensive testing and pet owner communication tools included in this program.\nThis program is just one example of how we are engaging with our customers to support them through near-term challenges related to managing clinic capacity in meeting growing demand for health care services. We are building on our strong customer relationships to drive continued solid organic growth in our CAG business.\nWith that, let's now turn to discuss IDEXX's strong progress against our key strategic growth initiatives. As mentioned, excellent execution across the IDEXX organization supported strong performance during a dynamic third quarter with commercial teams delivering the day while also building the foundation for long-term growth across regions.\nRecord quarterly placements of premium instruments supported another quarter of double-digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base. Global premium instrument placements grew 10% in the quarter. and placements in new and competitive accounts grew even faster at 13%, supporting strong EVI gains across regions.\nThese results, combined with continued sustained new business gains and 98% Catalyst customer retention rates, will support future recurring revenue growth aligned with the long-term financial framework shared at our recent Investor Day.\nSustained high levels of commercial performance were aided in part by continued improvement in the rate of in-person visits for account managers, up to 75% in the U.S. and nearly 70% in Europe. IDEXX sales representatives are welcome in the clinic as trusted advisers to their customers, adding value by helping customers provide high standards of medical care, drive strong practice economics and improve practice efficiency. These results are also supported by our world-class innovative products like ProCyte One and customer-friendly marketing programs that help support the adoption of IDEXX innovations.\nProCyte One provides customers with an efficient lower-cost hematology platform at the point of care and is especially sought after in international regions where veterinarians have been trained to do hematology testing first when doing a basic workup on a patient. This platform is integral to our strategy to address the approximately 230,000 long-term global instrument placement opportunity that Dr. Tina Hunt shared at Investor Day, and third quarter results continue to be very encouraging.\nProCyte One was a key driver of 26% growth in premium hematology placements in the quarter with international regions representing approximately 75% of ProCyte One placements and more than 60% of its installed base. Attach rates for ProCyte One are consistently high. Over 95% of ProCyte One customers overall and more than 80% of competitive customers also utilize our chemistry platform, demonstrating the excellent placement quality and strong multiplier benefit of this platform.\nThese results are further supported by benefits from investments we have made to expand our global commercial organization, where we are seeing positive reach to revenue trends and deeper customer relationships. Customer survey work in Germany and France demonstrates that customers have had an overwhelmingly positive experience during the first year of the new commercial ecosystem.\nOver 90% of customers in Germany, for example, indicate that their commercial experience is the same or better than a year ago with the highest satisfaction rates and practices to receive continuous commercial engagement. This feedback highlights the benefit of our high-touch commercial model, where diagnostic subject matter experts partner with practice centers and staff to drive practice patient care and business objectives.\nOur commercial and operational teams in the Asia Pacific region are also driving successful execution against our strategic plans. Asia Pacific premium instrument placements are at a record high and were delivered while hiring and onboarding new sales professionals in Japan and opening a new reference lab in Brisbane, Australia during the quarter.\nConcurrent seamless execution of our commercial investments across multiple regions is not easy to do, and to do so while also delivering against our business goals. This demonstrates the value of the investments we've made in these teams, which will continue to benefit us as we work to address the significant long-term addressable opportunity outside the U.S.\nIn addition to these excellent commercial results, we also delivered multiple new technologies to our customers during the quarter. Since VMX in January, we have announced 8 new product service and software solution enhancements across IDEXX modalities, each of which add value to the relationship that customers have with IDEXX while demonstrating our commitment to a technology for life strategy.\n5 out of 8 of these projects were launched in the third quarter. These are: number one, expanding the comprehensiveness of our fecal antigen reference lab test by adding a flea tapeworm assay, which now detects up to 5x more than traditional methods; number two, providing faster access to PCR results for North American customers by opening a next day PCR lab in Louisville; number three, improved veterinary insight into the treatment of feline chronic kidney disease by adding an improved disease marker, FGF23, to our reference lab menu; number four, improving the efficiency, convenience and sustainability of the Catalyst SDMA test by reformulating the test to include onboard reagents; and number five, delivering enhanced accuracy and longer room temperature storage in our best-in-class 4Dx Plus Test.\nThe rollout of these new products and services was enthusiastically received by our customers and highlighted the IDEXX team's ability to deliver high-quality new products, which will help increase standards of animal health care and develop our sector while also providing very high customer service levels.\nAnother strategic area of innovation is IDEXX's software and diagnostic imaging businesses, which include a full suite of software product offerings to create a connected ecosystem within the clinic that supports each step of clinic workflow through the patient appointment, the practice information management system and its easily updatable customer-friendly front-end interface is the center of this solution.\nRecord third quarter PIMS placements highlight strong customer interest in the whole product solution that IDEXX offers. Furthermore, the shift to cloud-based products that we highlighted at Investor Day continued in the quarter as over 90% of placements were cloud-based subscriptions, reflecting 50% growth in cloud-based placements compared to the prior year and demonstrating the value that last year's ezyVet acquisition continues to bring to the business.\nStrong results across this business in the quarter were not limited to PIMS products, diagnostic imaging systems placements, Web PACS subscriptions, PIMS application adoption like payment processing and VetConnect PLUS with clinical decision support, engaged with all advanced at healthy levels in the quarter.\nWe know veterinarians are looking for ways to obtain, understand and communicate diagnostics insights in a digital and streamlined way, and our software portfolio is well positioned to provide them with these solutions.\nThe benefits of these products and solutions to IDEXX and our customers are compelling. They have highly favorable economics given the recurring nature of the revenue stream and high incremental gross margins. They also drive customer engagement, which supports a high levels of retention since they improve our customers' productivity and overall experience.\nIDEXX's innovation agenda also extends beyond our Companion Animal business. We recently took the opportunity to advance our water business by acquiring Tecta Pathogen Detection System, with an automated microbiology detection platform that uses patented technology to automate the incubation, reading and results notification for E. Coli and total coliform testing and drinking water supplies. This application provides an automated data-enabled instrument in EPA-approved coliform testing solution that complements our core water solutions by providing value for customers operating under rushed conditions.\nWe're excited to be able to invest in the attractive area of water testing and leverage our commercial resources to scale this new technology. This innovation agenda demonstrates a relentless focus on providing our customers with world-class products that increase in value over time. Products that not only provide them with important insights but also help increase workflow efficiency and effectiveness.\nIn addition to these top-notch products, our customer focus is supported by extremely high service levels to ensure customers have a wonderful experience with IDEXX, allowing us to earn their business every day. Our frontline supply chain and customer service teams continue to deliver high levels of service, reflected in another quarter of approximately 99% product availability despite ongoing challenges in the external environment. This strong performance leverages years of investment in our supply chain and customer support resources as we continue to deliver on the operational needs of our customers.\nThat concludes our review. I'm proud to report another quarter of strong results as IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long run while also delivering on our mission to create a better future for animals, people, and our planet. Our performance reflects the commitment and talent of our IDEXX team.\nOn behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank our more than 10,000 colleagues for the passion and engagement they bring to our purpose and strategy every day. You're making a meaningful difference to the health and well-being at pets, people and [buy stock] around the world.\nSo now we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A."

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn reviewing our second quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, continued high levels of IDEXX execution drove solid organic revenue growth in Q2 compared to strong prior year results.\nOverall, IDEXX revenues increased 6.5% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics were excellent, reflected an 18% gains in premium instrument placements, continued strong double-digit growth in veterinary software and service revenues and a nearly 1,100 basis point U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to same-store clinical visit levels.\nFor the first half of 2022, overall organic growth was 7.2%, slightly below our expectations for first half growth at the low end of our 7.5% to 10% full year guidance range. These results reflect relatively increased headwinds from lower year-on-year U.S. clinical visit levels and increased macroeconomic impacts in international regions.\nProfit results were in line with our expectations, supported by sustained high gross margins. EPS was $1.56 per share in the quarter, including $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments and $0.06 of net year-on-year impact from the stronger U.S. dollar.\nAs planned, EPS results reflected high operating expense growth, including the impact of $80 million in discrete R&D investments in the quarter and carryover effects from prior commercial investments. As we look forward to the second half of 2022, we're targeting continued solid organic revenue growth, building on the significant expansion of IDEXX's business through the pandemic.\nWe've updated our full year overall organic growth outlook to 5.5% to 8% for 2022, reflecting 6.5% to 9% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. The midpoint of this updated range reflects an outlook for continued solid organic gains in the second half, aided by strong IDEXX execution trends and benefits from incremental price increases.\nAs we'll discuss, vet practices continue to work through capacity constraints and the lapping of high 2021 demand levels supported by the significant growth in new pets during the pandemic. Given these factors in a challenging global economic climate, our midpoint organic growth outlook incorporates expectations for continued pressure on clinical visit levels in the second half of 2022.\nAt the low end of our updated growth range, we've also incorporated an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate in the second half related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. Our EPS outlook of $7.77 to $8.05 reflects our updated organic revenue growth estimates and new estimates for foreign exchange effects based on the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nIt also reflects expectations for sustained strong full year operating margins, flat to 50 basis points below prior year levels, adjusting for foreign exchange effects and $80 million in discrete R&D costs in 2022. We'll walk through the details of our updated P&L outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results.\nSecond quarter organic revenue growth of 6.5% was supported by 7% organic gains in our CAG business and 9% organic growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 5% organic decline in the LPD revenues, driven primarily by year-on-year impacts related to reduced African swine fever testing in China. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 7% organically in Q2 compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 8% gains in the U.S. and 5% growth in international regions.\nQ2 CAG gains were also supported by 8% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. In terms of U.S. CAG sector demand drivers, sustained healthy trends supporting increased utilization of diagnostics were moderated by relatively increased year-on-year pressure on clinical visit growth.\nIn Q2, same-store clinical visits were an estimated 3.1% below strong prior year levels. This compares to an updated estimate of 1.4% declines in Q1 and 2.5% to 3% increases in the second half of 2021. Our analysis points to two primary factors driving the recent change in U.S. clinical visit growth trends. Reduction in vet clinic capacity from peak pandemic levels and the continued lapping of the significant step-up in demand for pet health care during the pandemic, including benefits from the 10% increase in the pet population in 2020 and 2021.\nHistorically, U.S. clinical visits per practice have grown at approximately 2% to 3% annually, supported by steady vet practice capacity expansion. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, U.S. average clinical visits per practice jumped nearly 13%, and these higher absolute visit levels sustained through 2021. Extraordinary efforts by vets and their staff during the pandemic supported the significant increase in demand for clinical services, including diagnostics.\nIn 2022, U.S. clinical visit capacity pulled back from these high levels impacted by staffing challenges reflected in a 2% contraction in average clinical visit levels in the first half of 2022. This has brought implied vet clinic capacity metrics more in line with longer-term expansion trends while still being below the strong demand in the sector implied by the pet population expansion.\nWe see the specific dynamics as improving over time. However, given the recent pullback in clinic capacity, which continues to be affected by near-term staffing challenges and the lapping of strong underlying demand levels seen throughout 2021, we believe it's appropriate to plan for continued year-on-year pressure on U.S. clinic visit growth in the second half of this year.\nOffsetting these near-term growth headwinds is the continued expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit at the clinic level, supported by IDEXX innovation and engagement. While year-on-year clinical visits declined 3% on a same-store basis in Q2, diagnostics revenue per visit expanded nearly 9%, consistent with strong Q1 trends. IDEXX' U.S. CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 7.6% in Q2, continues to outpace solid sector growth trends reflected in the 1,070 basis point premium to clinical visit gains.\nJay will talk more about how we're driving sustained strong performance on this front in his comments. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the second quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions.\nConsumable gains were supported by 15% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 18% in Q2, reflecting 8% gains in the U.S. and 25% growth internationally, as clinics showed continued confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally.\nThe quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 9% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supported by our global expansion efforts reflected in a 64% year-on-year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Rapid Assay revenues expanded solidly in Q2 compared to higher prior year demand levels.\nGlobal rapid assay revenues increased 6% organically supported by solid volume gains in the U.S. and benefits from net price increases. Global Lab revenues increased 6% organically in Q2 as high single-digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by flat organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same-store clinic visit growth in Europe, including increased macroeconomic impacts.\nReference Lab new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally. We achieved continued solid net price gains in the quarter globally with an average 4% growth benefit to U.S. and worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the first half.\nOur updated outlook includes benefits from additional U.S. CAG price increases implemented in August, reflecting product and service enhancements and inflationary impacts. We estimate incremental price changes will provide an additional 1.5% to 2% and growth benefit to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the second half of 2022.\nIn other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically and 27% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.\nWater revenues increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting strong performance across regions, including benefits from net price improvements. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 5% organically in Q2. Tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business.\nWe've now worked through these comparison impacts and are targeting positive growth in LPD in the second half of this year. Turning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 5% in the quarter as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.7% in line with high prior year levels on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives and improvement in software service gross margins helped to offset inflationary effects and impacts from lower LPD revenues.\nOperating expenses increased 46% year-on-year as reported in the second quarter and 48% on a comparable basis, including a 35% OpEx growth impact related to $80 million in discrete R&D investments. Operating expense increases reflect carryover impacts from investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We're planning for moderated operating expense growth in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter as we gain leverage from these investments and lap more favorable year-on-year comparisons.\nEPS was $1.56 per share, a decrease of 30% on a comparable basis, including a 32% growth impact related to the discrete R&D investment. EPS results included tax benefits of $3 million or $0.03 per share related to share-based compensation, which was down $0.04 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $6 million and EPS by $0.06 per share in Q2, net of $6 million in hedge gains.\nFree cash flow was $36 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 66%. For the full year, we continue to estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%.\nThis outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets. We're maintaining our full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing warehouse expansion project.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4x gross and 1.3x net of cash. We allocated $340 million of capital to repurchase [809,000] shares in Q2. We intend to continue to support our share repurchase program and leverage our strong balance sheet as appropriate on this round. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with the consistent net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 2% full year reduction in share count.\nTurning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're lowering our full year organic revenue growth range by 2% to reflect first half performance, recent CAG sector trends and to incorporate potential additional impacts from macroeconomic factors at the lower end of our guidance range. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and updating our EPS outlook to incorporate current expectations for foreign exchange impacts and projected changes in interest rates.\nOur updated full year revenue growth range of $3.305 billion to $3.385 billion reflects an $80 million to $85 million reduction compared to earlier estimates. This includes a $20 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 3% to 3.5% for the full year with approximately 4.5% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q3. As noted, we've updated the full year organic revenue growth outlook to 5.5% to 8%. This reflects a full year CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 6.5% to 9%.\nOur updated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies second half organic gains of 5% to 10%. The midpoint of our outlook for H2 reflects CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 7.5% or 8% normalized for equivalent days effects, which we estimate will reduce Q3 revenue growth by approximately 1%. Supporting this outlook are benefits from price increases we're advancing in the second half of 2022, which we estimate will provide 1.5% to 2% of additional benefit to worldwide H2 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth building on first half gains of approximately 4%.\nNet of this incremental price benefit, the midpoint growth outlook for the second half of '22 is consistent with the global sector growth trends exiting Q2 and reflects expectations for sustained high IDEXX CAG growth premiums supported by continued strong IDEXX commercial execution.\nThe lower end of our second half growth outlook factors in an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. A 5% second half growth rate for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues would align with the low end of growth impact seen in the last recessionary period. The higher end of our growth outlook for the second half targets improved 10% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth supported by strong IDEXX execution and price increase benefits, but will require an improvement in recent clinical visit growth trends.\nAt our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for full year operating margins of 26.4% to 26.9%, an adjustment of approximately 50 basis points from our last outlook. This reflects a projected 210 to 260 basis point decrease on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to discrete R&D investments.\nAdjusted for the discrete R&D investments, and approximately 20 basis points of year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, the high end of this outlook reflects updated goals for relatively flat operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. The full year operating margin outlook has supported the goals to deliver solid comparable operating margin gains in H2.\nWe're targeting flat to modest comparable operating margin increases in Q3 and higher levels of improvement in Q4 as we benefit from higher net price realization, cost management efforts and the lapping of prior year stepped up investment levels.\nOur updated EPS outlook is $7.77 to $8.05 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of $0.32 per share at midpoint, including $0.05 of impact from higher projected interest rates and $0.03 of additional headwind related to FX. For the full year at our midpoint outlook, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by $23 million and EPS by $0.21 per share. This is net of an estimated $26 million or $0.23 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot.\nThat concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered another quarter of solid growth, supported by excellent execution by our global IDEXX teams. Demand for pet health care remains high, building on the step function and sector growth of pets and patient visits during the pandemic. IDEXX is a diagnostics and software partner of choice of veterinary clinicians. This was reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued high growth in cloud-based PIMS placements in a sustained IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to clinical visit growth.\nOur products support veterinarians by creating an integrated clinic-wide solution that helps them expand capacity and grow their businesses while providing diagnostic insights to support high levels of pet health care. The solid results that IDEXX delivered in the quarter despite some headwinds from near-term clinical visit growth and international macro factors reinforce our confidence in the durability and long-term growth potential of our business aligned with increasing care standards for companion animals.\nToday, I'll discuss our performance and progress in the context of current sector turns in advancing key innovation and commercial initiatives, that position us for continued solid growth and financial performance. Let me start by providing some updated context on trends in the companion animal sector. CAG sector trends continue to reflect strong global demand for veterinary services. building on a significant step-up in the number of pets and patient visits observed during the pandemic.\nU.S. diagnostics revenue per practice grew 6% during the second quarter against a very strong prior year base, as veterinarians use diagnostics to deliver best care standards while benefiting from profitable clinical services growth. IDEXX grew U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue nearly 8%, 2 points faster, validating the value we bring with differentiated solutions and an excellent customer experience. Specifically, diagnostics remains one of the faster-growing areas of the veterinary clinic continuing to outpace both total practice revenue growth and clinical revenue growth on a same-store basis.\nU.S. diagnostics revenue growth per practice of 6% in the quarter, as noted was once again driven by positive contribution from both diagnostics frequency and utilization. Diagnostics frequency and the utilization gains were both above pre-pandemic trends even at a much higher base. As highlighted in the earnings snapshot, critical use of diagnostics per visit expanded by revenue nearly 9% in the quarter, offsetting headwinds from lower clinical visits.\nWe continue to make progress on initiatives that drive future diagnostics recurring revenue. We saw increased adoption of our U.S. preventive care program where we provide a turnkey diagnostic solution to wellness care, with approximately 225 new enrollments, the largest quarter of enrollment since late 2020. We're also seeing continued momentum across global regions related to the adoption of IDEXX platforms, reflected in 25% growth in international premium instrument placements, including the successful expansion of our ProCyte One platform. These strong areas of progress have been moderated by year-on-year pressure on clinical visit trends.\nThis reflects a combination of impacts from pullback and capacity levels following a period of significant demand expansion, including the step-up in visits related to the 10% expansion of the pet population during the pandemic. In the U.S., for example, clinics were open around 50% of weekend days in Q2 compared to an average of almost 60% pre-pandemic. We're also seeing some impacts from macroeconomic pressures, particularly in Europe.\nWe think it's prudent to plan on continued year-on-year growth impacts on these fronts in the second half of 2022. Recent research we performed in the U.S. and Germany shows that a majority of veterinarians indicate staff capacity is a major or moderate issue, while also indicating they see continued higher demand for appointments.\nAs Brian indicated, we are well positioned with clinics and working through these dynamics over time to address what is likely underserved demand for pet health care in a significantly expanded global pet population. As we work through these near-term headwinds, we're targeting solid organic growth overall in the second half, building momentum that will keep us on track towards our long-term growth goals.\nLet's now discuss our ongoing progress in key areas of our growth strategy. A key factor in enabling IDEXX to drive strong utilization of diagnostics within the sector, IDEXX's decade-long focus on building and supporting a world-class commercial team to execute our high-touch model.\nThese capabilities, along with significant new product introductions over the last several years, help our customers grow faster and continue to support strong commercial results. This is reflected in record instrument and software placements, strong EVI gains, sustained solid net new business gains in very high customer retention levels. These results demonstrate the market development benefits, occurring commercial capabilities with highly relevant innovative products.\nOur sales professionals have shown an ability to maintain and leverage their deep relationships with customers to support these performance levels. Despite challenges related to staff capacity, U.S. account manager in-person visits are now over 70% approaching desired end state goals. International access was also excellent at close to 70%, where international growth is a strategic priority, and we're applying the successful U.S. playbook to drive strong placements and new business gains.\nThe second quarter represented continued progress against the strategy with solid year-over-year growth in customer adoption across modalities in Europe. Meanwhile, onboarding and integration of the 6 country-level commercial expansions have been completed and have gone extremely well. We look forward to ongoing future benefits from these expansions as we work through macro-driven headwinds in regions like Europe, which are constraining near-term organic gains.\nThe international opportunity to drive diagnostics utilization is tremendous, and largely underpenetrated as shared in last year's Investor Day. Our advancing global commercial capability and product innovations that fit the requirements of these regions are positioning us to realize significant opportunities over long horizons.\nPutting the right products and enhance of our capable sales professionals drives continued growth in instrument placements with the resulting highly profitable future consumable streams. Customers on a global basis have never been hungrier for technology that supports care, workflow optimization, excellent clinical performance and friction for use.\nA key piece of our in-house analyzer portfolio is ProCyte One, the innovative, customer-friendly hematology analyzer, which launched last year and has already surpassed an installed base of over 5,000 units. Reception and adoption of ProCyte One has been exceptional, particularly in international regions where many veterinarians were trained to run hematology diagnostics first when doing a basic workup on a patient. We had excellent growth in ProCyte One placements across regions for the second quarter and continued high levels of customer satisfaction and retention, supporting the expansion of our global premium hematology installed base aligned to the approximately 4,000 placements annually as shared in last year's Investor Day.\nThis progress is integral in addressing the estimated opportunity for 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placements. In addition to these targeted investments in enhanced commercial capabilities, technology and product innovation is another key pillar of IDEXX's growth strategy as we endeavor to add value to our product and service offerings.\nIn Q2, we announced three upcoming laboratory tests and service launches. We have a shared mission with our customers to deliver a higher standard of pet health care. And these new products and services support that care delivery to timely and highly accurate diagnostic insights. These innovations also enable our customers to do so in an efficient way by using the IDEXX reference lab as an extension of the veterinarian clinic, which is a key benefit given the current capacity constraints within our sector.\nThese innovations include: number one, expanding fecal Dx antigen testing to include the detection of flea tapeworm, the most common type of tapeworm to infect dogs and cats. With this addition, IDEXX's fecal Dx antigen test detects up to 5x more common and prevalent parasites than fecal flotation alone and provides customers with earlier diagnostic insights. This will drive even greater progress towards the goal we shared at Investor Day in 2018 of an incremental $120 million in fecal antigen revenues by 2023; number two, the addition of FGF23, a kidney disease management biomarker that will provide clinicians, along with the use of SDMA, not only earlier diagnostic signs of chronic kidney disease but will deliver more confident recommendations for targeted therapy during earlier stages of chronic kidney disease; and number three, a new service of PCR direct testing, which provides U.S. reference lab customers with crucial, timely access to next APCR results, enabled by a new PCR laboratory at our Louisville reference site.\nThe addition of these tests and services support our customers in delivering improved pet health care in ways in which an IDEXX partnership adds long-term increasing value for our customers. In addition to the development of highly relevant, accurately testing products, IDEXX's innovation focus is also on our broad portfolio of software services, including multiple cloud-native PIMs and a variety of tools to manage clinic workflow like Vet Radar, VetConnect PLUS, payment processing solutions and Web PACS.\nWhen combined, these products could create a powerful connected ecosystem within the veterinary clinic, which not only improves access to and communication of diagnostic insights but also provides efficiency benefits around the clinic and at each step of the patient visit process. The rapid uptake of IDEXX cloud-based solutions is a reflection of this.\nCustomers understand that modern software tools reduce manual work and increased capacity for clinic staff to focus on higher order patient center tasks. This higher standard of care is further supported by clinical decision support on VetConnect PLUS, which leverages machine learning to offer suggested next steps aligned with care protocols. A great example of this is our enhanced 4Dx Plus introduction, where we not only improved upon our gold standard in a plasma assay, but added a vector-borne disease clinical decision support module and made significant enhancements to workflow by doubling product shelf life and room temperature storage.\nWe are also seeing incremental follow-up tests for customers engaging with clinical decision support, and we'll share with you at the upcoming Investor Day promising early results. Customers clearly appreciate these benefits as we saw another quarter of record PIMS global placements, supported by continued strong demand for cloud-based offerings. ezyVet in particular, continues to experience strong growth since joining the IDEXX software family, the second quarter placements consistent with the prior quarter and 28% higher than the previous year.\nThese cloud-based solutions enable customers to shift their focus for maintaining on-premise hardware to providing excellent patient care while also benefiting IDEXX through growth of a highly profitable recurring revenue stream in the future. We continue to be very pleased with the advancement of our long-term strategy to integrate diagnostics and software that help IDEXX customers grow faster.\nUnderpinning our growing commercial and technology capabilities is a commitment to providing world-class level of service to our customers, which is integral to earning our customers' business every day, especially given the high levels of demand within the sector. Strong execution against this commitment takes many forms, from consistently high product availability rates to reliable turnaround times at our reference labs. The high service level IDEXX delivered in the second quarter, including greater than 99% product availability demonstrates the benefit of our long-term focus on building supply chain capabilities and highly-scaled manufacturing centers.\nOur recently communicated U.S. midyear price increase reflects higher cost to run the business, including investments in our supply chain to ensure excellent levels of product continuity and future network resiliency. Given this, IDEXX is well positioned to manage through supply chain and inflationary dynamics while building on our strong long-term financial performance. This concludes our review. IDEXX's execution levels remain strong and aligned towards our significant and enduring long-term growth potential.\nWe're well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results as we advance our mission to create a better future for animals, people in our planet. I'm thankful there are more than 10,000 colleagues for their ongoing dedication to our efforts. They are integral in delivering strong financial performance for the company and creating long-term value, while also supporting the advancement of animal care globally. To those listening in on the call, I'd like to extend the heartfelt thanks in making a meaningful difference in the world.\nBefore we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that my senior management team and I will provide more information on the IDEXX strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day. After 2 years of holding the event virtually, we look forward to hosting the event at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 11, from 8:00 to noon.\nWe're also live streaming and recording the event via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and GM for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Julie Godon, Vice President and GM for Global Rapid Assay; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology; Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President and GM of Veterinary Software and Services; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nWe're also excited to host a live customer conversation led by George Fennell, Senior Vice President and GM of the Americas CAG customer-facing organization, to discuss recent trends at the clinic level and how IDEXX has supported their business during these dynamic times. The event will last approximately 4 hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session and an investor lunch with the extended management team.\nSo with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A."

Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.\nDuring this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.\nIn reviewing our first quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted.\n(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our first quarter results and review our recalibrated financial outlook for 2022.\nIDEXX delivered solid financial performance in Q1 compared to very strong prior year results. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 8% as reported and organically driven by organic gains of 10% in our CAG business and 8% in our water business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically compared to higher prior year levels, which included benefits from a significant expansion in new pet patients during the pandemic.\nOur commercial execution was excellent, reflected in 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and continued strong momentum in expanding cloud-based software solutions. EPS was $2.27 per share, up 3% on a comparable basis. As expected, comparisons to high prior year gross margin levels and increased commercial investments constrained year-on-year operating profit gains in the quarter.\nCAG Diagnostic demand levels and IDEXX commercial execution continue to build on the significant step-up achieved during the pandemic, supported by ongoing gains in diagnostics adoption and utilization. We have seen a moderation in clinic visit levels compared to second half 2021 growth trends, which form the basis for our original 2022 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth outlook of 12% to 14%. In the U.S., in addition to early Q1 impacts from higher COVID cases globally, visit levels have been affected by constraints on veterinary service capacity and availability in a challenging labor market, following a period of significant demand expansion.\nWe saw similar COVID and capacity constraint dynamics in international regions like Europe with additional recent impacts for more challenging macro conditions, which have also constrained clinical visit growth compared to strong prior year baselines. Factoring in our Q1 results and near-term CAG sector trends, we're recalibrating our 2022 full year organic revenue growth outlook. We're adjusting our overall organic growth outlook to 7.5% to 10%, primarily reflecting an adjustment of 3% in our targeted full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range, now projected at 9% to 11% compared to strong prior year levels.\nWe're also factoring in an additional $40 million impact from the strength in U.S. dollar. Combined, these changes reduced our reported growth outlook by 3.5% or approximately $105 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. We believe these adjustments are appropriate as we work through near-term CAG sector dynamics and more challenging comparisons in the first half of 2022. We're targeting higher growth in the second half of 2022, with the high end of our full year growth outlook reflecting return to our original targeted CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range in H2.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for Companion Animal diagnostics globally building on the strong gains achieved during the pandemic. We're confident in the sustained long-term growth potential for our business, supported by our ongoing focus on innovation and customer engagement and driving CAG sector development. Aligning with this conviction, we're advancing high-return investments in innovation and commercial capability this year, including approximately $80 million in discrete investments related to the in-license of technology during the second quarter, which Jay will discuss in his remarks.\nOur 2022 EPS guidance of $8.11 to $8.35 per share factors and updates to our operating outlook, including $0.72 of discrete impact from the in-license of technology as well as a $0.10 per share adjustment related to the stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 of EPS impact related to higher interest rates. We'll discuss our full year outlook in more detail later in my comments.\nLet's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by 10% organic gains in our CAG business and 8% growth in our Water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, which included impacts from reduced African swine fever testing in China as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID testing revenues. Combined, these factors reduced overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by approximately 1% in the first quarter. Comparisons on both these fronts will improve in the second half of 2022.\nCAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically in Q1 compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. First quarter CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth benefited by approximately 1% from equivalent day effects. Overall Q1 CAG gains were also supported by 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues, in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition.\nIn terms of U.S. CAG sector demand drivers, same-store clinical visits in the first quarter were approximately 2% below strong prior year levels. This compares to 2% to 3% increases seen in the second half of 2021 when we began to lap the step-up in demand -- in testing demand that we saw during the pandemic. As noted, a factor influencing these trends is a near-term challenge related to capacity management of vet clinics that we've seen across global regions, which has resulted in constraints on clinic hours and access to veterinarians. Jay will speak more to these dynamics in his comments.\nAt the U.S. practice level, same-store diagnostic service revenue growth was a solid 7%. Underlying demand for pet health care services remains high, reflecting a robust multiyear growth trends. Compared to the 2019 pre-pandemic base, U.S. same-store clinical visits and diagnostic revenues increased 4% and 11%, respectively, on a 3-year compound annual growth basis.\nIDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 10% in Q1 continues to outpace sector growth trends, reflected in a 1,150 basis point premium to clinical visit gains, in part, supported by relatively higher net price realization and equivalent day benefits. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the first quarter. VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically with double-digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, reflecting double-digit gains across our Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 31% in Q1, reflecting 24% gains in the U.S. and 35% growth internationally, as clinics show confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally.\nThe quality of instrument placements continues to be very strong, reflected in 12% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supporting 1,924 premium hematology placements in the quarter, up 101%. Rapid Assay revenues expanded solidly in Q1 compared to high prior year growth levels. Global rapid assay revenues increased 8% organically, supported by solid volume gains in the U.S. and benefits from net price increases. Global lab revenues increased 8% organically in Q1 as double-digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by low single-digit gains in international regions impacted by pressure on clinical visit levels in Europe.\nReference lab new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally, supported by expansion of IDEXX 360 agreements. We achieved relatively higher benefits from net price gains in the first quarter, with 4% to 5% average gains on U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and solid levels of increases across international regions. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 34% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.\nWater revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting benefits from price gains and a continued solid global recovery in testing demand from constrained pandemic levels. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue decreased 19% organically in Q1. As expected, tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China, offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business. We expect to see relative improvement in LPD growth rates in the second half of the year as we work through challenging comparisons in the Asia Pacific region.\nTurning to the P&L. Solid revenue growth supported moderate operating profit and comparable EPS gains compared to high prior year levels. Gross profit increased 6% in Q1 as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.6%, a decrease of 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Comparable gross margin declines reflect the lapping of high Q1 2021 levels, business mix impacts from lower LPD and higher CAG instrument revenues and impacts from higher freight and distribution costs. CAG recurring revenue, net price gains and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset select inflationary impacts.\nWe're also seeing benefits from improvement in software service gross margins as we expand our recurring revenue base. Operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year as reported in the first quarter and 13% on a comparable basis. Higher operating expense growth reflects comparisons to controlled prior year levels as well as investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We also saw relatively higher travel costs compared to low prior year levels. We expect relatively higher year-on-year comparable OpEx growth in the second quarter as we lap these impacts in addition to the second quarter impacts projected from discrete R&D in-license activity.\nEPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 3% on a comparable basis. Q1 EPS included benefits of $5 million or $0.06 per share related to share-based compensation benefits, which was down $0.11 per share from high prior year group levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.03 per share in Q1, net of $2 million in hedge gains.\nFree cash flow was $83 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 84%. For the full year, we now estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%, approximately 10% below earlier conversion estimates. This outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D credits. We're maintaining a consistent full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing and warehouse expansion project.\nOur balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 0.9x net of cash. We allocated $273 million of capital to repurchase 523,000 shares in Q1. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with maintaining a similar net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 1.5% full year reduction in share count.\nTurning to our 2022 full year outlook. We're updating our organic revenue growth ranges to reflect Q1 performance, recent CAG sector trends and projected impacts related to the Ukraine War. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.39 billion to $3.465 billion reflects a $105 million reduction at midpoint compared to earlier estimates. This includes $10 million of projected revenue reductions related to our Russia, Belarus and Ukraine businesses and a $40 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by approximately 3% for the full year, with approximately 4% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q2.\nOur full year organic revenue outlook of 7.5% to 10% reflects an adjustment to our original guidance range of 2% to 2.5%, primarily reflecting a recalibration of our full year growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're planning for overall organic growth at the lower end of this range in the first half of 2022, reflecting more recent CAG sector trends and challenging comparisons in the second quarter. We're targeting improved growth rates in the second half of 2022 as vet clinics work to adapt to capacity challenges, and we benefit from our commercial initiatives.\nOur recalibrated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook is 9% to 11% for the full year, building on strong prior year gains. As noted, the high end of our full year growth range reflects second half CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth aligned with our original full year goals.\nAt our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for operating margins of 26.8% to 27.3%, down 170 to 220 basis points on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance. This includes approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments. This outlook incorporates effects from high-return commercial investments aligned with our long-term growth potential and captures projected inflationary effects on IDEXX's business this year.\nAdjusted for the discrete R&D investments and approximately 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, this outlook reflects updated goals for 0 to 50 basis points in operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. Our EPS outlook is $8.11 to $8.35 per share, a decrease of $1.20 at midpoint. This includes $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments, an additional $0.10 per share headwind related to foreign exchange and $0.05 per share of impact from higher projected interest rates. Our guidance for comparable EPS growth of minus 1% to plus 2% includes unfavorable growth impacts of 9% from the discrete R&D investments and an estimated 2% impact in 2022 from international tax rate changes.\nWe provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to 2022, building on significant gains in demand for companion animal diagnostics and software solutions achieved over the last 2 years. Veterinarians continue to see increased demand in their clinics compared to pre-pandemic turns and routinely choose IDEXX' innovative products and services to meet rising standards for pet health care. This is reflected in our continued solid CAG Diagnostics recurring growth and record Q1 global premium instrument placements, supported by our global rollout of ProCyte One. IDEXX' business strategy is focused on inspiring adoption and increasing the utilization of diagnostics and our results reflect continued strong progress on this path.\nOur integrated solutions not only help veterinarians expand capacity and grow their businesses, but also support an enduring recurring revenue stream in the future. While we've seen some moderation in CAG sector growth metrics from very strong growth levels during the pandemic, we have high confidence in the durability and ongoing growth potential of our business and our strategy to drive the significant long-term growth opportunity we see for companion animal health care. Today, I'll focus on discussing IDEXX's performance and progress in advancing key growth initiatives that are enabling us to build on our strong growth and financial performance as we serve our mission-driven purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock.\nLet me start by providing some context on recent trends in the CAG sector. Overall, CAG sector demand trends continued to expand at a solid rate, building on the very strong increases in diagnostics demand seen through the pandemic. As Brian noted, U.S. practice same-store diagnostics revenues increased 7% in the first quarter compared to very strong prior year results. IDEXX's growth strategy has been consistently focused on driving diagnostics adoption and utilization at the clinic level, supported by our investments in commercial engagement and innovation. First quarter results show continued progress on this front.\nWe've provided some additional information in our quarterly snapshot, which breaks down practice level diagnostics revenue growth dynamics into 3 key drivers: clinical visit growth; diagnostic frequency, or the percentage of clinical visits, including diagnostics; and diagnostics utilization, or diagnostics revenue per visit that include diagnostics. This breakdown highlights benefits for both continued solid increases in diagnostics frequency and expanded growth rates in diagnostics utilization ahead of pre-pandemic levels, building on a very strong gain seen over the last 2 years.\nThese impressive gains were moderated in Q1 by a 2% year-on-year decline in clinical visits, which is a change from the very solid 2% to 3% clinical visit growth trends we saw in the second half of 2021. As we've analyzed these recent changes, it appears that in addition to some effects from COVID case spikes and weather dynamics in the first quarter, there are near-term constraints on vet clinic capacity that are impacting clinical visit levels.\nVeterinarians and their staffs are continuing to adapt to the extraordinary growth in demand over the last 2 years when the U.S. pet population expanded approximately 10%, resulting in double-digit increases in same-store clinical visit levels, reflective of the sustained pressure on their time as well as staffing challenges that many sectors are facing currently. Pet clinics have scaled back hours. The metric we can track is the percentage of clinics with weekend appointment activity, which declined to 42% in Q1 from 54% levels pre-pandemic, as clinics and vet themselves are looking to achieve more near-term balance in their workloads.\nAs many pet owners wait longer to secure appointments, underlying demand for pet health care remains strong. But these factors have had the near-term effect of moderating the extraordinary growth pace we've seen in the CAG industry over the last 2 years. We've seen similar dynamics in international regions like Europe in terms of clinical visit levels, with some additional pressures potentially related to the more recent macro headwinds.\nGiven the near-term clinical visit and macro dynamics noted, we felt it was prudent to recalibrate our 2022 outlook. Our full year outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth of 9% to 11% builds on our 17% average annual growth over the last 2 years, with goals to accelerate gains in the second half of 2022, benefiting from continued advancement of our commercial and innovation efforts.\nThe longer-term outlook for pet health care remains very strong, benefiting from increases in pet ownership, favorable demographic trends and the continued strengthening of the pet and pet owner bond. IDEXX is well positioned to drive sector growth and help customers service growing demand through our broad array of point-of-care and reference laboratory products and services, all connected by cloud-based software capability, which supports clinic efficiency and workflow enhancements.\nThe IDEXX team is focused on driving this potential and continues to operate at an exceptional level. This is reflected in continued solid new business gains, record instrument placement levels, high growth in software services and the continued very high levels of customer satisfaction reflected in record high retention levels. Our high-touch customer commercial model and innovative diagnostics and software solutions positions us well to help customers work through near-term management challenges to extend the strong growth momentum in our business. Let's discuss some recent progress on these key strategic fronts.\nHigh levels of commercial engagement that supports sector growth remains a pillar of our growth strategy, and we continue to build on our leading commercial capability globally. As noted, we continue to drive strong performance in terms of new business acquisition, with solid net customer gains across modalities and regions. Our highly skilled commercial teams delivered outstanding premium instrument placement performance in Q1 across our platforms, supporting strong growth in our EVI metric in the quarter. We achieved strong growth overall across new, competitive and loyal customer segments as well as within corporate accounts, as veterinarians are clearly looking to use IDEXX technology to manage elevated demand within their clinics. And despite highly variable access levels globally, our sales teams demonstrate that they have strong and trusting relationships with their customers, regardless of clinic type and a keen ability to meet customer needs with IDEXX products, each of which are driving strong customer retention and healthy global installed base growth.\nThis momentum has been supported by the strengthening of our commercial capabilities in international regions. We're encouraged by the early performance measures like reach to customer and reach to revenue from our recently completed international country expansions. These include Germany, France, Spain, South Korea, Italy and Brazil, while it had smaller targeted investments in our commercial capabilities to complement these efforts as opportunity warrants, including in our largest region in the U.S. Commercial expansions are supported through our center of excellence approach, which enables efficiency, speed of execution and high return on our investments.\nInnovation is a critical enabler of our growth strategy. And key advancements such as ProCyte One, IDEXX's innovative and easy-to-use hematology analyzer, continues to gain momentum and provide multiplier benefits for our business. Just 1 year after its launch, ProCyte One is now commercially available around the world and has a global installed base of almost 4,000 units, demonstrating the power of the right product in the hands of a dedicated commercial sales force. This trajectory aligns our premium hematology business with the approximately 20,000 placement outlook we shared at our most recent Investor Day, and utilization rates are trending favorably for customers upgrading from laser side. ProCyte One attach rates with Catalysts are high in the mid-90% range, highlighting the multiplier benefit to our broader point-of-care business. This innovative hematology platform is a key enabler to support penetration of our estimated 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity.\nAnother key advancement in our innovation agenda is 4Dx Plus, the gold standard diagnostic for vector-borne disease in canines, which will provide customers with benefits from multiple product enhancements this year, including the more sensitive end-of-plasma detection, clinical decision support and USDA approval for 2x longer room temperature storage for our point-of-care test SNAP 4Dx Plus. It's an example of IDEXX's whole product approach of enhancing assay performance, workflow and clinical decision support. Additionally, the SNAP Pro analyzer, which has had excellent momentum in global placements during Q1, improves clinic workflows by seamlessly adding test results through our powerful diagnostics portal VetConnect PLUS and ensuring charge capture of all tests run through of the instrument. These innovative products help our customers improve clinic efficiency and supported solid growth in our rapid assay franchise in the first quarter as we saw seasonally aligned increases in demand for tick-borne disease testing.\nAs we capture near-term benefits from our existing innovations with customers, we continue to advance our long-term innovation agenda as well. As noted in our financial guidance update, we made investments with 2 companies, the in-licensed technology for worldwide exclusive use in developing point-of-care diagnostics platforms and applications. IDEXX has a long track record of partnering with companies to apply technology that enhances the quality of pet health care. We look forward to sharing more on these initiatives in the future as we build on our compelling real-time care portfolio.\nAnother key area of strategic focus for IDEXX involves delivering whole product software solutions that address a broad jobs-to-do capability within a single platform. Our PIMS solutions, along with Vet Radar and payment processing solutions, VetConnect PLUS, with clinical decision support and Web PACS, are all increasingly interconnected, offering our customers a seamless experience across these important clinical and productivity applications. Consequently, our customers purchased more of these applications in Q1 than in any previous quarter. We also had record global placements with over 350 PIMS installations, with the vast majority of customers choosing a cloud-based solution. Notably, we made significant headway in outfitting greenfield practices that the IDEXX is a key partner as they establish and equip a new clinic.\nWith many customers capacity constrained, veterinarians have a significant investment appetite for modern, mobile and well-integrated cloud-based software technology. These software solutions allow our customers to focus on providing care instead of maintaining technology. With our recent acquisition of ezyVet and as preference for cloud-based solutions accelerate, our software revenue base continues to move towards a highly profitable recurring revenue stream.\nAs we advance our commercial and innovation capabilities, we are highly committed to sustaining outstanding levels of customer support, reference lab service turnaround time and product availability enabled by our highly capable operations organization. The manufacturing and supply chain capabilities that we built over multiple decades allow us to support our busy customers and keep up with the strong growth in industry demand, while managing through a dynamic supply chain environment. IDEXX customers benefited once again from product availability close to 100% and continuously high levels of on-time deliveries. These excellent service metrics demonstrate the benefit of our long product life cycles and deep supplier relationships as well as our investment in highly skilled manufacturing centers. And while we continue to monitor the impacts of inflationary dynamics in regional COVID-19 outbreaks, we feel confident in our ability to build upon strong financial performance, as Brian outlined in our full year financial outlook.\nIn concluding our first quarter review, I'd like to welcome Michael Johnson to IDEXX as our new Chief Human Resources Officer. Michael brings over 22 years of experience in developing HR leadership capabilities across multiple disciplines and geographies, most recently at Abbott Laboratories, where he was Divisional Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion. The Chief Human Resources Officer role is a key enabler of our long-term growth strategy in supporting employee engagement, talent development and organizational effectiveness, and we look forward to Michael's leadership and continually advancing our initiatives and performance in these areas. Welcome, Michael.\nThis concludes our review of our first quarter performance. Before opening the line for Q&A, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Ukraine as the escalating war has taken a devastating toll on people and pets in the region. As a purpose-driven company, we strongly condemn the invasion and violence there. We have been focused on supporting our customers, the health and safety of our employees in the region and true to the heart of IDEXX, the pets that are part of their families. We have significantly scaled back operations in Russia, including suspending sales of veterinary diagnostic equipment in the country. Instead, our focus has been on supporting the essential care of pets to the extent that we can through our existing veterinary customers.\nTo support the humanitarian needs of the region, we have leveraged the IDEXX Foundation to provide funding to the International Medical Corps, the World Central Kitchen and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, while also providing free rabies tests for displaced Ukrainian pets all over Europe. Going forward, we will monitor the situation to identify the additional ways to support Ukrainian refugees and their pets. I would like to thank our employees around the world who have taken part in the IDEXX Foundation Matching program to make personal donations to these organizations.\nWith that, we will turn to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon.\n\nBrian P. McKeon\n\nCFO, Executive VP & Treasurer, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial performance in Q4, driven by double-digit top line gains compared to very strong prior year results. Revenue increased 11% as reported and 10.5% organically supported by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues.\nTwo-year average annual organic growth for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues was approximately 17% across U.S. and international regions, consistent with the accelerated 2-year growth trends seen throughout 2021. We achieved record premium instrument placements in Q4 with strong gains across our major platforms, supporting a 14% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base. Strong revenue growth enabled delivery of $1.89 in EPS, up 12% on a comparable basis as we advance planned investments in our commercial and innovation capability.\nFlow-through benefits from high organic revenue growth in 2021 drove outstanding full year financial performance above our long-term goals. IDEXX achieved 16% overall organic revenue growth for the full year driven by 18% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 29%, an increase of 220 basis points on a comparable basis, and we delivered full year EPS of $8.60 per share, up 29% on a comparable basis.\nWe're well positioned to build on this strong financial performance in 2022. We're targeting revenue gains at the higher end of our long-term goals, reflected in our outlook for 10% to 12% overall organic revenue growth and 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. We're also targeting 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, building on the strong profit gains through the pandemic as we continue to invest towards the long-term development of companion animal health care globally.\nOur EPS outlook of $9.27 to $9.59 per share reflects 12% to 16% comparable EPS growth, including an estimated $0.15 per share or 2% EPS growth impact related to higher projected international tax rates. We'll discuss our 2022 financial outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results.\nFourth quarter organic revenue growth of 10.5% was driven by 13% overall CAG gains and 13% growth in our Water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, reflecting comparisons to high prior year results that benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $5 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing revenues. Strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth reflected 13% organic gains across U.S. and international regions compared to 21% organic growth levels in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nStrong Q4 and CAG results were also supported by 21% gains in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. For the full year 2021, overall CAG revenues increased 19% organically driven by 18% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting high gains across our major modalities and regions.\nStrong U.S. CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter was aided by solid year-on-year gains in clinical visits and continued positive demand trends, which are supporting high levels of clinical revenue growth at the practice level. Same-store U.S. clinical visit growth was 2.2% in Q4 compared to high prior year growth levels.\nOn a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical business increased at 5.5% with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. An increased focus on health care services, including diagnostics, supported an 8% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4 and nearly 10% gains in clinical diagnostic revenues, which increased 14% on an average 2-year basis. Expanding demand for clinical services and benefits from IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement, supported a 1,050 basis point premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to U.S. clinical visit growth in the quarter. In terms of practice level trends, we did see some modest impact from the recent Omicron wave on clinical testing volumes in international regions in Q4, which has continued in early 2022.\nWe've also seen some modest in clinic visit growth in January in the U.S., including near-term impacts from higher COVID cases on practice level staffing. We're monitoring these dynamics, which we see indicative of changes in strong underlying demand trends. Globally, IDEXX achieved strong organic gains across our major testing modalities in Q4, resulting in exceptional full year growth results.\nIDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 12% organically in Q4, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S. and high single-digit organic growth in international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by solid same-store volume growth, including benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements. For the full year 2021, Global Lab revenues increased 70% organically, reflecting consistent high gains across U.S. and international regions.\nIDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 15% on an organic basis in Q4, reflecting double-digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Strong consumable growth reflects increases in testing utilization sustained high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. These dynamics supported 20% full year organic growth at IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2021.\nIDEXX had another quarter of outstanding instrument placements building on this momentum. We achieved 5,258 premium instrument placements in Q4, up 29% from prior year levels, reflecting robust gains across U.S. and international regions. We achieved strong global placement growth across our major platforms year-on-year with Catalyst up 8%; SediVue up 20%; and premium hematology up 72%, supported by the continued global rollout of ProCyte One. The breadth and quality of CAG instrument placements supported strong gains in our economic value metric.\nNew instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels drove a 14% increase in our global premium instrument installed base in 2021, setting a foundation for continued strong consumable growth as we move forward. Rapid Assay revenue increased 10% organically in Q4, reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S., aligned with broader increases in demand for diagnostic testing and high growth in international regions. For the full year 2021, Rapid Assay organic revenue growth was 17%, supported by high volume gains for canine 4Dx feline and specialty testing. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, augmented by moderate net price improvement of approximately 3% in key regions like the U.S.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we're planning for a net price improvement in the range of 3% to 4%, reflecting higher list price increases to reflect higher service costs and continued investment in service quality and product innovation. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 30% as reported in Q4, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Continued strong gains in recurring software and diagnostic imaging services and high comparable growth in PIMS placements were moderated to a degree by tough compares related to strong prior year diagnostic imaging placements.\nFor the full year 2021, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues expanded to over $200 million, up 15% organically and 27% as reported, as we continue to advance the integration of information technology and insight as a key feature of our diagnostic solutions.\nTurning to other business segments. Water revenues increased 13% organically in Q4 and compared to flat organic growth in last year's fourth quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre-COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and noncompliance testing categories. For the full year 2021, Water revenues increased 12% organically compared to a 2% organic decline in 2020.\nLivestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 90% organically in Q4 compared to 13% organic growth levels in Q4 of 2020. As expected, dynamics in our China LPD business, including the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing offset growth in other global regions. For the full year 2021, LPD revenues declined 9% organically compared to 11% gains in 2020. We're planning for continued challenging year-on-year comparison in LPD revenues in the first half of 2022, which is factored into our overall revenue outlook.\nTurning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth drove solid operating profit gains compared to strong prior year levels as we advance planned investments aligned with our growth strategy. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis in Q4, driven by continued solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 12% in the quarter reflecting strong revenue growth and a modest overall increase in gross margins. We benefited from continued high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, moderate net price improvement and higher veterinary software margins, including positive impacts from our expanding SaaS customer base. These factors were moderated by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues.\nOperating expenses increased 15% on a reported and comparable basis in Q4. As planned, we saw relatively higher levels of operating expense growth as we advanced investments in R&D, enhanced our global CAG sales and marketing capability and integrated the ezyVet acquisition. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth in 2022, aligned with our strong global growth momentum. Operating expense investments drove a 70 basis point contraction in comparable operating margins in Q4. For the full year 2021, our operating margins reached 29%, up 220 basis points on a comparable basis for the year, up approximately 560 basis points on a comparable basis from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. We're targeting to build on the strong performance in 2022 as we invest towards the high return long-term growth potential in our business.\nQ4 EPS was $1.89 per share, including $0.08 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year 2021, EPS was $8.60, up 29% on a comparable basis. Full year EPS results included $32 million or $0.38 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 360 basis points of effective tax rate benefit. Foreign exchange effects reduced revenue growth by approximately 1% in Q4, resulting in a $0.02 per share profit impact, net of a hedge loss of approximately $500,000.\nFor the full year 2021, foreign exchange rate changes increased EPS by $0.16 per share, net of foreign exchange hedge losses of $7 million. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we're planning for 1.5% FX revenue growth headwind in 2022, with approximately 2% to 2.5% year-on-year growth headwinds in the first half. While previously established hedge positions will mitigate these impacts on profits, our initial 2022 outlook incorporates an estimated $0.08 net unfavorable EPS impact from FX at the rates noted in our press release.\nFree cash flow was $636 million for 2021 or approximately 85% of net income, reflecting $120 million in capital spending, including $18 million in real estate purchases. We've maintained a strong balance sheet. We ended 2021 with leverage ratios of 0.9x gross and 0.7x net of cash with $144 million in cash at the end of the year.\nIn Q4, we established a new 5-year $1 billion revolving credit facility, which provides relatively improved borrowing rates. Our 2022 interest expense outlook incorporates these benefits, current forward interest rates and expectations for a net leverage ratio of 1x next year. In Q4, we allocated $245 million to repurchase 391,000 shares in the quarter. We plan to continue to allocate capital to share repurchases as part of our financial approach, which is reflected in the projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in our diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2022.\nTurning to our 2022 outlook. We're providing initial guidance for reported revenues of $3.5 billion to $3.565 billion. This outlook reflects a targeted organic revenue growth range of 10% to 12%, carryover benefits of approximately 0.5% from 2021 acquisitions and an estimated 1.5% revenue growth headwind from FX. Our organic growth outlook reflects an estimated growth range of 12% to 14% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. The higher end of this range aligns with sustaining the strong year-on-year growth trends we achieved exiting 2021 and incorporates additional targeted benefits from a moderately higher net price realization and investments in global CAG sector development. Our overall organic growth outlook also factors in continued benefits from expansion of our premium instrument installed base and solid growth in our Water business. These positive factors are partially offset by expectations for continued year-on-year pressure on LPD revenues in the first half of 2022 and a projected contraction in human PCR testing revenues reflecting our overall strategic growth focus on our core businesses.\nOur operating -- reported operating margin outlook for full year 2022 was 29.7% to 30.2%, reflecting a targeted 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement, building on our strong operating margin gains in recent years. We expect operating margin improvement will be supported by solid gross margin gains as we advance investments in our global commercial and innovation capability and ensure high levels of operational business continuity as a priority. We've incorporated anticipated inflationary cost impacts as well as benefits from relatively higher net price gains in our overall operating margin outlook. Given exit rates in our OpEx spending and year-on-year operating profit comparison dynamics, we're planning for operating margin improvements to be primarily driven by gains in the second half of 2022.\nOur preliminary EPS outlook for 2022 is $9.27 to $9.59 per share, an increase of 8% to 11% as reported. Our EPS outlook factors in increase in our overall effective tax rate from 17.5% to an estimated 21.5% to 22% in 2022. Approximately 100 to 150 basis points of this increase relates to projected impacts from international tax changes. We're also projecting lower tax benefits from share-based tax compensation activity. Our EPS outlook reflects projected 2022 stock-based compensation tax benefits of $10 million or approximately $0.12 per share compared to high realized 2021 tax benefits of $32 million or $0.38 per share.\nAs noted, we've also incorporated an estimated year-on-year negative impact of $0.08 per share from FX, net of established hedge positions. Adjusting for these factors, our outlook is for EPS growth of 12% to 16% on a comparable basis including an estimated $0.15 per share or approximately 2% EPS growth impact from international tax rate changes. Our 2022 free cash flow outlook is for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 75% to 80%. This reflects estimated capital spending of $180 million or approximately 5% of revenues including $50 million related to a new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion aligned to support our high growth. Adjusting for this major project, our normalized net income to free cash flow conversion ratio is aligned with our longer-term 80% to 90% targets.\nThat concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.\n\nJonathan J. Mazelsky\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX sustained its strong performance in Q4, capping an exceptional year for the company. For the full year, we delivered 16% organic revenue growth, 29% comparable EPS growth supported by solid operating margin gains and 59% ROIC. These results reflect the attractiveness of our businesses, including our core CAG business, which is sustaining very strong growth trends benefiting from our commercial expansion and an expanding innovation portfolio. We're well positioned to build on this momentum in 2022 as reflected in our financial outlook.\nThis morning, I'll recap our recent performance and highlight key areas of business focus moving forward, including advancement of new innovations and the ongoing expansion of our global commercial capabilities. Both of these are strategic elements of our plan to develop the substantial long-term market opportunity still before us.\nLet me begin with a brief update on sector trends. Overall, global companion animal health care trends remained strong, driven by ongoing robust demand and veterinary clinics for health care services, including Diagnostics. As Brian highlighted, U.S. same-store clinical revenues increased 8% in Q4, supported by 2% growth in same-store clinical visits compared to very strong prior year growth levels. Diagnostic same-store growth continues to expand at a higher pace of nearly 10%.\nIDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth is leading this expansion, reflected in 13% organic gains in Q4, building a 21% gains in Q4 of 2020 as we provide highly desired Diagnostics and information management platforms that support our customers' care mission. We're seeing sustained strong demand trends for clinical service globally, building on the step-up achieved through the pandemic.\nAs highlighted in data shared in our earnings snapshot, this includes sustained approximately 2% acceleration in U.S. Diagnostics revenue per clinical visit in 2021, building on higher 2020 gains. This solid momentum gives us confidence in investing towards accelerated global CAG sector development and is reflected in our outlook of 12% to 14% global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains in 2022 at the high end of our long-term goals.\nLike many sectors of the global economy, veterinary clinics continue to work through the challenging dynamic of increased clinical demand in the face of staffing challenges, including near-term management impacts from the search of the Omicron variant. It's clear that strong clinical service demand will be a priority for clinics moving forward. IDEXX remains committed and extremely well positioned to support the growth of our customers through our focus on high customer service levels and solutions that enhance clinic productivity.\nAs we look forward, we're expanding our global commercial capability aligned with these strong demand trends. Our investments in Germany, France and South Korea in the first half of 2021 continue to pay off as expanded commercial footprints in each country enable significant increases in customer contact and reach to revenue, critical elements of our high-touch account management philosophy. We're tracking towards completion in early 2022 of the already communicated second wave of expansions in 3 additional countries with more to come.\nThese are holistic initiatives that only involve the addition of customer-facing professionals across multiple job types such as account managers, professional service veterinarians and field service representatives but also include the extension of marketing programs and new field tools such as IDEXX 360 and the addition of more expensive reference of carrier routes and expanded service levels.\nIncreasing our international commercial footprint while maturing our approach will continue to be a key priority beyond Wave 2 countries currently nearing completion. To that end, I'm pleased to share that we are also augmenting our commercial leadership team with an experienced commercial executive in Asia Pacific Keg, who will join IDEXX this quarter. As we expand, our commercial team continues to deliver the day, reflecting in over 5,000 premium instrument placements in Q4. By far, our largest quarterly placements ever achieved. Premium instrument placement growth of 29% includes comparable growth across U.S. and international regions and resulted in 14% growth in our global premium installed base with strong performance across each of our instrument platforms.\nThese exceptional results were delivered despite excess challenges. They demonstrate strong commercial execution as well as the fact that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX innovations to support increased clinical demand today while investing for future business needs. ProCyte One is a great example of this. Our ProCyte One launch has gone exceptionally well. ProCyte One's performance and reliability as use of the demanding environment of a practice has met or exceeded all goals and feedback remains highly positive as customers love its easy use and how it fits into the veterinary clinic workflow.\nWe see mid-90% global attach rates with chemistry analyzers and this trend demonstrate ProCyte One's importance in building a full diagnostic work. Furthermore, the ProCyte One launch benefits from programs like IDEXX 360, which not only provides veterinarians with a flexible customer-friendly way to add this innovative analyzer to their clinics, but also benefits growth across IDEXX testing modalities. Our global ProCyte One regional [raw] is now nearly complete, and we have delivered over 2,500 instruments globally since launching in late Q1 of 2021. A growing installed base of premium instruments supports a robust stream of future consumables usage, which gives us confidence in guided ranges for CAG recurring revenue growth.\nIn addition to driving placements and adoption, our commercial team continues to educate our customers on the benefits of preventive medicine. The Preventive Care initiative remains our primary vehicle for driving a preventive agenda in the clinic and provide sales professionals an opportunity to engage in thorough conversations with broad participation from practice staff.\nDespite restricted access to clinics, we drove approximately 125 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter, while also developing plans to simplify the enrollment process for busy customers, and we look forward to deploying this and continuing to support this broader preventive care effort in 2022. We also see continued momentum in software expansion as our innovative products are helping customers improve clinic efficiency and pet owner communication. The onboarding of ezyVet has gone very smoothly and subscriptions are tracking favorably to our high expectations. Customers appreciate the advanced capabilities and intuitive workflow ezyVet provides. 81% of PIMS placements were cloud-based in the quarter, demonstrating that we are well positioned to support customers in their shift to the cloud. This trend provides a significant growth opportunity and excellent profit flow. It puts a robust and easy-to-use information management products at the hands of our customers that enable them to focus on providing the highest levels of patient care enabled by diagnostics to improve health outcomes.\nOur software portfolio is a strategic area of investment and focus for IDEXX. Veterinarians have never been busier and have a deep need and appreciation for software solutions that are easy to use and built on contemporary technology stacks. They look to these solutions to support patient care, staff productivity and internal as well as pet owner communications. Our strategy is to bring enterprise PIMS software solutions to our customers that work seamlessly with a broader set of business and clinical applications, our own or third parties that veterinarians use to run their practices.\nVetConnect PLUS, our Diagnostics' results, clinical decision support and ordering portal is a great example of this. VetConnect PLUS was launched almost 10 years ago. It's integrated from a workflow standpoint in IDEXX and third-party PIMS. It is now being used in over 30,000 practices globally. Customers who use our software and diagnostic solutions together correlate with higher growth profiles supporting workflow optimization for our diagnostics testing platforms.\nOur Diagnostic Imaging business, which includes our industry-leading web pack software solution also experienced an excellent quarter, demonstrating the preference customers have for our premier low-dose imaging solutions. Solid placements in the quarter supported full year placement growth of 35% and double-digit year-over-year gains in recurring revenue. We also had strong growth in Web PACS subscriptions for Q4, up 18% versus the prior year and with continued customer retention rates in the high 90% range.\nGrowth in the installed base, a profitable revenue stream and increased utilization of services have helped IDEXX Web PACS become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. In addition to ensuring the successful rollout and adoption of these recent innovations, we were thrilled to launch a series of new product and service enhancements at BMX last month. Each of these innovations highlight IDEXX' commitment to continually invest in our service and product offerings, with a particular focus on providing insights and decision-making aids to help customers deliver a higher standard of patient care.\nThese enhancements include an expanded oncology testing platform with additional test [dates] for veterinarians to better identify, stage, treat and monitor several prevalent cancer types, an updated 4Dx Plus test with improved parameter performance for anaplasma and the addition of clinical decision support for 4Dx Plus and Neural Network 6.0 for SediVue, which has now been trained on 800 million urine sediment images.\nImproving the performance of our products is central to our strategy, and we're also supporting greater efficiency which helps drive higher adoption and customer satisfaction. Some examples. The new catalyst SDMA, brings reagents on board the test, reducing the number of steps to run the test and time to results. while also reducing storage space and waste due to the removal of separate reagent comes. The improved VetConnect PLUS mobile app provides an enhanced user experience, improved mobile capability and easier pit on our communication. And finally, coming later in 2022, our 4Dx Plus test will allow for extended room temperature storage. The addition of these time-saving technologies demonstrates our technology for life approach to product and services designs.\nNotably, the improved 4Dx Plus product represents our fifth update to the (inaudible) product first launched in 1992. While this test already represents the gold standard for vector-borne disease rapid testing, we remain focused on continuous improvement to support our customers in delivering improved Pet Health outcomes. Underpinning our strong business performance is a prioritized focus on providing continued high-level service to our customers. A key element to achieving these service levels is consistent strong execution across our supply chain, which we saw again in Q4 through high product availability and strong order turnaround times.\nIn order to build this capability and support growth in the future, we plan to invest in 2022 in the expansion of our manufacturing footprint and lab capacity, while also maintaining strong frontline measures to support high service levels. And while we anticipate some inflationary dynamics and supply chain headwinds going forward, we have captured these impacts in our outlook and believe we are well positioned to build upon our year-end margins. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum and execution in our business and excited about our plans to build on our progress in 2022.\nBefore we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to say thanks to our employees for another top-notch year in pursuit of our purpose and its service to our customers. The IDEXX organization remained highly focused on our customers' needs and continued to perform at a very high level during another dynamic and demanding year. The team's perseverance is seen both in the results highlighted this morning as well as our high levels of engagement as a team. And I'm proud to be able to share today's excellent results on behalf of the whole team's hard work. That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.\n\nIf anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci.\n\nAhead. Thank you, Christine, and good morning.\n\nEveryone, welcome to Home Depot's third quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nFollowing our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up.\n\nIf we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements under the Federal Securities Laws, including as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and are most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nToday's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures including but not limited to adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and return on invested capital.\n\nFor a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures, to the corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release and our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $41.4 billion, up 2.8% from the same period last year. Comp sales increased 0.2% from the same period last year, and comps in the U.S. increased 0.1%.\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.74 in the third quarter. Compared to $3.78 in the third quarter last year. In local currency, Canada and Mexico posted positive comps.\n\nOur results missed our expectations, primarily due to the lack of storms in the third expected pressure in certain categories. Additionally, while underlying demand in the business remained relatively stable sequentially, an expected increase in demand in the third quarter did not materialize.\n\nWe believe that consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand. Today, we've revised our guidance for fiscal 2025, which Richard will take you through in a moment.\n\nWe remain focused on controlling what we can control. Our teams are executing at a high level and we believe we are growing market share.\n\nWe continue to invest across the business, supporting our associates and delivering the value proposition expected by our customers. In September, SRS completed the acquisition of GMS, a leading distributor of specially building products.\n\nIncluding drywall, ceiling, and steel framing related to remodeling and construction projects. GMS further enhances SRS's position as a leading multi-category building materials distributor, bringing differentiated capabilities and product categories in customer relationships that are highly complementary to SRS's existing business.\n\nWe could not be more excited to welcome GMS to the family and look forward to bringing a truly differentiated value proposition to our pro customers.\n\nWe're excited to see many of you in person in a few weeks at our investor conference at the New York Stock Exchange on December 9th.\n\nWe will update you on our strategic initiatives, our unique positioning in the marketplace, and our investments in the traction we are seeing with our customers as we continue to position ourselves to win market share in both the near and long term.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank our store associates, merchants, supply chain teams, and vendor partners who continue to take care of our customers and execute at a high level.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\n\nThanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Our associates did an incredible job focusing on our customers and delivering exceptional customer service in our stores during the quarter.\n\nWe continue to lean in on initiatives that help our associates do their jobs more effectively while also driving productivity in our operations. I'm going to highlight our progress across a number of initiatives that have helped improve the associate experience and our resulting in a better customer experience and increased customer satisfaction.\n\nLast year, we rolled out our freight flow application to all stores which has improved our freight processes and driven efficiency in our operations. This initiative has significantly improved our cartons per hour metric, resulting in greater efficiency in our onload and pack-out process.\n\nWe also continue to focus on on-shelf availability and through computer vision and sidekick, we have reached record in-stock and on-shelf availability levels. Lastly, our faster fulfillment efforts leveraging both our stores and distribution centers that you've heard about over the last few quarters have driven an over 400 basis point increase in our customer satisfaction scores.\n\nIn addition, we continue to focus on our pro ecosystem, maturing the new capabilities we have built for pros working on complex projects while enhancing the tools we have to serve pros.\n\nWe're pleased with the progress we're seeing as our customers engage with our capabilities. There are two new tools we have deployed over the last several months that help us differentiate our offering.\n\nThe first is a new project planning tool that we launched in September which allows our pros to create and manage material lists and track orders and deliveries.\n\nThe second tools, blueprint takeoffs, will transform the way pros plan and prepare for their projects. This new tool leverages advanced AI and proprietary algorithms to deliver accurate blueprint takeoffs and material estimates in record time.\n\nPros can then quickly and easily purchase all materials they need for their project through The Home Depot, simplifying this complex project process by going through a single supplier.\n\nThis technology replaces a manual intensive process that took weeks to complete increasing accuracy and reliability. Adding this advanced technology to our ecosystem of capabilities to better serve the pro working on complex projects will further enable us to be the one-stop shop for all project needs.\n\nFrom initial planning to material delivery, saving our pros time and money. We look forward to seeing you in a few weeks in New York to provide a holistic view of how our full ecosystem is resonating with our pros and allowing us to gain traction and win in the market.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities.\n\nAs you heard from Ted, the underlying demand in the quarter was relatively similar to what we saw in the second quarter. However, our results were below our expectations, largely due to a lack of storms relative to historic norms, which most notably impacted areas of the business such as roofing, power generation, and plywood to name a few.\n\nTurning to our merchandising department comp performance for the third quarter, nine of our 16 merchandising departments posted positive comps, including kitchen, bath, outdoor garden, storage, electrical, plumbing, millwork, hardware, and appliances.\n\nDuring the third quarter, our comp average ticket increased 1.8%, and comp transactions decreased 1.6%. The growth in comp average ticket primarily reflects a greater mix of higher ticket items, with customers continuing to trade up for new and innovative products, as well as modest price increases.\n\nBig ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were positive 2.3% compared to the third quarter of last year. We were pleased with the performance we saw in categories such as appliances, portable power, and gypsum.\n\nHowever, we continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund renovation projects. During the third quarter, both pro and DIY comp sales were positive and relatively in line with one another.\n\nWe saw strength across pro-heavy categories like gypsum, insulation, siding, and plumbing. In DIY, we saw strength across our seasonal product offerings, including live goods, hardscapes, and other garden products.\n\nTurning to total company online comp sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 11% compared to the third quarter of last year. We're excited about the continued success we're seeing across our interconnected platforms.\n\nOur faster delivery speeds are resonating with customers and driving greater engagement and sales. We know that as we remove friction from the experience, we see incremental customer engagement leading to greater sales across all points of interaction.\n\nDuring the third quarter, we hosted our annual supplier partnership meeting, where we focused on how we will continue to work together to bring the best products to market, deliver innovative solutions that simplify the project, and offer great value with best-in-class features and benefits.\n\nAt the event, we recognized a number of vendors across categories who continue to transform the industry with the innovation they bring to our customers on a daily basis.\n\nThey include Leadersen, Cobra Torque, Feather River, Milwaukee, Ryobi, Frigidaire, Kitta, Traeger, and many more. We are proud of the innovation and partnership that our suppliers bring to The Home Depot and the value we're able to offer both our pro and DIY customers.\n\nAs we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we're looking forward to the excitement we will bring with our annual holiday, Black Friday, and gift center events.\n\nIn our gift center event, we continue to lean into brands that matter most for our customers with our assortment of Milwaukee, Ryobi, Makita, DeWalt, Rigid, Diablo,\n\ntools Hand , and in appliances for Black Friday , we have exciting offers on LG , Samsung , Bosch , whirlpool , GE and Frigidaire .\n\nOur assortment includes multiple exclusive products like LG Stainless Steel , French Door refrigerator with Kraft Ice and Frigidaire's , new gallery , dishwasher with a wash cycle time of only This 50 minutes .\n\nI'm also quarter , excited to announce the addition of PGT windows to our wide assortment of exclusive retail brands , including American Craftsman and Andersen Windows , PGT impact resistant windows are engineered to meet some of the highest performance standards in the industry , reducing storm damage risk , providing energy efficiency , UV protection , and sound reduction .\n\nAnd they will be exclusive Home to The Depot and the Big Box channel .

It is the power of our vendor relationships coupled with our best in class merchant organization that allows us to offer our customers the best brands with the most innovation to solve pain points , increased functionality and enhance performance at the best value in the market .\n\nWith that , I'd like to turn the call over to Richard .

Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot's second quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release, in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

For a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release and our website.\nNow, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $45.3 billion, up 4.9% from the same period last year. Comp Sales increased 1% from the same period last year, and comps in the US increased 1.4%. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share were $4.68 in the second quarter, compared to $4.67 in the second quarter last year. In local currency, Canada and Mexico posted positive comps. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations.\nThe momentum that began in the back half of last year continued throughout the first half as we saw our customers engage more broadly in smaller home improvement projects. In fact, the performance across the business was the strongest we've seen in over two years. Our results are a testament to our focus on enhancing the customer experience as we invest in our strategic initiatives. From technology investments that drive productivity to the capabilities we are building with our Pro Ecosystem to better serve complex purchases to faster delivery options for all of our customers, we are growing market share with these initiatives. Just over a year ago, we completed the acquisition of SRS. This strategic acquisition was important for several reasons.\nIt gave us a right to win with a specialty trade Pro, enhanced development of our Pro Ecosystem, and provided a number of cross-selling opportunities. Over the past year, SRS has exceeded our expectations, driving market-leading growth, accelerating our organic ecosystem efforts, and driving revenue synergies. We could not be more pleased with their performance. As we announced in June, we are excited about the pending acquisition of GMS, a leading distributor of specialty building products, including drywall, ceilings, and steel framing related to remodeling and construction projects. This acquisition will add a highly complementary adjacent vertical to SRS's business with differentiated capabilities, product categories, and customer relationships. It will also broaden SRS's distribution footprint across the US and Canada.\nIn fact, SRS will now have a network of more than 1,200 locations, a sales operation of over 3,500 associates, and a fleet of nearly 8,000 trucks capable of making tens of thousands of job site deliveries per day. Additionally, GMS will be additive to our organic efforts to better serve pros working on complex projects, enabling us to offer a deeper and broader assortment of interior building products and services, as well as additional fulfillment options. Despite the uncertainty and volatility in the market, we are confident that we can effectively navigate this environment. Over the last several years, our teams have done an incredible job partnering with our vendors to diversify product sourcing, which gives us unique flexibility in our supply chain. We will continue to work with our vendors to ensure that we have the right products at the right value in stock and on shelf for our customers to purchase. I could not be more excited about the incredible opportunities in front of us to continue growing share with all our customers.\nOur store associates, merchants, supply chain teams, and vendor partners are executing at a high level, and I would like to thank them for all that they do. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior EVP, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Our associates did an incredible job delivering exceptional customer service, and I'd also like to thank them for all that they do. We know that when we enable our associates to focus on serving the customer, we grow sales. Over the last several years, we've been investing in a multitude of initiatives across our operations that not only allow our associates to more effectively serve customers but also drive productivity in our operations. From optimizing freight flow through a proprietary freight flow application to ensuring we have the right products in stock and on the shelf for our customers to enhancing how we pick and stage online orders, we are excited about the progress we're making and the results we are seeing. Our stores continue to be the center of the ecosystem and critical hubs for customers' shopping experience.\nLast year, we made technology improvements across our stores and DFCs to better leverage all of our assets, enabling faster delivery of online orders. We have continued to improve delivery times, and we now have the fastest delivery speeds across the greatest number of products in company history, both same-day and next-day. We are seeing a double-digit lift in spend with customers who utilize our faster delivery options as they return more frequently to shop in stores and online. This is all a result of our efforts to ship from best location, which uses machine learning models to determine the optimal delivery mode to maximize speed and efficiency. To support this incremental demand, we have added more order fulfillment associates or OFAs in our stores. Through enhancements to our HD Phones, we are now able to strategically direct them to more effectively manage online orders.\nFor example, this quarter, we rolled out enhancements to our OFA App that prioritizes orders and enables batch picking of several orders at once. Having dedicated associates for these orders, coupled with powerful technology in their hands, ensures that orders are efficiently and accurately picked, driving faster fulfillment times and higher customer satisfaction. As we've mentioned in the past, we continue to focus on our pro ecosystem, maturing the new capabilities we have built for pros working on complex projects. We're thrilled with the progress we've made across expanded assortments, fulfillment options, our sales teams, account management, and more recently, trade credit and order management. As you know, we've been leveraging SRS to continue to ramp up our trade credit capabilities. Today, we have several thousand pros with a trade credit account, and we've seen a double-digit lift in their spend across channels once these pros started using their trade credit.\nAnd while we continue to roll this out more broadly, we are also focused on ensuring connectivity through our different sales channels, including our B2B website and our stores. For example, we want our pros to be able to transact with our stores seamlessly, including checking and using the available credit on their account while they're shopping in our stores. And later this year, we anticipate that all trade credit customers will be able to seamlessly use trade credit for in-store purchases. Our order management system is another important capability that enables us to more easily manage Pro product deliveries throughout the life of their project. Order management brings together systems and processes that enable us to effectively capture, modify, deliver, and offer post-sale support for Pro orders. And while there's still work to do, we have already deployed a number of benefits.\nIn some markets, we can now reserve inventory, modify orders before fulfillment, and invoice upon delivery. For example, today, we can quickly and easily change an order from will call in a store to delivery to the job site. These are a few of the critical features and benefits we're working on that will deliver exceptional value to our pros. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during Q2, we saw continued momentum in the underlying demand across home improvement-related projects. Our performance was the strongest it has been in over two years. Turning to our merchandising department comp performance for Q2, 12 of our 16 merchandising departments posted positive comps, including storage, bath, hardware, building materials, indoor garden, electrical, kitchen, outdoor garden, millwork, power, plumbing, and appliances.\nDuring Q2, our comp average ticket increased 1.4%, and comp transactions decreased 0.4%. The growth in our comp average ticket primarily reflects a greater mix of higher ticket items, inflation from core commodity categories, including lumber and copper, and a modest decrease in promotional activity relative to prior years. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were +2.6% compared to the second quarter of last year. We were pleased with the performance we saw in categories such as building materials, lumber, and hardware. However, we continued to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the renovation project. During the second quarter, both Pro and DIY comp sales were positive and relatively in line with one another.\nIn the second quarter, we saw strength across many pro-heavy categories like dimensional lumber, concrete, and decking. In DIY, we saw strength across our seasonal product categories, including patio, grills, and live goods. Turning to total company online comp sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 12% compared to the second quarter of last year. We're excited about the continued success we are seeing across our interconnected platforms. As Ann mentioned, our faster delivery speeds are resonating with customers and driving greater engagement and sales. We know that as we remove friction from the experience, we see incremental customer engagement.\nWe also continue to invest in improving service functionality, leveraging AI, and enhanced our buy-it-again capabilities, allowing customers to easily and conveniently reorder products regardless of where the original purchase occurred. During the second quarter, we leaned into products and projects that are resonating with our customers, and we continued to focus on innovation to deliver the best value proposition for home improvement projects while enhancing the customer experience. For example, in Paint, we continue to see the benefits of the investments we are making with products, delivery, and loyalty. You might recall that we are the only home improvement big box retailer to offer KILZ branded primer. We also enhanced our fulfillment options, including our in-store service and job site delivery capabilities with the pro who paints. All of these initiatives have driven continued share gains in the quarter.\nAcross our power department, the strong competitive advantage that we have built with our extensive lineup of battery-powered platforms continues to drive share growth in these categories. In fact, we achieved a company sales record for battery-powered tools during Q2. In our storage department, the team continues to bring new innovation to the market, whether it's our mini totes, the large mega totes, or our improved storage systems. All of these products help drive positive sales and unit comps in the category for the quarter. Finally, we continue to see great success across our appliance business. As we've mentioned before, the improvements we've made to the shopping experience are resonating with our customers.\nAs we look ahead to the third quarter, our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customer's advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when they need it. As we prepare for the holiday season in the back half of the year, we are committed to providing our customers with new and innovative products at a great value. This quarter, we are extremely excited about our lineup for Halloween, as the products bring excitement to our stores and help drive traffic. Our merchants have worked with our supplier partners to put together a compelling assortment of product offerings for this Halloween season, including the return of many fan favorites such as Skelly and Barkley, as well as the new collections for the Halloween enthusiasts. Our sneak preview of our Halloween lineup was a huge success, and we look forward to the full rollout in the coming weeks.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $45.3 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion, or approximately 4.9% from last year. As a reminder, SRS entered our total company comp base in late June. During the second quarter, our total company comps were +1%, with comps of -0.3% in May, flat in June, and +3.1% in July. Comps in the US were +1.4% for the quarter, with comps of +0.3% in May, +0.5% in June, and +3.3% in July. For the quarter, and in local currency, Canada and Mexico posted positive comps.\nAdditionally, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total company comps by approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 33.4%, a slight increase compared to the second quarter of 2024, which was in line with our expectations. During Q2, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 65 basis points to 18.9% compared to Q2 2024. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Our operating margin for Q2 was 14.5% compared to 15.1% in Q2 2024. In Q2, pre-tax intangible asset amortization was $139 million.\nExcluding the intangible asset amortization in Q2, our adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 14.8% compared to 15.3% in Q2 2024. Interest and other expense for Q2 increased by $61 to $550 million, which was in line with our expectations. In Q2, our effective tax rate was 24.2% compared to 24.5% in Q2 fiscal 2024. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.58 compared to $4.60 in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding intangible asset amortization, our Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the second quarter were $4.68, a slight increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. During the second quarter, we opened three new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,353.\nAt the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $24.8 billion, up approximately $1.8 billion compared to the second quarter of 2024, and inventory turns were 4.6x, down from 4.9 times last year. Turning to capital allocation, during the second quarter, we invested approximately $915 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, and during the quarter, we paid approximately $2.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 27.2%, down from 31.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Now I will comment on our outlook for fiscal 2025. As you heard from Ted, our performance during the second quarter was in line with our expectations. The customer engagement we saw in the back half of 2024 continued into the first half of 2025, with notable improvements in underlying demand during the second quarter.\nAs we look to the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to manage through the macroeconomic environment as it stands today. As a result, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2025 guidance. As a reminder, our guidance does not include any assumptions on impacts from the pending GMS acquisition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in the interest rate environment, or a recovery in demand for larger remodeling projects. We expect total sales growth to outpace sales comp, with sales growth of approximately +2.8% and comp sales growth of approximately +1% compared to fiscal 2024. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.4%, essentially flat compared to fiscal 2024. Further, we expect operating margin of approximately 13% and adjusted operating margin of approximately 13.4%.\nOur effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $2.2 billion. We expect our diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 when comparing the 52 weeks in fiscal 2025 to the 53 weeks in fiscal 2024. We expect our Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to decline approximately 2% compared to fiscal 2024. On a 52-week basis, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share would be essentially flat compared to fiscal 2024. We plan to continue investing in our business with capital expenditures of approximately 2.5% of sales for fiscal 2025.\nWe believe that we will grow market share in any environment by strengthening our competitive position with our customers and delivering the best customer experience in home improvement.

One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Starting with the July improvement, and if you view this more of a catch-up due to weather or underlying change in trend, and then as you think about the second half comp, about a 50 basis points improvement implied from Q2, a couple of points on a two-year basis, perhaps we could level set on the drivers across traffic, ticket, pricing, etc., and whether you anticipate any changes there?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Zach. That's a fulsome question. We feel really great about our Q2 performance. As you know, we had really tough weather in the first quarter of the year, leading to relatively flat US comps and slightly negative overall with FX, and recovered here with 1% for the company and 1.4% for the US. As you said, those comps got markedly stronger as the months went on through the quarter. That's really a factor of two things.\nFirst, we definitely saw broader engagement across the portfolio. These are the best comps we've seen across the most departments in nearly two years, as Billy said. The performance adjusted for some of the hurricane activity we saw last year across the regions was consistent. The consumers, both pro and consumer, engaged broadly across the business. Granted, in smaller projects, we still haven't seen the recovery in much larger discretionary projects. Then finally, weather did have a big impact.\nI mean, we had not a great spring overall, and that went into Q2. But in July, in particular, the weather in the north, in particular, really turned favorable, and that team responded, and we captured great sales. So I feel great about underlying momentum in the business, helped by a little weather. When you look at the back half of the year, just focus on the US, and Richard can go into some exchange rate differentials. But when you look at the US, we're looking at just a slight uptick in comp to have that 1% for the full year. So we were just under 1% in the first half.\nDo a little better than 1% in the back half gets us to that 1% guide for the year. So we feel really good about our ability to do that, particularly with the broader engagement across the portfolio. Richard, there's some FX.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSure. Just to tick off what Ted said, so recall when we established guidance at the beginning of the year, our guidance assumed a slight improvement and, frankly, a continuation in the momentum that we had seen in the back half of 2024 to continue gradually through the year 2025. That's what we've seen to date. So that is still embedded in the assumptions underlying our guidance. Just to tick it off, we were a +0.9% in the US in the first half. And as Ted said, we're assuming slight improvement in that trajectory.\nFrom an FX perspective, total company had a 55 basis points headwind from FX in the first half. At current FX rates, that actually flips to a 25 basis points tailwind. So for those reasons, we feel confident in our guide. I think it's also important to note that the momentum that we saw through the second quarter has continued through the first two weeks of the third quarter.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, Richard and Ted, for all the color there. And then just to follow up, there's been a lot more talk about the potential for rate cuts later this year. And we also have some tax reform dynamics as well. So just curious to what extent these could be positive catalysts for your business? And if you have any thoughts on the level of rate cut you'd need to see to begin seeing that impact?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Certainly, some relief on mortgage rates in particular could help. I think referring to it a bit of a frozen housing market with 40-plus-year low turnover rates, and even new starts are struggling a bit. So lower rates would certainly help. We don't have a crystal ball on what that number is. When we talk generally, though, to our customers, each of our sets of consumers and pros, the number one reason for deferring the large project is general economic uncertainty. That is larger than prices of projects, of labor availability, and all the various things we've talked about in the past.\nBy a wide margin, economic uncertainty is number one. And when you look at things like the tax bill passing, last time we were together, we didn't know what tax rates would be, corporate or personal rates. That's all been settled with even some more favorable lowering of taxes, increases in child tax credits, and the like. So, little help on the interest rate front would be helpful. And then I think we have a great result with the tax package that passed, that should put some more discretionary spending in our consumers' wallets.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nJust from a pure cash tax perspective, we will see a benefit from bonus depreciation, full expensing of R&D. That's not a book benefit, but it's a cash tax benefit. We'll be thinking about how that factors into our plans going forward.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on Zach's second question there. Ted, when you think about some of the clarity you've gotten on the tax package and then we're waiting on rates, how does it inform your view on the shape of recovery in that large project activity? As we sit here today, do you think that's something to materialize in the next 12 months?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWell, again, we don't know when those rates will come. There's clearly expectation that we start to get some cuts in the second half of this year. Remember that the short-term rates, while that will help on a HELOC rate, which is often utilized for a larger project, the longer rate is more associated, the mortgage rate is more associated with the 10-year and the longer bond rate. So again, I'm optimistic that with some of the reduction in the overall deficit, that will be the longer, more sustainable benefit to the long-term rates. And we see some progress there. So with lower taxes and now permanent tax position, that uncertainty is removed and with lower rates.\nHard, Steve, to pick the number that unlocks turnover and mobility in US housing and new construction, but things will certainly look better, given tax and interest rates, than the environment we're in right now.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. Understood. And then maybe just for the second half of the year, can you help us think a bit more about AUR and pricing? How did that perform in the quarter? It sounds like promotional activity was down a bit. But just as you think about the second half of the year, the complexion of ticket and transaction, how does pricing fit into that equation?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Steven. This is Billy. Let me give some more color on that. Both kind of the macro piece for us as we think about diversification and those things, and I can give you a little color on some of the Q2 performance that you asked about. But listen, I'd say a couple of things on pricing.\nGoing back to our call in May, first, it's super important to remember that over 50% of our products are sourced domestically and wouldn't be subject to any tariffs. Now, some of the imported goods, obviously, tariff rates are significantly higher today than they were when we spoke in May. So as you'd expect, there'll be some modest price movement in some categories, but it won't be broad-based. And I think it's important to keep in mind as well, our customers tend to shop for the entire project. You think about a small flooring project: tile, the grout, bathtub, and vanity in a bath project. So we're laser-focused on protecting the cost of the entire project.\nListen, our goal is to maintain the best value for our customers. We're going to take a portfolio approach, as we've talked a lot about in the past, as we always do, and we'll have a price leadership position in home improvement. The second piece that you alluded to, some of the dynamics in Q2, when I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some promotional activity, that was really focused around just some of the smaller garden projects. Think mulch, think chemicals, those things. I mean, those were the biggest headwinds that we had as it related to just the transaction comp in the quarter. So that was, if you think about our job, which is to help impact some of the tariff pressure.\nBeing a little less promotional in a couple of those garden areas was just the nature of what we did in Q2. And so again, four of those five categories that we saw an impact from were just related to some of the lower ticket garden projects.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. Understood. Best luck in the second half.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks and good morning. My first question is more near-term than my thoughts, a bit more big picture. Following up on this last line of the question, there are a number of puts and takes in the back half around comp cadence that I'd love for you to talk about. Do you expect much difference between the quarters? It looks like the hurricane lift was pretty similar, but then ticket inflation, given inventory receipts and seasonal, probably accelerates over the year. But on the other side of this, you had this sort of euphoric December post-election with the consumer.\nAny thoughts there on the puts and takes of comp cadence in the back half?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah, Chris, as Richard and I outlined earlier, there's not a big uptick necessary to meet our guide. The US business will be more or less a similar comp rate with no meaningful lift necessary. We get that swing of 80 basis points of FX pressure for total company. On ticket and transactions, you saw higher ticket in Q2 to transactions. As Billy said, that is really the increase in spend on large items where we had a 2.6% comp in tickets over $1,000. Again, that was broad-based. In the lack of a lot of promotional activity in outdoor garden, that tends to be smaller ticket.\nThat mixed effect is what helped the ticket. It really wasn't price. Then similarly, that slight decrease in transactions was all in that modest pullback in outdoor garden promotions. I mean, that explains all of the negative transactions that we saw. So you're going to cycle through the year. We're not planning for any more hurricanes. The hurricane impacts were smaller in Q2 than they were in Q1.\nThey'll be smaller yet again in Q3 and Q4. So we're just looking at the continued momentum broadly in our departments, in our geographies to deliver that 1% guidance.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Then bigger picture on GMS, could you compare and contrast the business relative to the roofing business, which is SRS's largest vertical? From the outside, it seemed to some that GMS is maybe more commodity-oriented and something that perhaps you could have achieved through the expanded fulfillment offering that you have in about 20 markets on the large pro side. Is there something particularly in the assets that you want to acquire that was easier to buy than build? Is it sort of drywall so foundational? And so thus, it's a big part of the market.\nIs it the sales force and so forth? Thanks very much.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nSure. Chris, it's a number of those things. Let me just wind back a minute. As I said, we're super pleased with SRS. Roofing is the biggest category, also pool and landscape. And those are verticals that they run as a specialty trade distributor.\nAnd from what we saw in public company announcements in Q2, we took share. We won in the marketplace in each of those three verticals. And when we look at the opportunity set in our pro initiative, we talk about a game board, different categories and different customers in different purchase occasions, and where are there attractive profit pools and share opportunities. We're building out with our own organic Pro ecosystem a focus on the cross-trade Pro who's going to shop across The Home Depot store, which will increasingly engage with them with an outside sales force and sales trade credit and delivery as we've talked about. But then we've also said, well, there are these verticals of specialty that are very attractive, SRS being incredibly attractive in roofing, pool, and landscape. And drywall and ceiling are very much adjacent complementary verticals to that SRS business model.\nSo small branches, truckload delivery, high inventory turn, effective sales engagement, asset light, similar margins going into, again, largely residential remodel and construction. We believe GMS is the best property, the best asset in that space. And we've been talking to them for some time. Dan Tinker in the SRS team had been in contact with John Turner in the leadership of GMS for some time. This was not something that happened overnight. This is something we've been engaging with them and thinking about how these two businesses could add value working together.\nAnd the management teams, the cultures, the approach to single ERP systems, and go-to-market strategies at the branch level are very, very similar to SRS. We think this will be a seamless integration under that SRS platform. And they'll attack their markets the way they always have, growing the specialty trade business. And then Ann and Mike and our teams, as we build out our pro ecosystem, we have a great new list of larger customers. We have an additional 400 nodes of distribution to add to the 800 that SRS already have. As I said in my remarks, 1,200 additional distribution branches in total.\nIf, when Ann mentioned ship from best location, we'll be leveraging those branches as well, combined with the 2,000 stores. You can start to see this ecosystem that we're putting together with customers, with sales force, with distribution nodes, and with delivery assets. We're just super excited on how we can take incremental share, bringing this unified capability set together.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. I want to follow up, please, on the phrase that Richard, you used in prepared remarks, and then I think Ted said it again, this notable improvement in underlying demand. You qualified it with some commentary around weather. I assume also maybe bathtub effect is the same definition. Can you talk about the degree to which you think there is underlying turning in housing, or was this market share, or was this weather? Are we seeing an inflection?\nThank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Simeon. Well, as we've said, I think our assumption, what we've observed, and the assumption going forward is that first, more than anything, we have a very healthy customer, right? Our customer is the homeowner or the pro that serves that homeowner. They're fully employed. They've seen strong income gains over the past several years. They have seen home price appreciation of 50% since 2019.\nThey're sitting on tappable equity of over $11 trillion, which is double that they were sitting on in 2019. And so as we predicted, we have observed continued engagement and momentum in that engagement across the core of our categories. As Billy spelled out, 12 of 16 categories in positive comp territory, the strongest and broadest performance we've seen in over two years. And that's what we expected, and that's what we've seen. As Ted pointed out, and as we've discussed before, our customers still tell us that the rate environment is giving them pause on larger remodeling projects that would typically require debt financing. Ted alluded to where mortgage rates and HELOC rates are.\nWe know that that is still an impediment in our customers' mindset to executing on projects. What I think is important to note is our pros. We survey every quarter and say that their customers tell them they're deferring projects. They're not canceling projects. Home improvement demand persists. And so our job is to position ourselves to be ready for that.\nAt the same time, our guidance for the remainder of the year, as I said, doesn't assume any improvement in the outlook for larger projects or a turn in housing per se. It really just assumes that consistent momentum that we've already seen really for four quarters now, and that continued in the first two weeks of the quarter.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And a follow-up, can I ask about proof points on complex projects or complex pro? Are you seeing sequential inflections, whether it's some of the core capabilities that Home Depot has implemented or related to crossover benefits from SRS?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah. On your share comment, we believe we're taking share. As I said, we looked at the public company disclosures that reporting of Q2 and how we performed, and that includes paint, roofing, landscape, drywall. We're starting to see some really neat cross synergies on distribution front and on the sales front. And Mike or Ann, if you'd like to comment a little bit about the momentum we're seeing in our organic efforts and then with some of the cross-sell with SRS.\n\nMike Rowe\n\nEVP of Pro, Home Depot\n\nYeah. As Ann mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're pretty thrilled with the progress making as we continue investing in the pro ecosystem, continue to optimize assortments as she talked about, account management, our sales force service model, fulfillment, among other things, notably for that cross-sale pro. So notably, delivery reliability, specifically related to being on time and complete, are paramount for the pro experience. And we're pleased with the improvement that we've seen in terms of the pro's feedback around customer satisfaction with their deliveries, along with our improved performance for being on time and complete. And we see this both for large job site deliveries, notably on flatbeds and box trucks, but also their use of car deliveries. As we've leveraged our distribution assets for faster parcel delivery, we've seen a double-digit lift in spend on parcel items, enabling pros to stay on the job site.\nAnd then just further, with Pro trade credit works hand in hand with the advances we're making with order management and delivery. And again, as Ann noted, seeing strong lift from now being able to invoice on delivery of goods versus upon the purchase of those goods.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys. I guess this is a bit of a follow-up to Simeon's question. You have previously given us some figures on the incremental sales you've been able to generate from your cross pro efforts. Can you update us on that most recent performance? And where you have rolled it out, obviously, you just talked about kind of the wins that are happening. But how should we be thinking about the growth curve in those markets?\nThanks.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nScott, yeah, we're not going to keep updating that billion dollars. We just wanted to—it was a nice hallmark for us to hit the billion dollar mark on incremental sales. But trust me, we are reviewing every week incrementality on all we're doing with the pro initiative. As Mike said, it starts with an engaged sales force. This is solution selling with a mature outside sales force supported with inside sales support. On time and complete delivery is paramount, and that is where we've seen a real step change.\nJohn Deaton and his team on the delivery side from our FDCs. Remember the 17 markets? We have the flatbed distribution centers. We have 20-plus parcel delivery facilities. We have 200-plus market delivery operations, which are for big and bulky product and appliances. Ann mentioned the ship from best location.\nWe're leveraging stores as well. So we're putting all those nodes into an opportunity set to optimize delivery for the customer, from which node is going to have the quickest delivery time at the lowest cost, at the greatest chance of being on time and complete for the customer. That's all the machine learning and AI we're putting into effect to make that happen. We've seen step-change improvement in our on-time and complete delivery. That's giving our sales team more confidence to sell. That's keeping retaining customers who tried us once and liked us, try us again, we satisfy them again.\nNow you add trade credit to the equation. It's still such early days with trade credit, and we have millions of pro customers, and we literally have small single-digit thousands on trade credit. So this virtuous cycle of this whole ecosystem trying to work is gaining steam. The great thing about having someone like SRS and then doing all the diligence in the work with GMS, we actually understand that part of the business is behaving like a distributor. We are satisfying these larger pros in their complex purchase occasions as we need to, as a true professional wholesale deliverer. So super excited and the momentum is building.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nAppreciate that. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Over the last several years, Home Depot has taken some big swings, made some big calls, including building the pro ecosystem, buying SRS, and now GMS. Are these calls driven by something that you are seeing that is changing in the home improvement market or something that's changing in The Home Depot that's prompting the need to take bigger calls in order to gain market share? And as part of this, how do you weigh the potential trade-off between growth and returns in these capital allocation decisions, or is that just a moot point because Home Depot is going to be able to achieve both in a robust recovery situation in the next few years? Thank you very much.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nGreat question, Michael. I'd also add what we've done with e-commerce and the big swing we've done building out the distribution centers.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood point. Good point. Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nOur e-commerce, which has taken tremendous share. I'll let Richard talk about trade-off returns. As we've said, we look at this game board and this opportunity set of where their profit pools and where we can satisfy the customer. But we're always looking customer back as we went into this. And what we're told by our Pro customers, they're dealing with so many different suppliers. They're dealing with 20, 30, 50 different suppliers on a job site.\nIf we can make their job easier to take out five different sales calls, five other delivery trucks, five other invoice payment cycles, that is making their business easier. And that is our value proposition, is that you can get a lot more from one supplier. We'll never get 100% of someone's spend or even 100% of someone's spend in a particular category. But the more we can consolidate activity for them, particularly on a job site in the selling cycle and the billing and payment cycle, that's our value proposition. And that's where they told us we have a right to win, and they're interested in that. I'd also say that there is some consolidation. There's consolidation on the manufacturer side, on the distributor side, and even the customer side.\nAnd scale matters. And we've always been the scale player, and not in the pro wholesale type activity, but certainly in home improvement. And we're satisfying that scale game as well. And we think the returns, you get there in a different way, but Richard, the return profile is attractive.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nAbsolutely. So when we think about capital allocation, as we've always told you, we invest in our business first. And that's what we've leaned into in these last few years. We view our goal here is to drive sales growth through driving share capture, which then drives EPS growth. We have to do that in concert with creating shareholder value. And so that's when returns come.\nWe understand, first of all, just on the TAM and the share capture perspective, we've seen an increased TAM, but we've also increased our TAM through the acquisition of SRS, and then GMS would further increase that TAM. So we have one of the most attractive, addressable markets in the, I call it the US consumer economy, North American consumer economy, and it starts there. Second, as Ted said, we're the scale player in that market. And so we have tremendous opportunities, and we feel like it's our responsibility to put ourselves in a unique position to win share. So now let's talk about returns. Simply put, when we find an investment that allows us to drive share capture and drive earnings growth that drives a return higher than our cost of capital with a little bit of a margin of safety built in, we're going to make that investment.\nAnd so you've seen us lean into a variety of investments over the last five years. What might surprise you is that many of these investments are more capital-light and have a higher return profile than some of our more conventional investments. I'll give you two examples. When you think about an SRS branch, comparatively speaking, the capital required and then the return on that capital through time is actually lower capital required on a percent of sales basis than a Home Depot store would be. And the return on that capital actually comes more quickly than it does at a Home Depot store. And by the way, we think that a Home Depot store is one of the most rock-solid investments we can make, which is why we've leaned into that program.\nSo SRS, wholesale distribution, a capital-light model. Second, our DFCs. If you take our DFCs and you look at where they are on their maturity curve, they're actually generating higher returns on invested capital than an equivalent Home Depot store would at this point in their life cycle. Again, if you're using the benchmark, a Home Depot store to us is almost like buying treasuries. I mean, that is as close to the most confident return we can drive in this business. And the incremental investments we're making, I'll argue, are positioned to drive higher returns on that capital. Now, if you look at it in the earlier stages of investment, ROIC is lower in the earlier stages.\nIn the later stages of that same investment, it's higher. We're simply ascribing to the fact that we have an opportunity to position ourselves like no one else in our trillion-dollar total addressable market to win and win over the long term.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you very much for that. My quick follow-up is the decision to reduce promotional activity during the quarter was tied to the tariff situation. So A, how do you expect this to unfold? It's likely that tariffs are going to be with us for a while. Does that mean Home Depot's posture around promotional activity will be reduced?\nAnd B, how do you expect this to impact the P&L over the next few quarters? And what have you assumed that within your guidance? Thank you very much.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Michael. As I mentioned a little bit earlier to Steven's question, we did pull back. Again, those were primarily in the outside garden space, which caused some of that transaction comp noise that I mentioned. I mean, listen, The Home Depot is an EDLP retailer. So anything that we can do to continue to drive value for our customers in this marketplace and going forward.\nYou're right. The tariffs have been increased since we met in May. That's all in our go-forward guidance. So listen, we feel great about the values. I mentioned holiday. We have many things coming up in the back half of the year.\nWe'll talk a little bit more in Q3 about our gift center and all the things that we'll have there. We're going to continue to be focused on EDLP and taking market share. We love our price position as it stands today, and we look forward to partnering even closer with our supplier partners and continuing to drive that value for customers. And believe me, there'll be plenty of great opportunities for our consumers, our customers every day in our stores now through the back half of the year.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and good luck.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Home Depot\n\nChristine, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Gordon Haskett",
    "content2": "Hey, thanks very much. My question is for Billy on category performance. I was hoping you could maybe double-click on the areas where the business has most notably improved. You guys have called out 12, but of the 16 categories, that's the best breadth of performance, I think, since the second quarter of 2022. So maybe just click on the categories a little bit, and then also regionally, any callouts in the quarter.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. No, happy to talk through that. It's great, Chuck. As you mentioned, we called out 12 of our 16 departments posted positive comps. We actually had 13 in the US with some FX pressure and pain. But really, it was the broader-based performance that, as I mentioned, the strongest we've seen in over two years. So I called out some of the seasonal pieces, patio, live goods, and barbecue, but just to give some color on some of the other businesses. And I know Richard talked about this being much more broad-based. But if you think about our portable power business, our cleaning business, dimensional lumber, concrete, water heaters, vanities, interior paint. And in fact, the largest comp contributions to the quarter were really outside of seasonal. And of course, we saw pickup. Ted mentioned the north picking up.\nCertainly, more traffic in our stores drives more projects as well. But it was really broad-based across the business, not only the 12 departments, but I gave you some color around just what we're seeing inside some of those what we consider really core home improvement projects that are just outside of, obviously, your typical when spring comes and you sell a little bit more of the garden space. We're really, really pleased, thrilled with the work that the merchant team has done along with our supply chain folks. Just incredible work. Really excited about the back half of the year and more of the broad-based impact that we're seeing.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nThat's great. And then my follow-up just for Richard on gross margins, flat year over year. Can we just talk about the moving parts in the quarter? How are you thinking about the cadence in the back half? And then zooming out, I think this will be the third straight year. Gross margins will be around 33.4%.\nI guess how you're thinking about that line item in the out years. Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nRight. Well, we'll keep our comments to this year. Gross margin, we got it at the beginning of the year that it's going to be essentially flat at 33.4%. You're not going to see a lot of movement in that line item other than seasonal swing, a little bit that we always see. So we've reaffirmed guidance at that level. Then we'll address future years when we get together in December.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ms. Janci, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Home Depot\n\nThank you. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVice President, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot's Q1 2025 Earnings Call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call investor relations at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and return on invested capital. For a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for Q1 were $39.9 billion, up 9.4% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 0.3% from the same period last year, and comps in the US increased 0.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.56 in Q1, compared to $3.67 in Q1 last year. Our Q1 results were in line with our expectations, despite unfavorable weather in February and unplanned pressure from foreign exchange rates. In local currency, Canada posted comps below the company average, while Mexico posted positive comps. The momentum in the business during the back half of fiscal 2024 continued into Q1. Our customers engaged across smaller projects and in our spring events.\nOur associates remained focused in the quarter, and we feel great about our store readiness and product assortment as spring continues to break across the country. Let me take a moment to comment on our global sourcing strategy. Today, more than 50% of our purchases are sourced in the United States. Over the last several years, we have worked diligently with our vendors to further diversify our global supply chain. During that period, the vast majority of our supplier partners developed diversified sourcing strategies across several countries, including the United States. As a result, we now have tremendous sourcing flexibility. We are already taking action and anticipate that 12 months from now, no single country outside of the United States will represent more than 10% of our purchases. Our team has effectively navigated many economic cycles.\nWe believe we have the best merchants, supply chain, and finance teams with exceptional tools to help us understand cost impacts by country at the SKU level. We also have robust product and project elasticity models at the market level, and we have strategic vendor partners who understand the need to deliver the right value proposition to our customers. We remain bullish on the fundamentals of home improvement and are confident that we are best positioned to win. We operate in a highly fragmented, addressable market of approximately $1 trillion, and our consumer, the homeowner, remains healthy. For most people, their home is their biggest asset, and home prices continue to rise. This has led to record levels of home equity, giving our customers confidence to invest in their homes. The housing stock is aging, and 55% of homes are 40 years or older.\nWe know that as homes get older, they require more maintenance and updates. We will continue investing in our business to ensure we are best positioned to gain market share, particularly in periods of disruption. Our associates have never been more engaged and ready to serve our customers. You'll hear more from Ann in a moment, but we remain focused on our associates because we know that if we take care of our associates, they will take care of the customer, and everything else will take care of itself. We're also focused on maturing our Pro ecosystem to better serve pros working on large, complex projects. SRS is now managing our trade credit program, and we are seeing tremendous results as we onboard pros to the program. SRS continues to perform above our expectations as our teams work together to gain share.\nDespite the continued pressure and volatility across the market, our merchants, store and vet teams, and supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job serving our customers. I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work, and also our thoughts are with those impacted by the severe storms and tornadoes yesterday. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior EVP, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ted, we continue to invest in our business with a focus on taking care of our associates and customers. We know that having the best customer shopping experience in home improvement makes a significant difference and drives sales. Our stores are at the heart of the Home Depot experience, and our associates' deep product and project knowledge differentiates us from our competitors. Customers come to the Home Depot to solve their home improvement problems and build their dreams, and it is our job to consistently deliver the best interconnected shopping experience. To do that, we must be laser-focused on our associates, ensuring that we are providing the tools they need to continue to be engaged, knowledgeable, and ready to serve our customers.\nOur business isn't unique in that it provides our customers with what we refer to as a Three-Legged Stool: having the best assortment, value, and exceptional customer service. And we are continuously reinforcing that with our teams. One way we do this is at our store managers' meeting, which we held in March. That's where we celebrate the hard work and dedication of our 2,300+ store leaders and 200 distribution center general managers, among others. It is a fantastic event that reminds our leaders of what really matters: delivering a high level of service. And we do this by creating a learning environment that empowers our associates with the knowledge and tools to have the confidence to sell. To do this, we are continuing to leverage existing tools like PocketGuide, an application on the HD Phone that provides extensive product knowledge, including tutorials and how-to guides.\nWe're also investing in additional training opportunities. This quarter, we launched a certification for live goods associates, providing them a deeper level of localized product knowledge to drive incremental sales during our biggest selling season. We are introducing new tools using generative AI that leverages our internal data and deep knowledge base to provide store associates quick access to operational and product knowledge via their HD Phone. These tools, coupled with a multitude of other investments to drive better service, on-shelf availability, and better insights into our customers' projects, help us win with all of our customers, DIYs, and pros. Recently, we conducted our annual Voice of the Associates survey, which showed improvement scores, particularly in development. It is clear that as we invest more broadly in our associates, including through tools and education, we continue to see record retention rates, better engagement, and improved customer service.\nI am so excited about all we are doing for our associates to help them better serve customers and ultimately drive increased customer satisfaction and sales. Our amazing associates continue to go above and beyond to serve our customers regardless of the external environment, and I want to thank them for all that they do. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. In particular, and as you heard from Ted, we are well-positioned to navigate the current macroeconomic environment. Our best-in-class merchants, supply chain, and finance teams provide us with a competitive advantage and continue to position us for success. Their knowledge base and the tools that they have developed over the years provide us with visibility at the SKU level to help inform our global sourcing strategy. This deep business understanding, coupled with a strong collaboration with our vendor partners, is what enables us to move quickly to accelerate sourcing diversification.\nTurning to our Q1 results, as you heard from Ted, our performance during the Q1 was in line with our expectations despite unfavorable weather that impacted February. As the weather improved throughout the quarter, we experienced similar engagement compared to what we saw in the back half of fiscal 2024, with customers taking on smaller home improvement-related projects. However, the higher interest rate environment continues to pressure larger remodeling projects. In the Q1, six of our 16 merchandising departments posted positive comps, including appliances, plumbing, indoor garden, electrical, outdoor garden, and building materials. During the Q1, our comp average ticket was essentially flat, and comp transactions decreased 0.5%. Inflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket by approximately 30 basis points, driven by inflation in lumber and copper.\nAdditionally, during the quarter, we continued to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big-ticket comp transactions for those over $1,000 were positive 0.3% compared to Q1 of last year. We were pleased with the performance we saw in categories such as building materials, lumber, and hardware. However, we continued to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the project, such as kitchen and bath remodels. During Q1, Pro-comp sales were positive and outpaced the DIY customer. In Q1, we saw strength across many Pro-heavy categories like gypsum, decking, concrete, and siding. Turning to total company online comp sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 8% compared to Q1 of last year.\nWe continue to invest in enhancing our Interconnected Experience, and this quarter, we continued to lean into marketing our speed of delivery that is resonating with our customers. Those customers benefiting from faster delivery are engaging more and spending more with us across our categories. Additionally, during the back half of last year, we began rolling out a new feature on our website called Magic Apron, a Generative AI tool that helps customers find the answers they need related to their home improvement projects. Whether summarizing product reviews or answering live questions with our proprietary expertise, Magic Apron has seen strong customer engagement contributing to growth and online conversion. Our customers have always relied on the expertise of our associates in our stores to answer questions and help them solve problems.\nMagic Apron is designed to bring that same expertise to the digital world, leveraging our proprietary knowledge base to support our customers and give them the confidence to tackle their home improvement projects anytime, anywhere. In Q1, we were extremely pleased to announce an expanded relationship with Behr to exclusively offer KILZ-branded primer products in the United States. With our new exclusive agreement, the Home Depot will become the only home improvement big-box retailer to offer KILZ-branded primer products, including KILZ Original, All-Purpose, Premium, Restoration, and more problem-solving primer products and aerosols. This new exclusive agreement will deepen our relationship with our pro customers, allowing us to continue to gain share in this important space. During Q1, we also hosted our annual Spring Black Friday and Spring Gift Center events and saw strong performance across both events.\nOur merchants did a fantastic job curating the best products, and we saw strong engagement with our customers throughout the events. We're pleased with the results we saw, particularly in categories like appliances, power tools, grills, and paint. As we look forward to Q2, we are ready for spring across all our product categories. Our live goods look incredible, with everything from shrubs to a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables for every type of gardener. Our merchants partner each year with global, regional, and local breeders to make sure we have the right plants with the right attributes to ensure that our customers will have success in their gardens. The innovation we continue to bring in this space helps bring gardening confidence, creating brand loyalty, while also putting our customers in a position to succeed in their gardens.\nWe're excited about spring breaking across the country, and we remain ready to help our customers with all of their outdoor projects and outdoor living needs. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the Q1, total sales were $39.9 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion, or approximately 9.4% from last year. During the Q1, our total company comps were -0.3%, with comps of -3.6% in February, +0.6% in March, and +1.1% in April. Comps in the US were +0.2% for the quarter, with comps of -3.3% in February, +1.3% in March, and +1.8% in April. For the quarter, and in local currency, Mexico posted positive comps, whereas Canada was below the company average. Additionally, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total company comps by approximately 70 basis points for the quarter.\nIn the Q1, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of approximately 35 basis points from the Q1 of last year, reflecting a change in mix as a result of the SRS acquisition, partially offset by benefits from lower shrink and supply chain productivity. During the Q1, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 70 basis points to 20.9% compared to the Q1 of 2024. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Our operating margin for the Q1 was 12.9% compared to 13.9% in the Q1 of 2024. In the quarter, pre-tax intangible asset amortization was $139 million.\nExcluding the intangible asset amortization in the quarter, our adjusted operating margin for the Q1 was 13.2% compared to 14.1% in the Q1 of 2024. Interest and other expense for the Q1 increased by $163 to 591 million due primarily to higher debt balances than a year ago. In the Q1, our effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 22.6% in the Q1 of fiscal 2024.\nOur diluted earnings per share for the Q1 were $3.45 compared to $3.63 in the Q1 of 2024. Excluding intangible asset amortization, our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Q1 were $3.56, a decrease of approximately 3% compared to the Q1 of 2024. During the Q1, we opened three new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,350. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $25.8 billion, up approximately $3.3 billion compared to the Q1 of 2024, and inventory turns were 4.3x, down from 4.5x last year. Turning to capital allocation, during the Q1, we invested approximately $800 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. During the quarter, we paid approximately $2.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders.\nComputed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 31.3%, down from 37.1% in the Q1 of fiscal 2024. Now, I will comment on our outlook for fiscal 2025. Excluding the unplanned FX rate pressure, our performance during the Q1 was in line with our expectations. The customer engagement we saw in the back half of 2024 continued into the Q1 and through the first two weeks of the Q2. In addition, we are confident that we will be able to effectively navigate the environment as it stands today.\nAs a result, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2025 guidance. We expect total sales growth to outpace sales comp, with sales growth of approximately 2.8% and comp sales growth of approximately positive 1% compared to fiscal 2024. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.4%, essentially flat compared to fiscal 2024. Further, we expect operating margin of approximately 13% and adjusted operating margin of approximately 13.4%. This primarily reflects natural deleverage from sales and continued investments across the business, as well as reflecting the mixed impact from the SRS acquisition. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $2.2 billion.\nWe expect our diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 when comparing the 52 weeks in fiscal 2025 to the 53 weeks in fiscal 2024.We expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 2% compared to fiscal 2024. On a 52-week basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share would be essentially flat compared to fiscal 2024. We plan to continue investing in our business with capital expenditures of approximately 2.5% of sales for fiscal 2025. We believe that we will grow market share in any environment by strengthening our competitive position with our customers and delivering the best customer experience in home improvement. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So there was a lot of noise out there with the weather, which you called out, perhaps some CNN effect given the news cycle. So I wanted to get more insights on how you would characterize the overall demand environment. Do you think there was any uncertainty impact of sales trends in Q1 that could actually be understating the actual momentum in the business? And then more broadly, with respect to the momentum that emerged in the back half of last year, as we think about an environment where existing home sales is flat, wouldn't replacement cycles portend acceleration from the trends that you exited 2024 with, especially if there's a tick up in inflation?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nHey, good morning, Chris. Thanks for that question. Let me just raise up a bit as how we see overall consumer, and then drill down a little bit into that specific question. I think from the macro, the worst concerns I think have passed. We've gone from a dynamic of where we were going to have a near certain recession and stock market correction in early April to where today stock markets fully recovered. Recession expectations are way down in the past month. Morning Consult just came out with their daily consumer sentiment tracking that showed significant improvement just in the last two weeks. We know unemployment remains low. PCE grew nicely in April after a very strong March print, and inflation is trending down toward 2% in April. Home prices also continue to increase nationally.\nBut as you said, with interest rates and mortgage rates remaining stubbornly high, housing turnover has remained at decades-long lows, and starts are flat. So you would think you've heard us talk before with so much home equity built up. Our consumer has a job, increasing wages, increases of home equity are up as much as 50% since the end of 2019. Why haven't we seen the larger remodeling cycle, particularly as people stay in their homes? And again, we've cited the increased engagement in Q4 of 2024 and how that continued into Q1 2025, but we've yet to see that large project.\nThe large project generally requires some sort of financing. And while there are literally trillions of dollars of equity available to be tapped in the homes, I think there's still enough macro uncertainty. And again, those stubbornly high interest rates that people are painting again and working in their yards and doing smaller projects, but just have not engaged in the larger projects. Now, obviously, we think that will increase. We cited last quarter that we're at now a net cumulative shortfall of about $50 billion of home improvement spend on housing. So we're very much looking forward to it as much as you are when people tap their equity, gain the stronger macro confidence, and engage in those bigger projects.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Then my follow-up on the SG&A line. SG&A, I think, grew 12% year-over-year this quarter. That was a pretty sizable step up from the underlying growth rate of the past few quarters. Can you talk about was there anything one-time in that that maybe the street missed? How are you thinking about SG&A growth as the year progresses? Thanks very much.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. So we did, as we've said, operating expenses can show a little bit of variability from quarter to quarter. In this case, we're overlapping a legal settlement of some size in Q1 of last year. So that did have an impact. You also have to remember we're adding the SRS expenses to our expense base that didn't exist in Q1 of last year. And so when you take that noise out, we levered expenses exactly how we would have expected to in a comp environment like this. Our operators are managing their portfolios exactly how we would hope.\nAnd frankly, kicking up to the cost of goods sold, if I may just for a moment call out our incredible merchants, supply chain, and operations teams who, again, show us great results in supply chain productivity and in shrink results. So for the remainder of the year, just kind of zooming back out, we've reaffirmed guidance. Let me just kind of reorient you to the year-over-year expectation. So year-over-year, 2024 to 2025, operating margin will decline from 13.8% to 13.4%. About 20 basis points of that is from what you would expect natural deleverage, right? We typically leverage it around three points of comp. So if you say at one point of comp, we've got kind of two points of deleverage headwind.\nTwo times about 10 basis points each gives you about 20 basis points of deleverage. So that's 20 of the 40. Then 15 of the 40 is the partial year-over-year impact of SRS. We will own SRS 12 months this year. We owned them for about seven months last year. So that 15 is the year-over-year impact. Think of the fully annualized impact of SRS, just mixed impact being around 40 basis points to adjusted operating margin. But the year-over-year is 15. So that's 20 from deleverage, 15 from SRS, and the remaining five is caused by going from a 53rd week year to a 52-week year. Underlying all that, we are generating fantastic productivity, which we are reinvesting in the business to put ourselves in position to take share in any environment.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Have a great rest of spring.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I want to follow up on the comp guidance for the year. The April exit and then May commentary sounds good. You're close to two. SRS will kick up, I think, at some point in the Q2. And I also think the back half was always expected to be a little bit better than the first half. So, curious what if there's any added caution or just prudence in how you're setting it up. You could get to one and a half to two. I'm not trying to get you on that. But if trends that you're seeing today hold, you should do a little bit better maybe than the guidance, or is there some extra caution you're putting in with housing? Thanks.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSimeon, thank you for the question. We're one quarter in. The team did an awesome job of hitting our expectations, but for the FX pressure, which was $270 million, sorry, $275 million dollars at the top line. Without that FX pressure, we would have exceeded our own expectations. But we're a quarter in. We feel good about the business heading into Q2. But right now, we feel good about reaffirming our guidance where it is.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. I'll follow up on sales related to SRS. Can you talk about how much of a catalyst either order management or trade credits have been or are starting to be? And then, within that, if you're willing to share the relative strength of SRS's businesses between roofing, pool, and landscape? Thanks.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nHey, Simeon. We're super pleased with SRS's performance. If you just look at their growth by the three verticals they operate in, we exceeded our expectation. We believe they're taking share in each of those three verticals. So couldn't be happier with SRS. They are operating per their playbook of organic growth made up of comp branch growth, opening new branches, and tuck-in acquisitions. And that is active in all three verticals. Then in terms of how they're helping us on our Pro ecosystem, the main thing they're working on right now is the Trade Credit Program. So as we talked about the six broad capabilities of delivery, salesforce, pricing, and order management, etc., credit is a key component of that ecosystem.\nAnd as we started to build out that capability in-house, we said, \"Well, geez, SRS, that's their business model.\" They have 90,000+ accounts on trade credit. They have an extraordinarily capable set of managers and team members running that program for them. So we just said, \"Rather than build it ourselves here in Atlanta, let's let SRS build that for us and run our credit out of Dallas,\" which they're doing. So we're still very early days. We're in the thousands of accounts onboarded to a credit program with our Home Depot Core Pro. And like every bit of our capabilities, as our pros engage in the new capabilities, whether it's to be assigned a sales representative, engage in delivery, and now in this case, attaining a line of credit, we see accelerating comp.\nSo really happy with how this is going and look forward to increased growth as we onboard more customers. Remember, we have millions of Pro customers. I'm not saying we're going to have millions of accounts anytime soon, but we're in the low single-digit thousands of onboarded accounts on our way to millions.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nJust one thing on the specific verticals, we feel great about performance across all three.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Thanks. Have a great spring.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. My first question is on tariffs. So a little less than 50% of your sales are coming from outside of the US. There's currently anywhere from a 10% to 30% tariff on those goods. So if we assume a blended rate of 20% and The Home Depot is absorbing half of that, it would mean on average that's going to be about a 5% tariff on your cost of goods.\nHow is The Home Depot approaching that from a pricing standpoint? And if we assume you're generally pricing steady, does that offset or absorb some of the productivity, supply chain, and shrink benefits that would potentially accrue to shareholders over the next few years that it potentially would not materialize now given they'll need to be used to offset the cost increases? Thank you.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nWell, good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. So listen, you hit on a couple of the things that Ted mentioned in his prepared remarks. It's important, but over 50% of our purchases are sourced in the US, as you've mentioned. And we've been working with our suppliers for years. I mean, one of the hallmarks of Home Depot has always been diversification and diversifying with their supply chain. So during that time, a majority of our suppliers have diversified their sourcing strategies across several countries. We've got tremendous flexibility here. I can't emphasize that enough. We're already taking action, moving quickly. And we anticipate 12 months from now that no single country outside of the US will actually represent more than 10% of our purchases.\nAnd so you think about our scale, the great, tremendous partnerships, I can't reiterate those enough that we have with our suppliers, and you mentioned productivity, a hallmark of the Home Depot we see in our business. We intend to generally maintain pricing across our portfolio. We'll continue to use the portfolio approach that we've talked a lot about in the past. But we don't see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward. It's a great opportunity for us to take share, and it's a great opportunity for our suppliers to take share as well.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nJust to clarify, Billy, does that mean you will have to subsidize what would have been price increases with some of the other benefits that would have accrued to the gross margin otherwise?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nListen, we have a number of different levers that we have in the portfolio, Michael. You mentioned a few of those. We have a number of different levers, including productivity. And the other thing I would keep in mind is that if you think about our line structure today, there's items that we have that could potentially be impacted from a tariff that, candidly, we won't have going forward if it doesn't make sense inside the line structure. So it's a little bit less about the item and the percentages that you mentioned and more about the line structure and how we'll manage that going forward.\nAnd there'll be some things that don't make sense that just end up going away. So if you think about it that way, really a limited impact from that standpoint. Our suppliers, along with our teams, have done a terrific job diversifying their global supply chains. This is not new to The Home Depot. It's always been something that we've worked closely with our suppliers on. We feel good about all the productivity and the other things that we have in our arsenal to manage that accordingly for our customers.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot you. My follow-up question is on Ted's comment that there could be $50 billion of deferred demand in home improvement. If we just simply apply Home Depot's market share of around 25% to that number, that would be $10 to 15 billion of deferred demand that Home Depot could experience over the next few years, either as rates come down or as the consumer just comes in off the sidelines because a matter of time passes. Why shouldn't we think about that as providing an outsized benefit to Home Depot's sales growth over the next few years above and beyond the 3% to 4% top line growth that is inherent in your algorithm? Thank you so much.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWell, that's certainly our expectation that that's exactly the type of share opportunity as we continue to dial in the Core Orange Box business, servicing the DIY and the Pro, and then all the capabilities that we're building to capture more share of wallet with the larger Pro. That would absolutely be the upside case where we're taking more share, Michael. And that's exactly what we hope to do. We'll talk more about that in December at our investor conference.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nUnderstood. Thank you so much and good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Last quarter, you provided some extra comments on the 17 markets where you had extra capabilities rolled out for the complex Pro. Can we get an update on what capabilities are kind of rolled out where and then any more color on the relative performance of those markets? Thanks.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nSo, Scot, there are no additional markets. So we're in 17 markets with our, and the distinction of the 17 markets, again, is where we have a flatbed distribution center. Now, we're delivering in all markets as we've done for years. But again, the distinction there is that we have a separate facility. We've just continued to make progress. So the sales team continues to mature. Our pricing schemes continue to mature. Delivery, our on-time and complete scaled delivery has never been better. And by the way, that is with the consumer DIY parcel business to the big and bulky deliveries out of our stores as well as out of our multiple distribution facilities, our MDOs, market delivery operations, our DFCs, and our FDCs.\nWe've never been in a better in-stock, in on-time, and complete delivery with the fastest speed of all time in our delivery rates. The last and maybe longest hole in the tent is finishing up the IT work on order management and account management. As I said, the credit program is built and we're onboarding just early days there, and will be finishing up throughout 2025 the last initial build of the technology work to build more agile order management. And then that should only improve our on-time, complete, and speed metrics.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Thank you for that. And then, Richard, can you just comment on the expectations regarding SRS getting layered into the comp kind of mid-Q2, kind of how you guys are thinking about that for the balance of the year? Thanks, guys.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYes. So we closed on the acquisition of SRS mid-June last year. So they will enter our comp base shortly, and we'll own them for a little more than seven months this year. Once they enter the comp base, we will report them as part of total company comp. So our US comp that we report is principally our retail operations and reflects those. We have historically reported HD Supply, for instance, not in US comp but in total company comp to give you that clean look of the US retail business. So SRS will be treated similarly.\nThey will not be reported as part of US comp. They will be reported as part of total company comp. We expect them, so look, for the quarter, SRS actually exceeded our expectations. They delivered $2.6 billion in sales. And we expect them to meet our expectations of mid-single-digit growth for the year. We're looking forward to continued growth with them. That acquisition is one to be proud of. We're making, as Ted said, a lot of progress with SRS.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. So first one on the inventory, which looks to be up about 15% this quarter, can you just help us understand how much of that was driven by SRS in the base? And has there been any pull forward of inventory? And more broadly speaking, how do you feel about your inventory positioning ahead of the summer and more forward looking into the holidays? Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you. We feel great about our inventory position. We are at in-stock levels as good as they've ever been. But a little bit behind the numbers. First, recall, SRS was not reflected in our Q1 balance sheet last year. So the majority of the increase year-over-year in inventory is simply from adding the SRS inventory into our base. We also made investments, though, as we saw gains from our speed initiative online and in our supply chain.\nAnd we saw momentum in that part of our business and that customer experience. We began heavier load-ins in our DCs to take advantage of that customer momentum. And so the inventory position is right where we want to be. Really no pull forward here. And if you think about, Billy, maybe you want to talk a little bit about spring and how that works. Yeah.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nI mean, this is our Super Bowl season, Q2 specifically. So as Richard mentioned, we did not pull forward any inventory. Having said that, all of our goods for really the season, I'll think of the first half of our business, depending on where it breaks across the country, has been in our DC's, in our network. It's a little bit slower, as we mentioned, in February. That's caught back up. But all of that inventory has landed well before the fiscal year started. So we feel great about our position.\nWe mentioned our in-stock rates have never been better. Really thrilled with that. Thanks to our suppliers again for great work there. But we feel we're in a great position as it relates to the biggest part of our year coming up. Then we talked about speed and how that's working for us with our customers. Really pleased with the performance there. We've continued to invest in our DFC network as we know speed is the key metric to conversion. We're really pleased with the productivity we're getting out of that inventory as well.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you. A quick follow-up. In terms of the acceleration in comps over the course of Q1, was there any Easter timing shift impacted there? And are you seeing the exit rate continuing in May? Thank you again.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThere absolutely was an Easter timing shift that, if you add to April, it benefited March to the detriment of April. And so if you adjust for that Easter week shift, April would have been closer to 2.5% comp in the US than our reported comp.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zachary Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZachary Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Following up on pricing, as it sounds like you've got the levers at your disposal to hold pricing and margins relatively consistent. But when you think about the industry and your competitors, is it fair to say in that scenario that your price spreads versus your peers would widen? And then when you look at your elasticity models, is there a specific level of tariff that would preclude you or the industry from being able to hold price constant?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Zack. I'm not going to speak to our competitive set and what they're going to do with retails, as I mentioned a few minutes ago. We feel very good about our position in terms of where we are, diversification, and all the things that I mentioned there. We are always testing elasticity models in this environment and every environment. We have a great team with our merchants and obviously with our finance partners. And we're always testing those elasticity models in any environment. We'll do the same here as we've done every other time. But as it relates to our price positioning versus the market, I wouldn't speculate on that. We just feel great about our position. We've got the best merchants, supply chain, and finance teams.\nWe've got tremendous models down to the SKU level and where all of our assortments are and where they're going from a diversification standpoint. I'd say that we feel very confident about our price position, as I mentioned.\n\nZachary Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo",
    "content2": "Got it. And then, Richard, from an accounting perspective, you're under the retail inventory method. So just want to make sure that there's no change in the way we should think about your gross margin. And if there's any puts and takes, we should keep in mind as the tariff-driven costs flow through your P&L and how that will get recognized as you match that with sales.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWe are on the Retail Inventory Method. Look, you will see a little bit of variability reflecting, you know, changes in retail where that happens, markups where that happens. But there's really not anything significant to call out quarter to quarter for us.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Thanks for the time.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nRemember, our retail's moved in ordinary course. So in any quarter, you're going to see the effect of price changes, right, in that retail math method.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nThanks, Richard.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the housing backdrop and if you could elaborate on regional performance in the period. I'm curious what you're seeing in markets where maybe housing activity has softened a bit, where home prices have softened. I guess if we do see home prices weaken, does that matter as much as maybe in the past, just given where home equity is versus history? Thanks so much.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Tough to prescribe, Seth, the exact dynamic there. But there are a couple of markets that we saw a slight softening, but we've not seen any change in sales associated with that. This time of year, as you can imagine, weather is the dominant determinant of a particular region's performance. So nothing yet on any price changes in housing impacting the business.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Got it. And then as you think about the demand outlook, your business has been improving modestly in Q4 and then again the last several months. If you look out, even as you're not raising prices, it seems like a lot of other companies are going to be raising prices, even outside of the home improvement category. There's a growing concern that that's going to weigh on the consumer. It's going to weigh on spending power. How do you think about that? Do you see that as a risk to the outlook that you've laid out here? Thanks so much.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWell, I think there was a lot of talk of demand destruction, what I mentioned earlier in an earlier question, that if there was a significant shock to the economy and expectation of recession and overall demand destruction. I think we're well past that now. If there is some share of wallet dynamic due to raising prices in other sectors of the economy, we'll be watching that very closely. But again, the thing to keep in mind is we have a very different customer and a very different sort of use case for expenditure in home improvement. So our customer, from a broad basis, is one of the strongest in the economy. The average income's $110,000. 80% of our customers own their homes.\nWe've talked about how much home price appreciation they've seen over the past year. Stock markets have recovered. Job and wage growth are strong. So our customer is in a good spot right now. I mentioned Morning Consult. If you look at their views of different income levels, expectations of the economy, and most recent impact on wage growth, that $100,000+ customer is by far in the best shape in the economy. So it's something we're watching. Something like energy pricing is broad-based and obviously impacts everyone. Gas prices are going down. So that's a help. But food prices have remained high. So something we obviously watch, but I think we're well past the dialogue of overall demand destruction.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks so much, Seth. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks very much. On the consumer, I'm curious if you saw any pull forward in demand in the quarter or a change in project sizes, if there's any sense of urgency to get projects done sooner before prices rise. And I might have missed it, but did you guys have a comment on how May has trended so far relative to the Q1?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Chuck, thanks for the question. In terms of pull forward, we didn't see a lot of that. We may have seen a little bit of that in appliances, but across our broader business, we really didn't see any pull forward at all. We'll wait and see on some of the appliance pieces. But across our business, we haven't seen anything. And in terms of engagement with projects, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing customers engage as they did in the back half of 2024, smaller projects. We know that finance projects are still feeling pressure, but we're really thrilled with the engagement that we saw in our customers where the weather was. And as Richard mentioned in his remarks, the first two weeks of May, we're very pleased with the performance so far.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. And then, Richard, just four consecutive quarters now of shrink, roughly probably called 30 to 40 basis points of a tailwind. Can you just remind us where the accrual sits today, maybe relative to 2019? I'm just trying to assess how much longer that benefit can continue to help you. And then, zooming out on SRS, we talk a lot about the sales benefit, but as you said, 40 basis points of a headwind to the margin profile this year on an annualized basis. How do we think about SRS in 2026 from a margin perspective?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, I'll take those maybe in reverse order. First of all, we're not in a position right now where we're going to talk about 2026, but we know SRS has a track record of growing faster than their competition and taking share in any environment. So we expect there'll be an engine for growth for the company. For your shrink question, I think the most important point, because the world is a lot different now than it was in 2019, is that we're not where we want to be, but we're making great headway.\nAnd we know that the external environment is not getting any easier, but our operators are getting better, and they are delivering results. We're not where we want to be yet, but we've bent that curve down, actually Q6 in a row on a VOY basis. And then let's see. Just to clarify something, you said 40 basis points of SRS. I think you got it right. That's the annualized impact. For 2025 versus 2024, it's 15 basis points.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. Thank you very much.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVice President, Home Depot\n\nChristine, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for taking my question. First one was just on Q1. When you look at performance by region, can you just help us understand how that played out? Because obviously, there was a good amount of weather volatility. And then did the hurricane recovery efforts provide a benefit at all in Q1?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, we saw the majority of the tough weather kind of play out in the north and in Canada. With respect to hurricanes, there was some benefit in Q1 right around where we would have expected. That benefit is baked into our annual guidance because on a year-over-year basis, the benefit seen in 2024 is largely matched by the benefit in 2025.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. The follow-up I had is on pricing. I know it's been asked a good amount, but what are you seeing right now in terms of the competitive environment when it comes to pricing? Because presumably, some of the smaller players have probably needed to take up price sooner than others, just they've had less negotiating power. What have you seen in the competitive environment?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. I mean, so far, Steven, we've seen pretty consistent pricing. I mean, we obviously are very focused on our price position and what we look at and the CPI that we look at. But we haven't seen a lot so far in terms of price modifications in the marketplace. Again, it's somewhat early days still. And I would just reiterate our position, as I mentioned, about not seeing broad-based price increases at the Home Depot.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMs. Janci, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVice President, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Christine. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our Q2 Earnings Call in August.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call investor relations at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, and Return on Invested Capital. For a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release and our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for fiscal 2024 were $159.5 billion, an increase of 4.5% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 1.8% from the same period last year, and our US stores had negative comps of 1.8%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $15.24, compared to $15.25 in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 0.8% from last year, and comps in our US stores were up 1.3%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.13, compared to $2.86 in the prior year. In the quarter, we saw broad-based engagement across our geographies, as 15 of our 19 US regions delivered positive comps. In addition, both Canada and Mexico reported positive comps in local currency. Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations, as we saw greater engagement in home improvement spend despite ongoing pressure on large remodeling projects.\nThroughout the year, we remained steadfast in our investments across our strategic initiatives, despite uncertain macroeconomic conditions and a higher interest rate environment that impacted home improvement demand. Our strategic priorities remain: creating the best interconnected shopping experience, growing our Pro wallet share through a unique ecosystem of capabilities, and building new stores. We are always improving our interconnected shopping experience. We know that our customers want faster delivery than ever before. Recall that last quarter, I shared the progress we made with our investments in our downstream supply chain, including an expanded assortment in our DFCs to allow for faster delivery speeds across more products. We also began leveraging our stores to offer more delivery options. Our delivery speeds are now the fastest they've ever been, and customers are increasing their spend. Billy will take you through these results in a moment.\nGrowing our share of wallet with our pro customers is a key part of our growth strategy. We've continued investing in our store experience, fulfillment options, and sales teams. These investments are delivering incremental sales growth, and Ann will discuss this in detail shortly. In June, we completed the acquisition of SRS. While we've only owned them for seven months, we could not be happier with the business. The capabilities that SRS brings are both additive and complementary to our strategic efforts. As expected for fiscal 2024, SRS contributed $6.4 billion in sales for the seven months we owned them. Since we acquired them in June, they have opened over 20 greenfield locations and completed four tuck-in acquisitions. We're also focusing on many cross-sale opportunities with SRS.\nAs an example, we've talked about the opportunity with QuoteCenter, our platform that provides real-time quote pricing and different fulfillment options for larger job lot quantities. SRS was already in QuoteCenter, but not in all markets. Today, they are in nearly every market with their roofing products. And since making this change, we have seen SRS's sales in QuoteCenter more than triple. Going forward, we will continue to support SRS's momentum, and we expect their organic sales to grow mid-single digits in fiscal 2025. Our real estate footprint remains one of our distinct competitive advantages. We are expanding that footprint by investing in new stores in areas that have experienced population growth or where it makes sense to relieve pressure on existing high-volume stores. In fiscal 2024, we opened 12 new stores, 10 in the US and 2 in Mexico.\nWe are seeing great results from these stores, which are outperforming our expectations. For fiscal 2025, we plan to open 13 new stores. For fiscal 2025, we expect total sales growth of approximately 2.8%, comparable sales growth of approximately 1%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 2%. We remain excited about all our growth opportunities, and we feel confident that the investments we are making will set us up for continued success. I want to close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Our results reflect strong execution by our stores, merchants, and supply chain teams, as well as our vendor partners, as they remain focused on delivering value and service to our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Our thoughts continue to be with everyone impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as the devastating fires in Los Angeles. We are here as these communities rebuild with our associates and suppliers who consistently go above and beyond to serve our customers, and I want to thank them for all that they do. As you heard from Ted, growing our share of wallet with the Pro is a key part of our growth strategy, and I'd like to take a moment to talk more about the progress we've made. For the quarter, all our Pro cohorts positive comp, and it is clear that our initiatives are working.\nOver the last few years, we have made investments in our stores, as well as through our Pro ecosystem to improve the shopping experience for all of our pros, regardless of their purchase occasion, whether they are shopping in store, online, or getting delivery from stores or our distribution centers. We know that nearly all pros shop our stores. Over the years, we have been investing across our stores to simplify and enhance the in-store shopping experience through investments in our free-flow process and technology to increase on-shelf availability, investments in inventory to provide a deeper assortment and job lot quantities in core SKUs, enhancements in our labor model, and the introduction of CXMs or dedicated customer experience managers, and the development of SellinTools to provide better insights for our associates to help serve the pro.\nIn addition to these in-store investments, our investments in the FDC network have improved the in-store experience by taking many deliveries out of the store, which reduces clutter in the aisles from staged orders. As a result, our in-stock have improved, and our associate availability is higher. The FDC has also enabled faster delivery, expanded fulfillment options, and more consistent on-time and complete delivery of larger orders directly to the job site. We also continue to build out a more comprehensive set of capabilities in our Pro ecosystem. These capabilities include a broader and deeper assortment of products in the FDC, dedicated sales teams that provide a higher level of service, enhanced SellinTools with CRM capabilities to better serve our customers, additional digital capabilities through our B2B website, loyalty, and preferred pricing programs.\nIt is all of these capabilities, as well as enhancements in store, that have really allowed us to win a greater share of wallet with all our pros. Our initiatives are resonating with pros, and not only are we gaining traction with the larger pro that works on complex projects, we're also seeing meaningful lift in sales with all pros across all purchase occasions. In fact, these investments have driven over $1 billion in incremental sales on an annualized basis in 17 markets. Even in these 17 markets, we are in different stages of maturity, and there's still a lot to do to better serve all our pros, from improving our delivery experience to building new capabilities like trade credit and order management to leveraging SRS and improving connectivity with our stores.\nWe know that as we invest across all of our assets, it will allow us to more uniquely serve the pro. We have a lot to be proud of this year. We continue to focus on delivering the best customer experience in home improvement. We've seen great associate engagement and historically high retention rates. Our safety performance was exceptional, and we've made significant progress in shrink, driven by our company-specific initiatives. All of these efforts are positioning us well and will allow us to continue to grow with all of our customers. Thank you, and with that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, our performance during Q4 exceeded our expectations as we saw broader engagement across home improvement-related projects. In addition, we also saw incremental sales as a result of the ongoing hurricane recovery efforts. However, the higher interest rate environment continues to pressure larger remodeling projects. Turning to our merchandising department comp performance for Q4, 10 of our 16 departments posted positive comps, including appliances, indoor garden, lumber, power, building materials, paint, outdoor garden, storage, hardware, and plumbing. During Q4, our comp transactions increased 0.6%, and comp average ticket increased 0.2%.\nInflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket by approximately 20 basis points, driven by inflation in lumber and copper wire. Additionally, during the quarter, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were up 0.9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We were pleased with the performance we saw in categories such as appliances, building materials, and lumber. However, we continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the project, such as kitchen and bath remodels. During the fourth quarter, both pro and DIY comp sales were positive, with pro outpacing the DIY customer. In the fourth quarter, we saw strength across many pro-heavy categories like gypsum, decking, concrete, and fencing.\nTurning to total company online sales, excluding the impact of the extra week in the quarter, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. There are a lot of drivers to our online success, from the focus on continuously improving the shopping and browsing experience to enhancing the delivery and post-delivery experience, to leveraging AI to enhance our chat features, product descriptions, and creating rating summaries for our customers. This quarter, I'd like to talk more specifically about delivery. As you heard from Ted, we remained focused on continuing to improve our interconnected retail experience and have made significant progress on the delivery experience for our customers.\nWe have invested in a broader assortment across our 19 DFCs, established partnerships with third-party last-mile providers, and made technology improvements across our 2,000+ stores to better utilize all of our assets for the benefit of our customers. Today, we have the fastest delivery speeds across the greatest number of products in company history. Our customers also have more fulfillment options than ever before. They can choose what they want, when they want, including same-day and next-day delivery. We know that driving a superior customer experience, including speed of delivery, drives greater customer satisfaction, higher engagement, higher conversion, and ultimately more sales. We've seen these customers who are engaging in our delivery capabilities meaningfully increase their overall spend with us across all purchase occasions and channels. During the fourth quarter, we hosted our appliance, gift center, decorative holiday, and Black Friday events.\nWe saw strong engagements across all of these events, with our appliance and gift center events posting record sales years. We're looking forward to the year ahead, particularly with the spring selling season right around the corner, and we have a great lineup of new and innovative products from live goods to outdoor power equipment. We continue to see an industry-wide shift from gas-powered to battery-powered tools, and we have been leaning into this trend for some time. We have the brands that matter most to our customers, including Ryobi, Milwaukee, DeWalt, and Makita. In our spring gift center event, we will provide our largest assortment of battery-powered products with longer runtimes and enhanced performance across a number of battery platforms, including Ryobi One, Milwaukee M18 Forge, DeWalt XR PowerPack and PowerStack, and Makita LXT, to name a few. We're also excited about our live goods program.\nEach year, our merchants partner with a wide network of regional and local growers to ensure that our customers have new and improved varieties and the right localized assortments to enhance the overall garden experience. Investing in our relationships with our growers will allow us to continue to drive innovation to meet our customers' needs and improve their shopping experience while building loyalty to The Home Depot. As we look forward to spring, we are excited about continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when and how they need it. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $39.7 billion, an increase of $4.9 billion, or approximately 14% from last year. Fiscal 2024 included a 53rd week, which added approximately $2.5 billion in sales for the quarter and the year. During the fourth quarter, our total company comps were positive 0.8%, with comps of negative 1.7% in November, positive 6.6% in December, and negative 2% in January. Comps in the US were positive 1.3% for the quarter, with comps of negative 2% in November, positive 8% in December, and -1.4% in January. It is important to note that holiday shifts positively impacted December while negatively impacting November and January. Our results for the fourth quarter include a net contribution of approximately $220 million in hurricane-related sales, which positively impacted total company comps by approximately 65 basis points for the quarter.\nAdditionally, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted total company comps by approximately 70 basis points for the quarter. For the year, our sales totaled $159.5 billion, an increase of $6.8 billion, or 4.5% versus fiscal 2023. For the year, total company comp sales decreased 1.8%, and US comp sales decreased 1.8%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was approximately 32.8%, a decrease of 25 basis points from the fourth quarter last year, reflecting a change in mix as a result of the SRS acquisition, which was in line with our expectations. For the year, our gross margin was approximately 33.4%, an increase of approximately 5 basis points from last year, which was in line with our expectations. During the fourth quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 30 basis points to 21.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 19.9% of sales, representing an increase of 75 basis points from fiscal 2023. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was 11.3% compared to 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding intangible asset amortization in the quarter, our adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 11.7% compared to 12.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our operating margin for the year was 13.5% compared to 14.2% in 2023. Excluding intangible asset amortization, our adjusted operating margin for the year was 13.8% compared to 14.3% in 2023. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased by $150 million to $608 million due primarily to higher debt balances than a year ago. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.9%, and for the year, it was approximately 23.7%.\nOur Diluted Earnings Per Share for the fourth quarter were $3.02, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Diluted Earnings Per Share for fiscal 2024 were $14.91, a decrease of 1.3% compared to fiscal 2023. Excluding intangible asset amortization, our Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the fourth quarter were $3.13, an increase of approximately 9.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for fiscal 2024 were $15.24, essentially flat compared to fiscal 2023. During the year, we opened 12 new stores, bringing our store count to 2,347 at the end of fiscal 2024. Retail selling square footage was approximately 243 million sq ft, and total sales per retail sq ft were approximately $600 in fiscal 2024.\nAt the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $23.5 billion, up approximately $2.5 billion versus last year, and inventory turns were 4.7 times, up from 4.3 times last year. Turning to capital allocation, during the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $1.1 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. This brings total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to approximately $3.5 billion. During the year, we paid approximately $8.9 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Today, we announced our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend by 2.2% to $2.30 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $9.20 per share. Finally, during fiscal 2024, we returned approximately $600 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases.\nComputed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 31.3%, down from 36.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Now I'll comment on our outlook for 2025. As you heard from Ted, we feel great about the investments we made in 2024, the progress we've made throughout the year, and the significant opportunities we have as we look ahead. While there are signs that the home improvement market is on the way towards normalization, uncertainty still remains. As we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect the underlying momentum in the business that we saw in the back half of 2024 to continue into 2025. However, we are not assuming any meaningful changes to the macroeconomic environment. We expect our consumer will remain healthy.\nWe are not assuming a change in the rate environment nor improvements in housing turnover. As a result, we would expect continued pressure on larger remodeling projects. Given these factors, our fiscal 2025 outlook is for total sales growth to outpace comp sales, with sales growth of approximately +2.8% and comp sales growth of approximately +1% compared to fiscal 2024. Total sales growth will benefit from the SRS acquisition, the new stores we opened in fiscal 2024, and plan to open in fiscal 2025. For the year, we expect SRS to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.4%, essentially flat compared to fiscal 2024. Further, we expect operating margin of approximately 13% and adjusted operating margin of approximately 13.4%.\nThis primarily reflects natural deleverage from sales and continued investments across the business, as well as reflecting the mixed impact from the SRS acquisition. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $2.2 billion. We expect our diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 3% compared to fiscal 2024 when comparing the 52 weeks in fiscal 2025 to the 53 weeks in fiscal 2024. We expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 2% compared to fiscal 2024. On a 52-week basis, it would be essentially flat compared to fiscal 2024. We plan to continue investing in our business with capital expenditures of approximately 2.5% of sales for fiscal 2025. We believe that we will grow market share in any environment by strengthening our competitive position with our customers and delivering the best customer experience and home improvement.\nBefore opening the call for questions, we are pleased to announce that we will be holding an investor conference on 9 December 2025, in New York City. We will share more details in the future, but for now, please hold the date. Thank you for your participation in today's call. Christine, we are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from a line of Laura Meng with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. It's Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. My first question is on the macro housing backdrop and the ingredients to a 1% comp. So existing home sales look like they're set to grow mid-singles. And if that's the case, home improvement demand could arguably be a little stronger than maybe a 1 comp or whatever assumption you're using. What's your take on that? I know Richard said we're not assuming any improvement in turnover. Is there anything changed about any change about your forecast due to people staying in their homes longer and rates being stubborn?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nHi, Simeon. Yes, at this point, while we've seen a little life in turnover in Q4, we're not expecting meaningful increase off that 40-year low. We've likely reached the bottom of housing turnover at about 3% of units, but we're not expecting a big rebound nor significant increases in new housing starts. However, if you just step back, I mean, if you look at our customer, they remain very healthy. We look at our customer today; we think about $110,000 average income. Those incomes have been growing. We've talked about the increase in home equity values up 50% since the end of 2019, and then wealth effect through the stock market and other investments. So our customer is very healthy.\nAs you say, if they're staying in their homes longer, they will take on larger remodeling projects as opposed to moving. Those that are locked into lower interest rates or just not wanting to get mortgages with the higher rates. But we're not anticipating a large decrease in mortgage rates. It'll be more an issue of consumers getting used to these higher rates. And to take on a larger project, it's usually financed. And that financing is through HELOCs. And we've started to see a little increase in each of cash-out refis as well as draws on HELOCs. But there's literally trillions of dollars of equity built up in US housing.\nAs homes continue to age and people are staying in those homes and realize that we're highly unlikely to see the low interest rates we saw over the past two, three years, that they'll eventually tap that equity and do the larger remodeling projects. We're just not sure that turn comes in 2025 at a dramatically accelerated pace.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nTo follow up on the 1%, just to explain that, Simeon, obviously, this is a triangulation. We look at exit run rates of the business. As we said, keep in mind that Q4, while certainly showing signs of momentum growing from Q3, still had some benefit from hurricanes that won't fully repeat in 2025. A slight dampening of the run rate and then the assumption of continued pressure on larger projects, with the shape of the year increasing slightly through the year, which also includes the inclusion of SRS in our comp. You'll see them in our comp for the last seven months of the year.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. That's helpful. The follow-up, if comps do end up being a little stronger than one, does each point flow through with this 10 points of leverage to the margin? Or is there a scenario, whether it's better DIY, more pro, more complex project, or do you spend more? Is there a mix shift that could alter that relationship above one?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nNo. I think, look, the 10 basis points is a good rough estimate of leverage from that point.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Good luck.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYou're not going to have meaningful shifts in mix. Even if mix shifts, you're not going to have meaningful differences in that leverage number.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go at a similar kind of question, maybe on a different angle. Appliances were up, paint was up. Was that volume-driven? And to what extent do you think the category was up versus Home Depot continuing to gain share? Because as you look forward, the replacement cycle dynamic should get better from Q4 levels. You'll be five years out. Ted, you've talked about in the past, every wall was painted in the US in 2020, but we're getting further from there. So doesn't that replacement part of the business further accelerate? And curious if you're going to say, like, \"Well, X% of the business is replacement versus Y percent is more like big ticket remodel,\" which we would expect to continue to be an anchor.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nSure, Chris. Let me make a broad comment, and then Billy can give some detail on particular categories. Look, if we just step back and look at this quarter, we're happy with it, right? Sales exceeded our expectations, and we're happy with positive comps, obviously, for the first time in two years, and particularly happy with positive transaction comps, which has been negative for over three years. As you say, the business has strengthened across many categories and in many geographies. In fact, we haven't seen this broader-based performance in over two years and maybe even closer to three years. If you go back, Chris, to your comment on COVID, I'd say that shift of spending back to services post-COVID, in the pull forward of demand during the pandemic, those have largely played out.\nThere may be a category here and there, but I'd say that PC shift in home improvement pull forward have largely played out. And engagement in repair, smaller updates, and decor-oriented updates is strengthening. And Billy can give some detail on the categories.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Listen, as Ted mentioned, the broader-based performance. I talked about the 10 of the 16 departments that posted positive comps. We had an outperform, Chris, as you mentioned, in appliances in our gift center business, which we had record sales, candidly, in those areas across the store. So we had a healthy balance of transactions and unit performance, which to Ted's point, we hadn't seen in a while. With that said, still the pressure we know in finance projects. We had great performance across many of our pro-heavy categories. I mentioned gypsum, decking, concrete, and fencing. And while there was some hurricane impact in there, we're pretty pleased with the broad base of performance, not only across the merchandising departments, but certainly across the country. But there's just no denying the deferral that we're still seeing.\nWe are pleased with the pull forward that we think is largely behind us at this point from a go-forward standpoint. So all those things bode well, but still, the pressure in some of the more finance projects, we're still continuing to see that exist.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. And then, Richard, can you talk about the monthly US comps adjusting for the holiday shift? There's been a lot of questions, I think, over the past five, six weeks on what's going on with the consumer. You saw F&D talk about a slowdown relative to what they saw in the fourth quarter, and they talked about weather. So can you talk about, do you think, that the weather had any influence on the business in January and any comment on exit rate? Thanks very much.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nI think that so the monthly progression was absolutely influenced by holiday shifts, again, to the benefit of December to the detriment of November and January. But no doubt, weather was horrible in January. We've had two years in a row of tough Januaries, but this one was particularly tough. And so that's why we don't read a tremendous amount into it when we think about exit run rate. But no doubt, weather had an impact.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. Have a great spring.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. What market share assumption have you embedded into your 2025 outlook? And why wouldn't it be reasonable for us to assume that Home Depot's market share gains should accelerate from here and be above where they've been historically in light of you now having SRS as well as many more capabilities given the investments that have been made over the last several years? Is that a sign that you think your DIY market share is starting to peak? And that could have an impact on the overall share gains for the enterprise.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nHi, Michael. Thanks for the question. As we look at the overall market for 2025, we see it overall being flat, maybe up slightly. Those expectations have come down over the last several months. Our plus one, as Richard explained, is a continuation of some of the underlying strength in the business and our initiatives that we absolutely are gaining incremental sales for us. So that's why we peg our comp growth at 1%. Now, if you look at the combination of what's driving our share gain for both pro and consumer in the core, it is all the capabilities that we're putting in the marketplace. We talked a lot about interconnected and all the investments we've made on the interconnected journey, and then certainly all the investments on our pro ecosystem. I'll have Jordan spend a few minutes more on what we're doing on interconnected.\nAnd then you add what we're doing with SRS. SRS will grow faster than the core, and we believe they're taking share in each of their three verticals. So we're very pleased with what SRS is doing. So all that with our new stores, which are starting to add some meaningful dollars to our growth, gets us to the 1% comp and 2.8% overall growth in a flat market. So we wouldn't say our share has peaked by any means in DIY or pro. And then, Jordan, if you chat about what we're doing to drive share in pro and consumer with interconnected.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSure. So I mean, Billy shared the excitement we have had on dot-com sales performance. And that's really across both the consumer and the pro, both of them up healthily online. And it's been a combination of investments that we've made that have helped deliver that from the site experience and really making that journey so much better from a browse and search perspective and finding the right product to the fulfillment. Billy mentioned that we've had the fastest delivery speeds in the history of our company: same-day delivery, next-day delivery, whether that's concrete and lumber or whether that's a light bulb or power tool. It's been really fast. And all of those investments have come together to really drive an improvement in conversion rate on the site. And then what we see is an increased engagement across channel with more purchases that come in store.\nWe're real excited about the momentum there and see the investments that we've made really paying off.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you for that. My follow-up question is on what's been happening as of late. There's been a lot of focus on the impact that the government efficiency measures and/or immigration policy implementation could have on the US consumer. How did you factor that and those considerations into the guidance? And while you had just indicated that weather was really the underlying cause of some of the results in January, are you seeing any evidence that these factors are having an impact on the business? There's been talk about housing inventory in the Mid-Atlantic starting to creep higher. So anything you could provide that would be very helpful.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nMichael, I don't think we've seen anything specifically. If you tick through some of the things you mentioned, and some I'd add, tax policy would be one of the most important to Home Depot as a full taxpayer. So we'd be very pleased if the corporate rate stays at 21%. Tariffs is obviously a lot of discussion on what rates would be and what countries would be impacted, and what categories of goods. We've been through that before, and I think we have the best team to manage through any tariff environment which would impact the industry broadly. I'd say our diversification efforts out of certain concentrations and countries has been quite good over the last six or seven years. You mentioned immigration. We've talked about having a shortage of skilled trades folks in this country for some time. We believe it's like 400,000-odd trades folks short.\nNot sure how that number would change with any meaningful change in immigration. And then, specifically to the government efficiency in Mid-Atlantic, no, we've not seen anything there.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much and good luck.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys. Ann talked about $1 billion of incremental sales in the 17 markets where you've started to build out complex pro capabilities. How do you actually measure that? And then what kind of ramp would you expect in those markets in 2025 as you continue to phase in order management, credit expansion, etc., some of the other capabilities that you've discussed? Thanks.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Scott. Yeah. As we mentioned, we're incredibly pleased with what we've seen so far. We're generating $1 billion and growing. So that's been fantastic. And as we mentioned as well, it's geared across all participation. The way we measure that is the incremental sales in the 17 markets versus what we see in the top 40 markets. So the $1 billion of annualized sales is that in those 17 markets, we have been outperforming other top 40 markets. And so when you think about 2025, we're focused on really maturing the capabilities in these 17 markets, which is really important. Not only maturing the existing capabilities, but really, really rolling out new capabilities as well.\nSo whether it be delivery, expanding our sales force, those are key things that we'll continue to focus on, as well as new capabilities as we talk about trade credit, order management, account management. Those are opportunities that we have to continue to grow in 2025. Ted talked about SRS, and there's also an opportunity for us to really drive cross-selling opportunities across the SRS portfolio. Last but not least, we have more FDCs in the pipeline as well. We have three FDCs on the construction. We have more in the pipeline. So we're incredibly pleased with what we've seen in 2024 when we think about the 17 markets across our company and compared to the top 40 markets. More importantly, what we've seen with the Pro ecosystem across the country as well, and making sure that we're doubling down on the opportunities that we see.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nAppreciate that. What's the biggest sticking point as you roll this out? Is it building the specialty sales force? Is it the recognition from your complex pros, etc.? What's the toughest piece that you've kind of learned? What's the toughest hurdle you have to clear?\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP, Home Depot\n\nYeah, Scot, this is what we continue to find. This is an entire ecosystem, right? So it's not just one component of the ecosystem, right? When we talk about the outside sales, or we talk about delivery, or we talk about order management and account management, it's all of those things working in concert. So what is always kind of difficult is as you roll these capabilities out, and there are different levels of maturity, our focus is to refine and really perfect what we're seeing. And that takes time in a market, especially when you're building relationships. We don't want to create new relationships with our new capabilities with our pros and then have big failure points. So the difficult part is making sure that we're doubling down and moving at a speed that drives outcomes, but at the same time that we're focused on perfecting within the market.\nIt's incredibly complex. It is really important that we do this right. In 2024, we saw some really, really great progress. That's what makes us excited about what we will do in 2025 and beyond.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nAnalyst, Truist\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKaren Short\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHi, thanks very much, and good to talk to you. So I had one question regarding guidance, then another totally related. So actually, intangibles in terms of operating margin guidance, so should we look at that as the right way to think about the relationship between sales growth and operating margin growth, i.e., excluding intangible impact from SRS on your guidance?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYes. Yes. Karen, we believe that removing the non-cash amortization expense related to the amortization of intangible assets is the best way to look at our underlying operating margin. So that's where we have guided for the last couple of quarters and will continue to guide on that basis moving forward.\nHow should we consider?\nKaren, by the way, it includes. The operating margin is adjusted for all non-cash amortization expense at the Home Depot, not just that related to SRS.\n\nKaren Short\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Thank you. So, how should we think about the relationship on total sales growth versus operating margin or operating profit growth, on the way you define it?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nDelivers is essentially the same when you're looking at Adjusted Operating Margin versus GAAP Operating Margin. So there's no change needed in the way that we've talked about leverage or deleverage in the past.\n\nKaren Short\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Is 2.5% of sales the right run rate to think about on CapEx going forward?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSo historically, we've said 2% is sort of a rough expectation. We have increased that percentage really to reflect two things. Number one, obviously, we're happy with the investments we've made. They are generating exceptional returns. And so we're leaning into those investments. But second, a big part of that investment portfolio are our new stores. And it's worth calling our new store program out. In 2023, we announced we would build 80 stores over five years, including the year 2023. We are 25 stores into that program. So far, the results have been fantastic. We're tracking ahead of expectations. So we are going to continue, and we will complete that program. This year will be the third year of the program. We'll complete it by year five, which is 2027.\nSo that 2.5% of sales is reflective of that new store program as well as leaning into investments that are working.\n\nKaren Short\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you so much.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed. Give me your question.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nVery good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I actually want to follow up on Karen's question there and maybe dig into the SRS contribution a bit more. Can you help us understand how that's impacting the bottom line for 2025? Because you gave the organic mid-single-digit growth for the business. Maybe how's the bottom line tracking versus expectation?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nDollars to our top line from seven months of ownership. They hit that on the button, and we feel great about their P&L top to bottom. So from, as we discussed during the deal, we expected this to be cash accretive within the first year of ownership. We'll be coming up on that first-year anniversary soon. They're already contributing to top and bottom line. So we feel really happy about that. Now, just to be clear, to make sure that everyone understands this, obviously, we report our results on a consolidated basis. If you think about the pro forma impact of SRS, the reflection of SRS and its mix impact on The Home Depot, there's about a 40 basis points full-year mix impact to The Home Depot. So think about The Home Depot in total being impacted by about 40 basis points. But that's a mix effect.\nWe'll take that all day long. They are leaders in their spaces. They're performing exceptionally well, and we're happy with that.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nOkay. Thanks. The follow-up question I had was just on maybe the pricing environment. In the past, I think you've talked about prices kind of settling. Do you feel like we're at a point now where we should see sort of a natural return to a normal environment for pricing? And then how does the potential for tariffs kind of fit into that view?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nWell, thanks, Steven. It's Billy. Listen, as it relates to just the general pricing environment, and then I'll talk for a minute about tariffs. I mean, we are in a very rational market just by definition. And prices, as we've mentioned on the last couple of calls, really have settled, to your point. And the promotional activity is the same as it's been kind of pre-COVID as well. So no differences in that. And as I mentioned, again, the last couple of quarters, pricing has settled into the market accordingly. As it relates to tariffs, and we've spoken a little bit about it this morning. I mean, listen, we've been through this before. We'll continue to assess just how these impact our business from a go-forward standpoint. We've been focused on diversifying sourcing for several years. So we'll continue to assess that going forward.\nOur number one job in merchandising is to be the customer's advocate for value. We have great, great vendor relationships. With our scale, we feel that we're as well or better positioned than anyone in the marketplace to navigate the environment going forward.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nAnd actually, I want to go back one question and just follow up on Steven's question. So Steven, just to put a year-over-year comparison together for you and talk about how SRS impacts year-over-year from an operating margin perspective. So as you've seen in our guidance, we're guiding to a 13.4% adjusted operating margin from a 13.8%. That's a 40 basis point decrease. Here's how that 40 basis point breaks down. It's coincidental to the pro forma impact, but the year-over-year is different. So that 40 reflects 20 basis points of natural deleverage. And recall, we think this business levers about a 3% comp. So at a 1% comp, we're getting about 2 comp points of deleverage. So 2 times about 10 basis points per is 20 basis points.\nThen the inclusion of 12 months of ownership of SRS compared to 7 months of ownership is reflected in 15 basis points of mixed shift. So you've got about a 15 basis point impact of that year-over-year comparison of 12 months versus 7 months. And then finally, the comparison versus a 53-week year also shifts margin by 5 basis points. So you've got 20 basis points from natural deleverage. You've got 15 from SRS impact, and you've got 5 from the 53rd-week comparison. Within that, I think it's worth saying, look, we are leaning into investments. We're paying for those investments through productivity. And so that's also within that operating margin guidance. There's productivity inside as well as leaning into investments. And I hope that makes it a little bit more clear.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nYeah, that answers our question. Thank you so much for that follow-up.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. I do want to follow up on that last point around the flow-through. If you step back and look at your sales over the last several years, I think since 2019, sales are up maybe 45%. SG&A is actually up a similar percent. Along the way, there have been investments and plenty of cost pressures. I guess the real question is, to the extent that comps start to improve here, they progress throughout 2025, are we at that point where sales should grow faster than expenses, and you can really start to see that flow-through come through?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSeth, I would point you back to our investor conference back in 2023, right? Once this market normalizes, we would expect a base case of 3%-4% top-line growth. We would expect, and within that, we expect flat gross margin is kind of a base expectation. Then we do expect operating expense leverage. So that takes you to the earnings per share expectation of mid- to high single-digit growth once our market has normalized and once we are back to that level of sales growth. That view hasn't changed since 2023.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you for that. And then just on that point around the gross margin, you are guiding flat in 2025. You still have some SRS dilution wrapping into this year. Can you talk about some of the underlying assumptions for core Home Depot and speak to the offsets that would be helping mitigate that SRS dilution? Thanks so much.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSure. I'd point it to you. You're right about that. We still have a little bit of a lap. And so there's pressure from SRS mix. Just two great callouts. Number one, our outstanding supply chain and merchandising teams finding productivity. And I could go on and on about it, but the benefits we've seen in supply chain productivity alone are really encouraging. And we would call out our fantastic store operations team who have now driven improvements in shrink for about a year and a half, year-over-year, quarter by quarter. We expect that to continue into 2025. And so it's really a story of SRS mix being offset by supply chain productivity, some other great things the merchants are doing, and our fantastic store ops team.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nThanks. Appreciate it.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot",
    "content2": "Christine, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Zhihan Ma with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHi. Thank you so much for taking my question. Just a final quick one. How does your complex Pro initiatives impact your long-term ROIC expectations taking into account that you are extending more trade credit and potentially holding more inventory with a broader assortment from here? Thank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nI wouldn't expect meaningful impact on ROIC through capital investments. We've talked about driving incremental sales in profit dollar growth. That business has a different margin profile, but certainly incremental sales in profit growth. But it's really a reasonably asset-light investment. We lease the DCs. We lease trucks. We bring on sales teams that are commissioned sales forces that sort of earn their keep as they build their portfolios. Trade credit, as we scale that, we're tiny, tiny exposure at the moment. But as we build that, it's just not going to be a meaningful balance sheet item given the scale of our overall balance sheet.\n\nZhihan Ma\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMs. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot's Q2 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up.

Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures, including but not limited to adjusted income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. For reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures to our corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release and our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $43.2 billion, an increase of 0.6% from the same period last year. Our sales in the quarter include $1.3 billion from SRS. Recall that we closed on the SRS acquisition on 18 June, and we've included approximately six weeks of their performance in our consolidated results. Comp sales declined 3.3% from the same period last year, and our US stores had negative comps of 3.6%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.67 in the second quarter, compared to $4.68 in the second quarter last year. The team continues to navigate this unique environment while executing at a high level. During the quarter, higher interest rates and greater macroeconomic uncertainty pressured consumer demand more broadly, resulting in weaker spend across home improvement projects.\nAdditionally, we saw continued softness in spring projects, which were also impacted by the extreme weather changes throughout the quarter. When we look at the performance in the first six months of the year, as well as continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand, we believe a more cautious sales outlook is warranted for the year. Richard will take you through the details in a moment, but we're now guiding to a comp sales decline of approximately 3%-4% for fiscal 2024. Regardless of the current pressure in the environment, our team remains focused on serving our customers and ensuring we have the right products at the right values. And we remain focused on long-term share growth in the highly fragmented, approximately $1 trillion home improvement market.\nRemember, we operate in one of the largest asset classes, which is estimated at approximately $45 trillion, representing the installed base of homes in the United States. Today, we have roughly 17% market share with tremendous growth potential. That is why we have been investing and executing on our strategy to create the best interconnected experience, grow a pro-wallet share through a differentiated set of capabilities, and build new stores. Now, I'll take a few moments to comment on our acquisition of SRS Distribution. SRS has an exceptional team with a proven growth track record, and we are thrilled to welcome them into the Home Depot family. While our financials only reflect a portion of their first-half performance for the first six-month period matching our first half, they generated high single-digit top-line growth while growing operating income largely in line with sales compared to the previous year.\nWe are incredibly excited about what we can achieve together by leveraging our combined assets, capabilities, and competitive advantages. We plan to drive incremental growth through several sales and cross-selling opportunities. We'll make their more comprehensive product offering in roofing, pool, and landscape available to all our customers through our Pro desk. We'll offer SRS customers a form of credit tied to their account, which will make purchases at Home Depot stores much more convenient. The fundamentals of the home improvement market remain strong, and we have significant growth opportunities in front of us. We are gaining share of wallet with our customers, whether they are shopping in our stores, on our digital assets, or through our Pro ecosystem. Our merchants, store and vet teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams are always ready to serve in any environment.\nThey did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter, and I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior Executive VP, The Home Depot\n\nThanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ted, despite the environment, our associates continue to be engaged and ready to serve our customers. We know that delivering the best shopping experience for any purchase occasion is critical to our success. That is why we continue to invest in our associates, our in-store capabilities, our fulfillment channels, and the customer experience. Over the past year, we have talked about the tools that help us create this differentiated experience. Specifically, our focus on in-stock and on-shelf availability, or OSA, with our Sidekick and computer vision applications. Today, our in-stock and OSA are at best-in-class levels and provide the foundation for a fast in-and-out convenient experience that many of our customers desire, especially our pro customers. We have also enhanced the tools our associates use for our in-store pros and specialty selling.\nWithin the MyView tool, which has many in-store applications, we have given our associates better visibility to our customers' activity with The Home Depot. For example, for our in-store pros, we can see sales trends, specific buying patterns, and expiring perks, equipping our associates with insights to better partner, grow share of wallet, and deliver value for our customers. To drive conversion for specialty customers, we launched a new platform known as Pipeline Management that enables interconnected product selling for kitchen designs. With this tool, associates and store leaders will now be able to have a consolidated digital view of their pipeline and all activities related to a customer's journey. This allows associates to more easily manage multiple complex projects while more effectively communicating with our customers throughout their journey.\nAdditionally, we continue to make progress on our organic efforts around our different assets and capabilities to grow share of wallet with a complex project purchase occasion. We are pleased to announce that we now have key Pro capabilities in 17 markets, including a broader product assortment, digital assets, a sales force, and broader fulfillment options. Our trade credit pilot program is also on the way. And while it's still early days, we have seen the program resonate with our customers and the benefits of extending credit for larger scale projects that are staged over a longer period of time. We are also making progress on our order management system as we continue to roll out enhancements to the end-to-end selling system. We are very excited about our continued success serving the complex project purchase occasion and are focused on delivering the best customer service to all our customers.\nOur store readiness and execution is strong, and our associates are engaged. I look forward to the many opportunities ahead of us, and I want to thank all our associates for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during Q2, the higher interest rate environment and greater macroeconomic uncertainty pressured overall project demand. In addition, our sales reflect a softer spring selling season, which was also impacted by extreme changes in the weather throughout the quarter. Turning to our merchandising department comp performance for Q2, our plumbing department posted a positive comp, while power, building materials, appliances, and paint were all above the company average. During Q2, our comp transactions decreased 2.2%, and comp average ticket decreased 1.3%. However, during the quarter, we continued to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products.\nBig-ticket comp transactions for those over $1,000 were down 5.8% compared to the second quarter of last year. We continued to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the project, such as kitchen and bathroom remodels. Pros outperformed the DIY customer, but both were negative for the quarter. We saw positive growth with pros who engage in our Pro Extra program, deliveries to the job site, and our B2B website. Turning to total company online sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. In addition, during the second quarter, we expanded our partnership with Instacart to improve the interconnected shopping experience nationwide.\nWhile we are still in the early days of our expanded partnership, we are encouraged with the results we are seeing. During the second quarter, we leaned into products and projects that are resonating with our customers. We updated some line structures focused on innovation and continued to deliver a compelling value proposition while focusing on the customer experience. For example, we upgraded the durability of all LifeProof vinyl plank while also introducing on-trend colors, patterns, and lengths. This helped drive positive comps in the category for the quarter. In water heaters, we recently modified our line structure to better serve the pro customer needs. We simplified our value proposition, adding new and better features, which drove increased engagement in the category.\nIn paint, we continue to see the benefits of the investments we are making around our products and our fulfillment options, including our in-store service and job site delivery capabilities with the Pro who pays, driving continued share gains in the quarter. Finally, we continue to see tremendous success in our outdoor power equipment categories, driving both positive unit and dollar comps in the quarter. As we've mentioned before, we have built a strong competitive advantage with our extensive lineup of battery-powered platforms that allows us to continue to grow share in these categories. As we look ahead to Q3, our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customers' advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when they need it.\nWe will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That's why I'm so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market. This quarter, we are launching the first-to-market smart glass door with Feather River. Feather River is a leader in the fiberglass door market and continues to bring innovation to our customers. This new door technology allows customers to easily change the glass from privacy or frosted to clear with a push of a button and is compatible with our HubSpace ecosystem. This will be exclusive to The Home Depot and the Big Box retail channel. Additionally, we continue to lean in with our exclusive partner, Milwaukee, across the business and have seen great adoption of electrical hand tools. Our partnership is expanding with a broader assortment of made-in-the-USA tools.\nThese tools provide a high degree of precision with lasting results for our pro customers and will continue to strengthen our position as the number one destination for the electrical trade in the Big Box retail channel. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $43.2 billion, an increase of approximately 0.6% from last year. Total sales include $1.3 billion from the recent acquisition of SRS, which represents approximately six weeks of sales in the quarter. During the second quarter, our total company comps were negative 3.3%, with comps of negative 3.7% in May, negative 0.9% in June, and negative 4.9% in July. Comps in the U.S. were -3.6% for the quarter, with comps of -4.1% in May, -.4% in June, and -5% in July. In the second quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.4%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter last year, primarily driven by benefits from lower transportation costs and shrink, partially offset by mix as a result of the SRS acquisition.\nDuring the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 65 basis points to 18.3% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Beginning this quarter, in addition to our GAAP measures, we are providing the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets. We believe these supplemental measures will help investors better understand and analyze our performance. Our operating margin for the second quarter was 15.1% compared to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2023. In the quarter, pre-tax intangible asset amortization was $90 million, including $39 million related to SRS. Excluding the intangible asset amortization in the quarter, our adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 15.3% compared to 15.5% in the second quarter of 2023.\nInterest and other expense for the second quarter increased by $61 million-$489 million due primarily to higher debt balances than a year ago. In the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.5% compared to 24.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.60, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Excluding intangible asset amortization, our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $4.67, essentially flat compared to the second quarter of 2023. During the second quarter, we opened three new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,340. Retail selling square footage was approximately 243 million sq ft.\nAt the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $23.1 billion, down approximately $200 million compared to the second quarter of 2023, and inventory turns were approximately $720 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. During the quarter, we paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. First and foremost, we will invest in the business and expect capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in the business, we plan to pay the dividend, and it is our intent to return any excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, Return on Invested Capital is approximately 31.9%, down from 41.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nNow, I will comment on our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. As you heard from Ted, given the softer-than-expected performance in the first half of the year and reflecting continued uncertainty around underlying consumer demand, we believe a more cautious outlook for the year is warranted. With the recent closing of the SRS acquisition, we are now including their results in our consolidated outlook for the year. For the period matching our first half, which includes periods prior to the acquisition and not fully reflected in our financial statements, SRS generated high single-digit percentage sales growth, with operating income growing largely in line with sales. We believe that over the next several years, SRS on its own and through our combined pro efforts will help accelerate sales and earnings growth for our company.\nUpdating our fiscal 2024 guidance for the factors we just discussed, we now expect total sales growth between 2.5% and 3.5%, including the SRS acquisition in the 53rd week. The 53rd week is projected to add approximately $2.3 billion to total sales. SRS is expected to contribute approximately $6.4 billion in incremental sales. Comparable sales are expected to decline between negative 3% and negative 4% for the 52-week period. The high end of our range implies a consumer demand environment consistent with the first half of fiscal 2024. While comparable sales for the company are not currently on the trajectory for the low end of the range, a negative 4 comp implies incremental pressure on consumer demand beyond what we are seeing today. We expect to open approximately 12 new stores. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.5%.\nWe expect operating margin to be between 13.5% and 13.6%, and adjusted operating margin to be between 13.8% and 13.9%. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $2.2 billion. Our diluted earnings per share percent will decline between -2% and -4% compared to fiscal 2023, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30. We expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share percent to decline between -1% and -3% compared to fiscal 2023, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model.\nAs we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market, and deliver shareholder value.

One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, everyone. It sounds like you guys are seeing a bit more of a shift towards what's called broader consumer weakness from what previously seemed to be hesitancy around finance projects. Can you provide a couple of examples just so we can better understand kind of the incremental hesitancy on consumer spending patterns?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, I think it's just in broader projects, Scott. As we said in the prior couple few quarters, the consumer remains engaged. Our consumer, in particular, remains quite healthy. Again, these are consumers who have seen their home values go up 50% in the last four years. Their home equity has increased almost 70% since right before the pandemic. So that translates to over $13 trillion. Equity values have been strong. Jobs are strong. Earnings are strong. But we saw engagement the last several quarters in smaller projects. What we saw this most recent quarter is further pressure in larger projects. And we see that in building materials, in lumber categories that are very specifically tied to construction in a larger project. And that was really the change that we saw as the quarter progressed.\nSo in other words, it's not necessarily broadening out, but it's increased pressure on what's called project-oriented purchases.\nYes. And you said it. I mean, the change that we believe happened over the course of the quarter is, if you go back a bit to the environment that we've been working through, this period of moderation, the first thing we saw was a shift in spending, PCE spending, from goods back into services. And we're effectively through that transition. The relative share of spend is more or less equal to where it was before the pandemic. And then we had certainly some pull forward in our segment. I'd say we're not completely through the pull forward, but largely. I mean, we're now going on four years from the first spring of the pandemic when people were buying lots of grills and patio furniture, etc. We're largely working our way through that.\nAnd then the higher interest rates started to impact the housing market and housing turnover in particular, which is down some 40%. And I think last quarter, last month, we saw numbers that on an annualized basis were approaching 40-year lows. That's also impacting customers' interest in financing larger projects. Everyone's expecting rates are going to fall, so we're deferring those projects. But again, what more recently has happened is a broader concern with the macroeconomy. There's just a lot of noise with the political and geopolitical environment. Unemployment ticked up. Inflation keeps eating away at disposable income. And I think people just took a pause as we progressed through the quarter or more of a pause because of these macro uncertainties.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about just performance across different channels. So core Home Depot retail, I think that's pretty clear. But Home Depot or HD Supply, it seems like it's outperformed, but kind of hard to tell from our side. And then on SRS, if you can maybe just elaborate more on the trends you're seeing there. As you step back and think about hopefully an eventual recovery, you've built up this very diverse business over the last few years. I mean, how do you think about the timing of these different segments and how they come out of this? Thank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nSure, Seth. Well, I'd say we're very proud of all components of our business. We are executing at an exceptionally high level across the core and across the businesses that you call out. While we don't split out HD Supply as part of our core, we are proud to say that we have had, and HD Supply has had, an exceptional track record as of late, even penetrating through to generate positive sales growth in the second quarter. And so that's a real bright spot for The Home Depot. SRS, as we told you when we acquired SRS, this is a growth company acquiring a growth company. SRS has a track record of growing faster than their competition in all of their verticals and has done so for the last 15 years.\nIf you look at what SRS accomplished in the first six months of the year, again, we only own them for six weeks, so we only book six weeks of results. But they grew in the high single-digit percentages in the first half. They had healthy growth in the second quarter. And we expect them to, again, book single-digit growth in the entirety of the year 2024, even though we'll only own them for seven months. So these two business models, HD Supply and SRS, are great examples of market leaders who are accustomed to growing share and delivering the bottom line as well.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. And I'd add to that, Seth, we're not going to break out operating segments. But in HD Supply's case, there's some appropriate comparables. In SRS, there's very much publicly traded comparables. And we feel really good about the MRO business, the roofing, the pool, and the landscape business against those comparables.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. That's super helpful. And then if we just zoom back in on Core Home Depot, maybe just speak about your relative performance. If there are categories that you may be seeing some widening gap, you called out a number of categories that seem to be under a lot of cyclical pressure, but were cited as bright spots. Outdoor power equipment, you mentioned appliances above average. Obviously, that's been a tough category. I think you even mentioned vinyl plank having positive comps. So maybe just speak to some of those categories and where you may be seeing that widening gap. Thanks.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nNo, thanks, Seth. So it's Billy. Listen, as I did mention in our prepared remarks, and we continue to talk about the finance projects, we continue to see ongoing pressure. I don't think that's new news. Having said that, we called out a number of businesses that you just mentioned. Vinyl plank, we saw great performance in both sales and unit comps. Water heaters, as I mentioned. Certainly, paint. We're thrilled with the efforts we've had in paint with the pro that paints and our paint business in total. And again, power across our platforms as well. So non-finance projects, while we did see some softness in some of the seasonal pieces that we alluded to in our prepared remarks, the continued ongoing pressure of just the uncertainty as it relates to interest rates is going to continue to put some pressure on those finance projects.\nBut we're pleased with some of the other pieces I've mentioned. Larger ticket, one-time purchase categories like riders, as an example, we continue to see good engagement in businesses like that as well.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks, guys.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. What do you think the key level for the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage needs to fall to in order to drive Home Depot's business higher? And does that rate change or that level change if the decrease in rates is due to an erosion in the labor market rather than just a moderation in inflation?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nHey, Michael. Good morning. Full question there. Hard to pinpoint what that magical rate number is historically and then, as you say, with some added pressure. All I can do is reference toward the end of last year when rates came off the highs over 7% and moderated down, I think even hit below 6.5% there for a bit. You saw an immediate increase in housing activity, mortgage applications, mortgage refi applications. And then, unfortunately, the rates spiked back up, I think almost to 7% again. So we're trending down again. I think you're approaching 6.5% for qualified mortgage. And based on what we saw toward the end of last year, we would think you're approaching a level that people are going to engage.\nCaveat to that would be, again, this broader economic, geopolitical, and even concerns that people still might pause a little bit until some of this gets sorted out, which would be understandable. But as rates head down toward six, we would expect to see activity. The other thought or piece of this whole puzzle is the amount of folks, as you know, who are in mortgages as low as 3%, plenty of mortgages under 5%. There's definitely a little bit of a golden handcuff dynamic going on with those rates. But again, as time goes on, family dynamic changes. And for one or two years, you might stay in those golden handcuffs and enjoy the low rate, but family size increases, household formation, moves for employment, retirement, etc.\nSo we would see a gradual unlocking of that, even if that adds to a little bit of a delay response to housing from a traditional rate-cut environment.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. My follow-up question is, the longer that this downturn persists, does Home Depot have an inclination to invest more in price or value as a way to grab market share that it could sustain on an eventual upturn? And maybe as a part of this, could you pull apart your updated gross margin guidance to reflect the underlying dynamics within Core Home Depot versus the influence of SRS on this line item? Thank you so much.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nYeah, Michael, thanks. I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll hand it to Richard on the second piece of that question. As it relates to just the promotional activity, I mean, listen, we're going to continue to drive innovation and create value for our consumers. We are in a very rational environment as it relates to the home improvement sector. While there's been some pressure in a category like appliances, we don't see the need nor are in the environment where we need to be more promotional. We're focused on driving innovation and value, creating opportunities for our customers to come into our stores every day. We don't want to be in the promotional business. We feel very good about our position in creating these opportunities and excitement in our stores around just those things. We've seen great adoption.\nWe've been able to bring value into the marketplace. Areas like our proprietary brands continue to perform very well. We're very pleased with that and don't see a change in really the promotional cadence going forward. Now, I'll toss it to Richard more on the gross margin piece.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. Great. So let me actually broaden the question because I think it's important to give the broader context. If you're asking about gross margin, let's just talk about SRS for a moment. So in last June's investor conference, we laid out a base case, and we said that there could be contributors to that base case that would push us to grow sales and earnings faster than that base case, right? So base case was 3%-4% top line and high single digit, mid to high single digit EPS growth. The acquisition of SRS is one of those accelerants that we pointed to in our investor conference, pushing us towards the accelerated case. The objective of SRS is to grow our share with the pro, to accelerate sales growth, to accelerate operating profit growth, and to accelerate EPS growth.\nSo from a sales and operating profit perspective, as you can see, it's already contributing to our company immediately. From an EPS perspective, the acquisition of SRS will be cash EPS accretive in the first 12 months of ownership, as we said in March. It will be cash EPS accretive in the first 12 months of ownership, adjusting for the associated non-cash intangible amortization. So let's talk about how SRS is reflected in our financials. And again, just as a reminder, we include six weeks of results in Q2 from SRS, and we will include about seven months of SRS in our full year. So just thinking about SRS, look, they have a different product mix than Home Depot, right? About 2/3 of their product is roofing, and then the remaining 1/3 is in pool and landscape. SRS carries similar margins on similar products as the Home Depot.\nThose products carry a lower gross margin rate than the Home Depot's company average, but their margin simply reflects a different mix than the Home Depot. And so when we think about gross margin, SRS impacted the second quarter gross margin by about 35 basis points. And if you think about what that means for kind of an annualized figure, you're talking a kind of a reset of our margin profile of about 45 basis points in gross margin. So again, that'll be about 35 basis points for 2024. And then if you look at sort of an annualized figure, it's somewhere around 45 basis points. That's kind of a reset to reflect what is in effect a new mix of product at the Home Depot. So now let's talk about operating margin and SRS's impact because it's important to look at gross margin in that context.\nSo when you add SRS to our mix, it adjusts our base operating margin profile, lowering it by about 30 basis points in Q2, and it lowers our base operating margin profile by just about 40 basis points for the full year of 2024. So that's 40 for the full year of 2024. Again, if you annualize that number, then the adjustment to our base margin from SRS is about 60 basis points for an annual period. And those are GAAP numbers, and we can get into adjusted numbers if you'd like. When we think about gross margin, again, for the quarter, we want to point out several exceptional performances across our operations. First of all, significant transportation benefit brought to us by our supply chain partners and our merchant partners, and significant benefit from a decrease in shrink year over year.\nWe have now put several quarters of shrink benefit versus last year together in a row, and we can point directly at what drives that performance. It's a fantastic team that we continue to invest in, and the returns on those investments are exceptional. That's a long way of saying if you look at our gross margin performance year over year and you back out the SRS mix shift of 35 basis points, we're actually 75 basis points versus last year. An exceptional performance in gross margin across the board by our entire team.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much, and good luck.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning, everyone. I have a question related to reversion. One way to look at it since 2019, if we look at transactions, they look like they're flat to down a little bit. So to Ted's point earlier, most of that looks like it's given back on transactions. Ticket, though, is still up about 30-ish percent, 34%. And I think that's a function of the number of items consumers were putting in the basket and because there was inflation. My question is, if we look at just the inflation piece, are there any signs of product prices either deflating, disinflation, the non-commodity stuff, non-lumber? Any signs of pricing changing in the channel? Thank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nNo, Simeon, thanks for the question. Your math is sort of spot on there. The good news is no. We're not seeing any broad step down in cost or retails. If you look at what we've laid out for AUR this year, we said that we'd have pressure of about 150 basis points of AUR in the first half that would moderate to 50 basis points in the second half. That is all a function of lapping the cost and associated retail moves from last year. There really isn't a lot of net new activity on the cost or the retail front. In fact, sort of cost out and cost in activity. We have a very robust team that works with our merchants on this. It's all pretty neutral right now, not a ton of activity. So as Billy said, we're not going to be promotional.\nWe're an EDLP retailer that has to give value to particularly our pros every day. The cost environment is neutral. The price environment is neutral. We're not seeing a lot of trade down in particular. We're not seeing an increase in OPP penetration. Things are pretty neutral to several last periods of activity. And what we're seeing on the AUR is a matter of lapping. So we're not seeing that, and we would expect the cost levels from where we are today to largely hold as well as the retail levels. Remember, in the cost levels from our supplier base, it's not just a matter of input costs in terms of materials, which you understand with our cost finance team. We have a very, very good view into that. But everyone over the last four years has seen significant increase in labor costs, and we're still working through transportation costs.\nSo that 30, you can say, \"Wow, that's highly inflationary, and that has to come back.\" Well, in fact, the cost structure, with labor being a big component, has increased similarly, and that's why we don't see the marketplace rationally eroding those price levels.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Follow-up, trying to think about what the core business is doing in terms of decremental margins in the second half. I think some of Richard's comments before gave us some more clues, but it looks like the EBIT dollar guidance of the whole business dollars are roughly the same. We have a midpoint now. We had a single point before. So whatever we're losing from the core, it seems like we're picking back up in SRS. And it looks like the decrementals are somewhere around 20%-25%. Is that right? Is that the right run rate if this sort of negative comp or low negative comp environment persists?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nSo what I would do is, why don't we talk about performance to date and how our guidance reflects the performance to date? Because we actually have, as I said, outperformed certain expectations in cost of goods sold, and the team has managed expenses in an exceptional manner. So let me walk through what that means for the guide. You can recall we began the year with a guide of a negative one comp with a 14.1% operating margin. In isolation, if we were to take, well, as we take comp from a negative one to a negative three, that is, call it 25-30 basis points of natural deleverage that we would see in that reduction in top line expectation. However, we've had favorability year to date. We know where it comes from, and that favorability enhances our earnings.\nInstead of taking our 14.1% operating margin, and by the way, I'm excluding SRS in this discussion, so for simplification, if we were to set SRS to the side for a moment, naturally, our 14.1 operating margin would drop to something like a 13.9- a 13.8 at a -3. Instead, at a negative three, again, with SRS to the side, we are now guiding operating margin of 14%. So we have held, in essence, that core 14% operating margin at a negative three comp. That's because we are flowing through benefits that we have created through investments that we've made. Now, if we include SRS in this, obviously, as I said, there's about a 40 basis point mix shift in our operating margin base. So that 14 becomes the 13.6 that we've guided alongside the negative three top end of the range today.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI got it. Makes sense. Thank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nJust to tie it all up together, that 13.6 corresponds with our adjusted operating margin of 13.9%. For the year, when we eliminate non-cash amortization expense on intangible assets, we expect to report operating margin of 13.9% on a comp of -3.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nThanks. Good morning. You just talked about SRS revenue growth in the high single-digit range year to date, which is really strong in this environment. I'm curious, what's driving that success? Were there some acquisitions made by SRS? Has it been all organic? And I guess, how do we think about that growth rate as we move into 2025?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThanks, Chuck. Yes. They remain a robust share-taking grower, and that high single digit is roughly equally split between organic growth and lapping of acquisitions.\nOkay. Great. And any thoughts on how the pace of that will go into 2025?\nYeah. We wouldn't give any guidance into 2025, but remember their mode of growth, which they have demonstrated since inception in the mid-2000s, is they're a balanced grower between comping their existing branches, their open base of branches, opening greenfield branches, and then some roll-up M&A, geographical customer list add-on. So that's the profile that they've grown for years, and that is exactly the profile that we will support going forward. And just for clarity's sake, SRS is not in our comp base, and so they are not reflected in our comp sales guidance. They will become comp once we've owned them for 12 months.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then, Richard, you've talked about the consumer-deferring projects over the past few quarters, but as the prospects for lower rates begin to materialize and we can start to see the line of sight for maybe a 6% mortgage rate, is it possible that the pace of deferrals begins to ramp higher over the next couple of quarters? And if that's the case, what parts of your business do you think could be most exposed?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, intuitively, it's probably the converse of what we've seen. You think about the categories and Billy, please chime in, but those things that are components of the large project, kitchen, bath, flooring, and lighting, are all under pressure. And our customers tell us it's because that large project is being deferred. We're certainly not going to try to call timing. But just to echo what Ted said, there is certainly a direct relationship between decreases in mortgage rates and the amount of activity that you at least see picking up in turnover. And so I think the important point here is, as we've said for years, the long-term fundamentals of home improvement demand are strong. We have continued to invest through this period of moderation. 2024 marks the highest amount of CapEx that we've invested back in the business, really, in the last 15 years because we are bullish on the future.\nTiming is uncertain, but we're going to be ready for it.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question, just with respect to the pace of comps. So the numbers you gave me to compare with them is there was a marked slowdown from June to July. Is there anything that's notable there, or was it just that growing malaise we talked about?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot",
    "content2": "Yeah. Brian, thanks for the question. And to reiterate, in our comps through -3.7, -0.9, and then a -4.9. Well, we did see some softness in July, as we alluded to in Ted's comments. There's no question that the extreme heat took some sales in weather-related categories. Think ACs and fans. Think air circulation. Think watering. Those typically come for us in the July timeframe. And we saw, as I think everyone on the call is aware, we saw a pull forward of that significantly back into June. So it was really just a shift as we saw some of those categories move into the back half of June. And I'll let Richard expand a little bit further.\nYeah. And Brian, Billy's comments were spot on. There were signs of maybe a little more general weakness. The major driver were those heat-related categories. There were some signs of more general weakness. That had an influence on our guidance range. But let's talk about that range and kind of how we've started off the quarter. August has started off at a level consistent with what we would expect in a negative three comp result for the year. And August comps are better than July, right? And so there are a lot of factors that went into our guidance, but again, August has started off at a level consistent with what we would expect in the negative three comp case.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThat's very helpful. I appreciate all that. The second question I have, I guess the bigger picture, but we were talking a lot about SRS. The acquisition now is closed. You're working on the integration. As we're watching Home Depot, this continued push into the professional market, I mean, should we be expecting you to be exploring other acquisition opportunities there?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, Brian, as I said, SRS will continue their activity to fill in geographies and segments, etc. Look, we just made a very large acquisition that we feel great about in early, early days of joint business planning and value creation. We've always talked about utilizing M&A for growth opportunities, whether it's segments, geographies, or customer bases, and expect us to continue to do that, but do not expect us to do anything large having just done this very significant transaction with SRS.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, Ted. Thank you very much.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. It sounds like the Pro Spread widened versus DIY relative to Q1. Curious if there's any call out there? And then you mentioned positive comps for pros engaging in your new ecosystem. I'm curious what percent of pros this now represents and how you'd expect this trajectory to trend now that SRS is under your belt.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior Executive VP, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. Hi, Zach. It's Ann-Marie. And pros certainly outperformed DIY, selfers in the quarter. And as we have mentioned, we continue to invest in the Pro ecosystem to accelerate growth and really drive and grow the share of wallet. I'll throw it over to Chip, and you speak a little bit about the investments and what we're seeing there.\n\nChip Devine\n\nSVP, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Zach. As we've mentioned in the past, we're investing in markets. In the last year, we had 14 markets we invested in. We'll be fully invested in 17 markets this year. When we talk about investing in markets, it's a distribution supply chain capability play, foundational capabilities that help us better serve the pro, and then most importantly, our expansion of our outside sales team. We've seen positive growth in all of those markets since we've been investing, and we see that quarter after quarter. So we're very, very pleased with our progress over the last year and a half as we've marched. We continue to march into 2025 with the same progress and expectation of expansion.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGotcha. And then, Richard, two quick ones. First, on buybacks and how we should think about the timeline around the return. And then second, on the long-term structural margins. You gave some good detail around the impact of SRS. Curious how we should think about the new high watermark in recovery over time.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, let's talk about share repurchases. So as we announced, as part of the SRS acquisition, we financed the acquisition with $10 billion in bond issuances and then some short-term commercial paper raising. We are currently at a 2.6x debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We like to see that ratio around 2.0x. It's our intent to delever over time before we restart repurchases. That's going to take us likely into the year 2026, and we will obviously update our investors on how that looks over time. But that would be kind of the current calculation. Sometime in 2026, we return. And then from a long-term structural perspective, when we laid out our base and accelerated case, we said in the base case, \"Look, we anticipate in the base case that we will always generate some degree of operating leverage.\" And that will always remain true.\nWe're not going to talk about a high watermark. We will continue to update you on our views. For now, we're executing with exceptional expense management, exceptional management in cost of goods sold, and we're over-delivering really on the profitability we would have expected at this top-line rate. We are happy that we're running the business as it should be run. We believe in those base case and accelerated cases that we laid out in June.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thanks for the time.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nChristine, we have time for one more question.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThanks, everyone. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on SRS. Ted, you mentioned the growth rate and broke it down 50/50 between comps and, I think you said, lapping acquisition. So maybe just give us an update on where the branch count is today. And then how would you sort of summarize the capital spending needs of that business to fund both greenfield and acquisition-related expansion as it's included in the CapEx guidance? Thank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nSure. The good news is on their greenfield operations; it's reasonably capital-light. They lease a more modest-sized facility than a Home Depot DC would be. Think of this as a branch operation. High-turning inventory and variable pay for the sales force. They tend to be break-even in year one of operation. Similarly, when they make infill acquisitions, they have a great process to get that acquisition up on their ERP system. They literally do it over the weekend. They acquire a company on a Friday, and when that company opens up on a Monday, they are on the core ERP system of SRS. That lets them get the operating process in technology synergies very quickly. They have a track record of doubling EBITDA of acquired companies in the first three years of ownership. It's reasonably asset-light.\nIt's quickly profitable on a greenfield basis, and it's multiples of earnings expansion in an acquired company. Since we've owned them, they've made, in fact, I think last Friday, they closed on a small pool deal. They have a couple more under LOI. So these are modest infill acquisitions that they do in the normal course of business. So we're really excited to watch them grow. And again, it's reasonably asset-light on greenfield. And the multiples they're paying, as you can imagine, on smaller regional companies are generally in single-digit EBITDA multiples. So nice earnings profile on their acquisition case.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nRichard, maybe just a very quick follow-up as we think about sort of restating last year's numbers for intangible amortization. The full-year amount for last year, we're looking at 15 basis points as a percentage of sales, or maybe correct me if I'm off there.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. The total amortization expense last year was $186 million for Home Depot for the full year of 2023.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nSteve, on branches, they're at about 775. When we announced in March, it was 760. You can see their growth profile. They've opened 20+ branches just in the last few months. These folks are super growth-oriented.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nGreat to hear. Thank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you. Ms. Janci, I will now turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot's Q1 2024 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations Department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentation will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Isabel. Good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $36.4 billion, down 2.3% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 2.8% from the same period last year. Our US stores had negative comps of 3.2%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.63 in the first quarter compared to $3.82 in the first quarter last year. The team executed at a high level in the quarter and continued to grow market share. While the quarter was impacted by a delayed start to spring, and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects, we feel great about our store readiness, product assortment, and associate engagement. Our associates are energized and ready to serve our customers as spring breaks across the country. As you will hear from Billy, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects.\nIn addition, our focus remains on creating the best interconnected experience, growing Pro wallet share with a differentiated set of capabilities, and building new stores. Driving sales growth with our Pro customers remains one of our top focus areas. Remember, we operate in a $45 trillion asset class, which represents the installed base of homes in the United States. We serve a highly fragmented, addressable market of approximately $1 trillion. Within that TAM, the greatest opportunity is with the residential Pro contractor who shops across many categories of home improvement products while working on complex projects. We've defined that specific opportunity as an approximately $250 billion TAM, of which we have relatively little share today. We also know that to effectively serve this TAM, we need an expanded set of capabilities and services that we refer to as our Pro ecosystem.\nWhile the store remains the center of that ecosystem, we are developing more fulfillment options, a dedicated sales force, specific digital assets, trade credit, and order management capabilities geared at the residential Pro who shops across categories. As we've shared with you before, our more mature markets with this Pro ecosystem have seen great success, so we're expanding to other markets. As you heard last quarter, we'll have the foundational elements of our ecosystem in 17 markets by the end of the fiscal year. While these 17 markets are currently at different maturity levels, they are outperforming our other large Pro markets in aggregate. Earlier this quarter, we announced our intent to acquire SRS, a residential specialty trade distributor with a leading position in three large, highly fragmented specialty trade verticals serving the roofer, the pool contractor, and the landscape professional.\nSRS is complementary to the ecosystem we've been building, giving us another avenue to more effectively serve the complex project occasion. They also give us the right to win with a specialty trade Pro customer. SRS does an exceptional job serving the specialty trade Pro who typically only shops one category and needs specialized capabilities to complete their project. In addition, SRS is an exceptionally well-run business with a world-class management team. As we build out our own ecosystem, we can leverage their expertise and deep product catalog in the verticals in which they operate. We have significant growth opportunities in front of us, and we are very happy with the operational execution in our core business. Despite pressure in the market, we continue to invest in our business.\nWe are gaining share of wallet with our customers, whether they are shopping in our stores, on our digital assets, or through our Pro ecosystem. Our merchants, store and merch teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams are always ready to serve in any environment. They did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. And I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSEVP, The Home Depot\n\nThanks, Ted. Good morning, everyone. As we head into our biggest selling season, our associates continue to be engaged, excited, and ready to serve our customers. As Ted mentioned, growing share of wallet with the Pro and winning the Pros working on complex projects continues to be our largest growth opportunity. We know that delivering the best shopping experience for any purchase occasion is critical to our success. That is why we continue to invest in our Pro sales teams and capabilities. We have developed new capabilities within our Pro intelligence tool, which feeds our CRM platform and leverages data science to bring better insight to our sales teams. These tools are helping us to both assist in identifying the optimal Pro targets in a market as well as the highest value cross-selling opportunities to drive action and sales.\nAnother critical component of the shopping experience is being in stock with the right products and ensuring those products are on shelf and available for sale. We've talked to you before about Sidekick and computer vision and are thrilled with the results we've seen so far. This year, we will continue to lean in to improve our OSA and drive productivity by creating consistent, actionable, and directed tasks for our associates. What's really exciting is how we are also now leveraging computer vision for other applications across the store. For example, computer vision helps us maintain the integrity of our base by ensuring that the product on the shelf meets our quality standards. Maintaining high-quality, damage-free product is a key component of delivering on the customer experience. Additionally, we have also deployed this technology in our self-checkout corral to help us mitigate shrink.\nComputer vision can identify complex carts or high-value carts and signal a cashier to help the customer with their basket to ensure all products are scanned and accounted for. While we will continue to improve upon all these technology-enabled applications, we are thrilled with the early results we're seeing. Last quarter, we talked with you about one of our areas of opportunity within our post-sale experience, specifically within our returns process. I'm excited to update you that over 70% of online orders are now able to be self-service returned from their My Account profile on our website. Now, our customers can create their own return of an online order and drop it off at a UPS with a scan of a barcode. Later this year, we will enable job site pickup for returns back to our FTC, which will be a game changer for our Pro shopping experience.\nThis enhancement will allow our customers, primarily the residential Pro, to initiate a return from their job site versus having to return big and bulky items to the store. This is a massive win, not only for our Pros but also for our associates, and our stores, and will drive better customer satisfaction and greater store productivity. These initiatives are just a few examples of the different ways we're improving the shopping experience for our customers and our associates. I am so excited about all we are doing to drive sales in our stores, and I look forward to the opportunity that's ahead of us. None of this would be possible without our amazing associates, and I want to thank them for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during Q1, our sales were impacted by a delayed start to spring and continued softness in certain larger discretionary projects. However, where weather was favorable, we saw good customer engagement and strength in outdoor projects. Before providing commentary on our comp performance, it's important to note that we made some merchandising department changes to more closely reflect how our customers shop our categories and better align with our merchandising growth efforts. We now have 16 departments, up from 14 previously, and have separated electrical and lighting, and kitchen and bath.\nAdditionally, we have renamed our tools department to Power and included outdoor power equipment to capture synergies and maximize the strength of our battery-powered platforms. Turning to our department comp performance for the first quarter, our building materials and power departments posted positive comps, while outdoor garden, paint, lumber, plumbing, and hardware were all above the company average. During the first quarter, our comp transactions decreased 1.5%, and comp average tickets decreased 1.3%. However, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products. Big ticket comp transactions, those over $1,000, were down 6.5% compared to the first quarter of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund the project, such as kitchen and bath remodels.\nTurning to total company online sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 3.3% compared to the first quarter of last year. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the first quarter, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. We are incredibly focused on removing friction for our customers to create an excellent interconnected shopping experience. We continue to work on improving our online search functionality and serving the most relevant product offerings to our customers. To do this, we rolled out an intent-based search engine that combines keywords, behaviors, and intent to deliver more targeted results. We enhanced our filtering capabilities, improving the customer's ability to find exactly what they're looking for. All of these initiatives work together to drive strong results in our online business.\nPro and DIY customers' performance was relatively in line with one another, but both were negative for the quarter. While Pro backlogs remain relatively stable, we hear from our pros that homeowners continue to take on smaller projects. The investments we are making are resonating with our pros as we see increased engagement. For example, we have made significant progress with the Pro Who Paints and continue to see share gains with this customer. Our partnerships with Bayer and PPG, as well as enhanced capabilities around our in-store service and job site delivery capabilities, are helping to remove friction from their experience. During the end of Q1, we hosted our annual Spring Black Friday and Spring Gift Center events and saw strong performance across both events. Our merchants did a fantastic job curating the best products, and we saw strong engagement with our customers throughout the events.\nWe are pleased with the results we saw, particularly in categories like riding lawnmowers and outdoor power equipment, where we had experienced some discretionary pull forward over the last couple of years. The trend away from gas to battery-powered products is continuing, and we are well-positioned with our assortment. We have the brands our customers are looking for, whether it's Ryobi, Milwaukee, DeWalt, Makita, or Ridgid. We estimate that there are nearly 500 million batteries in the market today, and our assortment covers the vast majority of these batteries. In fact, more than 70% of batteries are with brands that are exclusive to the Home Depot in the big box channel. With hundreds of products across each of these platforms, this is one of the best loyalty programs that keeps customers coming back to the Home Depot. Our live goods category looks incredible.\nWe are ready for spring with everything from shrubs to a variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables for every type of gardener. We're excited about spring breaking across the country, and we remain ready to help our customers with all of their outdoor projects and outdoor living needs. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $36.4 billion, a decrease of approximately 2.3% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were -2.8%, with comps of -4% in February, -0.8% in March, and -3.3% in April. Comps in the US were -3.2% for the quarter, with comps of -4.8% in February, -1.3% in March, and -3.6% in April. For the quarter, Mexico posted positive comps, whereas Canada was slightly below the company average. In the first quarter, our gross margin was 34.1%, an increase of approximately 45 basis points from the first quarter last year, primarily driven by benefits from lower transportation costs and shrink. During the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 140 basis points to 20.2% compared to the first quarter of 2023.\nThe increase was primarily driven by a benefit from a legal settlement that we are overlapping from the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as well as deleverage from our top-line results. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 13.9% compared to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Interest and other expense for the first quarter decreased by $13 million to 428 million. In the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 22.6% compared to 24.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.63, a decrease of 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter, we opened two new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,337. Retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million sq ft.\nAt the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.4 billion, down approximately $3 billion, or 12%, compared to the first quarter of 2023, and inventory turns were 4.5 times, up from 3.9 times last year. Turning to capital allocation, during the first quarter, we invested approximately $850 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. During the quarter, we paid approximately $2.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $600 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As a reminder, in March, we announced our intent to acquire SRS Distribution, and as a result, we paused share repurchases. As you've heard us say many times, we maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation, and that is not changing. First and foremost, we will invest in the business and expect capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis.\nAfter investing in the business, we plan to pay the dividend, and it is our intent to return any excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. From time to time, we will also invest in the business through acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and to accelerate our strategic objectives. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 37.1%, down from 43.6%, excuse me, down from 43.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Now I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2024. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, our guidance does not currently reflect any impact from the announced acquisition of SRS. The acquisition is currently under regulatory review, and we expect it to close by the end of fiscal 2024.\nWe expect total sales growth to outpace comp sales, with sales growth of approximately 1% and comp sales of approximately -1%. Total sales growth will benefit from a 53rd week, and we expect the 53rd week will contribute approximately $2.3 billion in sales. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.9%, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. We expect operating margin of approximately 14.1%. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion, and our diluted earnings per share growth is targeted to be approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2023. It is our intent to update guidance as appropriate once the SRS transaction closes. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment.\nThe investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market, and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call. Christine, we are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.

You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from a line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. Can you talk about how you think the bathtub effect could play out? Do you have a sense of how much maybe the weather was a net headwind this year, understanding that last spring was also wonky? And related to that, Billy mentioned being pleased with spring, where the weather was good, and some positive commentary and some early COVID winning categories. So where there was normal weather, did you see comps maybe get flat or maybe up around the spring business? Thanks.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nHey, good morning, Chris. Wonky is a great word to describe this spring. We can't really point to one geography that has had consistently good weather, but yes, certain markets, particularly in some of the northernmost markets where we've had some good weekends, business was just incredible. That's really what powered the positive comp in our power business. A lot of that is driven by outdoor power equipment. We talk a lot about the battery platforms and the brands we have, and customers are really responding to that category. But we just haven't had the consistent weather across the country. We were looking for much improved Western division this year, given how bad weather was last year in the West, but that really didn't happen. So the bathtub is in effect, but we still have a long way to go.\nOur biggest selling weeks are ahead of us, and certainly hope for some drier weather and sunnier days. But Billy, maybe you can add some commentary.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. No, thanks for the question, Chris. And as Ted mentioned, I mean, if you go back, we knew that there was pull forward in a lot of discretionary categories, single-item purchases, if you will. And we're really pleased to see some of those businesses more normalized to the cyclical cycle of what you would typically see. And there's no question that that had been an impact, certainly last year. And so really pleased with seeing some of that. Yes, where the weather's been great, which hasn't been, or consistent, I should say, we've seen great customer engagement. I mentioned our Spring Black Friday event, our Spring Gift Center events. We've seen great customer engagement there. And there's still the continued pressure that we see in financed big projects, as I called out in Kitchen and Bath, specifically in the kind of remodeling finance projects.\nBut really pleased with some of the customer engagement and some of those pull forward categories so far.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust to dig in on that a little bit, on the big tickets, or two sides of the coin, is the big tickets finance project business. Did it get worse because rates spiked? On the other side, categories like garden equipment, grills, and patio, are you seeing any emergence of replacement cycle where you could see maybe those categories start to get back to flat, if not up?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nChris, this is Richard. So just from a year-over-year perspective, we saw big ticket pressure last Q1, which was more of the item purchase as customers deferred those sort of item purchases. We saw big ticket pressure this Q1 as well, and yet the dynamic had changed. And the dynamic really that we began to see towards the back half of last year was this deferral of large projects like Billy called out. So the pressure in those categories has actually increased. It's a different story of Q1, 2023 versus 2024. And maybe, Billy, you talk about particular categories.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. Again, the kitchen and bath remodel project, cabinets and so forth, I mean, anything that's financed, we continue to see even a little bit more pressure. Conversely, and you just mentioned, Chris, some of the categories, more item buying.\nI mean, the category like riding mower is well over $1,000 purchase. And we're seeing just in a few categories like that, terrific customer engagement. Again, we had pull forward, but we're really pleased with some of those specific item purchases, even the ones that are over $1,000, as I mentioned, riding mowers and some other categories where we've seen really back to that cyclical customer engagement. So we're really pleased with some of those pieces that we're seeing in the business.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Have a great rest of spring.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. My first is a macro, and I'm going to follow up with a micro. I want to ask your opinion on lock-in effect versus turnover. Is it if it's clear that we need turnover now for stronger demand? If you can talk about demand in regions of the country where pricing is more noticeably going up than others, seeing if there is a real lock-in effect that can happen. The contingency is, if we don't get rate decreases, what sort of normal could look like?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nSo Simeon, I think you have to think about this short-term and longer-term. So if we think about lock-in effect and the impact of housing turnover, clearly, we've seen two years of significant decrease in housing turnover to the point where we're at really sort of historical lows. And most folks think that that can't get much lower. When you're thinking about current performance, obviously, that puts pressure on our business. When a customer buys or sells a home, they spend more in that year than in a year when they don't. And so there's no doubt that we're missing some of that project demand, and that's what's weighing on our sales as we had anticipated. Then you have to ask yourself, though, the lock-in effect, the interest rate environment. At this point, a lot of it's subject to the macro.\nI think the question is, at what point current interest rates become sort of the new normal? This is not something that we're making a prediction on. It's just thinking about behavior. At some point, spend on housing shifts from discretionary to something that you simply must do. We know that there's pent-up demand for household formation. And so again, I'd say short-term, it is having an impact on our customers' mindset. And it's not just housing turnover-related spend. It's really all large projects. As Billy said, sort of debt finance spend, where we are seeing interest rates sort of weigh on the mind of customers. And look, we're not immune to this. If you look at the national figures on what's really driving the consumer right now, it's services. Goods are underperforming services, and durable goods are seeing the most pressure, and in particular, home-related categories.\nThis is not a surprise, and this is baked into our expectations for the year. The question will be how it evolves over time.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Yeah, that's helpful, Richard. My follow-up, transactions still negative, but on a stacked, it looks like they're getting a little better if we're not overreading it. And that's despite the spring weather not breaking yet. So if you look at your transactions on an improving trend line, is that industry bottoming getting better, or is that Home Depot taking share?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, those are challenging to tease out. I would say our sense is we are taking share. That's from third-party reporting on 4441. But transactions, I think you have two dynamics going on, and they relate to your prior question, Simeon. We've talked about the COVID, and the lap of the COVID is sort of like the giant storm and the hurricane. For a couple of years after you've pulled so much demand forward, you suffer from lower sales in those categories. That's what we were talking about last year. When Billy was just reviewing this item buying, there was no doubt grills, riders, and patio sets, these big ticket items were pulled forward. We're seeing now that sort of naturally lap, sort of like that hurricane effect lapping.\nWhat is newer, and we've chatted about this before, is the housing turnover, which, while historically not a huge driver of demand, is steady-state demand; housing turnover is fairly steady. But in the last 18-odd months, that has dropped from over six million units a year. I think at some run rates in certain months, it was even under four million. That dramatic decrease in housing activity is sort of the newer hurricane, if you will. And we don't see that going much lower. It's hard to predict, but as Richard said, tough to call the macro. But at some point, people will start to lap the interest rates and the lock-in effect. We've already seen percentages of houses with mortgages and all the various interest rate strata. The percentage that we're in that under 3.5% is past peak.\nSo you're already starting to see a bit of an unlock there. But all of that then leads to your transaction question. So we are starting to see some increase in transactions as we're lapping more of the COVID pull forward, some newer pressure with the housing turnover dynamic. But net-net, we like the trend of transactions in units per basket. We're also up, and we like seeing that trend as well. So not unexpected, as Richard said, and all baked into our guidance for 2024.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nJust to add to that, you think about how we're performing in spite of large projects having seen the pressure. If you just look at debt financing and you look at some of the statistics around where we're sitting, HELOC withdrawals or HELOC borrowing is down 23% year-over-year. That's a Q4 statistic, but I think we're in the same territory in Q1. In dollars, that's dropping somewhere from $70 billion-ish a quarter to $50 billion-ish a quarter. And you look at cash-out refinancing is down 14% year-over-year. In dollars, those peaked around $80 billion, and they were $17 billion last quarter. And so you've got a significant drop, more than 75% from peak to where we are today. And so that's, to us, interesting context for the fact that transactions have actually begun to recover on a sequential basis. So we're punching through the environment.\nIn some respects, as Ted said, the macro has been against us for a little while now. You could almost say those statistics are stabilizing, at least on the bottom.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning, and thank you. I want to start with a clarification on the outlook. You've got 1% EPS growth. I just want to confirm that this incorporates the buyback pause post Q1. And then second, transaction growth stepping in the right direction. Curious if this was more pro or DIY-driven or both, and any color on the health of small and mid-sized pros versus larger pros.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nGreat. So Zach, I'll take the first part. It's Richard. So look, as we have reiterated guidance and see no reason to do anything but that. And when you think about the pause and charity purchases, think about the fact that we're also accumulating cash. As we accumulate cash, we earn interest on that cash. You'll see on our balance sheet, we have over $4 billion in cash right now, which is around $3 billion higher than last year. So given where short-term interest rates are, that interest income is a really strong offset to the impact from pause charity purchases. And therefore, the net of it wouldn't change our guidance.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nOn the Pro DIY, each were negative for the quarter, more or less the same rate. Within Pro, the larger Pro continues to outperform, particularly those engaging in the ecosystem. I'll let Chip comment some more about our performance there.\n\nChip Devine\n\nSVP of Outside Sales, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Zach. Where we've expanded our capabilities around our supply chain capabilities and the expansion of our outside sales teams, we've seen noticeable outperformance in those markets and positive comps. So very pleased with that march of expansion. As we move into this next nine months, we'll expand in another three FTC markets that we've mentioned, one in LA, one in Detroit, and one in San Antonio. So we're very pleased with our progress.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Appreciate the color. Then, Richard, quickly, it looks like your SG&A on a per-store basis was about flat year-over-year when you exclude the legal impact. I'm curious if this is the right way to think about productivity this year or if you have any other levers at your disposal through the year.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, look, I again would encourage you to look at our full-year guidance because operating expense management can vary quarter to quarter. Obviously, we wanted to make sure that we were fully staffed in our stores. And as we said, we had a little bit later start to spring than we would have liked. And so but we wanted to make sure that we were right there in front of our customer. We had other favorability. I mean, hats off to all our teams driving productivity throughout the portfolio, but in that particular point, operating expense is controlled by our operations team. They just did a fantastic job late in the quarter. And that's all baked into the reaffirmation of guidance.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks so much for the time.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys. The scope of the answer here might be a little beyond this conversation. In general, can you talk about how you plan to utilize SRS and their discrete set of Pro relationships to potentially leverage your broader complex Pro initiatives?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nSure, Scot. First and foremost, SRS is just a great company operating in three large, highly fragmented markets. So we talked about our TAM being $950 billion at the investor conference. With SRS in their market of roofing, specialty trade, pool, and landscape, that opens up $50 billion increased TAM, where they're a strong number two in each of those segments. So just a well-run company in three great growth markets where they have strong share positions. So first and foremost, you get capability that lets you engage and win in a completely new TAM. How it's complementary to what we're doing, all the things that we are building, they have as a distributor.\nWe've been a retailer for 45 years, and we're building wholesale capability, things like trade credit, things like much more robust on-time and complete delivery to job sites, things like order management, things like incentivized field sales forces. So these are all things that they've done for years, and we look forward to being able to engage with them and learn from them. But then they can also serve our customers. I mean, our customers will benefit from their deep, broad catalogs in those verticals, and we can cross-sell their product into our residential-focused pro customers. So we look at this as just a great opportunity to expand market, to expand capabilities, and to better service our customers.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nVery helpful. And then just hopefully a quickie. You talked about being in 17 markets by end of year for the complex Pro capabilities. How many markets do you ultimately see that capability rolled out to? It's 17 going to X.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nI mean, we would expect over time to be in, we often talk about the top 40 kind of 80/20 rule of demand in our space, and that would be the expectation.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nAwesome. Thanks a lot, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. In light of the start to the year, did you give any internal discussion to moderating your expectation around the way the rest of the year could unfold, especially in light of what's likely to be now fewer rate cuts than was expected 90 days ago, which may mean that the overall rate of home improvement, the market may see less of an acceleration from here?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. Michael, we're not Fed watchers here necessarily. And we said at the beginning of this year that we had a neutral stance on housing. We weren't going to take a bet on cuts or how many cuts. And that hasn't changed. What we are focused on and what our internal discussions do evolve around is our level of execution in the core business. And as I said, we couldn't be happier with how engaged this team is and how well we executed during the quarter.\nIf I can just take a minute to rattle off a few of these telltales, when you think what Hector has done in the stores in terms of shrink and leveraging our wage investments to getting attrition way down, which is helping with safety instances, what we're doing with technology and process in the store that Ann mentioned in her remarks about not just the better in-stock that the supply chain's delivering, but the actual on-shelf availability that all our tools are delivering, our supply chain and merchant teams, what an incredible job in the face of negative comps. They took out $3 billion of inventory at cost, increased our turnover 60 basis points to 4.5 times, and increased in-stock and on-shelf availability levels. I mean, that is just incredible performance. Then add our price position. We talked about prices having settled in the marketplace.\nWe're not any more promotional this year, but our overall price position with that roller coaster that we experienced during the COVID years, we're as well positioned on price and value and innovative products as we've been in some time. Then productivity in general remains a flywheel of the Home Depot. A lot of that SG&A leverage that you noticed and we delivered was the efficiency in the model in having executed that $500 million in cost out that we signaled at the end of last year. So Michael, that's what we focus on internally is controlling what we can control. That's why I'm just so pleased with this team and their high level of execution in the quarter.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you for that, Ted. My follow-up is there is a school of thought out there that the SRS acquisition could be a sign that Home Depot's efforts to address the complex pro segment of the market has just proved to be a little bit more difficult than what was originally expected. How would you respond to that?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, I'd respond to say what we are doing to capture Pro wallet share with wholesale distribution capabilities is challenging, which is why no one's done it before. But we are doing it, and we are succeeding in it, and we like what we see, and that's why we continue to roll out to additional markets. We also know it's a journey. This isn't open up a DC. Building a physical DC is about the simplest thing for us to do in our whole ecosystem that we're building. But it is putting together all the pieces of the ecosystem and introducing our customers to those capabilities. And as we've said before, as we introduce customers to the capabilities, it is a linear relationship between increased comp and increased engagement with those capabilities. So we're still optimistic, green, and progressing on our organic efforts.\nSRS really is a completely different discussion in that a terrific asset and management team was brought to our attention that opened up a specialty distribution TAM that they have just a terrific position in. So at the end of the day, we keep reminding ourselves that we service a $45 trillion asset class with a $1 trillion TAM, with the Home Depot at only about $150 billion in sales. We have so much share to gain with our consumers, in-store online shopping, with our existing pros who largely shop our stores with this complex purchase occasion with larger pros that we're building out the ecosystem. And now SRS gives us a whole new white space to go play in three other verticals to take even more share. So very, very different propositions.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much and good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nEquity Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks a lot. I'm curious on the DIY side. Have you seen any changes in spending between income cohorts? As a follow-up, you spoke to the late start to spring. Curious, a few weeks here into the month of May, maybe you could frame out how business is tracking relative to the first quarter or April.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nSo on the income cohorts, it's actually really more about project size than it is about income cohort right now. And as I said, as we said, the majority of the demand pressure is in those larger projects. And that really sort of spreads itself across cohorts. You could even say that that almost tends to show as pressure in higher income cohorts. As we said before, though, what this seems to be is it's not the inability to fund projects. It's a deferral mindset. You have this odd irony of every soundbite you read, well, interest rates are coming down soon. Our customers tell us, \"Hey, with that in mind, with that on the horizon, we're just going to wait.\" And so that's really the most important dynamic from an income perspective.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. And then, Chuck, just on the first couple of weeks of May, I mean, it really has been the same story. Weather's been favorable. We've seen great customer engagement, strength in outdoor projects. Really pleased with what we've seen with the weather's been favorable, which is my prepared remarks, the same kind of dynamic we saw through, especially later in the quarter as the weather got a little bit better in certain parts of the country.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nEquity Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay. Thanks very much. And then, Richard, once you spoke to confirming the 33.9% gross margin rate for the year, is there anything today that makes you feel better or maybe worse about the underlying assumptions that got you there 90 days ago in terms of shrink, transportation, mix?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nI think we're executing on all cylinders. From a transportation perspective, from the merchants managing retail and costs through one of the most vulnerable periods last year in our history, fantastic results. Then just to add to it, look, with respect to shrink, shrink is a problem for retail. Organized retail crime is not going away. It's a problem for all of us. The external environment is only getting tougher. As a result, we've done a tremendous amount of work. It is amazing, the effort put forth by our teams in making investments that pay off with significant return on investment. So when we look at our shrink performance, I hate to say this, but the external environment is not helping. Our teams are succeeding in blunting the impact. It's still a problem. It's still a pressure in our P&L.\nWe want to keep attacking it, but we know that we've got the best in the business facing it. It's not only a return on investment in terms of financial performance. It's a return on investment from a customer and associate safety perspective. So we're really happy about that. I think that there's one dynamic. You ask about margin. There's a dynamic here that I think is worth calling out when you think about the shape of the year, so I'll just go there. It is not insignificant when you think about the price dynamic last year and how we saw retail settle in the market during the first half of 2023 and then essentially become what we would call settled during the second half of 2023, which has continued into Q1 and Q2 of this year.\nSo when you think about the AUR pressure within ticket, we reported ticket in spite of AUR pressure that is in essence about two percentage points this quarter, year-over-year. What I want to remind you of is that's a year-over-year comparison. So we had kind of the height of, well, let's put it a different way. We had a lot of retail and cost settling during the first half of the year. So that 2% pressure is an artifact of a year-over-year measurement. It is not an observation on what prices are doing today, and they're relatively steady. As we move through the year, that pressure halves from Q1 to Q2. So you'll have about one percentage point of pressure in Q2. It'll have again in Q3 and then in essence be gone in Q4.\nYou asked the question about margin, but I think that is a point with respect to shape of the year that is important to put out there.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nEquity Analyst, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat. Thanks very much, Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Retail Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I want to follow up on Michael Lasser's question. Can you just help us understand what drives the second half improvement in same-store sales? Just given the fact that the first half has been a little bit softer here with this delayed start to spring.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, the primary factor is actually AUR, which we just outlined. So if you think about pressure going from the beginning of the year in Q1 of two percentage points to sort of falling to zero by the end of the year, that's really the majority of the arithmetic with respect to the year.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Retail Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. And then to follow up on gross margin, maybe it's a question for Billy. Spring Black Friday did well. We did notice there was a new spring sale from an online-only competitor. Do you think the promotional environment's changing at all? I guess especially on the DIY side of the business as you try to compete for that customer.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. So I'll speak to the promotional piece, and thanks for the question. Listen, we're in a very rational market, and it's important to note that when we do events, we do events to drive excitement, to drive foot traffic at certain times of the year, no different than most folks do a Black Friday event. But we're doing that to drive excitement, bring value to the marketplace. We're not putting stuff, pulsing stuff on sale. The promotional business, as it stands today in 2024, looks exactly like it did pre-COVID and before. It's no different. In fact, we've talked about appliances a little bit, but the environment really is normalized to what it was pre-COVID. And I think it's, again, important to note that we do that to drive excitement, footsteps, and absolutely try to bring value to our customers at these key times of the selling year.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector of Retail Equity Research, Citi\n\nOkay. Thanks for the detail.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nSenior Sell-side Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first question, and I apologize. I know this can be a bit repetitive to at least a couple of the prior questions, but so I'll maybe ask a little bit different way. As you look at today, you reiterated guidance for 2024. As you think about what we see, what transpired, so to say, in Q1, we talked a lot through the call about the macro pressures, the macro disruptions still impacting Home Depot. So the question I have is, to get to that guidance, the guidance you've reiterated today, do you need some type of change, some type of solidification in the macro environment from what you're seeing today?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nNo, Brian. Really, the only impact here was a delayed spring, and we managed this business in halves. And no matter when spring comes, it always comes, and it never impacts our annual results or guidance. So that's why we reaffirm today.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nSenior Sell-side Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Then my second question, with some of the macro guidance, there's more chatter out there about a potential reemergence, if you will, of inflationary pressures. So I guess the question I have for you is, within your business, particularly maybe more the commodity side of this, are you starting to see this, A? And then B, as you think about to the extent that we are seeing potentially some type of reemergence in inflation, how do you view at this juncture the ability of Home Depot to pass those type of costs along to consumers as it has in the past?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nIf you look at the national statistics and you actually parse inflation, inflation is being driven in the goods space, sorry, the services space, not in the goods space, and particularly not in home improvement categories, maybe just talk about observations.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. From a commodity standpoint, Brian, we've seen no impact. Obviously, we talked a lot in the last year about not only lumber but copper, and we're pleased with the fact that there's no impact on commodities at this point and see a very stable environment.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nSenior Sell-side Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nVery helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nChristine, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nGood morning, everyone. I was hoping maybe to just expand on the weakness in certain discretionary projects such as kitchen and bath. Any way to help us better understand if there's line of sight to stabilization in the project size headwind this year and/or pressure rolling off? Meaning, is it cycling comps still, or are you still seeing project size moderate, right, relative to some baseline, whether it's a year ago or sort of from peak levels?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. I mean, for sure, the single biggest pressure outside of the AUR that Richard went through was from discretionary larger decor-oriented projects. And as we've said, last year, it was more of an item story. This year, it's more of a discretionary, generally finance story. If you take something like kitchen cabinets and countertops, I mean, those are probably the only categories where we've seen not just some falloff in projects and size of projects, but actually a little bit of trading down. So it's focused on those categories. That's the only place we've seen it and are seeing it. That too will pass. I mean, I think that is now going through. We've always had the idea that if turnover would drop, people would improve in place. I think we're still seeing the fallout from the turnover being down so dramatically.\nI mean, it was just six months ago that interest rates hit their peak in October 2023, mortgage rates. So those are the type of projects. You move into a new house, you update your kitchen, you update a master bathroom, etc. And then if you are going to stay in place and take on those type of projects outside of a move, you're generally going to finance. And as we've seen, the rates tick up, and the impact of rates ticking up, that's impacting that demand. So right now, you would see a lap of that dynamic. We don't see housing turnover going lower. And then the question is interest rates. What does happen to interest rates in higher for longer? What does that mean? You guys know as much as we do on that score.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nAnd then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think it was Chip's comments earlier about the pro comp, right, being positive. I believe he said within those markets that are servicing the complex pro. So maybe just clarifying if that's what he said. And does that imply that you've seen a widening in the performance gap between those markets where you're servicing the complex pro versus the company average, maybe relative to what you guys stated at the Analyst Day last year?\n\nChip Devine\n\nSVP of Outside Sales, The Home Depot\n\nYeah. Just reaffirming what I said. We have seen positive comps in those markets where we've invested in sales professionals and our FTC markets.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nChip Devine\n\nSVP of Outside Sales, The Home Depot\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Mr. Janci, I would now like to hand the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nThank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in August.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThank you Isabel and good morning everyone. As you'll hear from the team shortly, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was largely in line with our expectations for fiscal 2023. Sales were $152.7 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Comp sales 3.2% versus last year, and our US stores had negative comps of 3.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $15.11 compared to $16.69 in the prior year.\nAfter three years of exceptional growth for our business, 2023 was a year of moderation. It was also a year of opportunity. We focused on several operational improvements to strengthen the business while also staying true to the growth opportunities detailed at our investor conference in June. As we reflect on 2023, we are better positioned in four key areas: we invested in our associates, the heartbeat of our company, and the stewards of customer service, effectively manage disinflation while maintaining a strong value proposition for our customers, rightsized our inventory position and increased in-stock and on-shelf availability levels, and we reduced fixed costs in the business that were introduced during the pandemic. As you know, at the beginning of 2023 we announced an approximately $1 billion investment in increased annualized compensation for our frontline hourly associates.\nThis allowed us to improve customer service, position ourselves favorably in the market, attract and retain the most qualified talent, drive greater efficiency and productivity across the business, and improve safety broadly. We also navigated a unique disinflationary environment. We did this by leveraging our best-in-class cost, finance team, and merchants to effectively manage cost movements while also being our customer's advocate for value, and we believe prices have essentially settled in the marketplace. After several years of unprecedented sales growth, we entered 2023 with more inventory than we would have preferred. While the products we sell have low obsolescence, our teams work throughout the year to improve inventory productivity while delivering the highest in-stock and on-shelf availability rates since the pandemic. Today, we feel very good about our inventory position heading into 2024.\nProductivity and efficiency are hallmarks of The Home Depot, and as you heard at our investor conference in June, we announced our commitment to reduce fixed costs by approximately $500 million to be fully realized in 2024. We've now taken the necessary actions to achieve this cost benefit, which Richard will detail in a moment as we look forward to 2024. We remain focused on our strategic opportunities of creating the best interconnected experience, growing our Pro wallet share through our unique ecosystem of capabilities, and building new stores. In December 2023, we made a strategic acquisition of Construction Resources, a leading distributor of design-oriented surfaces, appliances, and architectural specialty products for Pro contractors focused on renovation, remodeling, and residential home building. This acquisition adds to our robust product offering of products and services.\nIt allows our Complex Pros to easily shop across aesthetic product categories in a showroom setting, which is how they are accustomed to shopping for these types of goods. We are excited to welcome Construction Resources into the Home Depot family.\nIn 2024. We will continue learning and building out new capabilities for the Complex Pro. We are expanding our assortments, fulfillment options, and our outside sales force and just recently began piloting trade credit options. In addition, we continue to work on new order management capabilities to better manage Complex Pro orders for the Complex Pro opportunity. This means that by the end of 2024 we will have 17 of our top Pro markets equipped with new fulfillment options, localized product assortment, an expanded sales force, and enhanced digital capabilities with trade credit and order management in pilot or development. What I hope you take away today is how great we feel about our business and how well we are positioning the business for the future. We remain excited about the opportunity to grow our share of a fragmented $950 billion plus market.\nOur associates and supplier partners have continually demonstrated agility and resilience, and I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior EVP, Home Depot\n\nThanks Ted and good morning everyone. I couldn't be more pleased with our operational excellence and the investments we continue to make in the business. As you heard from Ted, we remain focused on three main strategic opportunities: creating the best interconnected experience, growing our Pro wallet share through our unique ecosystem of capabilities, and building new stores. As we continue to create the best interconnected experience and remove friction from our customer shopping journey, one of our biggest areas of opportunity is within our post sale experience for the majority of our customers. This process has largely been unchanged for the last 44 years, and we have opportunities to improve this experience.\nIn 2023 we made significant progress taking friction out of our online order management process. Today we have enhanced our systems to better allow our customers to both modify orders and self-service online returns. In 2024 we will focus on building more robust capabilities to support an interconnected self-service returns process where customers will have the ability to start a return online and complete that return via mail or in store. We have just begun all of this work in earnest and are very excited about the friction we will remove through this process while realizing significant productivity benefits over the long term. Through these enhancements and new capabilities in our returns process, we gain efficiencies by reducing transaction time and improving on-shelf availability, enabling better inventory management. We also improve customer service by allowing the customer to start and complete their return however they want.\nAs you have heard us say many times, we are focused on making our interconnected experience better and more convenient no matter how our customers choose to engage with us. As we mentioned at our investor conference in June, we plan to open approximately 80 new stores over the next five years. Our current network of over 2,300 stores throughout North America makes the Home Depot the most convenient physical destination for customers to shop for their home improvement products. We have a premier real estate footprint that provides convenience for the customer that we believe is nearly impossible to replicate, and we will continue to build out this footprint in a very strategic way by investing in new stores in areas that have experienced significant population growth or where it makes sense to relieve some pressure on existing high volume stores.\nIn fiscal 2023, we opened 13 new stores, eight in the US and five in Mexico. In the US our eight new stores were roughly split between stores relieving pressure from higher volume existing stores, and stores where we identified voids in new high growth areas. As an example, we're already seeing great results from many of these new stores and are particularly pleased with our Mapunapuna store in Honolulu which allows us to better serve the Honolulu market.\nFor fiscal 2024, we plan to open approximately 12 new stores. Beyond our focus on removing friction and growing through new stores, we have a lot of initiatives in 2024 geared at growing our share of wallet with the Pro. My new organization will be focused on better enabling alignment so we can more safely and seamlessly deliver on our unique value proposition for all pros. When we invest in new assets and capabilities to better serve the Complex Pro, this also improves our Pro experience in our stores. For example, more job site delivery orders fulfilled from more distribution centers means less congestion in our stores and less time dedicated to picking, packing, and staging orders for delivery. This gives our in-store Pro sales associates more time to dedicate to our pros.\nAdditionally, the ability to fulfill large orders through our distribution network also means that we have more product in stock and available for sale for all those pros shopping in our stores. These improvements benefit our associates and all of our pros.\nOur investments in these strategic initiatives, as well as the investments in our associates, have set us up for success. Recall that at the beginning of the year, we announced a significant investment of approximately $1 billion in increased annualized compensation for frontline hourly associates. As a result of this investment, we saw what we intended to see, meaningful improvement in our attrition rates, particularly among our most tenured associates, which drove improved customer service, productivity, safety. I'm excited to see all of our initiatives gaining traction, and I want to thank our amazing associates for all that they do. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nThank you Ann, and good morning everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted during the fourth quarter, our sales were largely in line with our expectations. However, we did have some unfavorable impacts from weather in January and core commodity deflation. We saw a continuation of a trend that we've been observing throughout the year with softness in certain Big-Ticket discretionary type purchases. Our customers continue to take on smaller projects while still deferring larger projects.\nTurning to our department comp performance for Q4, our building materials and outdoor garden departments posted positive comps, and six of our remaining 12 merchandising departments posted comps above the company average, including appliances, plumbing, tools, paint, indoor garden, and hardware. During Q4, our comp transactions decreased 2.1%, and comp average ticket decreased 1.3%. However, we continue to see our customers trading up for new and innovative products.\nDeflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket by 35 basis points during the fourth quarter, driven by deflation in lumber and copper wire. During the fourth quarter, we continue to see on average a decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago.\nHowever, framing and panel lumber pricing experienced the most stable pricing levels during the quarter in some time. As an example, framing lumber started the quarter at approximately $370 per thousand board feet compared to ending the quarter at approximately $395, representing a change of less than 7%.\nBig-Ticket comp transactions for those over $1,000 were down 6.9% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We continued to see softer engagement in Big-Ticket discretionary categories like flooring, countertops, and cabinets. During the fourth quarter, our Pro and DIY customers' performance was relatively in line with one another. While internal and external surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they have remained stable and elevated relative to historical norms.\nTurning to total company online sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to enhance our digital customer experience with a number of new capabilities, including an enhanced browsing experience featuring the best sellers in a local market and new product discovery zones, which highlights what's trending based on new and highly rated products for those customers that transacted with us online during the fourth quarter. Nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores during the fourth quarter; we hosted our annual Decorative Holiday Gift Center and Black Friday events. We saw strong engagement across all these events with our Decorative Holiday event posting a record sales year.\nAs Ted mentioned, 2023 marked a year of significant progress for our inventory management and on shelf availability while effectively navigating a disinflationary pricing environment and maintaining our position as the customer's advocate for value. Today we are in a great position regarding our inventory levels. Our in stocks are the best they've been in a number of years, and we are delivering a compelling assortment for our customers' home improvement needs.\nWe're looking forward to the year ahead, particularly with the spring selling season right around the corner, and we have a great lineup of new and innovative products from live goods to outdoor power equipment. We're excited to expand our offering of Pro outdoor tools with the launch of our new cordless battery powered Milwaukee M18 backpack blower and straight shaft trimmer, broadening our assortment for the Pro landscaper, and our Spring Gift Center event continues to lean into cordless technology with a wide variety of products from Ryobi, Milwaukee, Makita, and DeWalt, many of which are exclusive to the Home Depot and the Big-Box Retail channel. We're also excited about our Live Goods program. Each year our merchants partner with our national and regional growers to provide our customers with new and improved varieties to enhance the overall garden experience.\nWe've made significant investments in partnership with our growers to bring new varieties to our customers that are more disease resistant, tolerant to different climates, and require less watering. Investing in our relationships with our growers will allow us to continue to drive innovation to meet our customers' needs and improve their shopping experience while building loyalty to the Home Depot. As we look forward to spring, we're excited about continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when and how they need it. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you Billy and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter total sales were $34.8 billion, a decrease of 2.9% from last year. During the fourth quarter, our total company comps were -3.5% with comps of negative 2.5% in November, +1.1% in December, and negative 8.5% in January. Comps in the US were -4% for the quarter with comps of -2.7% in November, +0.6% in December, and -9.1% in January. In local currency, Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average, with Mexico posting positive comps. It is important to note that adjusting for holiday shifts and weather-related impacts in January, monthly comps were relatively consistent across the quarter. For the year, our sales totaled $152.7 billion, a decrease of 3% versus fiscal 2022. For the year, total company comp sales decreased 3.2%, and US comp sales decreased 3.5%.\nIn the fourth quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. For the year, our gross margin was approximately 33.4%, a decrease of 15 basis points from last year, which was in line with our expectations.\nDuring the fourth quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased approximately 115 basis points to 21.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nOur operating expense performance during Q4 reflects our previously executed compensation increases for hourly associates as well as deleverage from our top line results.\nFor the year, operating expenses were approximately 19.2% of sales, representing an increase of approximately 90 basis points from fiscal 2022. Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 11.9% and for the year was approximately 14.2%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter increased by $50 million to $458 million in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2023, our effective tax rate was 24%.\nOur diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.82, a decrease of 14.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2023 were $15.11, a decrease of 9.5% compared to fiscal 2022. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $21 billion, down $3.9 billion, or approximately 16% versus last year, and inventory turns were 4.3 times, up from 4.2 times from the second period last year. Moving on to capital allocation, during the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $860 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. This brings total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 to approximately $3.2 billion.\nDuring the year, we opened 13 new stores, bringing our store count to 2,335. At the end of fiscal 2023, retail selling square footage was approximately 242 million sq ft, and total sales per retail sq ft were approximately $605 in fiscal 2023.\nAdditionally, we invested approximately $1.5 billion on three acquisitions during fiscal 2023, accelerating our strategic initiatives and providing us with better capabilities to serve our customers. During the year, we paid approximately $8.4 billion of dividends to our shareholders. Today we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 7.7% to $2.25 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $9 per share.\nFinally, during fiscal 2023, we returned approximately $8 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, including $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity. For the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 36.7% compared to 44.6% at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nNow I'll comment on our outlook for 2024.\nFirst, let me point out that fiscal 2024 will include a 53rd week, so the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 will consist of 14 weeks. We will continue to report comps on a 52-week basis, but we will base our overall guidance on 53 weeks. As you heard from Ted, we feel great about the actions we took in 2023 to position us well heading into 2024. While there are signs that the economy is on the way toward normalization, the home improvement market still faces headwinds. As we look ahead to fiscal 2024, we considered several factors that informed our outlook for fiscal 2024. On the positive side, we faced a number of pressures in fiscal 2023 that are unlikely to repeat in fiscal 2024.\nIn 2023, we saw four increases in the Federal Funds Rate, a sharp decline in existing home sales, and approximately 110 basis points of comp pressure from lumber deflation. However, we still expect pressures to our business in fiscal 2024. Personal consumption growth as measured by PCE is expected to decelerate compared to 2023. Our share of PCE also remains slightly elevated relative to 2019 and has been on a glide path towards 2019 levels. Higher interest rates at the beginning of 2024 relative to last year will likely continue to pressure demand for larger projects, and the effects from pull forward of demand during the pandemic as well as some project deferral could impact demand into 2024.\nAs we consider these influences on home improvement demand, we are planning for a year of continued moderation, but with slightly less pressure to comp sales than what we faced in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2024 outlook is for total sales growth to outpace comp sales with sales growth of approximately +1% and comp sales of approximately -1% compared to fiscal 2023.\nTotal sales growth will benefit from a 53rd Week as well as from the acquisitions we made, the new stores we opened in fiscal 2023, and the stores we plan to open in fiscal 2024.\nWe expect the 53rd week will contribute approximately $2.3 billion in sales.\nOur gross margin is expected to be approximately 33.9%, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2023.\nThis primarily reflects a lower product transportation cost environment relative to fiscal 2023 as well as benefits from a portion of the approximately $500 million in reduced fixed costs that we will realize in fiscal 2024.\nFurther, we expect Operating Margin of approximately 14.1%. This reflects deleverage from sales and pressure from targeted incentive compensation as we are overlapping lower incentive compensation paid than planned in 2023.\nThis will be partially offset by the benefits from the approximately $500 million in fixed costs that we will realize in fiscal 2024 in both cost of goods sold and operating expenses.\nOur effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect net interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion. Our diluted earnings per share percent growth is targeted to be approximately 1% compared to fiscal 2023, with the extra week contributing approximately $0.30. We plan to continue investing in our business with capital expenditures of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. We believe we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model.\nAs we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low cost position to drive growth faster than the market, and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call, and Christine, we are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your lines in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please, while we poll for questions.\nThank you. Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question number one.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning everyone. My first question is how much of this minus one comp view is an industry view ± share gain? I'm assuming plus versus if you look at current purchasing trends, and Richard, you noted some of the, let's say some of the less headwinds that you noted that you expect to face in 2023.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSure, yes. I mean, in short, we expect that the macro pressures we called out to point towards low single-digit negative growth from improvement demand, and then for us to outperform the market. That's how we got to the negative one comp guide.\nYour second part of your question, Simeon.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI guess that was the whole part of it. It was how much of it is a macro view versus.\nA forecast for housing plus market share versus you have less headwinds that you noted in the current year. Plus you're combining that with how the consumer is behaving.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, it's all taken as a whole. There are several cross currents here. Again, we face macro headwinds, albeit at a lesser degree than we faced in 2023. And so again, just to quickly tick through them, PCE is expected to decelerate. We still have a slightly, as a market, we have a slightly elevated share of PCE versus 2019, and we know that that has gradually receded since 2021. The interest rate environment is still one where, while we see our customers have the means to spend, they are taking more of a deferral stance with respect to large project demand. And we believe there was some pull forward of certain, certain spend during the period of 2020 to 2022 that we're working out. Housing, you know, it's a little hard to tease out. Obviously, home values have held in there.\nWe now see home prices having appreciated by over 46% since 2019. Turnovers dropped sharply over the last two years. That's a headwind possibly offset by some level of improvement play. We're essentially neutral on housing short term.\nSo that's all of those have an impact on our market. Then as you said, we expect to gain share in any macro environment through our growth initiatives of Pro, the interconnected experience, and new stores. That takes us to our negative 1% comp outlook.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nFair enough. And then the follow up, can we ask about the shape of the year? You lapped the lumber deflation in the first part of the year, maybe some weather, so that should be better. But the second half is in theory, post interest rate cuts, maybe durables get a little bit better. So how should we think about it?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYeah, so Simeon, lumber was actually a function, more of a comparison to 2022. In 2023, if you compare the lumber charts, just, I'd encourage you to pull it up. Lumber prices were relatively steady across 2023, so we don't really see a material impact to 2024. With respect to 2024, first, we expect a normal seasonal curve for our business. So there's really no seasonal shift in how we think about the halves. We anticipate the second half coming in slightly better than the first half with both being negative. At least as implied in our guidance, it might help to recall the halves for 2023 relatively in line with one another.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you. Good luck.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning.\nStarting with the underlying comp commentary, curious if you could share some thoughts on Pro versus DIY trend, both for the industry as well as your share gain potential, and then any early thoughts on traffic versus ticket.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nIf you look at Pro versus Consumer, Zach, I mean for us they were effectively the same in Q4. Overall industry.\nDon't see that being too terribly much different. I can say within our Pro, in any customer segment that we have, the Managed Account customer who's engaging in the ecosystem that we're building was the highest performing customer segment in Q4 and throughout 2023. We would expect that to continue into 2024 as well as we continue to build out the capabilities.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd then you called out the disinflationary price environment. I'm curious if you could parse that out between commodity deflation and promotional activity. And then as you look at 2024, could you walk through the signs that you're seeing to suggest that we have turned a corner on the disinflation?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP, Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah, this is Billy, thanks for the question on the commodity piece that is embedded in our forward-looking guidance that Richard articulated during his prepared remarks. As it relates to the promotional cadence, you know, we haven't seen any difference. If you go back pre-pandemic to the promotional activity, you know, we are in a very, you know, normalized environment. We do feel that pricing is kind of settled as we mentioned earlier. And so from a promotional standpoint, cadence, we don't see any differentiation than, like I said, what we lived through prior to the pandemic. So, you know, very consistent. We really are in a solid marketplace as it relates to that. And look forward to 2024.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So I was curious, as you think about the share of wallet, what did you learn over the holiday season? Are there any signs of life that you're seeing? You mentioned, you know, outdoor garden. I'm assuming maybe that's Christmas trees and Christmas decor. Is there any signs of life that maybe the smaller ticket, soft line stuff is starting to show or more decor items starting to show? Some. Some signs of life. Did you see anything in appliances or on the bigger ticket side?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nNo. Hey, Chris, it's Ted.\nWe saw great signs of life. There's loads of life in the sector. I mean, we're working through some macro factors as Richard articulated, but the consumer is healthy and the consumer is engaged. They're just engaged at this point in smaller projects. You know, you called out a number of categories that we had terrific engagement in Q4. Our decor holiday program was just an exceptional performer. The merchants there just keep taking that to the next level. We know we took a tremendous amount of share in decor holiday as the customer responds to our offering. Our gift center lineup with the brands we have and the values that Billy and team put in the marketplace had a tremendous response. You know, as you said, decor holiday and live goods did extremely well.\nThings like totes, I mean, we saw sold record units of totes in Q4 as people responded to our storage events. So we still have tremendous traffic, just pure volume of traffic and engagement. Again, it's just that big ticket, although as an aside on big ticket appliances was one of our better relative performers. And I think a lot of that has to do with our service levels as we're integrating the TEMCO acquisition in the percentage of our deliveries that they're now handling and the service level scores and on time and complete that they're providing our customers. We think that's a big piece of the momentum behind our appliance business as well as the strength of our online shopping experience for major appliances.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAnd then as a follow up, can you talk about what drove the gross margin decline here in Q4? You mentioned the expansion here coming in 2024. And then separately, just on the SG&A side, you did have, I think, sizable legal gain in Q1 of last year. Is that something that.\nWill have an effect on 2024 overall? Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSure. Hi Chris, it's Richard. So first on Q4 gross margin.\nI'd say our gross margin first of all is in line mith our expectations for the year, for the full year. In the quarter we saw some pull forward of pressure from pricing actions ahead of cost decreases. You know, the good news is you now see those at current levels and Billy mentioned we're really at kind of a settled point right now in retail and in cost. As we begin to work through inventory layers, you now see the impact of those cost increases, cost decreases that we took earlier in the year coming through in 2024. That's the major.\nDriver behind the gross margin expansion that we've got it to. On the, on the settlement that you called out. I appreciate the question. It's important to note that there is some geography noise in year-over-year comparisons driven by that settlement. So just for everyone's recollection, we had a significant settlement in Q1 of 2023 that was a benefit to operating expense. Now as we said we would do, we fully offset that benefit with short term costs in 2023 that set us up to lower our cost base going forward. Those short term costs were mostly incurred in cost of goods sold, including some actions taken to optimize inventory levels. So that settlement geography, and the cost that offset it create a more favorable comparison in cost of goods sold and a less favorable comparison in OpEx on a year over year basis.\nBut obviously the two offset each other, and it's a geography shift.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks so much. Have a great spring.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes to the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys.\nThanks for the time. Within your comp guide, can you help us understand how you guys are modeling any benefit or accretion from your Complex Pro build out just so we can better understand the thought process around it? And just as a sidebar, can you also tell us how big of a margin drag you expect the incentive comp swing to be in 2024? Thanks.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nOn the Complex Pro. I mean, clearly the improvements there and the expectation that the Managed Account engaging in those capabilities will be the strongest performing customer segment. That's embedded in the guidance of comp sales in overall sales.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nAnd on the drag from lower incentive bonus in 2023 really the largest and most meaningful driver of deleverage. As you know, our OpEx levers or deleverage as a function of sales growth. So the largest driver of that is simply sales deleverage as operating cost inflation remains higher than sales growth.\nTo a lesser extent we see deleverage from the incentive compensation year-over-year.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nOkay, can I ask a follow-up on that? So just so I can understand that. Yes. Understand that the managed accounts are kind of growing. But like, are you guys able to kind of disaggregate, let's call it the typical engagement you would have with those accounts versus the expanded capabilities you're providing in certain markets, or is it just too, too difficult to kind of, you know, separate those?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nOh, no, we can absolutely. And we disaggregate at every level you can imagine. We're just not going to share all that detail, as you can imagine.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nOkay, fair enough. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nHey, thanks. Bigger picture. Curious what you guys are monitoring across regions or product categories to suggest that demand for the home improvement category from a unit volume perspective is starting to bottom here as we look out over the next couple of years?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, you know, just to hit it on the most fine point here, really the last three quarters, we've seen kind of the most stability. And, you know, I'd say three quarters ago we saw a marked recovery in transactions, and think about that as a proxy for units. But units followed similarly over the last three quarters. We've seen nice stability. And as we said before, we define a healthy home improvement market as one where ticket and transaction are both positive. What we have seen on the good side here is that ticket and transaction have begun to converge and, in fact, have sort of really much more tightly converged over the last three quarters.\nThey were still both negative for the quarter, but that's really just reflective of the macro pressure that continues from a geographic perspective.\nWe aren't really necessarily able to tease out differences in recovery and transactions or units. More of a national dynamic.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay, great. Then one for you, Richard. Just how should we think about the sensitivity of operating margins in fiscal 2024 to every point of comp? You know, hypothetically, you guys are being a little bit concerned, conservative here on the down one. Just trying to think about how the model could respond.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSure. I mean, the basics are, you can imagine.\nWith no management intervention, the natural rule of leverage or deleverage is about 10 basis points per point of comp up or down.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. Good luck.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning.\nThank you so much for taking my question. As we look back to the last couple of downturns in home improvement, there was a pretty robust recovery in the subsequent years. After a few periods of negative comps, are you seeing any evidence or signs that this recovery, whenever it happens, would be different?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nHi Michael.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWe don't see why it would be different. I mean, if anything, the underpinning of the market segment remains incredibly strong. When I step back and look at the macro, when you look at the influences that we watch most closely, home prices appreciation up 45%. Home equity is up closer to 70%. That equity level, which is a $10 to 12 trillion increase since the pandemic, has not been tapped. In fact, HELOCs and cash out refis are at multiple years low right now. Interest rates went up over the last two years. So you have tremendous potential in an untapped balance sheet and equity position in homes. We talk about the age of homes now; well over 50% are over 40 years old. People are still working from home more than they were certainly pre-pandemic.\nSo usage in homes, the fundamental shortage of homes, you know, we're, I've seen anywhere between two and six million units short, and on a near-term even forecast for 2024 will build 200-odd thousand units less than demand. So you're not even beginning to make up for that shortage in the near term. So you look at all those factors, millennials becoming the, you know, a year or so away of becoming the single biggest.\nSource of customer segment spend in our space. They're at, you know, prime household formation and home ownership ages. So I look at all those and say, you know, huge opportunity. And we've mentioned this before, but the pandemic in a sense.\nIt's a bit like a giant hurricane, right? I mean we had tremendous demand in growth in the segment followed by a couple periods of moderation following that buildup. But as we watch every hurricane market after you go through that cycle, you know, it's as strong as ever. So with that backdrop of fundamental macros and the overall pandemic playing out over a five-year period like a giant national storm, we have every reason to be extremely optimistic about the future. And that's why we've made the comments today about how happy we are of what we accomplished. The management team here, the store associates, and store leadership, supply chain just did such a great job level setting this business following that sort of pandemic storm. And we couldn't feel better about how we're positioned from an operational point of view.\nThen we're sticking with all the strategic investments. Our eyes are still on the prize of the best interconnected shopping experience. Building out the Pro ecosystem for Complex Pros and then having such confidence in our model to start a reasonably meaningful store build program. We feel really, really good. Michael, thanks for the question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThat's very helpful, Ted. If I could just add one more question. It's on Richard's comment about the rule of thumb of 10 basis points of margin expansion for every 1 point a comp, and understanding that this is theoretical, does that move in a linear fashion, meaning if you get back to the trajectory of mid single digit comps eventually, that you would see a better than trend rate of margin expansion the higher the growth rate. And there was also a comment that that rule of thumb would be outside of actions that would be taken. So can you discuss what actions might be taken to bend that curve.\nOn the upside over time? Thank you very much.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Michael. Well, first I certainly want to center you back to the comments we made at the investor conference in June.\nWhere we call out a base case once we return to market normalization. A base case of 3% to 4% sales growth.\nFlat gross margin, an assumption of operating expense and operating margin leverage and growth, and EPS growth of mid- to high-single-digit percentages within that, obviously, is.\nSort of an implied leverage per comp point on our OpEx.\nI'm giving you a what I would call a loose rule of thumb.\nIt would apply for the most part to, you know, to our sort of business model today, sort of. It certainly applied in the past, and I would expect it to apply loosely in the future. You know, embedded in that is a normal rate of productivity and efficiency that our teams deliver every single year. I mean underneath.\nAll this guidance and our results for 2023, which we were so pleased with, is an enormous amount of work.\nOn behalf of our team, we think about the efficiency in our supply chain. You think about the efficiencies that our merchants bring every year in product cost. Of particular note, the productivity in our stores with some of the tools that are unleashing the power of AI and putting that in the hands of our associates. Those are standard fare for us. They feed into what I would call normal operating leverage for the Home Depot. And it's something that we've come to expect to of ourselves. So that's a long way of saying we always intend to lever OpEx at a certain point of sales growth.\nAnd I would stick with the basic rule of thumb, maybe higher, maybe slightly lower in some periods from time to time. On the question about what actions there may be.\nWell, we always operate with a degree of financial flexibility in the P&L. Although I would tell you that we.\nDid our very best and I think we accomplished our objective of reducing fixed costs towards the end of 2023 that had built up during the pandemic, hence the $500 million in cost savings implied in our guide. There are always levers. We have to determine what environment we are operating in before we decide what levers to pull. So for now we've provided what we would call our central case for 2024. We're going to manage the business with the best interests of our long-term shareholders in mind.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much and good luck.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning everyone. I wanted to follow up on macro and then margins. Just on the macro side, you gave us a number of the factors that have built in here. I guess the real question is what are the conditions needed for comps to actually get back to positive? Is it as simple as fully digesting the two years of lower housing turnover? And that'll happen at some point through this year, I guess. Ultimately, can you return to growth without existing home sales improving?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President and CEO, Home Depot\n\nOh, absolutely. I mean, as we've said for the longest time, home turnover is a base of home improvement demand. But it's been pretty steady if you look at 4.5-odd% of housing stock as a multi-year.\nPercentage of turnover, and that equates to 5-ish million units. The reason we're calling out that as a factor in these last two years is the dramatic decrease. And there's definitely an understanding that there's an improvement in place cycle if you don't move and you stay in your house. But there's a lag effect, and arguably that lag effect is a bit longer this time because of the interest rate environment, and people are just being conservative of when they kick off a larger home improvement project in a home that they're going to ultimately stay in for a longer period of time. So that's the dynamic of housing turnover. We think that plays out. We're literally at a 40-year low in turnover. Don't see that going lower. So you're going to cycle through that kind of acute two-year pressure and then.\nDo we get back to growth? Absolutely.\nI'd say we have a neutral look on housing for 2024. We don't think there's incremental pressure, nor do we think that we're quite ready for a hockey stick recovery. Richard's been talking for some time and the Fed's stance of higher for longer. I think we now have an appreciation that longer is going to go through the first half of this year. So even a lowering cycle in the back half, you know, there's some timing effect to, you know, get mortgages, move homes, you know, take a HELOC loan out, et cetera to get a bigger project going. So that's why we're.\nKind of calling for a slighter moderation to continue into 2024. But as we said, that the back half is marginally stronger and we think all the macros line up for return to normalcy following that with the capabilities that we're building. I mean we're taking share today with.\nX percentage of these capabilities complete. Super optimistic about how we're hitting the ground running as we continue to build, going into a stronger market and the share gain opportunity.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, thank you for that. Just one follow-up, Richard. You gave us a bunch of sensitivity numbers around the EBIT margins, I guess more specifically on SG&A for this year. I realize there's a number of moving pieces that come back, but can you give us a feel for what base underlying SG&A growth should look like this year? I think the headline guidance is around 4% growth, but maybe what is it excluding incentive comp and some of the costs that you're lapping or the benefits that you're lapping just so we could think about that.\nThanks.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYou know, I tell you the best way to look at this.\nIt's that we are now our P&L provides you with an appropriate jumping-off point for your models. There's a lot of noise in operating expense. You think about the geography of the settlement in Q1, you think about the geography of costs that we incurred. Then you think about the geography of the $500 million in cost out, two third of which will be realized in OpEx, one third of which will be realized in cost of goods sold. And you just have a lot of noise again. The main driver of operating expense growth is going to be just that, inflation on our base of operating expenses.\nWe think that if you look at our gross margin and our Operating Margin guide, these offer you.\nThe appropriate jumping off points for your modeling.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. All right, thank you. Good luck.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Home Depot\n\nChristine. We have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity Research, Guggenheim",
    "content2": "Good morning everyone. I'll keep it to one just to end the call here. Wanted to follow up on the Complex Pro. Ted, appreciate the comments and your prepared.\nRemarks around trade credit being piloted, but.\nCurious if you can maybe expand on.\nSome early learnings around those newer features being launched as we think through what.\nThe sort of Managed Account customer can.\nContribute to growth over the coming years here.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP, Home Depot\n\nYeah, I'll kick that off. Thanks. That, first of all, we're in our early stages. And just as a reminder as well, HD supply does Trade Credit today. So we're, you know, as we architect our program, there's a lot of learnings there. But, for me, you know, Chip is in the room and Chip, you know, you have a lot of experience here with Trade Credit, and his experience is helping us also form some of the intricacies of how we think about it. So I'll turn it over to Chip.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYeah, thanks, Steven. Trade Credit is definitely a necessary capability that we're building, really focused on that complex project. So as we invest in our pros and our capabilities to be able to service their larger jobs, Trade Credit is definitely necessary. So we're in early days, as Ann mentioned, piloting a number of different customers, but plan to grow and expand that through the next couple of quarters as we automate that into our selling system as well.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMs. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Christine.

You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to The Home Depot's Q3 2023 Earnings Call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Ann-Marie Campbell, Senior Executive Vice President; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Sales for Q3 were $37.7 billion, down 3% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 3.1% from the same period last year, and our US stores had negative comps of 3.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.81 in Q3, compared to $4.24 in Q3 last year. Q3 was in line with our expectations. Similar to Q2, we saw continued customer engagement with smaller projects and experienced pressure in certain big-ticket discretionary categories. In addition, lumber, copper, and wire deflation, and storm-related overlaps negatively impacted results in the quarter. Billy will discuss these and other business trends shortly. During Q3, our Pro customer outperformed our DIY customer.\nWhile internal and external surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms. With only one quarter left in the year, we believe the endpoints for a previous guidance range are no longer likely outcomes. As a result, and as we announced in this morning's press release, we narrowed our guidance range for fiscal 2023. Richard will take you through the details in a moment. As we've discussed, this year reflects a period of moderation. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this unique environment. We remain very excited about our strategic initiatives and are committed to investing in the business to deliver the best interconnected shopping experience, capture wallet share with the Pro, and grow our store footprint.\nAs we discussed at the investor conference in June, we continue to invest and focus on creating a frictionless interconnected shopping experience for our customers. We are pleased with the progress we are making. HomeDepot.com is one of the largest retail websites in the United States, and our digital app is one of the most highly rated in all of retail. Yet, we believe there's still opportunity to reduce pain points across the shopping journey. Our teams are identifying areas of improvement, like better communication throughout the shopping journey, an easier returns process, and the ability to seamlessly and intuitively make changes to an order once placed. For our pros, we're investing in a multitude of initiatives. We remain focused on building out our unique ecosystem of products and services.\nAs a result, we are evolving our organizational structure and recently elevated Ann-Marie Campbell to Senior Executive Vice President, better aligning our outside sales and service business in the global stores organization. Pro is one of our biggest growth opportunities, and this organizational change will allow us to better serve them by leveraging our full ecosystem of expertise, product assortment, fulfillment, and operations. Our merchants, store and merchandising teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. In addition, The Home Depot is proud to have tens of thousands of veterans, service members, and military spouses in orange aprons.\nLast week, we announced that the Home Depot Foundation surpassed the goal of $500 million invested in veterans' causes and also increased the total commitment to $750 million by 2030. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior EVP, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that I'm very excited about my new role and the alignment it will create between the outside sales and services business and the global store organization. As you heard at our investor conference in June, capturing a greater share of the pros' wallet is one of our largest growth opportunities. It represents roughly $475 billion in addressable market, and today we have relatively little share.\nThe beauty of the Home Depot is that we have unique competitive advantages: our convenient stores, our leading brands, our engaged associates, our expansive fulfillment options that are unmatched and that can be leveraged for the benefit of our customers. And that's exactly what we aim to do. To do that, our new organizational structure will create stronger momentum with our teams to drive success with the pro.\nHector Padilla will focus on improving the experience for pros shopping our stores. His 29-year tenure and knowledge of our store operations and new pro capabilities will be instrumental in achieving our goals. Chip Devine, our head of outside sales, brings nearly 30 years of distribution experience. He will work on building out capabilities to better serve more complex product needs. Ultimately, we must focus on removing friction within our operations so our customers have a great experience every single time, no matter how they choose to shop with us, whether in the aisles of our stores, picking up product at the store, receiving product at their job site with a sales associate, or digitally. We know that most of our pros use many of these capabilities across our ecosystem when shopping with us.\nFor us, we are building trust and a partnership that lasts for decades and across generations. This means we have to work hard to deliver a great experience regardless of their point of interaction. As you know, we have identified additional growth opportunities with the Pro, which requires us to invest in new capabilities and functionalities across the business. Think about the initiative we are undertaking with the Complex Pro. This customer interacts differently.\nThey are accustomed to interacting with their suppliers in a different way than our traditional business model. Pros working on complex products want to reserve product, use trade credit, and have product delivered to their job site in a staged manner. While these capabilities exist in the market today, we are incorporating them in our full ecosystem to serve Pro customers in a way no one else can.\nI could not be more excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. For the in-store experience, over the last several years, we have talked about the importance of in-stock and ultimately on-shelf availability, or OSA. Having the right products in stock, in the right quantity, and on the shelf available for purchase is critical. We've implemented several initiatives to help us do this more effectively and efficiently. In the past, we've talked about GSR, or Get Stores Right. GSR drives productivity by using our proprietary space allocation model coupled with our tenured field merchandising teams to determine which categories to invest in on a store-by-store basis. More recently, we have talked to you about our rollout of Sidekick and Computer Vision.\nUsing machine learning technology, Computer Vision helps our associates quickly find depalletized product in the overhead, and Sidekick helps direct associates to key bays where OSAs low or out exist. Today, these tools have been deployed across all US stores. And while early days, they have driven meaningful improvement in our on-shelf availability. The beauty of these initiatives is that they also drive productivity.\nThey make it easier for associates to restock product, have a greater depth of high-velocity product, and ensure we remain in stock with more product on the shelf and available for sale. As a result, we enable our associates to focus on the most important tasks and allocate more time to deliver a better shopping experience. These are just a few examples of the many different types of initiatives that can drive significant value for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders.\nDespite a challenging year, our amazing associates have remained engaged and ready to serve our customers, and I want to thank them for all they do. With that, let me turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the Q3, our sales were in line with our expectations. However, we did have some unfavorable impacts from core commodity deflation and storm-related overlaps. We saw a continuation of a trend that we have been observing throughout the year, with softness in certain big-ticket discretionary-type purchases. Instead of engaging in larger projects, customers continued to take on smaller projects. Turning to our department comp performance for the Q3, our building materials department posted a positive comp, and seven of our remaining 13 merchandising departments posted comps above the company average, including plumbing, appliances, hardware, outdoor garden, millwork, tools, and paint.\nDuring the Q3, our comp transactions decreased 2.7%, and comp average ticket decreased 0.3%. Excluding deflation from core commodities, we experienced comp average ticket growth primarily driven by demand for new and innovative products. Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 60 basis points during the Q3, driven by deflation in lumber and copper. During the Q3, we continued to see a decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per 1,000 board feet compared to approximately $545 in the Q3 of 2022, representing a decrease of over 20%. Big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were down 5.2% compared to the Q3 of last year. We continue to see softer engagement in big-ticket discretionary categories like flooring, countertops, and cabinets.\nHowever, we saw Big-Ticket strength in Pro-heavy categories like roofing, insulation, and portable power. Turning to total company online sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 5% compared to the Q3 of last year. We continued to invest in the digital experience across our website and app and released a variety of enhancements in the Q3. These ranged from simple improvements to help customers track orders to more complex things like updating our search and recommendation algorithms. For those customers that transacted with us online during the Q3, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores. During the Q3, we hosted our annual Labor Day appliance and Halloween events and were pleased with the results. In appliances, we were encouraged with the customers' engagement during the event.\n2023 was another record sales year for our Halloween program, both in store and online, as our customers continued to add to their collection with our unique and exclusive product assortment. As we turn our attention to Q4, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday, and gift center events. In our gift center, we continue to lean into brands that matter most for our customers with our assortment of Milwaukee, Ryobi, Makita, DeWalt, RIDGID, Husky, and more.\nWe will have something for everyone, whether it's our wide assortment of cordless Ryobi tools, DeWalt's Atomic drill and impact kits, or our new Milwaukee M18 Forge batteries. These new M18 Forge batteries will be a game changer for our Pro customer, providing the most powerful, fastest charging, and longest life of any battery on the Milwaukee M18 platform.\nThis quarter, I'm also excited to announce the addition of WAGO to our powerhouse assortment of pro brands, including Milwaukee, USG, Custom Building Products, Leviton, and QEP, to name a few. It is these strategic vendor relationships that make us the product authority in home improvement, and the addition of WAGO will help extend our position. WAGO is one of the top requested, most innovative pro brands in the wire connector segment that features a releasable level lock wire connector that speeds up installation and saves space in tight applications. We recently launched a number of SKUs in our stores, which are exclusive to the Home Depot and the National Big Box Retail Channel. Our merchandising organization remains focused on being our customer's advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when they need it.\nWe will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That's why I am so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market. With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Billy, and good morning, everyone. In the Q3, total sales were $37.7 billion, a decrease of approximately $1.2 billion, or 3% from last year. During the Q3, our total company comps were negative 3.1%, with comps of negative 2.1% in August, negative 3.4% in September, and negative 3.7% in October. Comps in the US were negative 3.5% for the quarter, with comps of negative 2.5% in August, negative 3.8% in September, and negative 4.1% in October. In local currency, Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average. It is important to note that adjusting for storm-related overlaps and some seasonal shift, monthly comps were relatively consistent across the quarter. In the Q3, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of approximately 20 basis points from the Q3 last year, which was in line with our expectations.\nDuring the Q3, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 120 basis points to 19.4% compared to the Q3 of 2022. Our operating expense performance during the Q3 reflects our previously executed compensation increases for hourly associates, as well as deleverage from our top-line results. Our operating margin for the Q3 was 14.3% compared to 15.8% in the Q3 of 2022. Interest and other expense for the Q3 increased by approximately $30 million to $438 million. In the Q3, our effective tax rate was 23.3%, down from 24.4% in the Q3 of fiscal 2022. Our diluted earnings per share for the Q3 were $3.81, a decrease of 10.1% compared to the Q3 of 2022. During the Q3, we opened seven new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,333.\nRetail selling square footage was approximately 242 million sq ft. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.8 billion, down $2.9 billion, or 11% compared to Q3 2022, and inventory turns were 4.3 times flat to one year ago. Turning to capital allocation, after investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the quarter, we invested approximately $670 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. During the quarter, we paid approximately $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.\nComputed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 38.7%, down from 43.3% in Q3 of fiscal 2022. Now I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2023. As you heard from Ted, with one quarter remaining in fiscal 2023, we no longer expect the endpoints of our previous guidance range as likely outcomes, and therefore, we are narrowing our guidance for 2023. We expect fiscal 2023 sales and comp sales to decline between 3% and 4%. We are targeting an operating margin between 14.2% and 14.1% for the year. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%. We expect interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion, and we are anticipating between a 9% and 11% decline in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2022.\nIn addition, as you heard from Ann, we continue to focus on driving productivity in the business. We have taken a number of actions that will help us realize the previously announced $500 million in annualized cost savings in 2024 and are fully confident that we will deliver on this commitment. We also remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers with our leading product authority in home improvement, strong in-stock levels, and knowledgeable associates. We will continue to prudently invest to strengthen our competitive position and leverage our scale and low-cost position to outperform our market and deliver shareholder value.

Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. In thinking about inflections and when we might see one, looking at the spread maybe between DIY and pro, is the story of this quarter that maybe DIY is stabilized, but the pro is getting a little bit worse? And then, if that's right, and feel free to correct if that's wrong, would that mean that it could take a little longer than for the pro sort of normalizing to play out, and actually the overall comp could get a little worse before it gets better?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nMorning, Simeon. Thanks for the question. I would say pro and consumer; it had the narrowest performance gap in some time. So they both performed reasonably well. If you step back and look at the quarter, we feel really good about the Q3, and we narrowed our comp guidance for the year because of that. In fact, if you look at the performance of the business overall this year, if you look at the seasonality of Q1 and Q2, we're pretty smooth in that -3% comp through the first three quarters of this year. That's normalized for weather, storms, and commodity price deflation. Then our regional businesses are also pretty consistent. We've seen the least variability in regions. As I said, the narrowest gap between pro and consumer; we had really good seasonal sell-through.\nAs prices have settled with abating deflation, we feel pretty good about that. Our operations are increasingly getting back to normal. The supply chain is operating very well. Our inventory positions are better. Our in-stock rates are much better. As Ann took you through all the things we're doing in the store to improve on-shelf availability. Our value propositions, as Billy mentioned, are in great shape, and product innovation is better than it's ever been. The wage investments are paying off. Our attrition is way down. With that attrition being down, our associates have had more time in the store. Their ability to serve customers has improved. So all of that really is what delivered that consistent comp throughout the year.\nBut to answer your specific question, as we sit here feeling really good about the operations, the share shift of PCE from pre-COVID to today has not completely reverted. We're still not exactly sure where that reverts to. The asset class for home improvement is worth $15 trillion more than it was pre-pandemic. We know now that the Fed definitely has a higher-for-longer monetary posture, and that's going to continue to pressure durable goods in financing or motivation for larger home improvement projects.\nSo as we said, we see great engagement, engagement with seasonal goods, engagement with smaller projects. It's that the larger projects are a bit down at the moment. That's what we're watching. I mean, we're not obviously talking about 2024 today, but lots of good news in the operations of the business, great news with still a very resilient customer.\nI mean, we just came off of 4.9% GDP in Q3, driven by the consumer. But as you know, we're looking at it this year, this period of moderation for home improvement spend, but couldn't feel better about the business and our operations overall.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for that. Then maybe the follow-up, you mentioned GDP. Given that home prices seem to be pretty sticky, even with pretty weak turnover, and may not get any better, how should we think about GDP? Should we revert to GDP as maybe a better proxy for how the business could do?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSimeon, this is Richard. We have tried to take the most thoughtful approach possible over the last few years of what the drivers of the business are and those things that indicate to us how we have settled back out of the pandemic period. And that's why we focused on share of PCE. Like Ted said, we're not going to talk about 2024 today. There is an underlying kind of layer of economic activity that supports the business.\nBut as Ted pointed out, number one, we still haven't reverted all the way back to 2019 levels of PCE share. And the Fed stance of higher-for-longer has had and could have increasing pressure on the outlook for durables and housing-related spend. So like Ted said, that's what we're watching at the moment. And we'll talk about 2024 when we get to our call next quarter.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Richard, considering all the ins and outs of your cost base this year with wage investments, you've got the legal settlement in Q1, plus the cost saved next year, is it fair for us to assume your operating margins can expand in 2024? Or is there a certain level of comp that you will need to see to hold this 14% plus margin?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nMorning, Zach. Thanks for that question. Margin expansion is largely a function of top-line growth. There is a point there in the low positive comp digits where you see expense turn from deleveraged to leverage. We're not going to take on 2024 guidance today. What we have done is we have put in place measures and, in fact, now have essentially completed actions that will provide us with a $500 million cost buffer heading into 2024. And so regardless of the outlook, that provides some buffer in margin.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. And then you mentioned that you would reinvest the legal settlement gain from Q1. So first of all, any color on what this reinvestment actually is or what it would look like? And then is it fair to say the investment will be largely in Q4, or was there part of that in Q3?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWe've had part of that spent throughout the year. I think it is still a correct assumption that that favorability will be fully offset by the end of the year. And so I really point you to our guidance as the best jumping-off point for your modeling.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thanks for the time.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Zach.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, everyone. So in some other retail verticals, or a lot of other retail verticals, we're seeing a return to pre-COVID purchasing patterns where you probably see more activity, purchasing activity on weekends and around holidays and events with, frankly, bigger lulls in between. So the questions are, one, are you seeing a similar general pattern? And two, assuming that is the case, are there ways for you guys to take advantage of that pattern from an operational standpoint to improve productivity? Thanks.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Scott. It's Billy. Listen, as it relates to different fluctuations in customer patterns and so forth, we haven't seen that. Been very consistent throughout the quarter. And as Ted mentioned, in his prepared remarks really throughout the year when you account for some of the weather and some of the bathtub effect we saw in the first half. So we haven't seen that.\nListen, as it relates to promotional activity whatsoever, we have events in our stores that we love to execute and drive excitement for our customers. But from a promotional activity standpoint, it's really reverted back to pre-COVID times. Our pricing has certainly, as Ted mentioned, settled over the last several months. The environment's certainly stabilized. So we operate in a very rational market and promotional environment, as I said, it's just returned to kind of pre-pandemic times.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWe will always, Scott, we will always focus on EDLP. I mean, we have events during certain seasons that are a lot of fun. They're engaging for the associate. They're engaging for our customers. But day in and day out, 12 months a year, we strive to be an EDLP retailer with great values every day.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up. On the Big-Ticket discretionary, is there any specific areas where you're actually seeing a positive inflection, or are they all still trending, call it mid-single-digit negative?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nNo, we called out in my prepared remarks categories like portable power and so forth, where we have seen great engagement. And candidly, we're thrilled with the innovation that we continue to partner with our supplier base on that we bring to the market. And where we continue to see innovation, we continue to see great engagement with both the Pro and the consumer.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So a couple of follow-ups to prior questions. My first one is, with the Gross Margin decline in the Q3, can you talk a little bit about what drove that? You were lagging storm-related demand, and you had some commodity deflation. So I would have thought that those would be positive. So is that fair? And what were the offsets that drove it lower?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks for the question, Chris. I'll go back to Billy's comments, and Ted mentioned this as well. I think the most important observation we've made is that the worst of the inflationary environment is behind us. As a result, as Billy said, retail prices are settling in the market. Some prices are settling at levels higher than 2022. Others are settling lower. We're seeing some stabilization there that Billy can talk about.\nSpecific to the quarter and gross margin, there are some timing differences as some prices settle ahead of anticipated product and transportation cost benefits that will come through as we turn through our inventory. I'd really sort of consider those timing. For the full year, our view on gross margin hasn't changed, and we expect to see slight pressure year-over-year. Billy maybe just talk about kind of the settling of prices.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. I mean, as you mentioned, the inflation environment seems to be behind us. Prices absolutely settled in. Again, I reiterate what I said, work in a very rational market. The other thing I'd add is this is no different than any other timeframe. Frankly, we have a portfolio approach to how we take on whether it's lumber deflation that we've talked a lot about throughout the year or other ins and outs as it relates to the P&L. So a very normalized environment, rational, and really a stabilization that we've seen across the board as it relates to pricing.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Got it, got it, got it. So that makes sense. And then on the variable cost side, you talked about a low single-digit leverage point historically and the $500 million of cost savings next year. At the same time, you've had negative transactions for quite some time now. So can you talk about where we are in terms of how labor can maybe become less variable over time, maybe in the context of the percentage of stores on minimum staffing levels? And if there is negative comps in 2024 or over the next six months, is the flexibility that you get from the $500 million offset by the fact that you could be having still negative transactions and less flexibility?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nChris, thanks for the question. There's a lot of kind of 2024 conjecture built into that answer. I'll tell you that it's right. So I think when you're talking about changes in the nature of our labor model, the degree of change in transactions really isn't material enough to say that changes the nature of our labor model.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Sounds good. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. You talked about the promotional environment discounting being very rational. If the cycle or the downturn for home improvement remains protracted and extended, under what conditions would you expect that discounting will be more intense than it was in 2019 across the industry? And if that were to be the case, would Home Depot choose to remain true to the everyday low price and the portfolio approach that it has, or would it look to protect market share and participate in some of that activity?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nMorning, Michael. Yes, we will stay committed to EDLP. Our promotional cadences, as we said earlier, the Black Friday appliances, gift center, and some spring events for seasonal garden items to get traffic in stores, those have been the playbook for years and years, right, Billy? We don't see us going away from that. In fact, we've stayed truer to reductions of promotions. When you think of categories like ceiling fans that I remember with constantly on and off, 10% and 20% off paint, which was a promotional category where 5% and 10%, and then it went to 10% and 20%. We've backed off all of that. On the margin, we'd prefer to be even less promotional than we are today.\nIf you had a protracted downturn in the market, I mean, for sure we're going to be competitive, and for sure we are going to protect our share. But when you think of the nature of a large home improvement project, certainly one done by a pro, the labor component is such a big piece of that job. I mean, just take paint, for example. If you're painting your living room for $500, the paint in that job is going to be less than $100. And it's your labor bill, either your opportunity cost as a consumer or the pro doing the job for you. So being super aggressive to take $10 off the $100 component of a $500 job, I don't think really moves the needle. And that's why our bias, our starting position would be, no, we wouldn't chase a lot of price in that dynamic.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGotcha. Very helpful. My follow-up question is, historically, Home Depot has underpromised and overdelivered in just about all facets. Is it realistic to think that you took the same approach when building this $500 million of net cost savings for next year such that there could be upside to that number?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, that cost number was really more a function of having built capacity to handle the explosion in our volume during COVID, and then the sort of other side of that hill where we pulled capacity in many forms back. And so it was the right thing to do regardless of the environment. It does happen to provide a buffer for our operating margin as we move into 2024.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you very much and have a great holiday.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYou too.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats, Ann, on the new role. I wanted to focus on the pro side of the business. So the commentary about growing with the Complex Pro, in the past, there's been a focus on the flatbed distribution centers and the rollout on a regional basis. Is that still very much the strategy for the next couple of years? And as you zoom out and think about the opportunity with the Complex Pro, what are the top priorities within those next one to two years?\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior EVP, Home Depot\n\nSteven, thank you. Thank you so much for the kind words there. Chip is in the room, and he has been intimately knowledgeable about that. And so I'm going to throw it over to Chip, and he'll talk a little bit about some of the capabilities that we continue to leverage and some of the functionalities and capabilities that we will continue to build.\n\nChip Divine\n\nHead of Outside Sales, Home Depot\n\nYeah, thank you, Steven. We are going to continue certainly our march down to the expansion of our outside sales teams and continue to grow the Complex Pro, as it was mentioned in the earlier remarks. The connectivity into the store is an important part of this asset build as well. Our pros shop in our stores every single day, and connecting that ecosystem to our flatbed delivery systems is part of that. So as we look and expand into different markets as we move forward from where we currently are, we will continue to evaluate the best opportunity to expand those distribution assets as well to support our growth in pro.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nOkay, thanks. I wanted to revisit Simeon's question about inflection because I know it's a challenging backdrop to predict. But I guess as you think about the business, what are the key building blocks to take the business from this period of moderation to a more stable market backdrop when you talked about low single-digit market growth? I'm curious if you could opine on: is it really the PCE shift? Is it rates? And just any help you provide will be helpful. Thank you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Steven, for that, we're always looking at a balance between ticket and transactions. What was interesting during the COVID period, we had inflation, so we had AUR up, and we had ticket up, also driven by basket size. But the engagement was so high, you really didn't have elasticities. You had driving ticket and transactions, and that's what led to the 25% comp. As inflation has abated in primarily commodities, and those prices have come down, you've seen a falloff in ticket. You didn't get the elasticity initially that you'd expect, and that was because people were still powering through projects. Now it's a mix of what's the level of response from pricing versus pull forward versus the Fed stance, and higher interest rates. So that's all the dynamic that's muddying the traditional ticket and transaction dynamic.\nBut what's healthy for us is a solid comp, equally balanced between ticket and transactions. And that's what we'd be looking for. And now, as we've said, prices have essentially leveled. Our ticket was down modestly. And if you take out commodity, our ticket would have been up for the quarter. And then transactions, we're still working through a bit of that PCE shift, pull forward, whatever that dynamic might be. But we'd be looking for growth in each in a nice balance going forward.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nDirector, Citi\n\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The question I have, I think Michael may have asked previously just about price actions, but I guess maybe to expand that a bit further. So we've been discussing now this trend in weakness in big-ticket for a while. I mean, obviously, a very unique demand backdrop. But again, from your perspective, particularly as you look towards 2024, are there levers that Home Depot could pull to potentially spur better demand within big-ticket other than price?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWell, the number one way that we're focused to drive demand is with the Complex Pro. So that is our key strategy, and that's what we're focused on. It's a $200 billion space, as we've defined the 950 split evenly Pro and consumer. And of the 475 that's Pro, there's 200 billion that is larger Pros, more complex spend that we're building out the capabilities to serve that demand. And that, Brian, is what we're very, very focused on. And think for years and years, that is going to be a driver of our business as we take share in that sort of $200 billion white space.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks, Teddy. Got it. And then my second, my follow-up, much quicker. Obviously, you narrowed your guidance for the balance of the year. We talked about trends in the fiscal Q3. But any commentary on sales trends early here in fiscal Q4?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nOur performance in the first two weeks is on track to achieve our full year 2023 guidance.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nVery good. Well, I appreciate it. Congrats again.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Another one on average ticket here. So pre-COVID, average ticket around $67. I think now it's kind of trending closer to $90, so up 35%. Richard, just wonder if you have any perspective on kind of the like-for-like skew inflation component there versus the big ticket mix. It sounds like your like-for-like inflation seems to be stabilizing. I know there's innovation that can make things not like-for-like, but just curious as you think about the big ticket exposure there and what could potentially play out there, how big of a deal is that? Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you for the question. I think there are a few answers to that. First of all, we have seen inflation abate and really kind of settle on a like-for-like basis across the portfolio. I think it's interesting. You see, we've seen different dynamics in big-ticket over the years as we've had lumber inflation and deflation in particular skewing those results in big-ticket. But Billy, maybe you talk a little bit about trends there.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. I mean, and I'll just echo Ted's response back to Brian. You see categories like drywall, where we have capabilities, roofing, insulation, portable power where we've added innovation. We continue to see great both Pro and consumer reaction to just the innovation and things we're seeing. As it relates to Big-Ticket, obviously, you've seen some deferral and so forth as we talked about. And certainly, the pull forward is probably still playing a part in that as we continue to get further away from the pandemic. So we'll watch that closely. We don't see anything, as I mentioned: stabilized pricing, a rational environment. We don't see anything differing from what we've seen over the last multiple months now.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Thanks for that, guys. Then I guess turning to maybe the leverage and the pace of buyback. I mean, if we stay in this environment of, let's call it, moderation in demand, how do you think about just maybe balancing your buyback approach, leverage? I mean, you're still operating below the 2x. Is there anything that prevents you from kind of moving up to that 2x? Or just kind of curious your latest thoughts around those topics. Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you. We've maintained a position very close to that 2x debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio, and we intend to do so in the foreseeable future. We will also really maintain consistency with respect to capital allocation. We invest in the business first with pay our dividend. And then as we determine excess cash, we flow that to our shareholders in the form of repurchases. To your point, to date, we've repurchased $6.5 billion. There's really no change in our stance. And so I think that's the important takeaway there.\n\nPeter Benedict\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Thanks so much. Good luck.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nOkay. Thanks. Just thinking about the Q4, if we take the midpoint of the implied guidance, it does suggest a little bit of a deceleration, yet it does seem like your business has been consistent. Is that just a function of, \"Am I reading too much into that,\" or do we expect a deceleration? And maybe a second part of that, as you said, Halloween was really strong. Historically, fall into your trim-a-tree or your holiday decorating business. I think it's like in 10 of the last 14 years, your Q4 comp has been better than the Q3. Why should this year be different than that? Thanks.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks for the question. The narrowing of the range is truly what it is. We saw the extreme points of that range become less likely, and so we felt it would be helpful for our investors for us to narrow that range. There has been an assumption all year from the beginning of the year that our guidance reflected a reversion of our share of PCE from the pandemic time period back to 2019 levels. Our prior guidance range assumed that that share would continue to revert throughout the year. We've seen that reversion gradually and steadily. And our current range still has that assumption built in for Q4. We're largely reverted, but not all the way back. So there is some notion of that in our guide.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nOkay. So it sounds like, like I said, it's just a function of getting to the middle of the range. If I could ask one other question, you talked a little bit about storms and seasonality. I think a lot of retailers have said it's been a warm fall. How does that impact you? Do you need it to get cold as we go through the Q4 to drive your business? How should we think about that? Thanks.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nIt's been a little warmer, obviously, but not a big impact. We started to see where the weather has normalized. We started to see some of that fall cleanup and fall business really take off. Haven't seen, obviously, snow and so forth. So it's kind of right in line with what we'd say is a little more normalized year where you see the weather act a little more fallish. You've seen the categories and businesses that you'd expect to trend in that positive direction.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks for taking the time.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from a line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Forbes",
    "content2": "Senior Managing Director of Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nGood morning. Ted, or maybe Fran, just a follow-up on Pro sales, really focusing on the Dallas market versus the chain average. Can you update on how that market's performing? And then maybe just comment on any behavioral differences that you're noting between Pro markets based on the maturity of your strategic initiatives focused on the Complex Pro. I mean, are you seeing and being able to analyze very predictable behavioral changes?\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nSenior EVP, Home Depot\n\nYeah. I'll start off by just saying that the capabilities and functionalities that Hector and Chip have been working on over the last several years are certainly going to help us engineer a great deal of momentum and success with the Pro. And Chip, I'll throw it over to you again because of how intimately you are knowledgeable about that. But the Pro ecosystem is what we're focused on, and not the in-store side or not only the in-store side, but the Complex Pro. And as we build out these capabilities and we see the effectiveness of these capabilities, we're going to continue to leverage those. And Chip, I'll throw it over to you to kind of give a little bit more details on Dallas.\n\nChip Divine\n\nHead of Outside Sales, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Ann. And Steven, yes, absolutely, where we've built capabilities inclusive of assets, distribution assets, and where we've expanded our sales force, we've seen meaningful impact and growth. Our outside sales team is the best-performing cohort of all pros. So we're going to continue, as I mentioned before, to invest in that and then add assets where necessary in the appropriate markets.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThank you. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Richard or Billy. All the big ticket conversations here, any way to just sum up how the quarter for big ticket progressed relative to expectations? It sounds like it performed better than expected. You have sort of stabilization in multi-year big ticket comp trends. I would imagine that wasn't the expectation. But any way to help us frame on how the quarter progressed for big ticket versus internal plan?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. I think, listen, it was largely how we planned it. I called out some great interaction from our consumers as it relates to appliances. Having said that, we were in a better inventory position there. So we saw some tailwind from just our better inventory positions as it relates to that. But it largely played out exactly how we had thought it would. And really, again, back to the prior comments, a very balanced year across the board when you account for some of the weather shifts early on and then what we were lapping with the hurricane. Very balanced across the board and across the regions.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nI think it's important, though, thematically, just to sort of repeat the point. This stance by the Fed of higher for longer is sort of coming across in surveys. There is a deferral of larger projects. And so if you just want to zoom all the way back to the true macro here and the forces on ticket that we're watching, that's probably the largest macro force.\n\nChip Divine\n\nHead of Outside Sales, Home Depot\n\nThat's right.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nChristine, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from a line of Dean Rosenblum with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDean Rosenblum\n\nVP and Equity Analyst of US Hardlines & Broadlines Retail, Bernstein\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my call. My question is about the pro and really just understanding the performance of the pro relative to the comp overall and then splitting that out between store sales to pro versus complex project sales to pro. So just to make sure I'm understanding, you put up a, call it a negative three comp, DIY and pro very close to one another, US slightly worse than Canada and Mexico. So I'm assuming US pro would call it down two, two and a half. And then can you just either verify or correct that? And then can you characterize pro sales in the store relative to pro sales outside of the store through the outside sales force and the CFCs? Thanks.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, taking your last part first, it's an ecosystem like Ann said. We don't have goals or targets with respect to the separation of store and delivered sales. The point is actually lifting all sales. And that's what we've seen consistently in every market where we've rolled out capabilities. Originally, we worried, \"Okay, are delivered sales going to begin to cannibalize the store?\" The opposite has proven true. And so we are progressing in a way that we're pleased. With respect to your first question, factually, the pro did outperform the consumer in Q3, albeit at the narrowest margin we've seen in quite some time. If you actually normalize for commodity impact, the pro was essentially flat for the quarter.\n\nDean Rosenblum\n\nVP and Equity Analyst of US Hardlines & Broadlines Retail, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. And I guess my follow-up would be, when you guys measure big project versus small project, can you just clarify for us how you're determining what constitutes a big project versus a small? Is it like transaction size over $1,000? And if you could clarify that for us, that'd be great.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWe infer from category sales and from comp sales. When you look at categories that are more likely to sell at higher volumes and larger projects, kitchens, flooring, millwork to an extent, we are doing some inference. We also ask our customers what they're seeing and what kind of projects they're working on. We use external survey data that tells us that the nature of projects is kind of shifting from larger to smaller. And so it's a triangulation.\n\nDean Rosenblum\n\nVP and Equity Analyst of US Hardlines & Broadlines Retail, Bernstein\n\nThat's great. That's super helpful. Thank you so much, guys. Good luck in Q4.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nMs. Janci, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Christine. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our Q4 earnings call in February.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine. Good morning everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's Q2 2023 earnings call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President, and CEO; Billy Bastek, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; Ann-Marie Campbell, Executive Vice President of US Stores and International Operations; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors, and as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question with one follow up. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our investor relations department at 770-384-2387. Before I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you Isabel and good morning, everyone. Sales for the Q2 were $42.9 billion, down 2% from the same period last year. Comp sales for the total company as well as their US stores also declined 2% from the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $4.65 in the Q2 compared to $5.05 in the Q2 last year. All three of our US divisions posted low-single-digit negative comps in the quarter. Our geographic variability narrowed significantly on a sequential basis as weather normalized, particularly in our Western Division, and spring-related categories rebounded relative to the Q1.\nWhile there was strength in project related categories like building materials, hardware, and plumbing, we continue to see pressure in certain big ticket discretionary categories. Pro sales performance was slightly negative in the Q2 and outperform the DIY customer. While surveys suggest that pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms. Additionally, projects in these backlogs are generally smaller in scale and scope. In the Q2 we were pleased with the consumers engagement with home improvement, particularly across small projects, which Billy will discuss in greater detail going forward. As we continue to navigate a unique and uncertain environment, our focus continues to be on operating with agility as we respond to evolving customer dynamics while also driving productivity and efficiency throughout the business.\nIn addition, and as we mentioned at our investor conference in June, we operate in a large and fragmented $950 billion plus addressable market. We remain committed to growing the business and believe we are well positioned to continue capturing market share. To that end, I am pleased to announce HD Supply's acquisition of Redi Carpet, a national MRO flooring provider with a proven track record. This acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q3, extends our current product offering in the multifamily customer vertical. With 34 locations strategically located throughout the US, our team will continue to focus on what is most important, our associates and customers. Our merchants, store and met teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter and I'd like to thank them for their dedication and hard work.\nBefore I close, I would like to send our thoughts and prayers to the people of Maui. While we are thankful that our people on the island are all accounted for, we are heartbroken by the loss of life and extreme devastation that the community must now navigate, and we stand ready to help in the days, months, and years ahead. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Billy.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ted, and good morning everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities in the Q2 as we saw weather improve across the country, most notably in our Western Division, we saw an increase in spring sales and strength in smaller ticket projects. In addition, we saw a continuation of the trend we observed starting in the Q4 of Fiscal 2022 with softness in certain big ticket discretionary type purchases. Turning to our department comp performance for the Q2, six of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps including building materials, outdoor garden, hardware, plumbing, tools, and millwork. During the Q2, our comp average ticket was slightly positive and comp transactions decreased 2%.\nExcluding core commodities, Comp average ticket was primarily impacted by inflation across several product categories and as well as demand for new and innovative products. Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 160 basis points during Q2, driven by deflation in lumber. During Q2, we saw a significant decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. As an example, on average framing lumber was approximately $420 per thousand board feet compared to approximately $715 in Q2 2022, representing a decrease of over 40%.\nTurning to total company online sales, sales leveraging our digital platforms increased approximately 1% compared to Q2 of last year. We're excited about our customer engagement across our interconnected platforms as we continue to remove friction from the experience. We know the vast majority of our customers engage with us in an interconnected manner, whether it be through project inspiration and research, transacting fulfilment, or support, our customers blend the physical and digital world. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during Q2, nearly half of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores.\nDuring the Q2, Pro sales were slightly negative and outpaced the DIY customer. While surveys suggest that Pro backlogs are lower than they were a year ago, they are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms. In the Q2 we saw strength across many Pro-heavy categories like gypsum, fasteners, and insulation. In addition, we continue to see strength across smaller projects with positive comps. Performance in a number of categories including live goods, hardscapes, and landscapes.\nBig ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were down 5.5% compared to Q2 of last year. After three years of unprecedented demand in the home improvement market, we continue to see softer engagement in big ticket discretionary categories like patio and appliances. That likely reflects both pull forward of these single item purchases and deferral.\nOur merchandising organization remains focused on being our customer's advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best in class products that are in stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That's why I'm so excited about the innovation we continue to bring to the market. This quarter, we are excited to announce the addition of the Milwaukee brand to our assortment of electrical hand tools. Within this assortment, we will be introducing a brand new line of innovative Milwaukee hand tools that provide a high degree of precision with lasting results for our Pro customers.\nWe've already seen positive results with our Pro customers and feel confident that the addition of these Milwaukee tools will strengthen our position as the number one destination for the electrical trade in the big box retail channel. Additionally, in kitchen and bath, we continue to bring innovation to the market with Glacier Bay. Glacier Bay is one of The Home Depot's top proprietary brands known for performance and style. This fall we are excited to grow our faucet lineup to include innovative functionality such as touchless spring neck designs, add to our assortment of sinks and showerheads, while also expanding into new categories like disposals. We are also extremely excited about our lineup for Halloween.\nOur merchants have worked with our supplier partners to put together an expanded assortment of product offerings for this Halloween season, including the return of many fan favorites as well as new collections for the Halloween enthusiast. These products bring excitement to our stores and help drive traffic, and our sneak preview of our Halloween lineup was a tremendous success. We are thrilled for the full rollout in the coming weeks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP of US Stores and International Operations, The Home Depot\n\nThanks Billy and good morning everyone. Our store teams have a relentless focus on cultivating the best customer experience in home improvement. We know that our associates are a key differentiator and they are essential in helping us sustain the customer experience we strive for. In order to provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail. This means not only investing in competitive wages and benefits, but also providing tools, training, and development opportunities that make working at The Home Depot an enjoyable and rewarding experience.\nI am happy to share that our approximately $1 billion of annualized compensation investment that we announced earlier this year is having the intended effects. This quarter we continued to see meaningful improvement in our attrition rates, particularly among our most tenured associates. More consistent staffing levels are resulting in improved customer service, productivity, and safety. These improvements are exactly what we set out to achieve with this wage investment.\nIn addition to investing in our associates, we must also leverage technology to further simplify both the associate and customer experience. As you heard at our Investor and Analyst conference in June, our customers' journeys differ depending on the project they're working on. They shop with us in different ways. There is the unassisted cash and carry purchase which represents a significant majority of our in-store sales, and the remaining sales are assisted purchases where customers need help in purchasing a product, a service, or installation. It is critical that we have the right products in stock, in the right quantity, and on the shelf available for purchase, particularly for non-assisted sales. That's why you hear us talk about our focus on improving our on-shelf availability or OSA positions.\nWe're working to narrow the gap between what is considered in stock, meaning our systems indicate it is in store, versus on the shelf and available for sale for the customer. We're doing this by starting to leverage new technology such as computer vision. Computer vision enables technology to do what we previously relied on associate eyes to do and provides specific locations of depalletized product that is stored in our overhead. To start, associates will take a picture of bays using their HD phones. These images then feed into our systems and provide a single real-time view of inventory that can then seamlessly integrate into applications like Sidekick. Powered by machine learning, Sidekick directs associates to key bays where OSA's low or outs exist. This helps our teams prioritize the highest value task inside their respective stores.\nThe beauty of the machine learning model is that the algorithm is continuously learning as computer vision images are captured and scientific tasks are completed. So it will get better and better at directing our associates to the right bay at the right time. While it's early days as we have begun implementing this technology, we have seen meaningful improvements. Improvements in OSA, increased associate engagement, productivity, and higher customer service scores. In terms of our assisted sales experience, we have worked to improve this experience by enhancing our systems and processes, and have made significant strides. Historically, our associates had to navigate dozens of different systems. Over the last several years we have invested to simplify the order management system in our stores. With the introduction of Order Up, we have created a more robust, intuitive system that is easy for the first day associate to use.\nThis system enables any associate to more easily serve customers across a number of different applications, whether that's picking up an order, placing an order, changing an order, or scheduling a service or installation. Not only does Order Up make it easier to fulfill a customer's needs, but it also frees up more time for associates to spend serving customers who need assistance while in our stores. These enhancements have made the average Order Up experience over 40% faster for the customer, which has led to improved customer service scores. These initiatives are just a few examples of the many different types of projects that can drive significant impact for customers, our associates, and shareholders. I am so excited about all that our store teams are doing to focus on both the customer and associate experience.\nNone of this would be possible without our amazing associates, and I want to thank them for all they do to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThank you Anne and good morning everyone. In the Q2, total sales were $42.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $900 million, or 2% from last year. During the Q2, our total company comps were -2%, with comps of -2.6% in May, -3.3% in June, and -0.2% in July. Comps in the US were -2% for the quarter, with comps of -2.6% in May, -3.3% in June, and -0.4% in July. As you heard from Billy, during the Q2 we continued to experience lumber deflation compared to the prior year. While lumber prices were down, we saw an improvement in unit productivity resulting in a net negative comp impact of approximately 85 basis points versus the Q2 of 2022.\nIn the Q2, our gross margin was 33%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the Q2 last year, primarily driven by pressure from shrink. During the Q2, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 100 basis points to 17.6% compared to the Q2 of 2022. Our operating expense performance during the Q2 reflects our previously executed compensation increases for hourly associates as well as deleverage from our top line results. Our operating margin for the Q2 was 15.4% compared to 16.5% in the Q2 of 2022.\nInterest and other expense for the Q2 increased by $49 to 428 million due primarily to interest on our floating rate debt as well as higher debt balances than a year ago. In the Q2, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, up from 24.3% in the Q2 of Fiscal 2022. Our diluted earnings per share for the Q2 was $4.65, a decrease of 7.9% compared to the Q2 of 2022. During the Q2 we opened two new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,326. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million sq ft. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $23.3 billion, down $2.8 billion compared to the Q2 of 2022, and inventory turns were 4.4X, down from 4.5X last year.\nTurning to capital allocation, after investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During Q2, we invested approximately $800 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. During the quarter, we paid approximately $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.\nComputed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months. Return on invested capital was approximately 41.5%, down from 45.6% in Q2 of Fiscal 2022. Now I'll comment on our guidance for Fiscal 2023. Today we are reaffirming our guidance for 2023. We expect Fiscal 2023 sales and comp sales to decline between 2% and 5%. We are targeting an operating margin between 14.3% and 14% for the year. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%.\nWe expect interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion. We are anticipating between a 7% and 13% decline in diluted earnings per share compared to Fiscal 2022. In addition, we continue to focus on driving productivity in the business and feel confident that we will realize the previously announced $500 million in annualized cost savings in 2024.\nWe also remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers with our leading product authority in home improvement, strong in stock levels, and knowledgeable associates. We will continue to prudently invest to strengthen our competitive position and leverage our scale and low cost position to outperform our market and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call, and Christine, we are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star one. If you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So I think the big question is, you know.For the industry, have we seen the bottom? You did a down 4.5% in Q1. You needed the down 2% in Q2. July was flat. So how are you thinking about the trends going forward? Was there anything in Q2 that we shouldn't extrapolate on a go forward basis? Whether that was weather shift or was there something about July that benefited that month in particular?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nGood morning, Chris, it's Ted. The quick answer is yes, July really was a weather shift. We had a particularly wet and cold June, and with that weather shift, the months of the Q2 were all sequentially about that same -2%. But to answer your question from a more macro perspective on where we see the industry and the demand, you know, just start by saying, you know, as you all know, we looked at 2023 as a year of moderation after the explosive growth we had the prior few years. And as we called out, consumers would be shifting their spending from goods to services. And while that shift is happening, the overall economy in the country, consumer in particular, have remained incredibly resilient. As we all know, the economy continues to grow.\nAnother great GDP print for the Q2, and fears of a recession, or at least a severe recession, have largely subsided. The consumer is generally healthy. PCE spending continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate. If you look at the home improvement customer, our core customer, the homeowner, they've seen continued growth in home equity over the last several years, strong job growth, and increases in wages, so that the core customer remains strong. If you look at Home Depot, you look at our operations, what we can specifically control, we feel great about where we are. Halfway through this year, as you saw the meaningful reduction in inventory, we think our inventory positions are better placed than they've been in the past few years. Our in-stock rates have continued to improve.\nOur value proposition remains strong, and as Ann called out, the wage investments are really paying off. But given all those positives, in that we're pleased in Q2, uncertainties remain. We don't know how quickly or further the share shift in PCE will occur and where spending in home improvement in particular will ultimately settle. And we don't know what impact the monetary policy actions, which are specifically intended to dampen consumer demand, will ultimately have on consumer sentiment in the overall economy. And as I said, while we did see the sequential improvement in our comp sales, a lot of that was a seasonal recovery in Q2. And as I said specifically in July, as well as the impact of lumber is beginning to abate and as Billy called out, we do continue to see pressure in certain big ticket discretionary categories.\nSo while there's a lot of positives in the macro and with the consumer, we still see enough uncertainty, really largely driven by this PCE shift and where that ultimately lands, that we again, we feel good. We just thought there was too much uncertainty to take, for example, revise our guidance. From earlier in the year. But having said all of that, long answer. When we do get through this period of moderation, you know, we remain incredibly bullish on the sector. We couldn't feel better about the macro for housing and home improvement in our prospects and inability to keep taking share in this huge and still largely fragmented market.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you for that. My follow-up question is on the ticket side. I mean, you are, if you run stacks or CAGRs on your average ticket, it did deteriorate in the Q2 relative to the first. So can you talk about the drivers of that and how much of that is this shift of smaller ticket projects accelerating? Because you're going to start to lap through that ticket project pressure in the Q4. So is what you're seeing now indicative of that, that shift from large to small is accelerating? So we can't just, you know, assume that we sort of annualize that out in the Q4.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, Chris, this is Richard. First, just with respect to stacks and progression, you know, what we're encouraged by is we're seeing cost pressures in our industry sort of abate. We're seeing ticket and transactions actually begin to converge. We think that that's actually a healthy signal in the business. I think that's the most macro comment that we could make about ticket progression with respect to large versus small projects.\nCertainly our customers and our contractors tell us that there is some stance of deferral when it comes to large projects. Customers are opting for, they're more likely to opt for smaller versus larger and that may have some impact on ticket, but we're also seeing the impacts of what we call softness in certain large ticket discretionary item purchases like patio appliances. So there's a lot going on there. But I think that maybe the most important dynamic is just kind of that nice recovery in transactions as both ticket and transactions begin to converge and normalize.\n\nChristopher Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nUnderstood. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst in Hardlines, Broadlines and Food Retail, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given this trend of small transactions coming in and maybe even replacing large transactions, is it more likely that you can take the low end of your guidance off the table of a down 5% comp for the year outside of some macroeconomic shock at this point?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, Michael, I don't want to go through the answer I just went through with Chris.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst in Hardlines, Broadlines and Food Retail, UBS\n\nI hear you.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nThat pretty much laid out the view. I mean, again, we feel really good about the Q2. Clearly we like the sequential improvement and as Richard said, the normalization and settling, if you will, of a much healthier balance of ticket and transactions. But there's still just a lot of uncertainty. Is the Fed going to raise? Are we going to get a budget deal passed? I mean there's so many things out there swirling that we just updated or reaffirmed in June that we're just more comfortable standing pat right now.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThe other thing just to at least know that we're watching is our share of PCE. We've watched this since our sales spiked in 2020. As you know, not a perfect measurement, but certainly a way to think contextually about what we saw during the three years of unprecedented growth. As predicted, we've seen our share of PCE, as Ted mentioned, as we've seen share shift from goods into services, we have also seen our share of PCE.\nSteadily revert back towards 2019 levels. When you think about the bottom end of our sales guidance, that actually corresponds with the math that would say if our share of PCE reverted all the way back to 2019 levels, that would imply the low end of the guidance. We don't see anything in our business today that tells us that that's the trajectory, but that is the math of our PCE share shift. And I'd also just repeat, Ted, we're not sure where that share ultimately settles. The home is so much more important from a financial perspective for you'd say all homeowners than it was three years ago, that perhaps there's an elevated level of home improvement spend in PCE versus prior years. We just don't know. But that low end of the range does correspond to the PCE share shift math.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst in Hardlines, Broadlines and Food Retail, UBS\n\nUnderstood. My follow up question is Home Depot's operating expenses this year are being impacted by the $1 billion wage investment. But SG&A growth over the last few years has been anything but normal. So the key debate here is has the company entered a period where the cost of doing business has just gone up such that even if the cycle recovers in 2024, the company won't see a significant improvement in its profitability because so much will need to be reinvested back in operating expenses based on what's happening right now?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, I wouldn't paint that picture, Michael. Clearly too early to talk about 2024, but we made a significant investment in wages. As Ann said, we're in a much more comfortable position on a national minimum level and where we are in competitive markets.\nSo again, as Ann had mentioned, we couldn't feel better about the returns on that investment. We don't expect that we're going to need to make that outsize of an investment in the near-term planning horizon. Wage rates are still up, but we're seeing those come down. Annual increases that we track month to month, as I'm sure you do, are moderating. So we don't see another big wage investment. And then this business, as it always does, will leverage with volume in those dynamics. Of this P&L leveraging with modest comps, that investment thesis remains intact.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nIt might just do to remind, as we laid out in the investor conference, in a market normalized case with 3% to 4% top line growth, in a normalized case we expect margin expansion based on operating expense leverage that would lead to mid- to high-single-digit EPS growth. So nothing's really structurally changed that much. But it is worth just pointing back to our comments in June.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nEquity Research Analyst in Hardlines, Broadlines and Food Retail, UBS\n\nUnderstood. Thank you so much. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZack Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Can you help us unpack the cadence of DIY versus Pro from Q1 to Q2, as last quarter saw a DIY outperform Pro for, I think, the first time in two years. And with that reversing out in Q2, curious how you think about the moving parts between the two and if we should expect the spread to widen or contract going forward.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nZach, I wouldn't read too much into that. There was so much noise in Q1.\nThat, I just say, that was an outlier. The theme of the Pro responding to the investments we're making in outperforming the consumer that we just saw in Q2 is consistent with what we've seen. But for an outlier, very noisy Q1.\n\nZack Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGotcha. Richard, you had talked about the $500 million in cost savings next year coming out of the base. But I believe there's also about 10 to 20 basis points of productivity benefits this year. I'm hoping you could speak to first of all the differences between the two and the buckets of savings, and then whether that 10 to 20 basis points for this year is in the base today or if it builds through the year.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nSure, Zach. Thanks. Yes, that 10 to 20 basis points is something we called out at the very beginning of the year when we or and actually when we talked about the progression of margin. And so, or rather, the range of operating margin outcomes that you can think of that as really productivity that we anticipate in ordinary course. It certainly offset expenses such as the wage investment. But it was part of our original guidance and consistent with revised guidance in Q1 and consistent with guidance today, the $500 million cost out that we anticipate for 2024. It's separate, and it really reflects our rationalization in most parts of the cost structure that we had to build up as we saw.\nProduct volume skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021. So we built a cost structure that isn't necessary today in today's volumes. And so we will rationalize some of that cost structure. A good example would be a warehouse that we took a lease on to hold product during 2020 and 2021. We are looking at our real estate footprint, and some of that may well be rationalized. And with that comes cost savings. That's the nature of the $500 million. Think about it as a permanent reduction in our fixed cost base.\n\nZack Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll these are SG&A, right? Just to confirm.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThere's probably some. There could be some geography in COGS and in operating expense, but you know, we haven't settled on that yet. To your question, let me just make sure that we're clear that initial 10 to 20 basis points of productivity is included in our operating margin guidance for 2023. No part of the $500 million is included in 2023. That is assumed full year benefit annualized in 2024.\n\nZack Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Appreciate the time. Thanks Richard.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning guys. You talked about relative strength in the smaller project spending. But in an environment with negative pro sales and smaller pro backlogs, how are you guys benchmarking your efforts to gain traction in the large and complex pro business you've spent a lot of time talking about?\n\nHector Padilla\n\nEVP of Outside Sales and Services, The Home Depot\n\nHey Scott, this is Hector. Good morning. As we mentioned in the investors conference, what we are building as far as the ecosystem for the Pro, it is hard, and it will take some time. Now, the good news is that it will also be very hard to replicate, as you know. Today we're very encouraged by the signals that we are getting from our Pro customers as they engage with different pieces of the ecosystem. We are in many markets today with the expanded ecosystem. There are pieces of the ecosystem that we don't have fully deployed. Think of an order management system or a trade credit. But we continue to gauge our performance with our Pros.\nThose pros continue to engage not only in the supply chain assets that we have built and with our outside sales resources as we expanded that team, but they were visiting our stores on a more frequent basis. So we continue to be very encouraged by what that cohort is, how it's performing, and we'll continue to invest in the efforts.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nOkay, good. Thank you, Hector. Then just a second question, inventory was down quite a bit, even with a negative comp. Would you guys expect that to mark the bottom of your destocking process or should we expect inventory levels to continue to drop? Thanks.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nWell, we're pleased with the progress we've made relative to our inventory position. You know, you think about everything that's happened in the supply chain, and lead times associated with that has helped. We like it, we still have work to do to improve productivity, but we feel good about our inventory, and you know, we have low obsolescence risk and super experienced merchant teams. So a lot of the dynamics in the supply chain helped us really. And at the same time, I might add, our in stocks are better than they've been since, you know, since before the pandemic. So we're really pleased about the inventory productivity, but at the same time, our in stocks, our ability to be in stock below 80% is a no-call-out or OSA, and so really pleased with both of those pieces.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGot it. Thanks. All right.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJackie Sussman\n\nEquity Research Junior Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey there. This is Jackie Sussman on for Simeon. Thanks so much for taking our question. You were speaking earlier on small projects replacing large projects. Can you drill into the backlogs a bit more? You know, how much have they come off of peak? How far above normal levels are they? And is there any evidence you're seeing that construction are fully pushing off or canceling projects rather than just trading down? Thanks.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, I'll start on that one. We rely on publicly published surveys. The one that we watch is the National Association of Home Builders index. We have seen backlogs decline sequentially, but yet they are well above the historical average. And so, you know, you'd really say the professional customer's been oversubscribed for so many years that they still may have a full book of business, just not maybe oversubscribed. They may be taking phone calls again, but they are very healthy. Again, if you think about the historical average, and you can look this up, but historical average being a score of 50, the index is still at a 61, so down from peak, but higher than average.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nIn addition to, you know, the publicly available indexes, you know, obviously we have millions of pros and the field salesforce that Hector mentioned. So anecdotally, we're getting loads of feedback from our customer base. They're still busy and engaged with those backlogs, but, you know, it's their commentary to our sales force that they're smaller. So that's where we get the color on that dynamic.\n\nJackie Sussman\n\nEquity Research Junior Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. That's helpful color. And just one quick follow-up, shrink was the only real call out on the gross margin line. Can you talk about how that trended in the quarter? Did it get worse or any better? And are there any actions that you're taking to kind of mitigate that impact going forward?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Shrink has been a consistent pressure over the last several quarters and even last few years, and it's something we're tackling every day. And Ann maybe?\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP of US Stores and International Operations, The Home Depot\n\nWe are certainly in a battle in retail as we kind of think about shrink, but we have always continued to lean into initiatives that we've seen that can have impact to mitigate overall. I know it's early as we think about the INFORM Act, but the INFORM Act is one of the key components, as we think about organized retail crime, that I think will help give us a little bit more visibility in some of the things that are happening out there. Certainly it's been largely in line with what we've seen in the last several quarters. We certainly have key initiatives to help mitigate that, and we need our kind of government partners to help on their end as well to help us in retail to really mitigate what we're seeing out there.\n\nJackie Sussman\n\nEquity Research Junior Associate, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst in Hardlines Retail, Citi\n\nGreat.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nGood morning.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThanks very much for taking my question. I was hoping you could comment a bit more about the homeowner engagement that you talked about. Sounds like it was a bit of a sequential improvement. You know, was that largely weather driven or are you actually seeing some elasticity of demand as inflation eases in some categories?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nYeah, thanks, Steven. No, I think, you know, we articulated earlier about the weather patterns. We actually talked in Q1 about the impact that the West had. The West was our best performing region, best performing division for Q2. So we saw a lot of that engagement back into those spring categories. We pushed a little bit around from June to July with some of the weather and the heat, as you saw, you know, more in ACs and fans. So a much more normalized balance to the quarter outside of just some shifting of some of those smaller seasonal pieces.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst in Hardlines Retail, Citi\n\nOkay, great. And then just a clarification on second half expectations. You know, is there any difference in how you're thinking about the business in the third quarter versus the Q4 comps? And then maybe a more near term question. If July benefited a bit from weather, how has August to date trended? Is it fair to say you're kind of back within that full year guidance range?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nRight. So the first two weeks of the third quarter have been a little better than our first half comp. But we have 24 weeks left in the year, so we think the guidance range is appropriate.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst in Hardlines Retail, Citi\n\nOkay. And then just third quarter versus Q4. Should we just kind of look at the one year, one year comparisons?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nYou know, we're not going to provide quarterly guidance. And again, you know, we've got 24 weeks left in the year, so we think the range is appropriate.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst in Hardlines Retail, Citi\n\nOkay, thanks. Best luck in the back half. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nThanks very much. Great quarter. You know, you committed to investing $1 billion in wages this year, but as comps and transactions have remained negative and the flexibility that you have with the transaction-based labor model, is there the potential for that full amount not to be realized or will you reinvest it in other parts of the business?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, from a financial perspective, of course there's an assumption around, you know, how many hours would be utilized during the year? There's something that has to be multiplied against the wage. But I wouldn't say this is a material; you're not going to see a material change in our financial profile. And again, our guidance is the best guideline for you to look at with respect to our annual, likely annual performance.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. And then for Ann, just can you elaborate a little bit more on the computer vision technology? How quickly is that going to be rolled out across the chain and maybe elaborate on some of the benefits you think you could see in the near-term?\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP of US Stores and International Operations, The Home Depot\n\nOh sure. So first of all, we started with Sidekick application with direct associates to pack down product from the overhead. And so Sidekick is a task tool. Computer vision helps that associate see where the product is in the overhead, so, which is a complementary component to drive overall productivity. So we are certainly bullish. We have that in.\nA region that's fully rolled out already. We have that in what we consider pilot stores across every single region, and we expect that to be rolled out later this year. We're seeing some really, really good output finding products that take a ton of time in our stores. So I've been around for a long time, my neck looking up in the overhead trying to find product for customer's sake. And we have thousands of associates that's doing that every day. So complementing directing the task, and then finding exactly where the product is in the overhead drives a ton of productivity for us, and we expect to roll that out later this year.\n\nChuck Grom\n\nManaging Director, Gordon Haskett\n\nGreat. Thanks Anne.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP of US Stores and International Operations, The Home Depot\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, the risk of being maybe a bit repetitive with regard to inflation, I guess maybe now disinflation. So, as we're starting to see, I know you mentioned your prepared comments, the lumber price dynamic that we're seeing improved unit demand. But the question I have is we're seeing we're moving past maybe peakish inflation and getting more to stay disinflation. How are you seeing the overall business flex here both from, I guess, from what you're doing as well as how your consumers are reacting generally.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nBroadly on the inflation piece. Well, we still expect that the overall year will have a net inflationary. Impact on our costs and retails. But as we go into the second half, it is moderating when you look at just the activity of cost increase requests. I mean, there are a couple, and we were in the billions of dollars at one point of cost in, and so net new requests for cost, and certainly cost increases in the supply chain. That's all completely abated.\nAs we go into the second half. When you think of product cost, transportation, overall transportation cost, and then what ultimately do in retail, you know, inflation has certainly abated. You know, commodities are certainly down meaningfully from the peak, as well as year over year, as well as even shorter term. But beyond commodities and the fact that we don't have increased inflation. We're not expecting a deflationary environment. I think Richard used the term settling. We're kind of settling into these non-commodity price levels. And as the Pro and consumer customer has, you know, gotten used to those over the last few years, you're seeing the normalization in transactions, as Richard called out. So we're encouraged that the cycle of inflation is essentially behind us. And Richard, I don't know if you or Billy have anything else to add to that.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nNo, I'd say we are encouraged by the improvement in transactions as we see the normalized pieces that Richard spoke about earlier. But we don't see a deflationary environment as we go forward.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThat's very helpful. Then the second question I have, and I know it's going to be a bit nuanced, but you know, just to understand how your consumers really reacted here. So as you look at the West Coast, you called out, I think it was a point of strength in the quarter as weather maybe normalized a bit. But the question I have is, you know, as you're watching that consumer, you know, reengage with Home Depot amid more normal weather conditions, is there anything there surprising or is the consumer coming back like you would normally expect with a weather shift like we've seen?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot",
    "content2": "Yeah, I'd say, Brian, that we, you know, we called it out in Q1 because of the impact that we saw, and it played out precisely kind of how we thought in the West. As I mentioned, that was our best performing division. Customers engaged heavily in our seasonal businesses that were so pressured into. And so it really did play out precisely how we had thought.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nOkay, thanks. Two please. If I could. One, bigger picture. I think last quarter, maybe, was in the June analyst day. You said that you thought the housing market would be down mid- to high-single digits in 2023. That was sort of the industry baseline. There's been some indicators of housing being a little bit better. Is that still the way you're thinking about the industry right now, down in that mid- to high-single digit range?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, we said there are some economists who might call for that. We were uncertain. And that's really because when you look at supply and demand imbalances in the market, we've worked our way into a structural deficit of housing in North America. And what's interesting to us is you've actually seen sequential improvement month over month in home prices. For the last four months. So I think if you just look at observed data, home prices have for the most part remained steady versus last year, and so better than many economists' predictions at the beginning of the year.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nOkay, but has your view changed at all, or too much uncertainty?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWe didn't ascribe any housing benefit to our guidance for 2023, and we think long-term those supports for home improvement demand are there, and we do think that that supply-demand imbalance is an important part of that, along with the aging of the housing stock. So again, we're bullish on the future of this market.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nYeah, I think that the big, the big story with housing now as it's playing out is values have held up. In Case-Shiller just came out with some data and Redfin just, Redfin just came out with some data. That drop-off in values has been erased, and that we're now back to record highs of home values in the United States, and sequential improvement. As Richard just said, the near-term story in housing is that with so many people locked into the incredibly low mortgage rates, that there just isn't a lot of inventory available for sale.\nSo transactions are at certainly near-term lows in terms of nominal number of houses that are turning over in a percentage of the housing stock is so many people are below 5% even at 3% mortgage rate. So values are holding, if not now back increasing. Fundamental imbalance again of two to three to four million homes. The issue is inventory. You know, people are getting used to it. We understand new buyers have sort of digested the increase in mortgage rates to the 7% but there's just not that much available to purchase.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nYep, okay, makes sense. Sorry, that was one question. The follow up is this. If I could, you had said I hate to be so short term focus. August was better than the first half comps. Any comment on August versus the Q2 comps?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nYou know, again, the first two weeks of the quarter are a little better than our first half comp. We have 24 weeks left, and so we just, we point you back to our guidance.\n\nMichael Baker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nOkay, fair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nHi, thanks very much. So two questions. The first is, when you think about the dynamics on DIY versus the Pro in terms of the impact to your second half comp and then into 2024, how are you thinking about DIY in terms of recovery? I think it's pretty clear where you stand on the backlog with the Pro. But I think DIY is the big question in terms of how that customer will feel and is going to feel in the second half.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nWell, you know, I think at the end of the day it's all the same demand and whether the Pro is fulfilling that demand or not, you know, it's sort of all the same. So I wouldn't, you know, I actually would view it as saying we feel good about where our Pro business is. We feel good about the entirety of it really. We don't know where those trends will go. But again, we know our Pros say their backlogs are healthy.\nI would say this,\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nAnd then the second question is.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, The Home Depot\n\nNo, I was just going to say, you know, that the consumer, the near-term view of consumer is the engagement in seasonal is led by the consumer, certainly the garden business. But also things like exterior painting and stain. And when the weather improved, consumers responded and it was really steady, constructive demand. So what we expect going forward, I think you look at all those macro comments. We mentioned earlier that, you know, our consumer is a homeowner. 80-odd percent of them own their homes with tremendous equity value in that home.\nYou know, great jobs, great income, and it's a very healthy. consumer segment in the overall economy. So, seeing their engagement in Q2 as weather improved, seeing their engagement in something like Halloween, I mean, it's not an enormous business for us. But you know, to say unbelievable engagement, Billy, in that product category which is, you know, 100% discretionary is a pretty decent telltale of engagement in the sector.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nOkay, that's really helpful, thank you. And then my second question is, Richard, you always discuss your ability to flex, you know, SG&A with respect to labor, but then also inventory rapidly based on the comp in order to maintain stability with operating margins. So I guess my question is, with the recent wage investments, do you still have the same flexibility within the same timeline in general with that rule of thumb in mind?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nAbsolutely. I mean you'd say that the jumping off point would be post wage investment. Post wage investment we have the same degree of flexibility we have always had.\n\nKaren Short\n\nManaging Director, Credit Suisse\n\nOkay, thanks very much.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nChristine. We have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nGood morning, everyone. So just two quick follow-ups. The first on big ticket. Curious if you could expand on DIY ticket versus Pro ticket trends as we think about sort of second half complexion, and then maybe if you could just speak to what the full year comp implies in terms of ticket, if it's still positive as you see it today?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, The Home Depot\n\nYou know, I'll answer the second part first and I'll turn to Billy.\nAgain. We've got 24 weeks to go. We're not going to break out ticket and transaction within our guidance other than just to repeat. We're encouraged by what we've seen with respect to settling of ticket and recovery in transactions. Billy?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot\n\nYeah, and as we called out, just on the lumber piece alone, you know, we'll see that debate as we get to the back half of the year, and it'll be much less of an impact than we saw in the first half overall.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThen just lastly, as we think about the Dallas market, the 350 basis points you guys noted as of 2022 at the analyst day presentation, any update on how that market is trending year to date, 2023 versus the company average?\n\nHector Padilla\n\nEVP of Outside Sales and Services, The Home Depot\n\nYeah, no. Steven, it's Hector again. We continue to be very encouraged by the results in Dallas, and we have scaled a lot of the capabilities that we first implemented in Dallas to all the markets, and we're seeing very similar and encouraging results as we see the customers engage not just with the delivery sales, but also again back in our stores and through our online digital platform. So continue to be very encouraged about the performance for us. Dallas has been a success so far, and we continue to deploy capabilities to round out the ecosystem in Dallas and again in other markets as we test and learn and deploy capabilities at scale.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Janci for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, The Home Depot\n\nThank you, Christine. Thank you for joining us today, everyone. We look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter earnings call in November.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."

Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Over the past three years, we grew our business $47 billion, or 43%. After this period of unprecedented growth, we expected demand would moderate in fiscal 2023, which our Q1 results reflect. Sales for Q! were $37.3 billion, down 4.2% from the same period last year. Comp sales declined 4.5% from the same period last year, and our US stores had negative comps of 4.6%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.82 in Q1, compared to $4.09 in Q1 last year. Our sales for the quarter were below our expectations, primarily driven by lumber deflation and unfavorable weather, particularly in our Western Division, as extreme weather events in California disproportionately impacted our results. As you will hear from Billy, where weather was favorable, we saw strength in key spring-related categories, such as live goods and other garden-related categories.\nAs we look beyond weather and lumber deflation, our underlying performance in the quarter was mixed. We saw more pressure across the business compared to what we observed when we reported Q4 results a few months ago. While there was relative strength in project-related categories like building materials, plumbing, and hardware, we had many departments with negative comps in the quarter and continued to see pressure in a number of big-ticket discretionary categories. DIY customers outperformed the pro in the quarter, but both were negative. While internal and external surveys suggest that pro backlogs are still healthy and elevated relative to historical norms, they are lower than they were a year ago. Additionally, recent external data points suggest that the types of projects in these backlogs are changing from large-scale remodels to smaller projects.\nThough we are only one quarter into the year, we believe the underperformance this quarter relative to our expectations, lumber deflation and continued uncertainty around underlying demand warrants a more cautious sales outlook for the remainder of the year. Richard will take you through the details in a moment, but we are now guiding to a comp sales decline between 2% and 5%. Reflecting this updated comp guidance, we now expect our operating margin rate to be between 14.3% and 14%, and earnings per share to decline between 7% and 13%. We continue to navigate a unique environment. We will remain agile and respond to evolving customer dynamics while always being an advocate for value. In addition, we feel confident that the investments we have made in wages are driving the intended results.\nAs Ann will discuss, in the short time frame since our most recent wage enhancements took effect, we are attracting a greater number of qualified applicants, and attrition is down. Lastly, and as you would expect, we will continue to focus on driving productivity and efficiency across the business. While the near-term environment is uncertain, we remain bullish on the medium to long-term outlook for home improvement and our ability to grow share in this large and fragmented market. We look forward to sharing our perspective on the many opportunities ahead when we meet at our investor and analyst conference coming up on 13 June.\nOur team continues to focus on what is most important: our associates and customers. Our merchant, store, and MET teams, supplier partners, and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter.I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. I'd also like to introduce Billy Bastek, who was recently named EVP of Merchandising. Billy is a 33-year veteran of the Home Depot and brings tremendous experience to the role, having spent his entire career with us in various roles of increasing responsibility throughout the merchandising organization. Not only is Billy a world-class merchant and leader, he's also a fantastic steward of our culture, and it is my pleasure to welcome him to the call today.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during Q1 , our sales were below our expectations, primarily driven by lumber deflation and unfavorable weather. We also saw a continuation of the trend we observed in Q4, with consumers pulling back on big-ticket and some discretionary-type purchases. However, where weather was favorable, we saw strength in smaller-ticket outdoor projects. Turning to our department comp performance for Q1, four of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, which were building materials, hardware, plumbing, and millwork. During Q1, our comp average ticket increased 0.2%, and comp transactions decreased 5%.\nExcluding core commodities, comp average ticket was primarily impacted by inflation across several product categories, as well as the demand for new and innovative products. Deflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 335 basis points during Q1, driven primarily by deflation in lumber. During Q1, we saw a significant decline in lumber prices relative to a year ago. As an example, on average, framing lumber was approximately $420 per 1,000 board feet, compared to approximately $1,170 in Q1 2022, which is a decrease of 64%. Turning to total company online sales, sales leveraging our digital platform decreased approximately 2.9% compared to Q1 of last year. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during Q1, over 45% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores.\nDIY customers outperformed the pro in the quarter, but both were negative. Pro results experienced a disproportionate impact as a result of lumber deflation, and a wet start to spring negatively impacted both customer cohorts. Big-ticket comp transactions, or those over $1,000, were down 6.5% compared to Q1 of last year. We saw some big-ticket strength across pro-heavy categories like portable power, gypsum, and pipe and fittings. After a couple of years of unprecedented demand in the home improvement market, we continue to see softness in big-ticket discretionary categories like patio, grills, and appliances that likely reflects deferral of these single-item purchases and pull forward. In addition, we've seen demand soften across other parts of the business, including flooring, kitchen, and bath. This softer demand may reflect consumers moving away from larger to smaller projects.\nWhile there are factors impacting the home improvement market, our merchandising organization will continue to focus on being our customers' advocate for value. This means continuing to provide a broad assortment of best-in-class products that are in stock and available for our customers when they need it. We will also continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and money. That's why I'm so excited about the innovation we're bringing to the market, whether it's Leviton's Decora Edge, Viega Copper Press fittings, or the launch of Behr Dynasty exterior paint, just to name a few. At our upcoming investor conference, I look forward to sharing more about these products and some of my favorite product innovations with you in person.\nIt's the power of our vendor relationships, coupled with our best-in-class merchant organization that allows us to offer our customers the best brands with the most innovation to solve pain points, increase functionality, or enhance performance at the best value in the market. Now, let's turn our attention to spring. While we've had a slower start to the season, we continue to be excited about the lineup of products we have for our customers and remain ready to help them with their outdoor projects or outdoor living needs. As you've heard us say many times, we have a great lineup of outdoor power products, and our assortment of RYOBI, Milwaukee, DEWALT, and Makita offers something for everyone, building on an ecosystem of innovative tools powered by the same battery platforms. Our live goods look incredible.\nWe're ready for spring with everything from shrubs to a variety of flowers, herbs, vegetables for every type of gardener. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ann.\n\nAnn-Marie Campbell\n\nEVP of US Stores and International Operations, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Billy, and good morning, everyone. We believe that in order to provide the best customer experience, we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail. Last quarter, I spoke about the investments we have made to make it easier for our associates to succeed at the Home Depot. We also announced that we would be investing approximately $1 billion in annualized compensation for frontline hourly associates. Today, I want to update you on key areas of improvement that we've seen thus far. Our ability to attract qualified pools of candidates and hire from the top tier of these pools has improved, even in our higher volume stores. In March, we saw the greatest year-over-year improvement in our attrition rates across all associate tenure cohorts that we've seen in some time.\nAs a result, we've seeing improvements in key customer service metrics, as well as benefits to our operations in the form of consistent staffing and less safety incidents across all our regions. These improvements are exactly what we set out to achieve with this wage investment. The consistency and talent of our workforce is an important foundation for driving both customer service and productivity. It also gives us the ability and confidence to accelerate other key initiatives that are yielding positive results with respect to customer service and productivity. We have implemented changes to our order fulfillment processes to drive speed and efficiency when picking and staging orders for customers. Historically, we have allocated fulfillment hours based on overall order volume. Now, we have transitioned to allocating hours more accurately based on the types of products being picked.\nJust for example, it takes us less time to pick and stage a paintbrush versus a patio set. We are also grouping fulfillment orders in batches so that associates can pick multiple orders at one time. We also continue to focus on simplification. We've talked about leveraging the Sidekick application to help associates prioritize the highest value task more effectively. Powered by our machine learning logic, Sidekick directs associates to key bays where on-shelf availability is low or outs exist. Since Sidekick was rolled out last year, we've seen improvement in our on-shelf availability for all SKUs, but we've seen the most improvement in our high-velocity SKUs, or the products that are key drivers of our business.\nThis has translated to an increase of approximately 300 basis points in our shelf-availability customer service scores. While this app is helping us to be more efficient with our tasking activity and improving our customer experience in the process, Sidekick is just getting started. These initiatives are just a few examples of the many different types of projects that can drive significant impacts for customers, our associates, and/or shareholders. I am so excited about all that our store teams are doing to focus on both the customer and associate experience and look forward to sharing a lot more in a few weeks. None of this would be possible without our amazing associates, and I want to thank them all for what they do every day to take care of our customers. With that, let me turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, total sales were $37.3 billion, a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion, or 4.2% from last year. During Q1, our total company comps were -4.5%, with comps of -2.5% in February, -7.5% in March, and -3.7% in April. Comps in the US were -4.6% for the quarter, with comps of -2.8% in February, -7.5% in March, and -3.7% in April. Our Q1 comp sales missed our own expectations, particularly in the months of March and April, driven primarily by two notable factors. First, lumber deflation drove a negative comp impact of approximately 220 basis points versus Q1 of 2022. Second, unfavorable weather, particularly in our Western Division, further impacted our results.\nIn Q1, our gross margin was 33.7%, a decrease of 8 basis points from Q1 last year, primarily driven by increased pressure from shrink. We continue to successfully offset supply chain and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customers' advocate for value. During Q1, operating expense as a percent of sales increased approximately 25 basis points to 18.8% compared to Q1 of 2022. Our operating expense performance during Q1 reflects the planned compensation increases announced during our Q4 2022 call, as well as a one-time benefit from a legal settlement. Our operating margin for Q1 was 14.9% compared to 15.2% in the Q1 of 2022.\nInterest and other expense for Q1 increased by $72 million to $441 million due primarily to interest on our floating rate debt, as well as higher debt balances than a year ago. In Q1, our effective tax rate was 24.2%, up from 23.9% in Q1 of fiscal 2022. Our diluted earnings per share for Q1 were $3.82, a decrease of 6.6% compred to Q1 of 2022. During Q1, we opened two new stores, bringing our total store count to 2,324. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million sq ft. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $25.4 billion, essentially flat compared to Q1 of 2022, and inventory turns were 3.9 times, down from 4.4 times last year.\nTurning to capital allocation, after investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During Q1, we invested approximately $900 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. During the quarter, we paid approximately $2.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.6%, down from 45.3% in Q1 of fiscal 2022. Now I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2023. As you may recall, last quarter, we provided flat sales and comp guidance for fiscal 2023.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, our guidance did not include potential impacts from lumber deflation, which we noted could negatively impact our performance for the quarter and the year. As a result, lumber negatively impacted comps by approximately 220 basis points in Q1. Given the negative impact of Q1 sales from lumber and weather, further softening of demand relative to our expectations, and continued uncertainty regarding consumer demand patterns, we are updating our guidance to reflect a range of potential outcomes. We now expect fiscal 2023 sales and comp sales to decline between 2% and 5%. As a result of the change in our sales outlook, we are now targeting an operating margin between 14.3% and 14.0% for the year. Our effective tax rate is targeted at approximately 24.5%.\nWe expect interest expense of approximately $1.8 billion, and we are anticipating between a 7% and 13% decline in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2022. As Ted mentioned, we expected 2023 to be a year of moderation in the home improvement market, driven by monetary policy actions to dampen overall consumer demand. In our view, we are in a transitional period in the consumer economy. Setting the short-term impacts of monetary policy aside, we know that the home improvement customer is healthy, and we believe the medium to long-term underlying fundamentals of home improvement make it one of the most attractive markets in retail and the economy as a whole.\nWe believe that we are well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers with a broad assortment of products, strong in-stock levels, and knowledgeable associates. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to prudently invest to strengthen our competitive position, leverage our scale and low-cost position to outperform our market, and deliver shareholder value. Thank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please, while we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good morning, everybody. So I have two questions on the ticket side. Average ticket was flat in Q1. I think last year you had same SKU inflation, ex commodity of about high single digits all year. So how much of the ticket deceleration relative to Q1 last year or just simply same SKU disinflation on a year-over-year basis versus things like project size and trade down?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nHey, Chris. Good morning. You know, we are still seeing inflation in same SKU items. So putting commodity aside that we gave the example of lumber being down 64%, we're still experiencing inflation in our ticket and our average unit retail. So the non-index or the non-commodity prices are still lapping cost and price from last year. And then there's still moderate inflation live this year in 2023. So inflation is still present in the average ticket.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nSo, as you look ahead, how are you thinking about how much of a headwind that becomes over the year and what did you incorporate in the guidance? And then related to that, if transactions are sort of back to 2019 levels, but in the Q1 tickets still up 37% versus Q1 of 2019, I'm guessing maybe a third of that is same SKU. So just trying to put in a context the risk around ticket in terms of disinflation and then also project size and trade down.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nRight. Well, it's something we clearly look at carefully. There certainly has been a lot of cumulative inflation in price in our average unit retail in our ticket, but that is not something that we are expecting to broadly deflate. Now, commodity prices, those price essentially weekly, and we will price those up or down on a weekly basis. But price levels in a number of our products have increased and been established over the past three years. Embedded in that higher ticket is innovation. So when you think of ticket, a lot of that is not just cost and price. It's trading up to better product. When you think of battery-powered outdoor power equipment, what we've done in the paint department with better and better paints, there's innovation. And with innovation, it's usually higher price points.\nSo we don't see those deflating broadly as we work through this period of moderation.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nMy guess, just in terms of, do you think, you know, if you sort of look at the trend on project size, will that cause ticket to become negative over the years? Is that how you're thinking about it?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nI wouldn't say over the years. Certainly, right now, we are seeing two of the biggest factors on each of ticket and transaction is, as we said, we have specific discretionary items. Best examples are things like a grill, a patio set, and appliances tend to be one-off discretionary items and we are seeing pressure in those. We've been seeing pressure in those for some time. What was newer in our observations this quarter is that while projects are still strong and pro project backlog is still elevated, the size of the projects are getting a bit smaller. It could be that the project's being deferred, or it could be that the project is being broken up into chunks. So rather than do an entire room or an entire basement, you start working away at it in smaller chunks. That clearly impacts items per basket in overall activity.\n\nChris Horvers\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst in Equity Research at Hardlines Retail, Citi\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could comment a bit on what you're seeing in Q2 to date, just given the fact that weather has been so volatile across the US. And then just in the context of that, how should we think about Q2 maybe versus the back half of the year? What can kind of get you to the high end versus the low end of your full-year guidance range?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSure. Well, thank you. Thanks, Steven. So the first two weeks of May are in line with the guidance we've provided. We don't break out quarterly guidance, but the first two weeks are consistent with the guidance we've provided. We're going to learn a lot over the next few weeks with respect to underlying demand as we still have some of our largest selling weeks ahead of us. If you think about what our guide implies from a shape of the year, first, let's perhaps talk about the building blocks of our range, so how we got to the -2 to the -5, and then we'll talk about the shape of the year.\nThe -2 was really built on flowing through the Q1 performance, adding the Q1 lumber impact into guidance, adding a little further lumber pressure that we'll see in Q2. We think that there could be 120 basis points of comp pressure in Q2 based on current lumber price. Then that -2 scenario also reflects our share of PCE, which shifted at a more accelerated rate than expected in Q1, sort of holding at that rate for the rest of the year. So those are the underlying assumptions in the -2 case. The -5 case simply takes that PCE share shift assumption, our share of PCE and assumes that we revert back to 2019 levels of PCE share by the end of the fiscal year. So that would imply the -5% case.\nWhen we talk about the shape of the year, for the -2 high end of the range, we would expect that the second half would be better than the first half really due to lumber normalization in the second half on a year-over-year basis. The vast majority of lumber pressure year-over-year exists in that first half. So as that normalizes, in the -2 case, second half improves versus the first half. In the lower end of our range, we would expect the first half would outperform the second half, again due to that assumption of continued acceleration in our share of PCE.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst in Equity Research at Hardlines Retail, Citi\n\nGreat. Thanks for all the detail on that. And then I wanted to follow up on the comment about this being a transitional period for the consumer. In the context of the question is, how do you think about this year as a potential trough in demand for home improvement versus it potentially being a multi-year trend, and maybe 2024 is another step down? And I know there's a lot of moving pieces, and you'll have an analyst day in a month, but if you could comment on that at all, it'd be helpful.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Why don't I just take it up a bit on the consumer and their health and then their engagement in home improvement? If you look at the consumer overall, they're still relatively strong as evidenced by continued increases in personal consumption. And then when you look at our customer, I mean, we have one of the best customer sets, you know, in any market sector. Our customer is stronger than the overall consumer when you think they tend to have good jobs, increasing wages, and own their homes, and collectively, those home values have increased by about $15 trillion since 2019. So as we said, we grew disproportionately these past few years, $47 billion in growth, 43% cumulative comp as consumers shifted their spending, as these healthier consumers shifted their spending into home improvement.\nUndoubtedly, after that period of growth, you're going to see moderation, which is exactly what we saw in Q1. So when you think about what this reflects about the consumer in the future engagement in home improvement, think about a few things. We've seen an accelerated shift out of goods to service spending as the broader economy has gotten back to normal and that's in particular in home improvement. Obviously, people aren't spending all their time at home as they did in the prior few years. And then there's an impact of pull forward or deferral of certain categories, like I spoke about earlier, appliances, patio, and grills that saw outsized growth in the early years of the pandemic. And then a newer dynamic now that we're really seeing again just this past quarter is a more cautious consumer given the broader macro concerns, including credit availability.\nThat aligns with what we're observing in our business and in the comments I made about our pros and consumers taking on smaller, less discretionary projects. Then lastly, with the buildup of inflation that we've seen, there's certainly some price sensitivity, particularly with respect to those bigger ticket discretionary items. In general, our homeowner consumer remains very healthy. It's a matter of digesting the outsized growth in shift of consumption spend out of services into goods and particularly into home improvement. We'll get through this period. Richard's talked about the PCE normalization. We don't know where that ends or how quickly it goes. There's an argument that PCE in home improvement stays elevated, all the reasons we've talked about before. The home values are so much higher. The age of the home is considerably older on average. People are spending more time at home.\nSo all those dynamics could suggest, you know, normalization might be, in fact, a higher level of PCE spending in our sector. But regardless of all that, we'll get through this transition period, and we remain incredibly bullish on the health of this sector. It's one of the absolute best sectors in all of retail. It's a large and fragmented market, and we have tremendous growth opportunities going forward.\n\nSteven Zaccone\n\nSenior Analyst in Equity Research at Hardlines Retail, Citi\n\nThanks for all the detail. Best of luck for the remainder of spring.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Can you help us bridge the gap from the 15.3% EBIT margins last year to the 14 to 14.3 today? And specifically, how should we think about the moving parts around gross margin versus SG&A? And then specifically for Q1, cost controls were a bit better than expected. Can you talk us through the impact of the legal settlement and anything else you'd highlight there?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYes, Zack. Thank you for the question. So let's first walk from 15.3, which is our actual operating margin in 2022, to our original guide of 14.5% margin. At a flat comp, particularly in an inflationary environment, our business will see a degree of deleverage in expenses. And so really three factors: natural deleverage in the business, a $1 billion investment in wage, which has proven to, as Ann said, provide real benefit from a customer experience point of view, and then productivity initiatives designed to offset some of that deleverage. And so when you net all those three against each other, that led to our guide of 14.5% at a flat comp. As we reflect on the revision to guidance, the range of operating margin that we have guided toward reflects the natural operating margin at these negative comp levels.\nIn other words, there are levers that help blunt deleverage, but there is deleverage still in our model. The greatest mitigator is that we have an activity-based payroll model. And so as activity in our stores decreases, so does our level of payroll. So you do have a natural buffer there. But again, the 14.3 to the 14.0 would be the natural operating margin at the -2 and the -5. When we think about the one-time legal settlement, so we did realize a large one-time benefit from a legal settlement, our guidance assumes this benefit will be offset during the remainder of the year. And so that's just a simplified assumption. We will protect that 14% operating margin. We operate with a degree of financial flexibility. And as the year progresses, we'll be evaluating the levers available to us against the backdrop of the environment.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Appreciate the color. I've got a big picture question. Could you talk about the macro and housing indicators that you believe are now most correlated to your business today? And then, considering the golden handcuffs of sub-3% mortgages out there, do you think this takes longer now for housing turnover to materially recover?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, I'll take the second one first. We've already seen the impact of housing turnover. I think that we've probably fully seen the impact of higher mortgage rates on potential sellers. In this environment, if you have a low fixed-rate mortgage, and let's just remind ourselves, 40% of owner-occupied homes are owned outright. And of the households that hold a mortgage, close to 90% of those hold fixed-rate mortgages under 5%. So with mortgage rates where they are today, there's a reluctance to sell your home, and there is a greater incentive to stay in place and improve in place. And as Ted said, you're spending more time at home, and that home's getting older, and you do not have an incentive to sell and take on a higher-rate mortgage. So I think we've already seen that in housing turnover.\nWith respect to macro indicators, I think as Ted said, I think what we're seeing in the business now is reflective of the broader impact of tighter monetary policy and tighter credit conditions. It's interesting as we saw the quarter unfold, if you look at how we did during February, our business was actually trending quite positively. In fact, February's dollar run rate adjusted for normal seasonal curves would have implied a positive comp for the year. You think about March. Well, first of all, March was impacted by extreme weather, most notably in California and that was also the point where we saw accelerating share shift. There were some external factors there that maybe don't have direct influence, but as you know, in March, we saw the collapse of SVB.\nYou think about the tighter credit conditions that were a result of the external environment. We think all of those just build to a broader caution among consumers. As Ted said, our homeowner customer is extremely healthy, very healthy balance sheet, healthy income. This is a broader consumer economy dynamic we think we're seeing.\n\nZach Fadem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks, Richard. Appreciate all the color.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Zach.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research in US Hardline, Broadline, and Food, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you look across your entire assortment and trying to set current unit demand versus what would be a normalized rate, how many product categories are still well above what would be suggested by a normalized rate? Perhaps if you look at appliances, grills, and patio furniture and where units are today versus 2019 and extend that math to the rest of the business, what would that suggest about a downside comp scenario even from here?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nMichael, great question. I wouldn't say we've gone into that level of detail by category. Certainly, a number of those categories were elevated. The ones you called out, patio grills, appliances were elevated on retails with innovation as well as units with outsized demand. I think you think of normal replacement cycles and pull forward on some of that product that's just going to take a little bit of time to normalize. Other categories that we haven't talked so much about that are really booming frankly are categories like building materials where we're seeing unit volume still running quite strong. We see units in lumber picking up meaningfully as prices come down and you get attachment with building materials. And then hardware, which attaches to both building materials and lumber, we're seeing our strongest hardware unit productivity and attach rate to those project starter categories.\nI think, Billy said it's the highest attach rate we've ever recorded.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah, that's right. You think about our building materials performance, we call that out as outperform along with lumber. Still seeing great unit productivity across those businesses and seeing the attached, certainly smaller projects taking place. And then Ted did mention we did see some pull forward in some of those businesses that we talked about initially as well.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research in US Hardline, Broadline, and Food, UBS\n\nMy follow-up question is, if we consider 2023 to be the transition year and comp for the Home Depot do return to growth in 2024, would you start seeing leverage on your expenses on the first dollar of growth, or will there be some catch-up? Like Richard, you mentioned this legal expense. You expect to give back some of that over the course of this year. Presumably, there'll be an incentive comp benefit as you lowered your guidance. So will you see some of those items come back next year such that if we have in our models a positive comp, we wouldn't necessarily expect you to leverage your expenses on the first dollar of growth next year?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWell, we'll get into a bit more detail on outlook in 2024 when we get together in June for the investor conference. We're not modeling 2024 to that level of specificity as we're only a few months into 2023. But broadly, Michael, our model is meant to leverage and will leverage with volume. And we have some cost to take out of the business for sure. You think on the product side with transportation in particular, you'll see significant costs come out as we work through our current inventory levels with the higher transportation rates experienced during COVID. And then on the operating model, the store and labor, that will always leverage with growth.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nAnd obviously, we manage cost and price independently, Michael, and transportation costs are a market dynamic. And so we'll make sure that we're positioned as the customers' advocate for value with respect to price. But as Ted said, we'll get more into this in 2023 or sorry, on 13 June.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research in US Hardline, Broadline, and Food, UBS\n\nRichard, can I just clarify what that comment is intended to say? Because one of the debates is costs have come down, whether transportation costs, certain raw materials, so there's a question of whether that means there's going to be like-for-like product deflation in non-commodity-related areas over the course of this year. And it sounds like Home Depot is going to continue to be an advocate for growth, but how would you clarify that? Or advocate for value?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nRight. No, again, we manage cost and price independently. As Ted said, we don't expect broad-based deflation in this market.\n\nMichael Lasser\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research in US Hardline, Broadline, and Food, UBS\n\nUnderstood. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nMorning.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nMy first question, I know we've discussed a bit already about the weather. I was just wondering if you could go into a little more detail what you saw, kind of the spread between in comps between markets where weather was an issue and markets where weather may have been more normal. And then, as I mean, looking at our data, the spring has come, has arrived in a lot of markets. So what are you seeing then as far as any type of pickup in seasonal categories as these spring-like conditions are starting to take hold?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah, Brian, thank you. So weather, as we said, was most pronounced in the West in a very unique weather pattern. This wasn't a bad weekend. This was, you know, record rain and even things like snow in Southern California. So where weather was sustained in bad, when we look at the West versus our northern and southern divisions, the impact was a multiple of what we saw in the other parts of the country. And generally, we've talked in the past about the bathtub effect, and we wouldn't have updated guidance based on stronger or relatively weaker sales in Q1 based on weather because we would look to get that back.\nSo when you think of a shorter spring season in the north where people are going to get that activity done in a limited number of weeks, if you don't get it done in Q1, people tend to make it up in Q2. The dynamic in the west, and this went into our guidance of the -2 to -5, is the West, it's more level weather patterns, we have very large stores, very high pro concentration. And when you get bad weather, you're not really looking at a bathtub effect to make it up in a short season. You just sort of miss that selling week. So the difference geographically was pronounced in the West, and we just look at that as sort of lost selling weeks. In the north, the behavior is more typical to the bathtub.\nI mean, we didn't have many good weekends, but when we did, sales were incredibly strong. So we're certainly hoping for better weather in Q2.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOkay, that's helpful, very helpful. And my second question, again, recognizing there's lots of moving parts here and you're dealing with varied comparisons throughout the year. But as you think about, or the updated guidance for 2023 you gave us today, does that basically assume kind of a continuation of what we've seen so far in 2023, or are you assuming some type of either improvement, further deterioration, et cetra, through the year?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThat's right, Brian. That's why we gave the range. I mean, you would say that particularly the bottom end of the range would assume greater deceleration than we've observed today. And it's consistent with a hypothetical case we laid out at the beginning of the year, which was to say, look, if our share of PCE reverts to 2019 levels by the end of the year, that is what you would see. And again, that would be an accelerated rate of reversion versus what we've seen. So the -2, again, sort of has, it takes into account the fact that we saw sharper reversion than expected in Q1 and that we would hold that share through the end of the year. It's not a perfect science, and that's why we gave you a range.\n\nBrian Nagel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nI appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nGood morning, guys. So Richard, you talked about protecting a 14% operating margin even with the wage investments that you guys have made this year at this point. I mean, how much flexibility do you think you have on that SG&A line? Because I know labor is your biggest kind of plus bucket, but you're actually investing more in labor, not less. So, like, how should we think about how you guys are managing that component?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWell, the investment in wage, again, which has really proven to have driven a lot of benefit on the customer experience side, that's embedded in our guidance. We've made the investment, and that will be roughly a $1 billion addition to our cost structure, but it's embedded in our margin structure. Again, as the year progresses, we'll be evaluating levers available to us against the backdrop of the environment. We invest to win over the long term. We're comfortable with our level of investment as it stands today. We'll continue to assess our investments against the backdrop of the environment, and we have some flexibility there too.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nJust a quick follow-up. With higher interest rates in the marketplace, does that change how you guys are thinking about capital allocation, not necessarily from a strategic basis, but how aggressive you want to be in terms of issuing debt to buy back stock? Thanks.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nWe feel good about where we stand from a debt-to-EBITDA perspective. We had a billion-dollar maturity in April, and we repaid that, didn't refinance it. We have no need necessarily to go to the debt capital markets in the short term, and we'll watch market conditions as they unfold. But we feel good about where we are from a leverage perspective.\n\nScot Ciccarelli\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nRoger that. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrad Thomas\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. Was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the trends that you've been seeing in the pro business. I think this is the first time in a few quarters that it had underperformed DIY. What are you seeing out of the pro? Has it improved as the weather has gotten better, and how are you thinking about it going forward?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nYeah, I'll let Hector talk a bit about the pro and what we like that we're seeing. But from the broadest perspective, don't forget the pro was disproportionately impacted by lumber. And then again, a very strong pro business out West. But we like what we're seeing with our customers as they engage with our capabilities.\n\nHector Padilla\n\nEVP of Outside Sales and Service, Home Depot\n\nYeah, good morning, Brad. This is Hector. On a two-year basis, our performance was positive. And as Ted just mentioned and Billy, we saw that disproportionate impact from lumber and weather. What we're most excited about is what we're seeing with our pros who are engaging with our new supply chain assets and the expanded pro capabilities that we have talked about in the past. We're getting share of wallet with them, and as they're growing, they're spending with us. They have a willingness to consolidate their purchases with the Home Depot. They love our brand, they love our assortment, and our value proposition, and we're seeing that across many markets. I really look forward to speaking with you in more detail in June about how the pro business is doing and around the capabilities that we're building.\n\nBrad Thomas\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nGreat. And as a quick follow-up, obviously some moving pieces here with weather and deflation. I believe your prior outlook for the home improvement market was a decline of low single digits. What are you assuming in your new outlook?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nSo we began the year with a flat outlook for PCE. There are economists who have lifted that outlook slightly for PCE. But as we observe PCE share that our market holds and the shifts that we've seen, we expect our market to be down mid to high single digits. And so implicit in our guide is the expectation that we'll continue to take share.\n\nBrad Thomas\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst in Retailing Broadlines and Hardlines, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to ask about home prices. There's been a case that's made that demand decoupled a bit from turnover, and that prices could matter more. I want to ask specifically about how that could inform the cadence of the year. Because if you are a strict adherent to prices, the lag effect could suggest that the back half core gets a little bit worse. I'm curious how you think about that?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWell, of all the housing metrics, Simeon, we think home value has the tightest correlation to home improvement spend. Certainly, turnover and household formation also influence the spend. There's generally a lag effect, as you say, to home price appreciation or depreciation. I think the difference here is how sensitive are people going to be that I was up 45% in home value from the end of 2019. And yes, now month-over-month, the values are off slightly, but I'm still up 40% or 38% from where I was at the end of 2019. That psychology is tough to weed out with the general consumer apprehension given general inflation, macro, rising interest rates, and all the talk are we going to have a recession, are we not going to have a recession. So I wouldn't think that that would have that big of an impact.\nWe're not thinking that's a big impact in 2H.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst in Retailing Broadlines and Hardlines, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, that's fair. One more question around the updated guide for Richard. The midpoint of this -2 to -5, just to clarify, that assumes that the core worsens from Q1 as well as the impact of lumber worsens from Q1?\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nYou can think of the impact of lumber being kind of an assumption that is equal across all cases. So about 120 basis points of pressure to Q2 and then very, very slight, really non-meaningful pressure in the second half. Again, we've given a range, Simeon, to just provide sort of a balanced view here. It's tough to extrapolate this early in the year, and so we feel like the range approach is the most helpful guidance that we can give.\n\nSimeon Gutman\n\nEquity Analyst in Retailing Broadlines and Hardlines, Morgan Stanley\n\nRight. Okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst] (Barclays\n\nHey, everybody. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on that assumption that home improvement wallet share will normalize back to 2019 levels. And obviously, that implies things get worse from here. But I guess there's also been some prior cycles where wallet share overshoots on the downside and goes lower than where it was before. And we talked a lot about pull forward already today. But how do you think about that scenario and why that scenario would be wrong this time?\n\nTed Decker\n\nChair, President, and CEO, Home Depot\n\nWell, as we've said, we've given the guide for our best view of 2023. The downside of a -5 would be that you've reverted by the end of the year to 2019 levels. Mathematically, you could say, well, there'd be some hangover of that into 2024. Then your question, does it overshoot? Frankly, we don't know. As I said earlier, there's as strong a case, if not stronger, that where you settle is a higher share if based nothing more than your asset class is so much higher. I mean, we're not talking billions of dollars. We're literally talking trillions of dollars that this asset class has more value. If you're thinking about percent of investment in any asset class, you've got a much bigger base.\nWe talk about the average age of the home is now over 40 years old, and we have big chunks of homes that are reaching that 20-year and 40-year sort of witching hour of age. We all know we're spending more time at home, so wear and tear is higher. So we've talked about all these dynamics in the past. And I'd say if you had to call it, you would say the spend would ultimately settle out potentially higher.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst] (Barclays",
    "content2": "Okay. Fair enough. Just want to follow up on the EBIT margin guidance for this year. I think what you laid out here at the low end, so 14% margin on negative mid-single digit comps, very consistent with the scenarios you talked about last quarter, but it does include that Q1 SG&A benefit. Can you just help us better understand does that imply the underlying is actually lower? I think you may have said there's an offset to that. Maybe you can just clarify that point. Thank you.\n\nRichard McPhail\n\nEVP and CFO, Home Depot\n\nThank you for the question. To clarify, it's not assuming that the underlying would be lower. Our guide actually assumes that that gain would be offset through the remainder of the year.\n\nSeth Sigman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst] (Barclays\n\nOkay. Thanks very much.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nChristine, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nGood morning. Just wanted to follow up on lumber trends. You made a comment about price deflation. Curious if you could talk about what specifically happened with unit volume during the quarter and then what the guidance assumes in the back half as the price compares ease in terms of unit expectations right in the second half.\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nYeah. Thanks, Steven. This is Billy. As we talked about, Richard mentioned in his previous comments, we do anticipate the greatest pressure from lumber in the first half for the total year. We think lumber deflation impact to the comp is about 100 basis points. Now, with that, we're seeing strong unit movement across plywood, dimensional lumber, PT decking. It's 220 basis points, as we mentioned in Q1, another 120 basis points roughly in Q2, which is in the guide, then we don't expect a material impact from lumber for the back half of the year, but still seeing really strong unit performance in the categories I called out.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nAnd so you do expect unit volume to improve in the back half? Or what is sort of the trajectory of unit dynamics, right, with lumber specifically implied in the guide?\n\nBilly Bastek\n\nEVP of Merchandising, Home Depot\n\nWell, as the pricing normalizes year-over-year, you'll see the units reflect in that as we get towards a more rational state that we had in the back half of last year.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThen just a quick follow-up. Any sort of preview of what we should expect at the upcoming Analyst Day? I think you made a comment before potentially about speaking to 2024, but I wasn't sure if you could maybe clarify any sort of preview thoughts on what we should expect to hear at the Analyst Day.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nThanks for that question, Steve. I think what you'll hear us talk about is the updated TAM that we will lay out for you, our growth opportunities to go after that TAM, and a little bit more about why we're so excited about the sector and the business.\n\nSteven Forbes\n\nSenior Managing Director in Equity Research, Guggenheim\n\nThank you.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Home Depot\n\nThanks, Christine, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at our Investor Conference on 13 June.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, Chair, President and CEO; Jeff Kinnaird, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) If we are unable to get your questions during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nEdward P. Decker\n\nChairman, President & CEO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning.\nSales for the third quarter were $38.9 billion, up 5.6% from the same period last year. Comp sales were up 4.3% from the same period last year, and our U.S. stores had positive comps of 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.24 in the third quarter compared to $3.92 in the third quarter of last year.\nFrom a geographical perspective, each of our 19 U.S. regions delivered positive comps versus last year, while Mexico posted comps above the company average and Canada below the company average, both in local currency. The team has done a fantastic job serving our customers while continuing to navigate global supply chain disruptions, inflation in a tight labor market.\nThis quarter also marked another active hurricane season. As they always do, our associates and suppliers did an incredible job supporting those in the path of both Hurricanes Fiona and Ian and our thoughts continue to be with those impacted by these storms.\nOur results in the quarter reflect continued solid demand for home improvement projects. While we did see some deceleration in certain products and categories, as Jeff will detail, the project business remains strong across most of our departments. We also saw year-over-year growth with both our Pro and DIY customers in the quarter.\nWhile the business performed very well and our consumer remains resilient, we are navigating a unique environment. We can't predict how the evolving macroeconomic backdrop will impact our customer going forward. However, we continue to closely monitor elasticities and trends across our business and believe we have the tools, team and the experience to effectively manage in any environment. Despite near-term uncertainties, we believe the long-term underpinnings of demand for home improvement remains strong, and we are well positioned to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities in our space.\nWe are pleased with the traction we are seeing in our interconnected business as we continue to build on our momentum with both our Pro and DIY customers. For example, as we have better functionality and capabilities in our Home Depot app, we see greater engagement. In fact, throughout the year, we have seen strong double-digit growth in monthly active users versus last year.\nThe growth is attributable to several enhancements we have made, including an improved online experience for our Pro Loyalty program, the seamless connectivity we've provided for a military program and the launch of our new store mode feature, which makes navigating the store and interacting with products much easier. These enhancements translate to less friction of our customers as they navigate the digital world and connect into the physical world.\nWe also remain focused on driving continuous improvement in productivity within the 4 walls of our store to enhance both the associate and customer experience. We are currently launching a new application on our in-store mobile devices called Sidekick, which is an in-aisle tasking tool designed to direct associates to the highest value tasks in real time.\nThe tool direct associates to key bays were on-shelf availability is low or out exists. By simplifying our operations, we can generate productivity to enhance both the customer and associate experience.\nFor the Pro customer, we remain focused on investing in an ecosystem of capabilities, including enhanced fulfillment, a more personalized online experience as well as other business management tools to drive deeper engagement with these customers. While we are focused on removing friction from the shopping experience, we are also onboarding capabilities to help our Pros run their businesses more efficiently.\nOur Pros tell us that finding qualified skilled labor is a pain point in their business. To that end, we recently announced our Tap to Pro platform, connecting skilled trades people with hiring trades professionals. This unique and proprietary platform is available at no cost to all Pro Xtra members. It already contains thousands of candidates and Pros have begun posting their open jobs.\nOur team remains focused on what is most important, our associates and customers, our merchants, store MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter.\nI'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey G. Kinnaird\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the third quarter, we continued to see solid demand for home improvement projects and strong execution from our teams and supplier partners.\nTurning to our comp performance during the third quarter. 11 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps: build materials, plumbing, lumber, millwork, paint and hardware had comps above the company average. All other departments with the exception of appliances, flooring and indoor garden were positive, but below the company average. During the third quarter, our comp average ticket increased 8.8% and comp transactions decreased 4.4%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across our product categories as well as demand for new and innovative products.\nInflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 200 basis points during the third quarter, driven by inflation in build materials, lumber and copper. Big ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 10.1% compared to the third quarter of last year. We saw a big ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like fasteners, pipe and fittings and gypsum.\nDuring the third quarter, both Pro and DIY sales growth were positive, with Pro outpacing DIY. We're encouraged by the continued momentum we are seeing with both our Pro and DIY customers. In addition, our Pros tell us their backlogs remain strong.\nDuring the quarter, our project business remained healthy. This can be seen in the double-digit comp performance of our build materials, plumbing, lumber and new work departments as well as in other categories like fencing, siding, conduit boxes and fittings, hubs and showers and cabinets.\nWe're also encouraged by the momentum we continue to see with our larger Pro customers. These medium to large repair remodel Pros continue to post strong double-digit comps. We believe we are building a unique interconnected Pro ecosystem that will increase our ability to grow share in a $450 billion addressable Pro space. To serve the Pro, it's about removing friction through a multitude of enhanced product offerings and capabilities. We feel confident that the investments across our Pro ecosystem are resonating and that we continue to gain share with this important customer.\nAs you know, we've been on a journey to remove friction from our interconnected shopping experience. A great example of this was our announcement in December of 2017 to own more of the appliance delivery end-to-end. And in the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone. We now have 100% of our appliance delivery volume managed through our market delivery operations. This has significantly improved the customer experience. On-time and complete deliveries have increased meaningfully and customer satisfaction metrics have increased by approximately 6 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year.\nTurning to total company online sales. We are very pleased with the performance of our digital assets. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased nearly 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. This was driven by our continued investments, which are resonating with our customers. For example, during the quarter, lead times improved across different fulfillment capabilities, which drove greater conversion.\nFor those customers that chose to transact with us online during the third quarter, approximately 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy. We're excited about the holiday season. During the third quarter, we hosted our Halloween event and could not be happier with the results. 2022 was a record sales year for our Halloween program, both in-store and online, as our customers continue to add to their collection with our unique and exclusive assortment.\nAs we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events. Our teams have sourced the most compelling artificial tree assortment we have ever had, which makes it easier for our customers to find the perfect tree for their holiday. In terms of our decorative holiday program, we couldn't be happier with our industry-leading assortment with extraordinary features and functionality that looks great and also reflects exceptional value.\nIn our gift center, we continue to lean into brands that matter most for our customers with our assortment of Milwaukee, RYOBI, Makita, DEWALT, RIDGID, Husky and more. Earlier this fall, we launched the next generation of the Milwaukee drill and Drive M18 fuel lineup, offering more power, run time and increased safety for our customers. In our gift center, we are featuring this innovation in combo kits with 4 tools and 2 tools. And we have our exclusive RIDGID 4 tool, 18-volt brushless combination kit with 2 free tools, all backed by our lifetime service agreement.\nAnd in appliances, we have exciting offers on LG, Samsung, Flash, Oraple, GE and Frigidaire. We have multiple exclusive offers, including the LG side-by-side refrigerator with craft ice, a great innovation and ice-making. As with prior years, we've extended these events over several weeks, and we believe we are well positioned with the right brands, the right inventory and a great customer experience.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard V. McPhail\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.\nIn the third quarter, total sales were $38.9 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion or 5.6% from last year. During the third quarter, our total company comps were positive 4.3%, with positive comps of 7.1% in August, 4.4% in September and 2.1% in October. Comps in the U.S. were positive 4.5% for the quarter, with positive comps of 7.2% in August, 4.2% in September and 2.5% in October. On a 3-year basis, monthly comps were consistent across the quarter.\nIn the third quarter, our gross margin was approximately 34%, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from last year primarily driven by supply chain investments. We continue to successfully offset significant transportation and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customer's advocate for value.\nDuring the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased 18 basis points to 18.2%. Our operating expense performance was in line with our expectations, which reflected continued wage investments as well as planned investments designed to drive efficiency in our store environment.\nOur operating margin for the third quarter was 15.8% compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of 2021. Interest and other expense for the third quarter increased by $80 million to $406 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, down from 24.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $4.24, an increase of 8.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021.\nDuring the third quarter, we opened 3 new stores, 1 in the U.S. and 2 in Mexico, bringing our total store count to 2,319. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million square feet. At the end of the third quarter, inventories were $25.7 billion, up $5.1 billion compared to the third quarter of 2021. Inventory turns were 4.3x, down from 5.4x last year. And our inventory growth primarily reflects product cost inflation and strategic decisions in response to continued global supply chain disruption.\nTurning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the third quarter, we invested $770 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $1.9 billion in dividends to our shareholders and we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.\nComputed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 43.3%, down from 43.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\nNow I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2022. As you heard from Ted, we are very pleased with the solid performance we saw during the third quarter. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2022. We expect comp sales growth of approximately 3% for fiscal 2022. We expect comp sales to be positive for the fourth quarter. We expect our fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 15.4% for the year. And we expect mid-single-digit percentage growth and diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021.\nAs we've said throughout the year, we find ourselves in a unique environment with many cross-currents. We are operating in a broad-based inflationary environment, not seen in 4 decades while managing through constrained global supply chain conditions, all against the backdrop of monetary policy shifts intended to moderate demand.\nTo date, our customer has proven resilient. We feel confident that we will continue to manage with flexibility through a dynamic environment while growing faster than our market and delivering exceptional shareholder value.\nBefore opening the call for questions, we are pleased to announce that we will be holding an investor conference on June 13, 2023 in New York City. We will share more details in the near future, but for now, please hold the date.\nThank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci. Please go ahead.\n\nIsabel Janci\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Home Depot's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining us on our call today are Ted Decker, CEO and President; Jeff Kinnaird, Executive Vice President of Merchandising; and Richard McPhail, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for questions. Questions will be limited to analysts and investors. (Operator Instructions) If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor Relations department at (770) 384-2387.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ted, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nToday's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nEdward P. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call this morning.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly sales and earnings in our company's history. Sales for the second quarter were $43.8 billion, up 6.5% from the same period last year. Comp sales were up 5.8% from the same period last year, and our U.S. stores had positive comps of 5.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $5.05 in the second quarter, up 11.5% from $4.53 in the second quarter of last year.\nFrom a geographical perspective, each of our 19 U.S. regions delivered positive comps versus last year, while Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average. The team has done a fantastic job serving our customers while continuing to navigate global supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market.\nOur results in the second quarter reflect continued strong demand for home improvement projects. As Jeff will detail, the business was strong across our departments. While our seasonal business posted positive comps as spring broke in the second quarter, these categories underperformed our expectations for the first half of the year. This was more than offset by strength in project-related categories that outperformed our expectations.\nWe also saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers in the quarter and are encouraged that project backlogs remain healthy. While the business performed very well and our consumer remained resilient through the first half of the year, we are navigating a unique environment. We can't predict how the evolving macroeconomic backdrop will impact our customer going forward. However, we continue to closely monitor elasticities and trends across our respective categories and believe we have the tools, team and the experience to effectively manage in any environment.\nDespite near-term uncertainties, we believe that the long-term underpinnings of demand for home improvement remains strong and that we are well positioned to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities in our space.\nFor the Pro customer, we continue to invest in the ecosystem of capabilities, including enhanced fulfillment, more personalized online experience as well as other business management tools to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers, and we believe our efforts are resonating. In May, we launched new capabilities on our B2B website to enhance the interconnected shopping and quoting experience for our Pros. In the past, our website was not integrated with our ordering and quoting systems so an associate could not seamlessly modify an order if a customer had questions or changes before placing the order. Our new interconnected capabilities remove friction for both Pros and associates, allowing them to collaborate on orders, both in-store and online.\nSales leveraging our digital platforms increased 12% versus the second quarter last year. We also saw record downloads, traffic and sales via our mobile app. We continue to see improved conversion rates as ongoing enhancements within our digital properties are resonating with our customers.\nOur team is focused on what is most important, our associates and customers. Our merchants, store and MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. Based on first half results, 100% of our stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for hourly associates. I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey G. Kinnaird\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the second quarter, we continued to see strong demand for home improvement projects and strong execution from our teams and supplier partners.\nTurning to our comp performance during the second quarter. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. Building materials, plumbing, millwork, paint and hardware were all above the company average. Electrical, decor and storage, kitchen and bath, outdoor garden tools, appliances, indoor garden, lumber and flooring were positive but below the company average.\nAs you heard from Ted, while our seasonal businesses posted positive comps in the second quarter, they underperformed our expectations for the first half of the year, driven by categories like grills, fertilizers, chemicals and mowers. Keep in mind that we are up against very tough comparisons versus the last 2 years and -- in these categories when our customers focused on outdoor living and these were some of our best performing departments.\nDuring the second quarter, our comp average ticket increased 9%, and comp transactions decreased 3.1%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across our product categories as well as demand for new and innovative products. On a 3-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive.\nInflation from core commodity categories negatively impacted our average ticket growth by 14 basis points during the second quarter driven primarily by lower lumber prices. Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 11.6% compared to the second quarter of last year. We saw big-ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like pipe and fittings, gypsum and fasteners.\nDuring the second quarter, both Pro and DIY sales growth was positive with Pro outpacing DIY. We're encouraged by the continued momentum we are seeing with our Pros and they tell us their backlogs remain healthy. During the quarter, we saw a robust project demand across the business. This can be seen in the double-digit comp performance of our building materials, plumbing and millwork departments as well as in certain project-related categories like fencing, siding, conduit boxes and fittings, tubs and showers and countertops.\nWe continue to introduce new and innovative products aimed at simplifying the project, saving our Pros time and helping them take on more jobs. One example in building materials where we launched nationally, Henry's Tropi-Cool roof coatings. This new formula offers maximum reflectivity, helping reduce cooling costs. Henry's Tropi-Cool can be applied in any season with 100% waterproof and rain-safe within 15 minutes of application. And this product is exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel.\nIn bath, we're excited about the success we're having with our great assortment of Delta tub-and-shower wall combinations. Delta Classic 500 series is a simple tub or shower system that delivers a big transformation to a bathroom in a fraction of the time. It is easy to install, and its acrylic surface makes it easy to clean. This series is exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel.\nTurning to our online sales. We are very pleased with the performance of our digital assets as we delivered the highest sales dollar volume in company history. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased 12% during the second quarter. This was driven by our continued investments, which are resonating with our customers. Enhanced search capabilities, an improved Pro site experience and more robust fulfillment capabilities help drive online conversion.\nFor those customers that chose to transact with us online during the second quarter, more than 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy.\nAs we look forward to the back half of the year, we remain committed to being our customers' advocate for value. Last quarter, we highlighted several new innovative products for our customers. This quarter, we're excited to announce the launch of Makita's new XGT 40-volt and 80-volt max system of cordless equipment and tools in our outdoor power categories. The XGT system is engineered to achieve the optimum power required for heavier load applications without sacrificing run time. And these 1-battery solution tools are exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel.\nWe're also excited to build on the success of our Hubspace smart home platform, expanding our assortment across several categories such as door locks, lighting control, fixtures and ceiling fans. Hubspace makes it easier to set up and manage your smart home products and pairs well with voice-controlled operating systems. This platform is exclusive to The Home Depot.\nAnd in garage organization, we'll be rolling out our Milwaukee PACKOUT and RYOBI LINK wall systems, utilizing the same locking technology across the system that can be customized to meet your organizational needs from the workshop to the workplace.\nWe're also excited about our lineup for Halloween. Our merchants have worked with our supplier partners to put together an expanded assortment of product offerings for this Halloween season. These products bring excitement to our stores and help drive traffic, and our sneak preview of our Halloween lineup was a tremendous success. We are thrilled for the full rollout in the upcoming weeks.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard V. McPhail\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, total sales were $43.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion or 6.5% from last year. During the second quarter, our total company comps were positive 5.8%, with positive comps of 5.2% in May, 4.9% in June and 7.1% in July. Comps in the U.S. were positive 5.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 4.1% in May, 4.7% in June and 7.2% in July.\nIn the second quarter, our gross margin was approximately 33.1%, a decrease of approximately 15 basis points from last year primarily driven by supply chain investments. We continue to successfully offset significant transportation and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customer's advocate for value.\nDuring the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased approximately 50 basis points to 16.6%. Our operating leverage during the second quarter reflects solid expense management for the quarter.\nOur operating margin for the second quarter was 16.5% compared to 16.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Interest and other expense for the second quarter increased by $58 million to $379 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago.\nIn the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.3%, up from 23.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $5.05, an increase of 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our total store count at the end of the quarter was 2,316, and selling square footage was 240 million square feet.\nAt the end of the second quarter, inventories were $26.1 billion, up $7.2 billion compared to the second quarter of 2021. Inventory turns were 4.5x, down from 5.7x last year. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase in inventory reflects product cost inflation. Our inventory also reflects deliberate investments and higher in-stock levels and pull forward of inventory for back half events in response to continued global supply chain disruption, investment in our new supply chain facilities and carryover of some spring seasonal inventory.\nTurning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $750 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.\nComputed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.6%, up from 44.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\nNow I will comment on our guidance for fiscal 2022. As you heard from Ted, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2022. We expect sales growth and comp sales growth of approximately 3% for fiscal 2022. We expect comp sales to be stronger in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. We expect our fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 15.4% for the year. And we expect mid-single-digit percent growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021.\nWe find ourselves in a unique environment with many crosscurrents. We're operating in a broad-based inflationary environment not seen in 4 decades while managing through constrained global supply chain conditions, all against the backdrop of monetary policy shifts intended to moderate demand. We also see engaged and resilient homeowners who have strong balance sheets, consumers spending more time in their homes and continued structural support for home improvement project demand. We feel confident that we will continue to manage with flexibility through a dynamic environment while growing faster than our market and delivering exceptional shareholder value.\nThank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Isabel Janci.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in the press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations will also include certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these measures is provided on our website.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ted.\n\nEdward P. Decker\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call this morning. Fiscal 2022 is off to a strong start. Sales for the first quarter were $38.9 billion, up 3.8% from the same period last year. Comp sales were up 2.2% from the same period last year, and our U.S. stores had positive comps of 1.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.09 in the first quarter, up 6% from $3.86 in the first quarter last year.\nThe strong performance in the quarter is even more impressive given the robust performance we were comparing against last year. A year ago, we delivered the highest first quarter sales in company history as we benefited from outsized demand for home improvement goods, favorable weather and government stimulus. This year, we achieved a new high watermark for first quarter sales as strong demand for home improvement goods continued despite a slower start to spring in many parts of the country.\nDelivering such strong results on top of last year's historical growth is a testament to our orange-blooded associates. They are maintaining their relentless focus on our customers while continuing to navigate the ongoing pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market. We are also thankful for the strength of our relationships with our supplier and transportation partners. Our respective teams are working tirelessly to flow product to stores and distribution centers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I would like to thank them for their ongoing support as we continue to navigate a challenging and dynamic environment.\nThe demand seen in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. The home improvement consumer remains engaged. Customers continue to tell us that their homes have never been more important, and project backlogs are very healthy. We believe that the medium- to longer-term underpinnings of demand for home improvement have never been stronger.\nWe are thrilled with our Pro performance in the quarter, driven by underlying strength in project demand. We continue to invest in an ecosystem of capabilities, including enhanced fulfillment options, a more personalized online experience as well as other business management tools to drive deeper engagement with our Pro customers. And we believe our efforts are resonating.\nWe are navigating a unique environment, but we believe we have the tools, the team and the experience to effectively manage through. While we don't know how inflation might impact consumer behavior going forward, we are closely monitoring elasticities and customer trends across our respective categories and geographies and remain encouraged by the underlying strength we see in the business. Jeff will provide a bit more color about what we've observed from a category and big-ticket standpoint in a moment.\nAnd while inflation impacted our average ticket increase this quarter, it wasn't the only impact. As we've seen over the past several years, our customers continue to trade up for premium innovative products. In March, we held an in-person Store Manager Meeting for the first time in 3 years. One of the many highlights of that week is our Product Walk, where vendors showcased the latest in product innovation. And what I can share with you is that the level of innovation across the business is robust. In fact, almost 90% of the products on display this year are entirely new SKUs to The Home Depot. So the pipeline for innovative products remains very strong.\nBeyond product and innovation, my biggest takeaway from the Store Managers Meeting is how energized the team is. The exceptional execution our associates delivered over the last few years hasn't been easy, but our teams have consistently risen to the challenge. We frequently survey our associate base and are pleased that engagement and morale remain high.\nLast quarter, we talked about our customer-backed approach to remove friction at every touch point of the shopping experience. To that end, we recently announced that Matt Carey has been named Executive Vice President of Customer Experience. In this newly formed role, Matt will partner across the business to help design and develop new and innovative solutions to drive a seamless experience for our customers.\nAs Matt transitions to this new role, we also announced that Fahim Siddiqui has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer, where he is responsible for all aspects of our technology development and strategy. These moves will help drive further alignment around our interconnected retail strategy, which will allow us to enhance what we believe is the best experience in home improvement.\nRichard will talk to you in a few minutes about our guidance for the remainder of the year, but the first quarter certainly got us off to a great start. We're also encouraged by the continued strength we see in the business through the first 2 weeks of the second quarter as spring is breaking more broadly across the U.S.\nOur team continues to focus on what is most important: our associates and customers. Our merchants, store and MET teams, supplier partners and supply chain teams did an outstanding job delivering value and service to our customers throughout the quarter. I'd like to close by thanking them for their dedication and hard work.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey G. Kinnaird\n\nEVP of Merchandising, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by also thanking all of our associates and supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers and communities. As you heard from Ted, during the first quarter, we continued to see outsized demand for home improvement projects and strong execution from our teams and supplier partners.\nTurning to our comp performance during the first quarter. 11 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comps, led by plumbing, building materials, millwork and paint. During the first quarter of this year, we saw double-digit negative comps in our seasonal departments due to the late arrival of spring. Appliances posted slightly negative comps. Adjusting for a shift in event timing, appliance comps would have been positive for the quarter. Excluding seasonal categories, we are thrilled with the broad-based strength across the business and healthy project demand.\nDuring the first quarter, our comp average ticket increased 11.2% and comp transactions decreased 8.4%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across several product categories as well as demand for new and innovative products. Comp transactions reflect the late start to spring and anniversarying of stimulus. And on a 2- and 3-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive.\nInflation from core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 240 basis points during the first quarter, driven by inflation in lumber, copper and building materials. Lumber prices remained volatile during the quarter. As an example, framing lumber peaked at approximately $1,300 per thousand board feet during the first quarter before falling over $400 to approximately $900. Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up 12.4% compared to the first quarter of last year. We saw big-ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories, like pipe and fittings, gypsum and fasteners.\nDuring the first quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY. On a 3-year comp basis, both growth with our -- growth at both our Pro and DIY customers was consistent and strong. We're encouraged by the momentum we are seeing with our Pros, and they tell us that their backlogs are strong. And during the quarter, we saw many of our customers turn to Pros to help them with larger renovation projects. This can be seen in the double-digit comp performance of our building materials and plumbing departments as well as in certain kitchen and bath categories, like in-stock kitchens, tubs and showers and countertops. We also saw double-digit growth in our kitchen and bath installation business. This underscores the strength of project demand we are seeing across the business.\nSales leveraging our digital platforms increased 3.7% during the first quarter. We are very pleased with the performance of our digital assets as we delivered the highest sales dollar volume in our company history. For those customers that chose to transact with us online during the first quarter, more than 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores, a testament to the power of our interconnected retail strategy.\nAs you heard from Ted, we are very excited about the innovation we are introducing across the business. We continue to lean into products that simplify the project, saving our customers time and helping them take on more jobs. One example is our Viega ProPress line of plumbing. Your plumbers can create a water-tight copper connection in 60% less time than a traditional copper solder job. Viega ProPress fittings require no flame and work in wet applications. Viega is the market leader in this space and is exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel.\nIn paint, working with Masco and PPG, we have put together a formidable Pro paint lineup that is resonating with our Pro painters. Masco's BEHR-formulated, Pro-specific offering continues to perform well in our stores. And in the first quarter, we added PPG SPEEDHIDE series. This Pro-specific paint that is specced in the vast majority of multihousing and large commercial jobs, giving us an entry point with our Pro painter for larger-scale projects. And this is now exclusive to The Home Depot in the big-box channel.\nIn spray paint, we launched PPG's Glidden Max-Flex spray paint. PPG's proprietary, industrial-based technology is uniquely flexible, covering an preserving the original look and feel of a wide range of surfaces, including leather and fabric. And with Masco, we've expanded their exclusive offerings to spray paint, caulks and sealants as well as interior stains.\nNow let's turn our attention to spring and the exciting lineup of products we have for our customers. We are thrilled to showcase our new product offerings across our seasonal categories. We are seeing an industry-wide shift from gas-powered to battery-powered mowers. Demand for cordless mowers have never been stronger. And our lineup of battery-powered mowers, including RYOBI's 80-volt Zero Turn Riding Mower, Milwaukee's new M18 Fuel walk mower, DEWALT's FLEXVOLT walk mower and Makita's LXT walk mower is unmatched. This lineup offers something for everyone, building on an ecosystem of innovative tools powered by the same battery platforms.\nIn patio, we have continued to add optionality. And today, customers can create their perfect patio set to transform their outdoor living space through an enhanced online experience. And we expanded our assortment of grills. We're particularly excited about our new Traeger Timberline XL, which provides a larger cooking surface, easier maintenance and a side burner to enhance your cooking needs. Our new Neevo Next by Grill (sic) [Nexgrill] is the first propane-powered grill controlled via an app or your mobile device. The app displays timers, the grill temperatures and internal food temperatures, providing a consistent cooking experience for hours.\nWe're also excited about our live goods program. Each year, our merchants provide our customers with new and improved varieties to enhance the overall garden experience. We've expanded our disease- and drought-resistant products offering superior performance. For example, Beacon impatiens are disease-resistant, and our Easy Wave petunias now require less sunlight and lasts up to 6 weeks longer. Adding these new, hardier plants allows our customers to have a vibrant and healthier garden for longer. Our live good category looks incredible. We are ready for spring from everything from shrubs to a variety of flower and edibles for every type of gardener.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard V. McPhail\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, total sales were $38.9 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion or 3.8% from last year. During the first quarter, our total company comps were positive 2.2% with positive comps of 12.9% in February, essentially flat in March and negative 2% in April. Comps in the U.S. were positive 1.7% for the quarter with positive comps of 12.5% in February, negative 0.3% in March and negative 2.9% in April. Recall that March reflects the anniversarying of stimulus and April was impacted by a delayed spring this year.\nOur results this quarter were once again driven by continued strength across the business. Spring temperatures broke late in all our geographies, but in particular impacted some of our northern regions. In local currency, both Mexico and Canada posted comps above the company average.\nIn the first quarter, our gross margin was 33.8%, a decrease of approximately 20 basis points from last year, primarily driven by supply chain investments and pressure from lumber. We continue to successfully offset significant transportation and product cost pressures while maintaining our position as the customers' advocate for value.\nDuring the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales remained essentially flat to last year at approximately 18.6%. We were pleased with our operating expense performance during the first quarter, which reflected planned increases in wage and planned rollout of investments designed to drive efficiency in our store environment. Our operating margin for the first quarter was 15.2% compared to 15.4% in the first quarter of 2021.\nInterest and other expense for the first quarter increased by $36 million to $369 million due primarily to higher long-term debt levels than 1 year ago. Our effective tax rate was 23.9% in the first quarter of both fiscal 2022 and 2021. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $4.09, an increase of 6% compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nOur total store count at the end of the quarter was 2,316, and selling square footage was 240 million square feet. Unfortunately, during the quarter, we lost a store in San Jose, California due to a fire. Thankfully, no one was injured, and all of our associates have been reassigned to other nearby stores. And the team has done a fantastic job continuing to serve our customers in the area.\nAt the end of the quarter, inventories were $25.3 billion, up $6.1 billion compared to the first quarter of 2021. And inventory turns were 4.4x, down from 5.5x last year. This level of inventory reflects outsized demand for home improvement projects, actions taken to improve in-stocks and the impact of the delayed start to spring. While our in-stock position is not back to pre-pandemic levels, it is the healthiest it has been since the pandemic began.\nTurning to capital allocation. After investing in our business and paying our dividend, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As we have mentioned on previous calls, we plan to continue investing in our business with CapEx of approximately 2% of sales on an annual basis. We also plan to maintain flexibility, to move faster or slower depending on the environment.\nDuring the first quarter, we invested approximately $700 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. And during the quarter, we paid approximately $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders, and we returned approximately $2.25 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.3%, up from 45.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nNow I will comment on our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. As you heard from Ted, we are very pleased with the strong performance we saw during the first quarter, which surpassed our expectations. Today, we are raising guidance for 2022. We now expect sales growth and comp sales growth of approximately 3% for fiscal 2022. We expect comps to be stronger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We expect our fiscal 2022 operating margin to be approximately 15.4% for the year, and we expect mid-single-digit percentage growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021. While a number of uncertainties remain, we feel confident that we will be able to continue to manage through a dynamic environment while growing faster than our market and delivering exceptional shareholder value.\nThank you for your participation in today's call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.",

Menear\n\nChairman & CEO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Isabel, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call this morning. As you know, this is my last earnings call, and it has been a blessing and an honor to serve our customers, associates, shareholders and communities for the last 7.5 years as CEO. I'm extremely proud of the progress this team has made together, but perhaps our greatest accomplishment has been nurturing the culture of our company, which I believe is a competitive advantage.\nI am confident that this leadership team will effectively guide The Home Depot through its next phase of growth. But before we talk about that, let's first discuss our results for the year. Fiscal 2021 was another record year for The Home Depot as we achieved the milestone of over $150 billion in sales. We have continued to navigate a challenging and fluid environment with agility. This resulted in double-digit comp growth for fiscal 2021 on top of nearly 20% comp growth that we delivered in fiscal 2020.\nWe've grown the business by over $40 billion over the last 2 years. For context, prior to the pandemic, it took us 9 years from 2009 to 2018 to grow the business by over $40 billion. So to achieve that level of growth in 2 years' time is truly a testament to our investments, our teams and their exceptional execution.\nNone of what has been accomplished over the past 2 years would have been possible without our orange-blooded associates. Our associates have maintained their relentless focus on the customer while simultaneously navigating the ongoing pandemic, industry-wide supply chain disruptions, inflation and a tight labor market.\nThe tenure and strength of our relationships with our supplier and transportation partners has also been key to our success. Our respective teams have worked tirelessly to build depth in key product categories and flow product to stores and distribution centers as quickly and efficiently as possible. I could not be more proud of the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to demonstrate, and I want to thank them and all of our partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers, communities and each other. Their extraordinary efforts in fiscal 2021 resulted in record Success Sharing, our bonus program for our hourly associates.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to Ted, who will provide some additional details on our fourth quarter performance.\n\nEdward P. Decker\n\nPresident & COO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We finished the year with another exceptional quarter as home improvement demand remained strong. Sales for the fourth quarter grew approximately $3.5 billion to $35.7 billion, up 10.7% from last year. Comp sales were up 8.1% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 7.6%.\nDuring the fourth quarter, all our regions and merchandise departments posted positive comps. Departments of comps above the company average were plumbing, electrical, building materials, millwork, decor and storage and paint. Our kitchen bath department was in line with the company average. And hardware tools, lumber, flooring, appliances and our garden departments were positive but below the company average.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our comp average ticket increased 12.3%. Comp transactions decreased 3.8%. The growth in our comp average ticket was driven primarily by inflation across several product categories. Core commodity categories positively impacted our average ticket growth by approximately 185 basis points in the fourth quarter driven by inflation in lumber, building materials and copper.\nLumber prices remain volatile. For example, in the fourth quarter alone, the pricing for framing lumber ranged from approximately $585 to over $1,200 per 1,000 board feet, an increase of more than 100%. On a 2-year basis, both comp average ticket and comp transactions were healthy and positive in the fourth quarter. Big-ticket comp transactions or those over $1,000 were up approximately 18% compared to the fourth quarter of last year.\nWe saw continued strength in both our Pro and DIY customers. During the fourth quarter, Pro sales growth outpaced DIY growth. Sales growth for both our Pro and DIY customers accelerated in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and showed strong double-digit growth on a 2-year basis for both customer groups.\nSales leveraging our digital platforms grew approximately 6% for the fourth quarter and approximately 9% for the year. Over the past 2 years, sales from our digital platforms have grown over 100%. Our focus on delivering a frictionless, interconnected shopping experience is resonating with our customers as approximately 50% of our online orders were fulfilled through our stores in fiscal 2021. We feel great about our position as the #1 retailer for home improvement, and we look forward to serving our customers in the busy spring selling season.\nBefore I hand the call over to Richard, I also want to say a huge thank you to all our associates as well as our supplier and transportation partners for their incredible effort in 2021. Over the last year, we faced a number of challenges, including rising cost pressures, disruptions throughout the supply chain and the ongoing pandemic. We're extremely grateful for the way our cross-functional teams work with our partners to mitigate these challenges while staying focused on serving our customers and communities.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.\n\nRichard V. McPhail\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, total sales were $35.7 billion, an increase of approximately $3.5 billion or 10% -- 10.7% from last year. Our total company comps were positive 8.1% for the quarter with positive comps of 7.3% in November, 10.2% in December and 7% in January. Comps in the U.S. were positive 7.6% for the quarter with positive comps of 7.2% in November, 10.9% in December and 5.4% in January.\nOur results in the fourth quarter were once again driven by broad-based strength across the business and our geographies. All 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps, and Canada and Mexico posted double-digit positive comps in the fourth quarter.\nFor the year, our sales totaled a record $151.2 billion, with sales growth of $19 billion or 14.4% versus fiscal 2020. For the year, total company comp sales increased 11.4%, and U.S. comp sales increased 10.7%. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.2%, a decrease of approximately 35 basis points from last year. And for the year, our gross margin was 33.6%, a decrease of approximately 30 basis points from last year, primarily driven by product mix and investments in our supply chain network.\nDuring the fourth quarter, operating expenses were approximately 19.7% of sales, representing a decrease of approximately 120 basis points from last year. Our operating leverage during the fourth quarter reflects comparisons against significant COVID-related expenses that we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020 to support our associates, the anniversarying of $110 million of nonrecurring expenses related to the completion of the HD Supply acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2020, and solid expense management for the quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we also incurred approximately $125 million of COVID-related expenses. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 18.4% of sales, representing a decrease of approximately 170 basis points from fiscal 2020. Our operating expense leverage in fiscal 2021 reflects a decrease in our COVID-related costs compared to last year, partially offset by wage actions taken at the end of 2020 as well as throughout 2021. Our operating expenses for the year included a consistent level of investment in our business, which we intend to continue. For the year, we are very pleased with the operating expense leverage we were able to deliver.\nOur operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.5% and for the year was approximately 15.2%. Interest and other expense for the fourth quarter was essentially flat with last year. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 25.5% and for fiscal 2021 was 24.4%.\nOur diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $3.21, an increase of 21.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were $15.53, an increase of 30.1% compared to fiscal 2020.\nDuring the year, we opened 7 new stores and added 14 new stores through a small acquisition, bringing our store count to 2,317 at the end of fiscal 2021. Retail selling square footage was approximately 241 million square feet at the end of fiscal 2021.\nTotal sales per retail square foot were approximately $605 in fiscal 2021, the highest in our company's history. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $22.1 billion, an increase of $5.4 billion versus last year. And inventory turns were 5.2x, down from 5.8x from the same period last year.\nMoving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $830 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. This brings total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to $2.6 billion.\nDuring the year, we paid approximately $7 billion of dividends to our shareholders. We look to grow our dividend every year as we grow earnings. And today, we announced our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.90 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $7.60. And finally, during fiscal 2021, we returned approximately $15 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases, including $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was 44.7%, up from 40.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nNow I'll comment on our outlook for 2022. The broader housing environment continues to be supportive of home improvement. Demand for homes continues to be strong, and existing home inventory available for sale remains near record lows, resulting in support for continued home price appreciation. On average, homeowners' balance sheets continue to strengthen as the aggregate value of U.S. home equity grew approximately 35% or $6.5 trillion since the first quarter of 2019. The housing stock continues to age, and customers tell us the demand for home improvement projects of all sizes is healthy.\nWhile we are encouraged by the consistent and resilient demand we've seen for home improvement, broader uncertainty remains with respect to the impact of inflation, supply chain dynamics and how consumer spending will evolve through the year. Given these factors, establishing full year 2022 guidance based on macroeconomic fundamentals remains challenging. As a result, our fiscal 2022 guidance is based on the run rate of dollar demand we have observed over the last 2 quarters. We adjust this dollar run rate for our historical seasonality to calculate our sales outlook for 2022.\nBased on this approach and assuming there are no material shifts in demand, we calculate that sales growth and comp sales growth will be slightly positive for fiscal 2022. We would expect our fiscal 2022 operating margin to be flat to 2021. And we would expect low single-digit percentage growth in diluted earnings per share compared to fiscal 2021.\nOver the course of fiscal 2022, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our annual expectation of approximately 2% of sales going forward. We believe that we have positioned ourselves to meet the needs of our customers in any environment as evidenced by our results. The investments we've made in our business have enabled agility in our operating model. As we look forward, we will continue to invest to strengthen our position with our customers, leverage our scale and low-cost position to drive growth faster than the market and deliver shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Craig.\n\nCraig A. Menear\n\nChairman & CEO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. And again, let me congratulate the team on an exceptional year. In a few moments, Ted and Richard will share their thoughts on the next phase of growth for our company. The leadership team has spent a lot of time over the past year talking about what's next for The Home Depot, and I have never been more excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us.\nWhile change is constant in our business, our strategic priorities remain consistent: deliver the best customer experience in home improvement and extend our low-cost provider position. Our objectives to grow market share and deliver exceptional shareholder value are also unchanged. And as Ted will detail, the investments we have made and will continue to make in differentiated capabilities throughout the business will unlock the opportunity to deliver a value proposition that we believe is unique in our industry.\nWe are well positioned to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on a compelling growth opportunity in our space. We have a world-class leadership team who have the vision and experience to guide our company to new heights. We have a team of approximately 500,000 associates who are committed to the culture that our founders instilled in our business over 40 years ago. These associates have demonstrated exceptional execution and an unwavering commitment to our customers regardless of the operating environment.\nI believe that the greatest days for The Home Depot are ahead of us. And it is my honor to turn the call over to Ted, who will share a bit more about our strategic priorities for 2022 and beyond.\n\nEdward P. Decker\n\nPresident & COO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThank you, Craig. Let me take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for all that you have done for this company throughout your 25-year career. You're a tremendous steward of our culture, ensuring our values guide every decision we make as a leadership team. You led us through a transformational period and positioned us well for the future. So on behalf of all our associates, thank you.\nI believe that Home Depot is an organization unlike any other. Our success is driven by our orange-blooded associates, unique culture, customer focus and operational excellence. This is the power of The Home Depot and why we are the #1 retailer for home improvement.\nI'd like to spend some time talking about the future, what's next for this great company. We've seen several inflection points in our company's history, all spurred by a desire to maintain the growth mentality and entrepreneurial spirit created by Bernie and Arthur when they revolutionized the home improvement industry over 40 years ago. Over the years, we have used these inflection points to adapt to changing market conditions and customer expectations.\nApproximately 15 years ago, we pivoted from new stores as a driver of growth to growth driven by productivity. Years later, we began building capabilities to better enable a multichannel shopping experience through an end-to-end approach. In recent years, we focused on a customer-back approach to deliver the best interconnected shopping experience in home improvement. Customer expectations continue to evolve, and there is little tolerance for any friction in the shopping journey. So we will continue to adapt to stay ahead of the customer.\nWe have seen a tremendous amount of growth in the past decade. We could have never predicted the more than $40 billion in growth since the end of 2019. With this growth, we are reimagining new milestones for the business.\nI'm going to turn it over to Richard, who will briefly talk through our goals and help frame the opportunity within the context of our total addressable market.\n\nRichard V. McPhail\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ted. Our objectives to grow market share and deliver exceptional shareholder value are unchanged. Aligned with these objectives, our goals are: first, to grow the business to $200 billion in sales, which represents incremental growth of approximately $50 billion from where we are today; and second, and just as importantly, deliver best-in-class operating profit dollar growth and return on invested capital.\nWe believe that we will achieve these goals through what we are confident is the winning formula for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We intend to provide the best experience in home improvement, extend our position as the low-cost provider and be the most efficient investor of capital in home improvement.\nOver the last 2 years, as we've grown by over $40 billion in sales, our addressable market has also grown. We now estimate that our total addressable market in North America is greater than $900 billion. We have invested in capabilities that improve our competitive positioning and allow us to pursue opportunities we could not meaningfully address in the past, which provides significant growth opportunities with both consumers and Pros. We estimate that each of these respective customer groups represent about 50% of the total addressable market.\nWe also estimate that each of these important customer groups represent approximately 50% of our total sales. For Pro, we believe this addressable end market is over $450 billion. Within this end market, we believe our addressable maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, space has expanded to over $100 billion. So while we are the #1 home improvement retailer across all of our geographies, we represent a relatively small part of a large and fragmented total addressable market that has expanded significantly over the past 2 years.\nTo support our growth objectives, we have a straightforward approach to capital allocation that will also remain unchanged. Investing in the business is our primary capital allocation priority, and we have learned that it is critical to invest in a more consistent and agile way. Our investment cadence has become more real time, allowing us to pivot more quickly, giving us the ability to move faster when we see positive results. After investing in the business, it is our intent to return excess cash to shareholders through a balanced approach of paying a healthy dividend and making share repurchases.\nWhile there is more to do as we fine-tune new go-to-market strategies and refine our processes to better serve our customers, we believe what we are creating will extend our leadership position. We intend to leverage our unmatched scale as we continue to optimize assets and capabilities to compete in a more disruptive way. The macroeconomic environment is supportive, the opportunity in front of us is compelling, and our capital allocation principles will continue to create value for our stakeholders.\n\nEdward P. Decker\n\nPresident & COO, The Home Depot, Inc.\n\nThanks, Richard. We have a powerful foundation and distinct competitive advantages. First, as I mentioned earlier, our unique culture and values as well as our knowledgeable associates will remain a competitive differentiator. Second, our stores are the hub of our business and will always be important in the future of home improvement retail. We have a premier real estate footprint that provides convenience for the customer.\nThird, we believe we have the most relevant brands and products and are continuously driving innovation in the marketplace. Fourth, we have a best-in-class supply chain and have demonstrated our ability to operate with agility and navigate any environment. And finally, we have consistently improved the interconnected shopping experience as our customers increasingly blend physical and digital worlds for their projects.\nWe continue to invest and strengthen these advantages to ensure the best experience for our customers. While there is more work to do, we've made important strides in removing friction from the customer experience. Let me give you real examples of how the investments we've made across the business are earning us more share of wallet with our customers.\nLet's take the example of one of our Pro customers in the Dallas market. Years ago, this large-scale repair/remodeler primarily shop with us in our stores for their unplanned immediate need purchases, largely out of convenience. Over time, their in-store spend increased and they were signed a dedicated Pro Account Representative, or PAR, to deepen our relationship with them. As we invested across the interconnected experience, this customer engaged with us more often and occasionally used us for job site delivery. At this point, we saw their spend with The Home Depot grow to more than $100,000 annually but still for mostly unplanned immediate-need purchases in store.\nFast forward to today, this customer now utilize the number of new and/or improved capabilities. Last year, this customer downloaded our mobile app. Their mobile orders increased. They joined our Pro loyalty program and authenticated with us via our B2B website. We began offering personalized pricing on certain products. And they took their first deliveries from several of our new fulfillment centers, including one of our new flatbed distribution centers. As a result, we've seen spend with this customer more than triple to over $300,000 annually. While this is one example, we see that customers increase spend with us as they build confidence in our capabilities.\nWhile we continue serving this customer for their unplanned immediate-need purchases, we now believe our capabilities are beginning to satisfy important planned purchase occasions. We believe the ability to serve our Pros' planned and unplanned purchase occasions will be an important driver of growth as we work towards a $200 billion sales milestone.\nAnd while Pro is an important driver of growth going forward, removing friction from the DIY customer is equally important. Let's take the example of a customer we'll call Geena, a DIY customer tackling a bathroom remodel 4 years ago and compare that with the same shopping experience today. 4 years ago, she would have relied heavily on our stores and website for helping completing her project. Geena's engagement on our digital applications is a little more difficult. The mobile experience wasn't as intuitive, search results weren't as relevant, and associated recommendations were limited. As a result, she likely made multiple trips to the store for items she didn't know she needed. And when she did go to the store, buy online, pick up in store, or BOPUS, was essentially the only option outside of the traditional cash-and-carry model for collecting whatever tools and materials are projects required.\nToday, Geena's experience would be meaningfully different as her shopping journey is met with a lot less friction. As Geena begins her project online, improvements in search provide her with more relevant results. We also have a better understanding of the intent of our shopping journey and can make recommendations supporting their whole project.\nAnd we know these product relevant recommendations matter. Over the last 4 years, we've seen a significant increase in sales driven by product recommendations. When Geena comes to our stores, our recently updated mobile app and improved signage help her more easily navigate our aisles. We've made investments in the front end to improve her checkout experience. And as always, our knowledgeable associates are there to help Geena throughout her project. If Geena chooses to place an order online for pickup in the store, she has multiple fulfillment options. She can pick up her items at the service desk, grab those items from a locker or have them brought to a car with curbside pickup. Geena can also receive same- or next-day delivery on thousands of items. We have seen customers like Geena increase their spend with The Home Depot as a result of our improved in-store experience, more robust and personalized online shopping journey and greater delivery and fulfillment options.\nWe are also shifting our mindset to deliver a truly seamless interconnected experience. The flywheel we are building goes beyond retail's traditional channel mindset to an ecosystem of capabilities and operational efficiencies working together to remove friction at every step of the customer shopping journey.\nFor example, while we believe the supply chain network we are building is transformational, it's just not about the buildings themselves. The value lies in their connection to the overall fulfillment and store ecosystem in the improved customer experience. The new fulfillment centers enable us to expand our assortment and inventory depth as well as offer faster and more reliable delivery options. In addition, these new facilities removed some fulfillment pressures historically placed on stores, creating a better in-store shopping experience and freeing up associates to help drive additional sales.\nOur intention is to build an unrivaled delivery network for home improvement goods. While early days, we continue to develop our capabilities, and we are encouraged as we see a measurable lift in sales with a more interconnected shopping experience.\nAs we move forward towards this next phase of growth, we will remain focused on driving productivity, a long-standing hallmark of The Home Depot. Enabled by technology, we are focused on eliminating unnecessary tasks and making our processes more efficient while also making our shopping experience the best in home improvement. When I think about our stores, I think about the tremendous amount of productivity over the years, all of which helped us achieve over $600 in sales per retail square foot in 2021.\nAs we set our sights on our goal of $200 billion in sales, we have many opportunities to improve freight flow throughout the store and drive further space optimization and SKU productivity. The productivity initiatives don't reside solely in our stores. We see many opportunities across the business.\nWhen our founders started The Home Depot over 40 years ago, they transformed an industry. We are continuing that legacy but doing so in an interconnected way. We believe that the interconnected ecosystem we are building will increase our ability to capture share. We intend to disrupt traditional business models with new go-to-market strategies. The opportunity in front of us is exciting today as it was when we first opened our doors, and I am honored to help lead this company into the next phase of growth. Thank you for your interest in The Home Depot.\nAnd Christine, we are now ready for questions.",

Starting with the presidential symposium, new phase III data demonstrate that Paxlovid, in combination with pembrolizumab, reduced the risk of recurrence and death by at least half for patients with cisplatin-ineligible muscle-invasive cancer when given before and after surgery. This is the first and only regimen to improve survival when used before and after standard of care in this patient population. With this unprecedented data in hand, we see the potential to substantially increase the US addressable population with approximately 18,000 patients under the current label in metastatic urothelial cancer.\nIf there are further positive data that is approved, up to approximately 22,500 additional patients across both ciseligible and cisineligible muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We also presented follow-up results from the FAROS single-arm phase II clinical trial supporting Braftovi and Mektovi as a standard of care for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring a BRAF V600E mutation. This updated analysis showed a substantial median overall survival benefit of 47.6 months in treatment-naive patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation.\nWe are pleased with the continued strong year-over-year growth of Braftovi and Mektovi, with a 30% increase in new patient starts since the 23 October launch. We believe the results from the FAROS trial could establish a new benchmark with targeted combination therapies for its population of patients. These results fortify the strength of our growing lung cancer portfolio that includes small molecules, ADCs, and our 707 bispecific. We are confident in our potential to deliver treatments across the lung cancer spectrum, a large and growing market expected to reach approximately $70 billion by year 2030.\nWe also presented final overall survival results from the phase III EMBARK trial, evaluating Xtandi in combination with leuprolide and adjuvant therapy in non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence. As the first and only ARI-based regimen to demonstrate overall survival benefit in this population, these results highlight the potential benefit of Xtandi in this earlier line treatment setting. This strengthens our position for a product that is experiencing strong demand growth in hormone sensitive prostate cancer, and rapid uptake in the approximate 16,000 US patient population with non-metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence.\nI want to mention another update about our program in sickle cell disease. We are very pleased that last month, the FDA concluded that Pfizer may resume enrollment of Oxbryta studies outside of Sub-Saharan Africa and in individuals who have not relocated from Sub-Saharan Africa. We are still engaging with regulatory authorities to determine possible next steps for Oxbryta. We will look forward to sharing more details in the months ahead about our key pipeline catalysts for 2026 in the coming years. With disciplined execution and our continued focus on key products, both in the US and key international markets, we continue to build on our leadership position within our commercial portfolio.\nOur Vyndaqel family of products achieved 7% year-over-year global operational growth in the quarter. Strong demand reinforced that this is the foundation of treatment for patients with a heart condition of ATTR cardiomyopathy, helping them live longer and avoid hospitalization. We are encouraged by our continued strong market leadership. In international, we achieved 40% growth in the quarter in total patients on treatment. In the US, our continued double-digit demand growth reflects strong diagnostic efforts, broad access, and favorable affordability dynamics.\nNurtec continues to lead the oral CGRP class in primary care penetration in the US. In international, we achieved growth with continued strong uptake in key markets. Globally, we achieved 22% year-over-year operational growth in the quarter. We are pleased that our new consumer campaigns continue to perform well, and our team has been effective in sharing new compelling clinical data with healthcare professionals. Paxlovid, another market leader in our portfolio, achieved 13% year-over-year global operational growth in the quarter. Paxlovid, in combination with pembrolizumab, continues to expand utilization and has been established as a standard of care first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer.\nOur vaccines portfolio is a key area of focus in international markets. We are pleased with the strong performance of the Prevnar family, driven by SRR, GAINS, and launches in several key markets. We achieved 17% year-over-year international operational growth in the quarter. Pfizer is the pediatric pneumococcal vaccination leader, with public funding secured in about 140 national immunization programs around the world. After launching in the majority of key international markets, Prevnar adult is the established leader among adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.\nIn the US, where we did experience a year-over-year decline in the quarter, we are pleased with the overall performance of Prevnar 20. For adults, Prevnar held a market-leading position, and grew with the expanded recommendation for adults over 50. In the pediatric market, accounting for about 60% of Prevnar revenues in the US, we experienced a delayed timing of government bulk order, which we have seen from time to time. It's a question of timing. I want to provide an update about the next generation PCV programs. While we previously guided with phase III start of our adult 25 valent program in 2025, we are planning to start the study next year if the FDA aligns with our approach.\nFor our pediatric program, we expect for those data from our ongoing phase II study early next year, and pending positive data and regulatory feedback, we have the potential to start both phase III programs in 2026, streamlining our development approach and aligning with our strategy to provide a single vaccine across age groups. We are committed to maintaining leadership in the PCV space, and as a reminder, our 25-valent vaccine candidate has the potential for improved immunogenicity for serotype III, which is one of the largest remaining contributors of pneumococcal disease.\nSerotype III alone is estimated to cause approximately 20% of invasive disease in the 65+ population in the US and EU. Prevnar also achieved significant international momentum with 75% year-over-year operational growth in the quarter due to expanded access in key markets. In the US, we are experiencing the headwind of a more difficult-to-activate population as we enter the third season of RSV. Still, we are continuing to strengthen our position with a 59% market share in the US in CIP dose volume in this quarter.\nFrom the significant strategic milestones we have achieved in recent months to our solid financial performance during this quarter, we are demonstrating how we are building for long-term value with near-term execution of our 2025 strategic priorities. By committing to focus simplification and leveraging technology across our business, we are accelerating progress and improving productivity. In the quarter, we achieved another strong gross margin performance.\nAdditionally, we were able to deliver adjusted diluted EPS that was ahead of expectations significantly, even with lower infection rates contributing to a revenue decline in our COVID-19 portfolio. Our business is performing well, we are raising the range of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for full year 2025, while also remaining committed to our dividend. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. To begin this morning, I'd like to highlight that our solid financial performance directly reflects our disciplined execution of our key strategic priorities. We continue to prioritize enhanced patient outcomes, as well as the achievement of our financial objectives. Furthermore, our recent agreement with the US government demonstrates our ability to navigate in a complex external environment. Our cost improvement measures have driven greater operational efficiency and streamlined decision-making, which is evident in the solid operating margins for this quarter.\nYear-to-date, margins expanded despite the unfavorable impact of the acquired in-process R&D from the 3SBio transaction. Going forward, we expect to improve our cash flow and increase flexibility across our three capital allocation pillars. Our focus remains on creating long-term shareholder value. We will continue to invest in our business for the long term, evidenced by our recent business development activity, while prudently returning capital to our shareholders. Now, with that, let me start with our Q3 results, and then I'll touch on our cost improvement initiatives, as well as our capital allocation priorities.\nI'll finish with a few comments on our 2025 guidance, which continues to improve as we move throughout this year. For the Q3 of 2025, we recorded revenues of $16.7 billion, a decrease of 7% operationally versus the same period of last year. That's largely driven by a decline in our COVID products. The decline was primarily due to Paxlovid, which experienced reduced demand from lower levels of disease incidence, as well as last year's one-time Paxlovid government stockpiling recorded in Q3 of 2024, and, to a lesser extent, Comirnaty. With that said, our non-COVID products performance was solid, growing 4% operationally versus the same period of last year.\nOn the bottom line, Q3 2025 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.62, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.87, ahead of our expectations due to our overall gross margin and cost management performance. I'll point out that this profit performance includes a headwind of approximately $0.20 of acquired in-process R&D from the 3SBio transaction. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a refined commercial strategy. We remain committed to prioritizing key products and markets, optimizing the global allocation of our commercial field resources, and concentrating our market efforts on high-priority areas.\nWe saw solid contributions across our product portfolios, primarily driven by Eliquis, the Vyndaqel family, and Nurtec, but it was more than offset by declines in Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Through the first nine months of 2025, Pfizer's recently launched and acquired products delivered $7.3 billion in revenue while growing approximately 9% operationally versus last year. This lower growth rate in the Q3 as compared to Q2 was primarily driven by the timing of pediatric CDC shipments of Prevnar, and a one-time favorable impact in Q2 for CGEN products transitioning to a wholesale distribution model in the US.\nWe plan to continue to invest behind these two product groups to drive their future performance and help enable the company to largely offset our LOEs over the next several years. Adjusted gross margin for the Q3 was approximately 76%, primarily reflecting the product mix in the quarter, and continued strong cost management within our manufacturing footprint. As a reminder, over the past two years, our adjusted gross margins have generally remained in the mid to upper 70s, excluding Comirnaty, which has a 50/50 profit split with our partner BioNTech.\nWe expect $1.5 billion in savings from phase I of the manufacturing optimization program by the end of 2027 to support our long-term operating margin expansion goal. Going forward, cost management across our manufacturing network remains a top priority. Total adjusted operating expenses were $7 billion for the Q3 of 2025, an increase of 21% operationally versus last year, driven in large part by the acquired in-process R&D expense for 3SBio. Excluding the 3SBio deal, adjusted operating expenses contracted by approximately $150 million versus last year.\nLooking at the components, adjusted SI&A expenses decreased 3% operationally, primarily driven by focused investments and ongoing productivity improvements that drove a decrease in marketing and promotional spend for various products. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 3% operationally as well, driven by a net decrease in spending due to pipeline focus and optimization, including the expansion of our digital capabilities. Finally, acquired in-process R&D expenses increased $1.4 billion, largely resulting from the 3SBio deal. As our adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses demonstrate, we continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management. Q3 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.62, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.87, which benefited from our efficient operating structure.\nAdditionally, EPS was aided by our effective tax rate, primarily driven by favorable changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings, and tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple jurisdictions spanning multiple years, partially offset by the aforementioned 3SBio acquired in-process R&D charge. We continue to be disciplined with expense management, progressing multiple cost improvement programs, as we remain focused on driving operating margin expansion over the coming years. Phase I of the manufacturing optimization program contributed savings in the Q3.\nIn addition, we remain on track to deliver on our goal of at least $4.5 billion in cumulative net cost savings from our ongoing cost realignment program by the end of this year. As a reminder, in total for these programs, we expect approximately $7.7 billion in savings by the end of 2027 to drive operational efficiencies, strengthening our business with the potential of contributing significantly to our bottom line over this period. Of these savings, approximately $500 million identified in R&D will be reinvested in the pipeline, which we expect by the end of 2026. With that, now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value.\nOur strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at the appropriate level of financial returns, and making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first nine months of this year, we returned $7.3 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $7.2 billion in internal R&D, and invested approximately $1.6 billion in business development transactions, primarily reflecting the 3SBio licensing deal. As a reminder, our business development capacity after the 3SBio deal is approximately $13 billion. In the Q3, we announced a planned acquisition of Metsera for approximately $4.9 billion, with additional contingent value rights tied to successful pipeline progression.\nThe transaction is expected to be funded through a mix of available cash as well as debt. We expect the deal to be diluted through 2030 as we continue to invest to enable further promising late-stage pipeline assets. Specifically, we currently expect the Metsera transaction to be approximately $0.16 diluted to 2026 adjusted EPS. Additionally, we expect another $0.05 of dilution in 2026 from the 3SBio deal, which closed in the Q3. With that said, we believe the two deals set up a strong potential revenue growth trajectory in 2030 and beyond. Lastly, through the first nine months of 2025, operating cash flow was approximately $6.4 billion, which includes the $1.35 billion upfront payment for the 3SBio transaction.\nOur gross leverage at the end of the Q3 was approximately 2.7x. That said, upon the close of the Metsera transaction, our leverage is expected to be above the 2.7x target. We expect to bring our leverage back down to the target levels over time to continue to support a balanced allocation of capital between reinvestments and direct returns to shareholders. Now, let me turn to our full year 2025 guidance. As Albert noted in September, we reached a new voluntary agreement with the US government that will help ensure US patients pay lower prices for prescription medication, while providing the clarity we need to focus on our business and our investments in future innovation.\nThe agreement has no impact on our 2025 guidance, but we expect a diluted impact to our 2026 financial outlook. We continue to expect full year 2025 revenues to be in the range of $61 to 64 billion. Non-COVID products continue to perform very well operationally, and ahead of our plan. However, we note there is softness in our COVID products due to lower vaccination rates and COVID infection rates. In addition, our guidance assumes a favorable impact to revenues from foreign exchange rates. Furthermore, we now expect adjusted R&D to be in the range of $10 to 11 billion, and our effective tax rate to be approximately 11%. Additionally, adjusted SI&A remains unchanged.\nNow, given our strong performance to date and our fourth quarter outlook, including our more efficient cost structure, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by approximately $0.08 at the midpoint, to $3 a share to $3.15 a share. I'd like to emphasize our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance substantially de-risked the current lower-than-anticipated COVID trends. In closing, we remain committed to enhancing the value of our product portfolio and advancing innovation to further strengthen our pipeline. With a stronger balance sheet, we plan to continue deploying capital effectively.\nWe aim to boost R&D productivity with digital tools, including AI, prioritize investments in key R&D programs, and deliver new growth through business development. Furthermore, our performance continues to exceed expectations and deliver strong results, even as the incidence of COVID remains low. This consistent performance highlights our resilience and commitment to excellence, regardless of the challenging external environment. Our efforts to enhance cost efficiency and generate improvements in operating margins by driving productivity and optimizing processes.\nLastly, with the recent agreement with the US government, we can now focus on executing our strategy and our strategic priorities across our business to deliver new medicines for patients and enhance long-term shareholder value. I'd like to just close by noting that it is our expectation that we'll provide guidance for 2026, most likely by the end of this year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Albert, and we'll begin our question and answer session.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Alberto, please assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star one to ask a question. Our first question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biopharmaceuticals Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHi, Green. Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to have to defer the Metsera question to other analysts, but I'm curious to hear what you say there. I'll just ask a couple more on the commercial side. One, Vyndaqel, obviously facing more competition there. Surprised to see the performance. There was a little bit of sequential decline. Maybe you can just comment on the pricing and sort of market share dynamics you're seeing in that space, obviously with the new competitors.\nThen similar question on Padcev, obviously great data that you shared at ESMO. The commercial update for the quarter at least was a little bit less than we thought. Maybe just how you expect the muscle-invasive indication, assuming you get that here soon, to impact uptake of that program and kind of drive upside toward the number that right now. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vamil. Amir.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 1, Pfizer\n\nSure. Vamil, thanks for the question. Let me start with your question on Vyndaqel. I want to level set a couple of things about Vyndaqel, then I'll talk about the performance in the quarter. There's obviously new competition in the category, and it's important to note that Vyndaqel is still the only ATTR cardiomyopathy product that has statistically significant reductions in both mortality and CV-related hospitalizations together and as a standalone. It's also the only product where there is a once-daily capsule, placebo-like safety, and near-complete TTR stabilization. We've got 90% access for Vyndamax across the US.\nNow, with regards to the quarter, there are a couple of different dynamics that are happening. First of all, we saw very strong demand growth, and that's reinforced by our continued market share leadership, both on a TRX basis, clearly, but also in terms of first-line share. That volume growth was offset by two gross-to-net headwinds. One is the IRA manufacturer rebates, which we've talked about before. The second is what we alluded to last quarter, which is payer contracting that took place in the Q3. Vyndamax is performing exactly where we thought it would and consistent with what we guided.\nPerformance continues to reflect strong diagnosis, broad access, improving affordability dynamics, and that's going to continue to grow our volume. We are seeing competition. Atrybui is taking some first-line share from treatment-naive patients, and Amvuttra has driven minimal switching to date. As we kind of look forward on Vyndaqel, we'll see some of these dynamics continue into Q4 as well, where we expect continued volume growth, but the two GTN drivers that I described will certainly impact our net sales. Vyndaqel is performing in the way that we expected. On your question with regards to Padcev, we're again very encouraged by how Padcev is doing.\nFor us, we look at this through two lenses. First is the LAMUC population, where we currently have about 55% share among cisplatin-ineligible patients and 45% to 50 share among cisplatin-eligible patients. There is headroom for us to continue to focus on that segment of the market. I think your question with regards to how Padcev performed on consensus is related to the comment that Dave made, which is as part of integrating the Seagen products into the Pfizer portfolio in Q2, we moved from a dropship model to a wholesaler model. That resulted in a one-time growth in our Q2 sales.\nYou have to grow products off of that, adjusted for two to three weeks of inventory. As we cycle into Q4, we expect the whole Seagen portfolio, including Padcev, to return to growth. Finally, on MIDC, we're excited about the possibility as a result of both the 303 and also 304 trials that are ongoing, and that'll open up a patient population of close to 22,000 patients to help with the next horizon of Padcev growth.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Amir. Next call, please. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to David Risinger with Leerink Partners.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Diversified Biopharmaceuticals Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on the performance in the quarter. My question is on Metsera. Could you just comment on the legal process ahead? I know that Pfizer is arguing that Novo's acquisition of Metsera would be anti-competitive, and even if the FTC does not allow it, it could be anti-competitive. Could you just talk us through the clock and the process for courts to hear Pfizer's arguments? Thanks very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. As I said in my opening comments, it is very difficult for us to start commenting when we have all these legal issues pending, right, as we speak. I will repeat what I did say, which is kind of an answer to your question, not on the timing, but we do not see how Novo's deal can be superior. It is an illegal attempt by a foreign company to do an end run around antitrust laws, taking advantage of the government's add-on.\nWhat they want to achieve is not to get the products, but to destroy them. What they want is to catch and kill an emerging competitor, which is a significant antitrust concern given Novo's dominant market position. All I can say is that we are continuing to pursue all legal resources. Thank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Asad Haider with Goldman Sachs.\n\nAsad Haider\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Healthcare Equity Research and US Pharmaceuticals Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just for Albert and Dave, just a quick high-level question on BD. What's the plan if Metsera doesn't work out for some reason? Second, on 2026, any early framing on guidance, pushes and pulls, specifically on how we should think about OpEx with and without Metsera? Any additional color on how to think about the dilution you mentioned from your recent MFN deal with the administration? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, I will send the question to Dave because there are a lot of financial also elements, and then if Andrew wants to add something on the BD.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Maybe we'll start with business development. Obviously, the company has still significant resources to understand and how to deploy successfully transactions to bring science in-house, and we will continue to work aggressively to do so across all of our four therapeutic areas. We continue to work across the globe to identify potential candidates for acquisition to help bring new and innovative medicines to patients. That's still a very ongoing, focused activity for the company.\nI think it's probably a little early to talk exactly about 2026. You heard me give a little color in the sense that clearly we're making investments today, and those investments carry over into 2026 and beyond with either Metsera or 3SBio to bring these innovative medicines to market. Those will have a slightly dilutive effect to our operating performance next year. We will then wrap all that together with the puts and takes of 2026 when we give guidance by the end of this year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Anything to add on BD, Andrew?\n\n[Company Representative 2] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 2, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I mean, I'd echo what Dave said. We are very active in all geographies, especially in China. You saw this 3SBio, which has a foundational asset to become the backbone across multiple indications. The same is true in China and beyond across all the main therapeutic areas. We've increased the size of our team in China in particular, and we have very active efforts, and we have something to inform you. You'll certainly be the first to know.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Geoff Meacham with Citibank.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Healthcare, Citibank\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I guess one for Albert or Dave. When you look at the manufacturing investments you're making as part of the MFN agreement, relative to the operational cost efficiencies, how would you rank those as priorities? I guess both seem to have three-year time frames. I'm just trying to get a sense of the incremental dollar and the strategy there. Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Clearly, there are important elements of our strategy. We're going to clearly invest in the US from a production perspective. We're working now to work through our plans with the new agreement with the US government on how to effectively deploy our capacity here in the US and further build it out. More to come. We will also provide some color to that when we give guidance for 2026. We will be able to improve our manufacturing operating infrastructure and at the same time invest in manufacturing here in the US. Those two are not necessarily completely in conflict with one another. We'll be able to do both.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Courtney Breen with Bernstein.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst of US Biopharma, Bernstein\n\nThank you so much for answering our question today. I really wanted to understand, and perhaps another question on the Metsera, but from a different angle. I wanted to understand, in your mind, what factors supported Pfizer in garnering that unprecedented early termination of the waiting period from the US Federal Trade Commission? That would be really helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nI'm not sure I understood the question.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst of US Biopharma, Bernstein\n\nThe FTC clearance.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nWhy the FTC clearance?\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst of US Biopharma, Bernstein\n\nIf there are any factors that drove the early.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nIf there are any factors. No, I think the FTC made their own decision. Of course, they were aware of this question, so I don't want to speak for them. They decided that it is appropriate in the middle of a foreign attempt to supervision to just release our deal, which is now clear. That's all.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nI think it does further demonstrate the strength of our deal, the pathway to clearance, and the pathway for us to be able to further develop these products and take them to the marketplace in a very rapid fashion. This is helpful to patients long-term, is helpful to prices long-term under our management and our direction with these assets.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Don't be surprised, right? Because we all understand that's the epitome of antitrust conflict. The entire pipeline of Metsera, it is the entire pipeline of Novo, plus they have a dominant position with the current products that they have. Of course, FTC would worry about that. I don't want to speak for themselves, but it is something that everybody understands. All right. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Pharma and Biotech Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for me. You've previously talked about Elrexfio being a key driver for you over the long term. We noticed that MagnetisMM-5 trial was pushed out data into 2026. We know J&J had a similar trial in a similar patient population that just read out. Maybe you could just remind us of any potential differences here in terms of your trial versus their trial and why there might be a difference in timing, given they started around the same time.\nThe second question is just a clarification on Paxlovid dynamics for the quarter. It looks like, by our math, price per script went up over last quarter. Just wondering if there's any one-time items that we need to think about here as we think about the trends into fourth quarter. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAll right, Chris.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Pfizer\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Magnetism V, as you know, is double-class exposed, possibly later this year or beginning next year as an event-driven study. Timing could shift due to events not happening, which we cannot speculate. As you can imagine, that's often positive if events are not happening in this study. We'll just continue to follow the events and hopefully report early next year.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, on the Paxlovid question, I don't think there's any material change in price. Maybe there's different channels, mix, and things of that nature, but nothing significant from that standpoint. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you for clarifying that. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Akash Tewari with Jefferies.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. I had a question on your upcoming phase III EVH2 readout in CRPC. I'm surprised the study isn't more prominently flagged given the potential to extend the Xtandi franchise. What drives your confidence that you're getting adequate target exposure after examining some of your food effects studies? Also, what's your expectations around overall survival? Could we see a 20% to 30 benefit here? Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nChris, that's for you.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much for the question. This is another first-in-class internally discovered program, EVH2 program. We've previously shared randomized data, and we could show significant PFS benefit in all comers and late-line metastatic aspiration-resistant prostate cancer. We now have three phase III studies ongoing.\nThe first one we'll read out, to your point, is post-abiraterone metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer, and we expect that in the coming months. We recently also presented data at ASCO, randomized data on the food effect to your question, which was 875mg twice a day with food, and showed that the data are compatible with the dose we now use in phase III with reduced GIAE. We are confident in the dose that was selected.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nThank you for taking the question. Just on the guidance, please, for this year, you've clearly reiterated the total revenue range of $61 to 64 billion. When you first said that guidance, you spoke of total COVID-19 sales of around $9 billion for the year, seeing that you booked only just over $4 billion year-to-date. Just interested in your comments around whether that $9 billion is achievable for the full year. If not, what other assets would you call out as likely to fill that gap and give you confidence to reiterate the total sales guidance?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Dave, please.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYes, you're absolutely right, Carrie, as you pointed out. I would say that to the low end of our guidance range from a revenue perspective, we would assume that the COVID franchise continues a very modest uptake for the balance of this year, particularly in the US. However, as you know, the COVID franchise is subject to big peaks and valleys. If there happens to be a wave of COVID in the next several months, you can see utilization spike up.\nThat's why the range is so large. I'll just point out that what we have done with an earnings per share guidance range is we've de-risked the COVID franchise with the guidance that we provided, given that if the trends continue, we'll be closer to the low end of that range, and we will still be able to deliver on our earnings commitment.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Very clear, Dave. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just wanted to understand the thought process around the pricing of these GLP-1 and this class of medicines, given that, I mean, even today, there's a news article out there suggesting the price could be $150 or so. It seems like the price is only going in one direction. In that case, I mean, how do you justify the price that you're paying to Metsera and, in general, the obesity landscape over time? How do you think about that, this pricing decline for the class? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Thank you. This is also competition brings prices down. Of course, they try now to restrict competition. Anyway, yes, in our calculations, we have taken into consideration that the prices of GLP-1s probably will start going down. I do not know what will be announced now, but in our calculations, we took already that into consideration. Thank you, Mohit. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Alex Hammond with Wolfe Research.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for taking the question. Can you elaborate more on the reason for the delay to the initiation of the pivotal trial for the adult 25-valent pneumococcal program? You'd mentioned the caveat of if the FDA aligns with your approach. As a tenor of the dialogue change at the FDA, is there a chance that surrogate endpoints may no longer be approvable?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Chris?\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Thank you for the question. Across all our vaccine programs, we're obviously working very closely with the FDA and other regulators on the designs of the study and also the endpoint. PCV25, pending positive data and FDA feedback, as mentioned, we intend to start that study as well as the pediatric 25 valent program next year. It means we will align the pediatric and the adult study. We expect the fourth dose data from the pediatric study early next year, which helps us to coordinate the two studies.\nIt will just make it easier. The 25 vaccine candidate covers 25 serotypes, particularly I need to point out serotype 3, which we did before, because the vaccine is designed with significantly enhanced immunogenicity against serotype 3, which currently constitutes up to 20% of infections in the US and the EU. To continue our leadership, we also continue to study our first generation with 30+ serotypes, which we'll update you on more in 2026. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Operator, the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. Maybe two MFN questions. First one's kind of bigger picture. As you think about MFN on new launches over time, what are you thinking about this suggesting for international revenues? Is this, I guess, I could read this as a net positive, that you can get higher price? I could read it as net negative because reimbursement hurdle is going to be tougher at these higher prices.\nIt could be neutral. Just how you kind of envisioned what plays out with international as you signed that deal. The second one is just trying to get a little bit more color on the MFN impact for 2026. I think you mentioned some dilution there, but any more quantitative metrics you could provide of just how much of a headwind is that for next year? Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. I'm sorry if I ask Dave to tell you that she will tell you he will provide guidance at the end of the year, and that will incorporate everything, including that and the other things that he has talked. I don't think you will get more words out of our mouth, no matter how much you torture us. On the new launches in international, of course, we are waiting to see how things may play. The price differential is not sustainable. We are speaking about a smaller basket of countries in international that are affected by that. With these countries, we are hoping that they will understand that they need to change the way that they price their product going forward.\nOf course, a little bit help from the US government and USDR through trade negotiations also can make that happen. My assessment is that Howard Lutnick and the US trade representatives are highly, highly committed to make this go away. We will see how that plays. In theoretical, if the prices over there are we are not agreeing a decent way of pricing our products, clearly, we will not get reimbursement there, and we will price them to the price that will not affect the US price. Thank you. Now let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nEquity Research Analyst in Biotech, Pharma-major, and Specialty Pharma, Evercore ISI\n\nMorning, guys. First, on Metsera, I realize this is perhaps in the hands of your M&A lawyers and antitrust lawyers, but from an R&D perspective, can we make sure you'll be evaluating all the new data that's imminent? For example, the monthly transition and how the GI tolerability holds, as well as, even more importantly, the Amylin plus GLP early combo data. Separately, I was very intrigued by a phase II B trial you guys initiated on an oral drug, inatopic derm. Could you confirm if it's a stat-6 inhibitor? Were you able to gauge the magnitude of stat-6 inhibition phase I? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Thanks. Look, on the Metsera, it's easy if they provide us data or if they publicize data. Of course, we are eager to see that, and we believe it will be positive. On the second question, I will ask Chris to comment.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Umar, to ask a question regarding our INI portfolio. I just want to check, are you referring to PF9820?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI don't think you can come back to that.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Pfizer\n\nOkay. You are correct. That is a STAT inhibitor. I want to point out that we currently have a very differentiated INI portfolio with at least five molecules in-house, discovered and developed, most of these at a significantly accelerated speed, including, obviously, P40 TL1A, which we co-developed, which is being co-developed with Roche, which covers IL12 and IL23 via P40.\nOur two trispecifics covering IL4, IL13, TSLP, IL33, both of those now entering phase II for atopic dermatitis and for other TH2-related diseases. Lifrulo with the ongoing phase III trial in nonsegmental vitiligo, which is a JAK3 tech inhibitor, also differentiated in-house. Then the STAT6 early, just entering phase II, could be potentially first-in-class oral. We're currently further optimizing dose and formulation and hope to update you on that program in 2026. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. Two questions. What does the drug pricing deal with Trump allow Pfizer to do that other companies will not be able to do, other than, of course, AstraZeneca? Secondly, on Metsera, the data looks more similar than different than competitors, and Metsera disclosures have not been completely transparent, raising serious questions.\nMany other big-cap pharmas have passed over Metsera when pursuing other products, validating the me-too point. Nothing in all this justifies a bidding war or even a protracted legal battle. Is Pfizer's determination to persist underpinned by substantial confidential data, or simply the desire to be a player in obesity? Or does Pfizer agree with the points that I just said and could it just walk away? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Steve. On the first one, on the drug prices and what we have that other companies may not have, I can't answer because I don't know what the other companies are having. As you know, the discussions are between the administration and individual companies, which also ensures that there's no antitrust issues. Of course, if they are confidential, because that's also what the administration and the agreements portray, that we should keep confidentiality of those. I know what we are getting. Some of that has been public, and some of that is part of the overall very lengthy deal, but I don't know what others will take. On the Metsera, look, we have seen the data.\nWe did extensive due diligence, and we priced the asset into a price that we thought offers tremendous value to the shareholders of Metsera and to shareholders of Pfizer because those assets that we like in our hands, of course, will provide significant competitive edge. What you see now, I repeat, is an effort to cut and kill this emerging competitor, which is Pfizer, and to do that by evading the antitrust scrutiny and virtually get control, de facto control of the company, as they will become the major shareholder and the major creditor without any regulatory scrutiny. That's all I have to say. We will see how things go. Let's move to our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research, and Senior Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Analyst, BMO\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Assuming Metsera closes, what near-term factors must you consider to continue growing the dividend, and then deliberating, Dave, as you had said? When do you think you may be able to also start to repurchase shares, or is that less of a priority with all this BD? Thank you so much.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Evan, very good question. Obviously, you've seen us over the last year and a half or two years really lean into productivity across our platform. That productivity has allowed us to deliver from roughly 4x to 2.7x. That's given us increased flexibility to do both business development, as well as maintain and grow our dividend over time. That cycle of improvement and productivity is something that we've now embedded in the company. We will continue to do that. We will continue to do that across the enterprise. We will continue to prioritize ourselves from an R&D perspective.\nClearly, we have several assets that we think are key to the growth of this company by the end of the decade. We are going to invest behind those assets from a pipeline perspective, and we're going to invest behind the categories of products that we've either acquired and/or recently launched, because those will ultimately allow us to offset the LOEs over the next several years. We'll be able to do all of that. Share repurchases is an important lever for us. In the near term, it's not a tool that we're going to use. We have to get the balance sheet back to where we need to be. Again, we have business priorities that come in the forefront of that at this point. Great question. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOkay. I think let's get the last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.\n\nRajesh Kumar\n\nHead of European LifeSciences and Healthcare Equity Research, HSBC\n\nGood morning. Two questions, if I may. Appreciate you cannot say a lot about Metsera at this junction. Just from a modeling perspective, if we are thinking of additional balance sheet capacity for deal-making, how much capacity would you assume, assuming that you are keeping some capacity away from Metsera at the moment in 2026 on your own internal budgeting? That would be really helpful. Just on the 3SBio, appreciate the deal has just closed and some of the trials have just started. When can we expect to see data news flow come out of that deal? Is it more a 2027 event, or do we have any interim readouts or updates in 2026?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. I think Dave can answer the Metsera modeling.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. As you think about BD capacity, as I said in my prepared remarks, we have approximately $13 billion of capacity as we enter here into the Q3. With that.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nChris, let's understand the 3SBio.\n\n[Company Representative 3] (Pfizer)\n\nCompany Representative 3, Pfizer\n\nYeah, the data flows. Just a reminder that as per 2025, we shared phase II monotherapy or shared by phase II monotherapy data, and first-line non-small cell lung cancer showing the overall objective response at 65%. At ESMO, phase II combo data plus chemotherapy XELOX or modified FOLFOX6 was shown for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer, and that was showing a response rate of close to 60%.\nAt CTC, we'll provide additional data, combination data in lung cancer. You've just seen we posted two phase III programs starting now this year in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and in first-line colorectal cancer. In the coming weeks, we'll also provide the full development plan to you at event, and that will show the breadth and the depth of our clinical development program for 707.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Thank you very much all for your attention. It has been successful in achieving a series of significant strategic milestones. We delivered a solid performance during the quarter, and we are confident in our business. That is why you are raising the rates of our adjusted diluted EPS. Of course, we maintain our end-store revenue despite the lowest COVID right now trends. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer, and I hope you have a wonderful week.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nFrancesca DeMartino\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer and SVP, Pfizer\n\nPfizer's earnings call. Good morning and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of 2025 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions.\nMembers of our leadership team will be available for the Q&A session. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our FCC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our business is performing well, and I'm pleased with the progress we achieved in the second quarter. We advanced and strengthened our R&D pipeline. We worked to maximize the value of our commercial portfolio and made further strides to expand our markets. We continue to be actively engaged with policymakers as we navigate a complicated and rapidly evolving geopolitical environment, while also remaining focused on advancing our business.\nWith our strong year-to-date performance, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for full year 2025 and remain committed to our dividend. Our programs to expand margins through focused technology and simplification are working very well. We are driving productivity gains by leveraging technologies such as AI and automation, and we are also realizing the benefit of continued streamlining across our company. We believe Pfizer is well positioned to continue creating meaningful value for patients and our shareholders. Our top strategic priority this year is, of course, improving R&D productivity.\nI'm proud of the outcomes we are driving and the meaningful milestones achieved during the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe key programs in our R&D portfolio offer significant opportunities to help address substantial patient needs and drive Pfizer's growth in the coming years. I will mention some highlights. Elrexfio is a medicine that is performing very well, with rapid growth and encouraging progress in claiming leading class share in new markets such as Japan, the United Kingdom, and Spain.\nThe clinical data in Elrexfio, initially heavily treated, triple-class exposed multiple myeloma indication, continues to be encouraging, with median overall survival of greater than two years, which is more than double the historical median overall survival in this population. Moreover, the majority of responding patients are maintaining their response at 30 months. Elrexfio has the potential to be a leading standard of care, with a differentiated clinical profile.\nIt is a convenient subcutaneous six-dose regimen, the only one that now includes a once-every-four-week option for select patients. New data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in newly diagnosed patients demonstrate Elrexfio's potential to move to earlier multiple myeloma treatment settings. This data from part one of the MagnetisMM-6 study showed a confirmed response rate greater than 97%, and the manageable safety profile in combination with daratumumab and Revlimid. The randomized portion of this phase III study is now enrolling very well.\nBy executing on MagnetisMM-6 and Elrexfio's other ongoing phase III trials, we aim to achieve label expansion that, if approved, would collectively increase the addressable population approximately fivefold in the growing multiple myeloma market, expected to reach approximately $44 billion by year 2030. The vedotin, or SV, is our first-in-class integrin beta-6 ADC that could be a driver of growth later this decade. We are executing a robust development program with this investigational compound in non-small cell lung cancer.\nThis includes our fully enrolled phase III study of SV monotherapy versus docetaxel in previously treated non-squamous patients that we expect data from next year. In the second line plus population, we have observed a durable 31% confirmed response rate, which is favorable versus historical data with docetaxel monotherapy. We are also enrolling a phase III study of SV in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in first-line non-small cell lung cancer with high PD-1 expression, based on encouraging phase I data for this combination recently presented at ASCO.\nThese results showed a 57% response rate and greater than 90% disease control, including responses in all patients in the tumor proportion score greater than 50% sample, which compares favorably to historical anti-PD-1 monotherapy. These results support an ambition to change standards of care to conventional chemotherapy-sparing regimens by leveraging the potential synergy between vedotin ADCs and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.\nWith our ongoing and planned trials in non-small cell lung cancer, SV has the potential to impact large patient populations, with a non-small cell lung cancer market expected to reach over $60 billion by year 2030. Our strategy is intended to deliver a first approval in previously treated patients before moving into the first-line setting, which is a non-small cell lung cancer that includes more than half a million global patients. In hematology, we continue to promote the differentiated profile of Hympavzi.\nIn the quarter, we served positive top-line data from the phase III B6A study evaluating Hympavzi for adults and adolescents with hemophilia A or B. The study's cohort of patients with inhibitors met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 93% reduction in annualized bleeding rate compared to on-demand treatment in patients 12 years or older, which compares favorably to recent approved products for hemophilia A and hemophilia B.\nThese results further strengthen Hympavzi's differentiated profile as the first once-weekly fixed-dose subcutaneous treatment for hemophilia A or B administered in a convenient pre-filled autoinjector pack. They also support the potential to expand its label to patients with hemophilia who developed inhibitors to factor replacement as we continue to execute on its launch in the previously approved non-inhibitor population. We have seen considerable quarter-over-quarter growth, particularly in the hemophilia B market, where subcutaneous treatments are only recently available.\nFollowing EU and Japan approvals at the end of last year, we are seeking reimbursement and pursuing early access pathways in other international markets as we grow our presence in the hemophilia market, projected to reach nearly $10 billion by year 2030. Moving to our vaccine portfolio, we are enthusiastic about our potential to deliver the first approved vaccine for C. difficileicile infection. Our second-generation investigational vaccine candidate builds upon encouraging results from the prior phase III Clover trial of our first-generation candidate.\nThis trial demonstrated 100% efficacy against medically attended C. difficile infection despite not achieving the study's primary endpoint. With our second-generation C. difficile vaccine formulation, we have the potential to simplify the dosing schedule from three to two weeks. This candidate, now in phase II, increased the strength of the new response fourfold compared to the first-generation vaccine.\nBased on this newly announced phase II data, we are preparing for a phase III start before the end of this year. We will incorporate learnings from the previous Clover study to develop new primary endpoints focused on the prevention of severe disease outcomes rather than primary infection. If approved, the vaccine could significantly reduce the healthcare burden of the nearly 500,000 annual C. difficile infections and approximately 30,000 annual deaths in the US alone. In another one of our phase III products, we finished dosing the last patient in our study of a vaccine candidate for Lyme disease.\nIf successful, we expect to submit for approval next year. We also continue to strengthen our portfolio by harnessing external innovation through strategic business development. The recent closing of our Global X China in-licensing agreement with 3SBio grants us exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SSGJ-707, a bispecific antibody.\nTargeting PD-1 and VEGF has the potential to deliver breakthroughs for patients in the next wave in PD-1 immunotherapy, which is an established $55 billion market. With compelling monotherapy data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer presented recently at ASCO, we view this promising cancer immunotherapy candidate as a seamless fit within Pfizer's oncology strategy, given our deep experience in the development of antibody therapeutics, and our differentiated, industry-leading portfolio of ADCs. We intend to serve detail later this year for our plans for a phase III program.\nWith Pfizer's established presence and global reach, we believe 707 has the potential to become a backbone therapy for multiple solid tumor types where the PD-1 VEGF mechanism could have significant impact. Across our pipeline, we continue to sharpen our focus on programs where the strength of our capabilities gives us the greatest opportunities to address substantial patient needs.\nWe look forward to sharing future updates about our programs. Now, let's move to commercial. Our commercial strategy is unlocking higher productivity and performance across both our US and international divisions. With several of our established brands, we are pleased with our continued market leadership and growth. We deliver another solid quarter for our Vyndamax family with 21% year-over-year operational growth. These products are the foundation of care for patients with a serious heart condition of ATTR cardiomyopathy, and we continue to see strong progress in diagnosing patients and providing broad access.\nWhile we continue to closely monitor the competitive impact of new entrants, we believe the Vyndamax family is differentiated with a strong clinical profile, contributing to continued growth. With Eliquis, we are the clear leader with robust demand in a growing anticoagulant market. Our international commercial teams are driving higher growth versus the market in our key countries, with effective engagement with healthcare professionals to reinforce the favorable profile of this medicine. In the US, the BMS Pfizer Alliance recently announced a new direct-to-patient option for purchasing Eliquis via the Alliance's patient resource, Eliquis 360 support.\nThis option offers an insured, underinsured, or self-pay patient an opportunity to significantly lower out-of-pocket costs for Eliquis. Among some of our recently launched acquired brands, we are seeing strong underlying demand in competitive classes as we work to build expanded access, greater awareness, and loyalty, of course, among healthcare professionals. With Northex, we continue driving strong commercial execution. We are pleased with the performance of new consumer campaigns and greater precision and effectiveness in sharing compelling clinical data with healthcare professionals.\nIn the US, we achieved strong growth in total prescriptions and, with 47% market share, maintained leadership in the oral CGRP class, offset by pressures on net revenues from the impact of the IRA Medical Part D redesign and the 340B program. Internationally, we are achieving strong performance in several key markets where we already have access, and are encouraged by the potential to unlock additional opportunities by continuing to expand access. A new key product in our oncology portfolio is demonstrating strong performance, and we see multiple avenues for future growth.\nOur ADC for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer Padcev achieved high year-over-year operational growth of 38% in the quarter, with growing demand and the one-time favorable impact from entry to a wholesale distribution model for seasonal products. Padcev, in combination with pembrolizumab, has secured market share greater than 50% in first-line LA metastatic UC and is the standard of care first-line treatment. Additionally, we continue to anticipate phase III readouts for Padcev in muscle invasive bladder cancer in two ongoing studies.\nIf successful and approved, we expect a significant expanded opportunity to treat patients with bladder cancer focused on the approximately 28,000 in the US with MIBC, approximately 80% of whom undergo cystectomy. Tivdak had strong 46% year-over-year operational growth with a quarter driven by higher demand in the US and growth in key international markets where we have decided to focus. We believe there are additional market opportunities for Cibinqo in responding to the need among patients with atopic dermatitis. We are seeing the clear impact of recent positive data released for several of our oncology products.\nIt has contributed to strong growth in helping to establish these products as standards of care. Nurtec achieved 48% year-over-year operational growth in the quarter, and we expect continued strength through 2025. It has a compelling efficacy profile supported by the CRAM study, where the median progression-free survival was not reached after five years of follow-up. Nurtec is emerging as a standard of care for patients with first-line ARV-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We saw continued momentum with Braftovi and Mektovi, with 23% year-over-year operational growth in the second quarter.\nResults for the phase III Breakwater trial showed the Braftovi combination regimen doubled median overall survival versus standard of care for treatment-naive patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. This represents a significant advancement for the approximately 4,000 patients diagnosed annually in the US with metastatic colorectal cancer with this mutation. They face a more than twofold greater mortality risk compared to patients with no known BRAF mutation. Xtandi contributed strong 14% operational growth during this quarter.\nDemand is growing for patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer, and it is the top prescribed branded androgen receptor pathway inhibitor. With the presentation of ASCO for long-term overall survival data from the ARCHES trial, Xtandi is now the first and only androgen receptor pathway inhibitor to demonstrate an overall survival benefit at five years in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.\nWe also recently shared positive top-line results from the phase III EMBARK study, making Xtandi the first and only androgen receptor inhibitor-based regimen to demonstrate overall survival benefit in non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence. This contributed to demand growth for Xtandi, and we achieved 27% share in new-to-brand prescription. These positive results indicate how we are continuing to invest and focus in areas where we have leadership and expertise, contributing to ongoing progress with our oncology portfolio.\nThe strong performance in the US and international divisions shows why we remain confident in the commercial strategy we refined more than a year ago. In the quarter, for example, the key market and brand combination that we prioritized in our international divisions are outperforming with strong mid to high single-digit growth across all regions. We will continue to advance this commercial strategy and expect to drive further progress through precision targeting, engagement with patients, and healthcare professionals. With that, I'll turn over to Dave.\nWe will walk through our additional strategic priorities and progress with expanding margins and optimizing capital allocation. Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning. To begin this morning, let me emphasize that our solid financial results are a clear reflection of our disciplined execution and strategic priorities. We remain focused on improving patient outcomes and meeting our financial goals while managing the complexities of the external environment. Our cost improvement initiatives have contributed to greater organizational efficiencies, as demonstrated by our robust operating margins achieved this quarter. Going forward, we expect to improve our cash flow, reduce our debt leverage over time, and increase flexibility across our three capital allocation pillars.\nOur focus remains on creating long-term shareholder value. We will continue to invest in our business for the long term, while prudently returning capital to our shareholders. Now, let me start with our second quarter results. I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities and move to our cost improvement initiatives. I'll finish with a few comments on the macro environment as well as our 2025 guidance. For the second quarter 2025, we recorded revenues of $14.7 billion and an increase of 10% operationally. This increase was largely due to overall growth both in the US and internationally.\nPartially offsetting the increase was an $825 million year-over-year unfavorable impact of higher manufacturer discounts resulting from the IRA Medicare Part D redesign, which took effect in the first quarter of 2025 and overall is largely in line with our expectations. On the bottom line, second quarter 2025 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.78, ahead of our expectations, primarily due to strong top-line performance and our cost management execution. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our refined commercial strategy.\nWe remain committed to prioritizing key products and markets, optimizing the global allocation of our commercial field resources, and concentrating our marketing efforts on high-priority areas. We saw strong contributions across our product portfolio, primarily driven by the Vyndamax family, Comirnaty, Paxlovid, Padcev, and Eliquis, partially offset by declines in Ibrance. Also, I'd like to highlight a significant trend within our portfolio that we expect to fuel the company's top line for the next several years.\nYear-to-date, Pfizer's recently launched and acquired products delivered $4.7 billion in revenue while growing approximately 15% operationally versus last year. We plan to continue to invest behind these two product groups to drive their future performance and help enable the company to largely offset our LOEs over the next several years. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 76%, primarily reflecting the product mix within the quarter.\nLooking at our adjusted gross margin performance over the last two years, we have largely achieved percentages in the mid to upper 70s when adjusting for Comirnaty, which, as you know, has a 50/50 gross profit split with our partner BioNTech. In addition, we believe the expected $1.5 billion savings from phase I of our manufacturing optimization program by the end of 2027 will help bolster gross margins as we transition through the LOE period. Maintaining a strong emphasis on cost management throughout our manufacturing network will continue to be a key priority.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses were $5.8 billion for the second quarter and 8% decline operationally versus last year. Now, looking at the components, adjusted SG&A expenses decreased 8% operationally, primarily reflecting a decrease in marketing and promotional spend for various products as a result of our focused investments and ongoing productivity improvements. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 9% operationally, driven primarily by a decline in spending due to pipeline optimization expected to be reinvested later this year and into next year.\nWe continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management. Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.51, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.78, which benefited from our efficient operating structure, in addition to our effective tax rate, primarily driven by a favorable change in jurisdictional mix of earnings. Now, let me quickly touch on our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return, and making value-enhancing share repurchases.\nIn the first half of 2025, we returned $4.9 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and we invested $4.7 billion in internal R&D. As previously mentioned, maintaining our gross leverage at an appropriate level is a key priority towards improving our capacity for business development. Our gross leverage at the end of the second quarter was approximately 2.7x, which we are now setting as our new target, down from 3.25x. During Q2, we announced the licensing agreement with 3SBio, which closed in July of 2025. Our business development capacity is now approximately $13 billion following the 3SBio deal.\nLastly, first half 2025 operating cash flows at $1.8 billion was tempered primarily by large expected payments in the second quarter, including an approximately $2.1 billion TCJA repatriation tax payment, and our payment to BioNTech for our gross profit split. We expect to see improved cash flows in the back half of this year. Overall, we are focused on maintaining leverage at or below our new target to support a balanced allocation of capital between reinvestment and direct return to our shareholders.\nWe continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management, progressing multiple improvement programs, as we remain focused on driving operating margin expansion over the coming years. We expect to begin realizing initial savings from the phase I manufacturing optimization program in the latter part of this year. As part of our goal to return to pre-pandemic operating margins, we remain on track to deliver on our goal of at least $4.5 billion in cumulative net cost savings from our ongoing cost realignment program by the end of this year.\nAs a reminder, in total, we expect approximately $7.7 billion in savings by the end of 2027 to drive operating efficiencies, strengthening our business with the potential of contributing significantly to our bottom line over the period. Of these savings, approximately $500 million identified in R&D will be reinvested in the pipeline, which we expect by the end of 2026. Now, with that, let me turn to our full year 2025 guidance. The pharmaceutical industry continues to navigate a complex global landscape influenced by rapidly changing proposed trade and tariff policies.\nStrategies to help mitigate the potential impact on our business in the short term have been implemented, and we continue to evaluate opportunities and develop plans, which will help mitigate the potential long-term impact of tariffs on our business and our operations. That said, the company's guidance absorbs the impact of the currently imposed tariffs from China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as potential price changes this year based on the letter received on 31 July 2024 from President Trump. Our non-COVID revenues continue to perform very well operationally, and ahead of our plan.\nIn addition, our guidance assumes favorability to revenues due to foreign exchange rates. As a reminder, our plan assumes that a large majority of our COVID revenues are forecasted in both Q3 and Q4. Given this fact, we believe it is prudent to maintain our full year revenue outlook as we enter the second half of the year. We continue to expect full year 2025 revenues to be in the range of $61 to 64 billion. In addition, we now expect adjusted SG&A to be in the range of $13.1 to 14.1 billion, adjusted R&D to be in the range of $10.4 to 11.4 billion, and our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 13%.\nNow, given our strong performance to date, as well as our outlook, including a favorable impact on foreign exchange, our more efficient cost structure, as well as improvements in our adjusted effective tax rate, we are raising our full year 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.10. This includes absorbing a $0.20 charge for acquired in-process R&D associated with the upfront payment for the 3SBio transaction. Just to clarify, without the 3SBio deal, we would have raised our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.30. Of this amount, approximately 2/3 is due to our strong operational performance and our outlook.\nI will also point out that while we are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance, we are partially de-risking the expected COVID performance in the second half of this year. As a result, our revised full year 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share range is now $2.90 to 3.10 a share. In closing, we will continue to focus on maximizing our product portfolio's value, and driving innovation to strengthen our pipeline. With a stronger balance sheet, we plan to deploy capital more effectively.\nWe will focus on increasing our R&D productivity by deploying AI and digital capabilities, reinvest appropriately to accelerate high-value R&D programs, and pursue new growth opportunities through business development. Additionally, our cost improvement initiatives are beginning to expand operating margins through productivity gains and streamlined processes. I thank you for your attention. I will now open up for Q&A.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOperator, please assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star one to ask a question. We'll take our first question from Truong Nguyen with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nTruong-Chi Nguyen\n\nSenior Compliance Officer, UBS\n\nHi, guys. Just there in your prepared remarks, you noted your guidance absorbs the potential price changes this year based on the letter you received from President Trump on 31 July 2024 that talks about impacting Medicaid with MFM. Does that imply you think something's going to happen this year? If so, what's your broad assumption so we can kind of quantify that hit on your revenues and EPS? Can you perhaps just give us your state of the union on the recent developments with MFN and tariffs? On the CDC recommendations for the vaccines, there was a reduced recommendation in May, a payer pullback for broader adult COVID vaccinations.\nHow are you sizing the 2025-2026 US fall season versus last year? Can you comment on any progress with state mandates or payer negotiations to stabilize that coverage? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Trump. Let me say I know many people would like to get clarity on the MFN situations or the tariff situations. I'm not in a position to provide much clarity, not because we are not discussing. Right now, we are in very active discussions. I discussed at the highest levels for this government. I discussed myself with the president after he sent the letter, me and all the others. We discussed a lot with Secretary Kennedy. We discussed a lot with Dr. Oz, who is responsible for implementing a lot of these things. I would say only that these discussions are extremely productive.\nI think we understand where the president comes from, and we are engaging in a productive way to find a solution. Because we are in active discussions, it's inappropriate for me to start providing more details because I don't want to say things while we're discussing with them. I understand that many others may have questions about that, and I'm not sure I can give more information than what I just told you, but we have a letter that sets a base of what the president wants.\nThe letter asks a lot from us, but we are engaged in productive discussions with them. In general, I'm happy with the way that they listen to us and the way that we are trying collectively to find solutions that, from one hand, would make medics affordable in the US. On the other hand, it will make our industry even more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us. On the tariffs also, I don't have much news to add. We are waiting for the 232 report, and once we have that, we will see how these discussions go.\nAgain, on the tariffs, I had good discussions with Secretary Lutnick, with the US Trade Representative, with Secretary Bessent, and of course with the president, but we have a special relationship through the times of COVID. That's all I can say. I don't know if Dave, you want to add something on what is included and how we think about it.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, I would just say that the underlying strength of our business is allowing us to raise our guidance in the back half of the year. To Albert's point, with the work that's going on across the industry, we're able to come up with a range of scenarios, and we believe that those ranges of scenarios associated with potential timing of all this would allow us to absorb any impact this year based, again, on the underlying strength of our business today and performance today.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nMaybe Aamir, you can comment on the CDC?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Trump, I think your question was largely around commodity. I'll mention the quarter and then our expectations for the season. Comirnaty had a very strong quarter in Q2, and I think that's driven partially by gross net favorability. We've just become much more efficient at managing inventory in the marketplace, and we also saw a continued increase in our market share in the quarter. That's the quarter.\nNow, as it relates to the season, we don't have a crystal ball, but what we are planning for is we anticipate an indication for the 65+ population as well as those under 64 with underlying medical conditions. That largely reflects the dynamic of how people vaccinate in the US today. We also don't anticipate any major changes in coverage by payers for this season. This could have a modest effect on our vaccination rates, but we anticipate having a very strong season. In addition, I think we're very ready to execute against that.\nWe have our supply and distribution capabilities, which are genuinely unmatched. We have a very robust plan for both physicians, as well as patient activation, and we monitor sentiment very closely. We've not seen dramatic changes in intent to vaccinate. We also have very strong contract positions, both in retail and non-retail. We look forward to the commodity season for the fall.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, great. Thanks so much for the questions, and congrats on the quarter. Just two for me. First, on BD and capital allocation, just what's driving the slightly lower target leverage for the company going forward? I think you lowered it by about a half turn or so. I just was looking for any color there.\nJust on the BD approach, is the approach here still to target a couple smaller deals with that $10 to 15 billion of capacity you've previously talked about, or is the thought maybe looking at one larger one? Last really quick one just to slip in was just the recent PD-1 VEGF deal. I know you're going to think about doing combos with some of your ADCs. Will we need to see the phase III data from those ADCs before you move forward, or should we start to think about Pfizer starting development of those programs prior to those readouts? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThese are usually excellent questions, but David can take the first two, and then I think Chris can talk about PD-1 and VEGF.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYes, we've actually improved our target from a leverage perspective down to 2.7x from 3.25x. That's largely because we've improved our cash generation capability over the last a little faster than we anticipated post-closing of the Seagen acquisition. We're now sitting at 2.7x. We will continue to delever over time. If we were to do a PD transaction, we might tick back up over that 2.7x, but our objective is to still get down and continue to delever the balance sheet in the long term. Secondly, yes, most likely we would attend to do a, I'll say, a smaller deal given the fact that our capacity is in the $13 billion zip code at this moment.\nI would expect us more from a smaller perspective from a transaction.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. It is 13.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nIt is 13 only because we have essentially allocated some of 3SBio transaction funds against our PD target.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Chris, how do you think about developing the PD-1 VEGF that I know we closed and we very rapidly executed on a plan even before we could close?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. As you know, we do have ongoing programs with the ADCs, SV, PDL1V, and Padcev, all in phase III. We're not going to wait for readouts from these studies, and we'll start earlier with phase I, II combinations this year, in fact, with those ADCs in combination with 3SBio 707. How we look at 707 is really to be a potential backbone to replace single-agent PD-1, PD-L1. It's got a unique structure, and the preclinical data suggests potential best-in-class regarding high affinity for PD-1 inhibition and also potentially increased anti-angiogenic activity.\nYou've seen the overall response rate in the first-line setting of 65%. We're confident in this molecule across the cancer areas or tumor areas where we have significant capability, including thoracic, GU, and GI, and we'll later this year announce the phase III program for 707.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. I really, my team got me very excited about this molecule, and they have presented to me a very aggressive development plan that they plan to execute starting this year. We will share more news about the plan later in the year when we kick off the execution. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Alex Hammond with Wolfe Research.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for taking our question. I guess one on MFN. Just given your recently announced DTC patient option for purchasing Eliquis, how should you consider the applicability of this program to the remainder of your portfolio?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Alexandra. I think it very much will help. I can tell you that the direct-to-consumer was one of the four things that the letter of President Trump requested from me, from me and everybody else. We think it is a fantastic way to go ahead, so we will work collaboratively to do it. Clearly, Pfizer has good experience from the Pfizer for all, where we have a direct-to-consumer website that has very, very high traffic. Also, now we launched together with our partner BMS, the Eliquis 360, which exactly does what basically President Trump is asking us to do. Actually, I'm sure you've noticed that he tweeted himself.\nHe retweeted actually my tweet about the Eliquis. Also, we have serious discussions in the industry. I have connected, of course, we had the board of all the CEOs that we discussed it, and also myself, I'm connecting very often individually with all the major companies, and they are all ready to roll up the sleeves and execute something like that. It remains to be seen. I don't want to speak more, as I said, because we are in active discussions. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dave, I have a question regarding guidance. It does seem like you had quite a good quarter this quarter, and there is FX tailoring as well as operational reasons here. Wondering what is driving the intake guidance or even not even upping it to the higher end of the range. Just would love to know your thought process in setting this guidance at this point. Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, thank you. I think as we looked at guidance, as I said, we are essentially raising bottom end by $0.30 and then absorbing the $0.20 charge for 3SBio transaction. At the same time, we are looking at our future Q3 and Q4, and we're essentially de-risking some of that. This underlying strength of our business would have us increasing guidance even further from a profit perspective. We, at this point in time, given the volatility that's potentially ahead of us in COVID, think it's prudent to wait, hold, see how Q3 and Q4 come about, and then update as appropriate from that perspective.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Courtney Breen with Bernstein.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, all. Thank you so much for taking the question. A couple for me. The first is on the efficiencies that we're seeing kind of in your operating model, and particularly around SG&A. It'd be great if you're able to kind of give us some extra context around kind of where you are kind of reallocating and investing versus where you're able to pull back, and kind of some more context, detail, and color around that, both within the US and ex-US. Secondarily, you've given us some more detail in terms of M&A and the $13 billion range, but can you give us a little bit more insight on the priorities?\nI know you've talked about kind of the obesity opportunity or cardiometabolic opportunity, and immunology being areas of interest. Can you talk about kind of whether they still rank near the top or how you're seeing kind of opportunities out there that you might be interested in? Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nNo, thank you, Courtney. Let's start with Alexandre to speak about the efficiency in international, and then Aamir can chime in on the US.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks for the questions. You remember about 18 months ago when we started this journey at the international division, we said we will pick our growth driver both from an inline standpoint and the new product. That combination will be different country by country based on the environment, the potential, and the population to treat. That's what we did. We've identified in our top 16 markets those combinations, and then we invested to win in the sense that we looked at the share of voice that we need, and then we reduce our investment everywhere else so that we can win in this area.\nClearly, the growth that we are seeing coming out of that portfolio of assets where we focus is really remarkable because it's not just that we grew 6% at the international level overall, but it's also the quality of the growth. You see that we grew 9% in emerging markets, 9% in China, 7% in Europe. It's kind of across the geography, and it's also across the different category area, right? Specialty care grew 9%, driven by being there. Primary care grew 4%, 6% excluding COVID, driven by Eliquis and our vaccines. Oncology grew 6%, driven by Lorbrena and others.\nClearly, it's really how we reduce the cost around the non-core assets and the non-key countries that will help us double down on the area where we wanted to grow.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Alexandre. Aamir?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nCourtney, I'll give you a couple of different examples. When we implemented our new commercial model at the beginning of last year, we put in place a few fundamentals. One was having everything in one place, and the benefit of scale. For instance, we consolidated to a single agency partner, and that drove major efficiencies across the business. The second thing is we undertook a major resource reallocation exercise, both in terms of the products where we're investing, as well as the channels that we're investing into.\nThirdly, we've just embraced technology and the way that technology can drive efficiency across every aspect of our consumer campaigns, our physician targeting, and also Albert referred to our use of Pfizer for all and investment in the Pfizer brand, which, for instance, in the categories where we've deployed that, that model has resulted in about a 20% decrease in the cost per new NBRX. These are just examples of how we're driving efficiency across the commercial business.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. It is, I think for me, what really pleased me about it is that we are able to reduce our cost and at the same time continue growing the top line, which is the key here. Pfizer was always good in commercial. I do think that we lost a little bit our way during the COVID because the priorities, you can understand, were 100% devotion of the whole company to do something like that. I'm very proud and pleased that we got up to our feet, and we now have developed a commercial machine. It is really honoring the Pfizer tradition and taking it to the next level. I will finish with some questions on the M&A.\nYou asked what will be the range in terms of priorities. In terms of dollars, Dave talked to you. Clearly, with those dollars, probably will be in fewer, smaller transactions rather than one transaction or the remaining capital allocation. Clearly, it will be in the four areas that we are now active, which is the oncology, the vaccines, the internal medicine with cardiometabolic and obesity, and with the INI. On obesity, which is your specific question, clearly we have interest in this area because this is an area that is very big. Science is breaking. A lot of new things are coming out.\nWe have tremendous development capabilities in the primary care type of business, and we have also tremendous commercial opportunities. By the way, in obesity, also there is plenty of offering right now. I mean, in China, China is booming in terms of how many opportunities we have. Our chief strategy officer, Andrew Baum, that is responsible for PD, just came back from a week-long trip to China, and the opportunities are really, really very big. There are key opportunities in the US. There is a good substrate that we can choose, but we will be very disciplined with our capital. We will not overpay.\nWe will pay the real value that the asset is there. With that, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to David Risinger with Leerink.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much. Albert, thank you for helping lead discussions with the administration to ensure the future success of US biopharmaceutical innovation. Since you briefly mentioned competition from China, has Pfizer been helping the administration understand the very strong support that the Chinese government provides to local biotech companies based in China? I ask the question given significant pressures on biotech companies in the United States. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, David, and also thank you for your kind words. I do. I'm very vocal, and I speak at all levels, not only in the administration, but also in the Senate and the House. This is something that unites, I would say, one of the very few things that unites both Democrats and Republicans is their concern about China's emerging superiority in several technological areas, where it is very impressive is in the biotech. I very clearly indicate that this is happening, it's real. I'll give you just some examples.\nIn May, for the first time, Axios reported that the clinical studies in the world right now, China has the leading share, surpassed the US. I did a research myself on publications that are happening from Chinese scientists right now. In CRISPR, for example, just to give one area, 42% of the global publications are coming from China. Actually, in structural biology, which always was their fort, 62% came from China. To end up, they are not doing, they're not stealing patents. They have filed more patents than the US this year.\nThey are protecting very well intellectual property, and they are enhancing access to their local markets, and they are giving tremendous support, monetary support to their biotech ecosystem, which encourages a lot of private money going there. I explained all of that to the administration, and I think they listen. That's why I said before, we will all look to find ways that from one hand, affordability and access of the American patients, on the other hand, to the crown jewel, which is the biotech industry, needs to be supported by the government, by the Congress, so that we can, there's so much you can do to slow down China.\nYou won't slow them down. They are very good. What we can do is to focus to be better than them. That should be our goal. With that, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kerry Halford with Berenberg.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nThank you. A couple of questions for me, please. Firstly, looking at Adcetris to Pfizer, Q2 performance was a little weaker than anticipated. I understand these drugs are perhaps facing increased competitive pressures, but would be interested to hear your strategy for reinvigorating that growth of those Seagen assets, ex-Padcev. Secondly, a question on the guidance, specifically tax and abilities, if I missed this earlier. Dave, what has changed with regard to the tax outlook for this year, and how sustainable is this underlying 13% tax rate going forward? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nDave, you want to start with that, and then I'll make a—\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, just on the tax side, there were some one-time discrete items that allowed us to improve our tax position this year. I would expect going forward with the new tax regs globally that we would be largely closer to the 15% level from a global tax perspective in the long term.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nKerry, thanks for the question. I think your question was largely around the Seagen portfolio and the products. We feel very good about how we integrated those products. As an example, we were able to cross-train all of our field forces, and now we're seeing the benefit of that come through in commercial performance. If I look at Q2 and the entirety of our Seagen commercial portfolio, we grew 15% year-over-year. That was while managing some of the competitive headwinds that you alluded to on Adcetris, which we are starting to see now settle. In particular, we feel very good about the growth in Padcev.\nWe have greater than 50% market share in the first line, and we see headroom to continue to expand that share, especially in the cisplatinum eligible population where we are very focused. It's also important to note that as part of the Seagen transaction, it was not only the inline products, but the portfolio that came with it, which continues to perform very well.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman (BMO Cap\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research, and Senior Biotechnology and Biopharmaceutical Analy",
    "content2": "Thank you so much for taking my question. Kind of a follow-up to the prior question. A year and a half into the integration of Seagen, and really aside from Padcev, what do you believe are the two or three assets that have the potential to really drive a positive IRR for the $42 billion or so that you spent? Kind of a follow-up there is what part of the market could SV capture in non-small cell lung cancer if it went eventually approved? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I was pleased to comment. Let's start that there are four main assets that when we acquired the company, they were around $2 billion, even less of revenues, but they will grow by year 2030 to $10 billion. Now, of course, the value was not only on that. The value was mainly in the platform of the ADC that we got together with the intellectual property, the capability, the people, and the assets. I would ask Chris to comment on the most important things that are coming out in the short term, medium term, and long term from CSIS.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. In the short term, Padcev and the readouts for the muscle invasive bladder cancer studies, as you recall, the current indication is 18,000 patients. The new indications will be up to 28,000. There's both platinum eligible and platinum ineligible, and we expect those readouts in the next six months. Potentially, they could change the standard of care for this population. This next wave of studies we've started, phase III trials in SV, supportive drug vedotin. The second line study is now fully recruited. In fact, it recruited much quicker than we expected.\nIn the second line space, what we've seen so far in the phase I study in the late line population with a 31% overall response rate and a median overall survival, albeit a single line experience, of 16.3 months. That gives us confidence in SV. It's a predominant payload. What we've seen with the other studies with a predominant payload, including with Tivdak and Padcev, was this potentially synergistic activity when we combine it with an anti-PD-1. SV plus pembrolizumab has now been combined. As you know, overall, we've seen a response rate of approximately 60%.\nIn the population specifically, that's TPS high or PD-L1 high expression, all patients so far in the phase I trial have responded. That obviously is very favorable to what you would expect from pembrolizumab alone. The next molecule, PDL1V, that's again another first-in-class molecule. We're accelerating that into a phase III program for head and neck cancer, where we've seen a response rate just shy of 60% in the combination with pembrolizumab. There's a whole new group of ADCs coming with a TOP1 payload, including a follow-up to Adcetris.\nThey currently have two or three of these molecules showing highly encouraging data in phase I and will update you in the future about those.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. As I said, we are confident that not only will we recuperate the investment with a good return in the season, but I think this is transforming our oncology portfolio and business. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Carter Gould with Cantor.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biopharmaceutical Equity Research Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to go back to the policy side. I guess, Albert, should investors have any expectation around a comprehensive deal that addresses the president's objectives across MFN and tariffs, but also addresses the industry's concerns around enforcing IP protection, compounding, pill parity, IRA implementation? Vyndamax put up a solid quarter year on year, but this is sort of the fourth quarter in a row where sequential growth was more muted or meager. Is Vyndamax US growth behind us? In answering that, can you help frame the push-pulls between price and competition? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Let me give a brief answer to the policy. Look, I don't know. We are in very active discussions. You know that the president is impatient, so she wants the results quickly. We also want to come to a resolution quickly because I want to offer certainty to all of us, and all of you, as much as you can have in this period of time. Are we going to, are we discussing, in addition to all the things that are related with MFN and tariffs, also things that are related with PBM reform, with 340B, with the pill penalty? Absolutely. You know that the PBM reform is universally accepted that needs to happen.\nThere was a bipartisan deal, and there is clear indication the president has spoken so many times about the middleman. Also with the pill penalty, he has spoken about it, and also Secretary Kennedy spoke about it. Also we are working on it. Of course, the 340B has become a major, major problem. Right now, the 340B is expected to exceed $62 billion this year. It's a program that has become bigger than Medicare and Medicaid combined. That's all at prices that all of that is valuable goes from us out there to, let's say, hospitals.\nThis value is not passed to the patients because they mark up those products in tremendous amounts, way more than you see in Cardin. We can't afford that. We are discussing, we are explaining. It's more complicated, the 340B, because it involves hospitals. The program is very good for the small hospitals that it was intended for. This is not about not having 340B. It's about not having an abuse in the system. I mean, you want to take the next question.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nI'll speak quickly about Vyndamax in the US and then touch on international too. In the US, yes, we had a very strong quarter. We had 15% year-over-year growth. We maintained momentum and performance versus Q1. There's a lot that's going on in this market right now. That performance is a function of improving diagnosis as well as improving favorability dynamics. We continue to lead in the face of two competitors coming into that market, both in terms of total market share, but also importantly, lead in terms of first-line treatment naive patient share.\nWe've got good TRX momentum, and that's influenced the growth. Abemaciclib is taking some first-line share, and it's a little too early to tell about the dynamics of Brukinsa, and we'll keep a close eye on that for the second half of the year. We do expect continued TRX volume growth, but there will be GTN pressure on US performance. That's a function of both the Medicare Part D design, but also a result of contracting to maintain access for Vyndamax, both in Medicare and commercial, where we've maintained 90% access for the brand. We do expect those dynamics to impact our sequential growth in the back half of this year.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes, for international, we have a very strong dynamic. We have grown 30% for the quarter, but actually, since the beginning of the year, we have grown our patient treatment by 50%. It's clearly what I was describing at the beginning in terms of focus on the key assets where we think we can have an impact. This one is clearly the demonstration of our focus on execution. Moving forward, we think we're going to continue to grow on this product for three reasons. First, the diagnosis rate in international in most of our key markets is still significantly below what we have in the US, and we normally see in this type of disease.\nTwo, the access. Access takes a lot of time in international. You need to negotiate price and access in every single country. It took us five years just to get to where we are. Competition will have to follow the same timeline to get to the type of access that we get. Just to illustrate my points, we just unlocked UK and Australia at the end of last year, and we just unlocked South Korea at the beginning of this quarter. To give you a sense, it takes time. Now that we have access, we are unlocking the potential of those patients being untreated.\nFinally, we think that the profile of our product and the experience of our key centers will help us continue to establish the standard of care that we have developed with these assets. We are very confident with the potential future growth of Vyndamax.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I'm very impressed with the performance of Vyndamax in international and the way that we were not counting on that product before. Now, suddenly, we see a very big thrive. We're not counting in international, I mean, mainly US. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Asad Haider with Goldman Sachs.\n\nAsad Haider\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Albert, just one more, if I may, on the policy front. Given the comments you just made and then triangulating those back to your comments on MFN, that it's now quantified and reflected into guidance to some extent, maybe just talk about what could cause large swings to those expectations from here, or is your high-level view that we are now getting more granular around a central and potentially narrower range of outcomes, directionally speaking? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nClearly, I mean, our team is all over modeling several scenarios. There is no scenario that we have not assessed. There is no scenario that we have not built mitigation plans. There is no scenario that we haven't assigned the probability of success. The truth is that we don't know what will be because all of that are right now under active discussion. Even if I have some ideas where we should increase probabilities of happening and where we should decrease probabilities of happening, it's not appropriate now in the middle of the discussions and negotiations. You don't open the cards, right? I can't really do that. Thank you. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Umer Raffat with Evercore.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll spare the MFN question, but I did want to ask, Albert, I feel like some of the points you're making on this call regarding the China biotech ecosystem could possibly resonate with the administration. I guess how's, and I'm not even talking Pfizer specifically, but the industry broadly has been very active with a lot of outlicensing transactions to find the next layer of innovation. I guess is the administration pushing back with sort of balancing those two? Separately, on your oncology side, I feel like this B6A trial in lung will obviously be very, very important.\nI was very intrigued to see that you shrunk the sample size from 670 down to 470, which presumably signals increased confidence. My question is, did you take any interim look to see how the effect size is tracking? Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nLet me take the China one, and then I ask the press, of course, to comment on the oncology. Look, I mean, there is a lot of sensitivity in the Senate and in the House about everything that is happening in China, right? I have to say the sensitivity is way more on things that we transfer there, technology that we transfer, than vice versa, things that we take from them to develop them and manufacture them in the US. For example, our deal, I'm sure that, and I discussed the Chinese deal that we did with members of Congress, many members of Congress. I explained that we did not give anything.\nWe took their science and the license to develop. We will do it globally, not in China. To manufacture it, we will do it in the US, not in China. To commercialize it, we will do it in the whole world, actually not in China yet because we do not have the rights yet. I think less sensitivity on these two ways. Do not take me wrong, China is something that is very high on the radar of the political life of the US, and we need to be careful with that. Now, let's go, Chris.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nThanks for the question, Umer. Usually for studies, we recalculate effect size or study size based on emerging data from ongoing phase I to trials. We did not unblind, and there is no unblinding of ongoing phase III programs.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOkay, thank you. You saw I knew that you would not share much. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.\n\nRajesh Kumar\n\nHead of European Life Sciences and Healthcare Equity Research, HSBC\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on you said you'll absorb the potential impact from the letters this year. Can you confirm that if there were tariffs, etc., you can say the same about next year as well? I know you don't have a guidance, but in terms of how prepared you are with inventory, etc., and the pricing dynamics, do you think current consensus sort of captures the effect for next year? The second one is on the balance sheet. Clearly, you are going with a lower financial gearing target, and in effect, that gives you a bit more leeway on a lot of things.\nWhen you think of capital allocation, do you think you need to add more types of assets in oncology, or would most of the balance sheet capacity be deployed in obesity, immunology, other areas? That is, if you have to deploy capital in oncology or different indications or different mechanisms you still need to add, would you be comfortable going over the 2.7x leverage?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Let's start with Dave, and then we will move to Andrew also.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. As it relates to future years, 2026 and 2027, no, we're not confirming or discussing the implication of tariffs or MFN on those out years. Once we have definitive information and knowledge, we'll come back and share that with everyone. Secondly, just from a PD perspective, and others can comment on this as well, we have lowered our target or improved our target to 2.7x because we are already at 2.7x. It's hard to have a target that we've exceeded so dramatically because our business has done so well.\nIf an opportunity were to come along that made sense for us from a PD perspective, obviously, we would outstrip the target. It would be higher, just like we did with Seagen, and we'd work to get us back down to 2.7x over time. Maybe to Albert's point earlier, from a PD perspective, we're interested across the four areas in which we focus today, and we'll continue to evaluate assets on the market in all of those four areas.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAndrew?\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nEVP and Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, just to add to Dave's comments. Look, I think every potential licensing deal or acquisition is value-driven, although there is obviously some value in diversification. We've historically been very active through Seagen and more recently through Aspire on oncology. However, as you know, Pfizer has a strong commercial heritage with significant strength in areas such as internal medicine and INI. Obviously, we've got landmark drugs in those areas. We believe we have a right to will. If the right opportunity comes up at the right price, you can be sure that we're going to pursue it.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Andrew. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Tim Anderson with Bank of America.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I have a question on IRA. You guys have two drugs where prices are being negotiated in the current year for implementation in 2027. That's Ibrance and Xtandi. One fear that at least we've had is that the new administration may press harder for bigger discounts versus last year, potentially just to make a point in general, not just for Pfizer products. You're in the midst of those negotiations. Any color you can provide, such as how those discussions are lining up with what you expected before those negotiations began?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nLook, as you said, we're in the middle of this negotiation. Again, for the same reason, I can actually, it's not allowed by law to disclose aspects of the negotiation. I would say something. We have two products, as you said, for 2027. Both of them are losing patent in 2027. For us, of course, we try to achieve the best we can in the negotiations of the prices. The hit on us is very small. The MMV is very small because it's really a few months of exclusivity. It depends on the product, right? Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nSenior Pharmaceutical Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Two questions. The first one, I apologize, is on MFN. You've quantified the assumed impact of MFN in 2025, but you won't share your estimate. I assume it's a big number, well above $500 million for Q4 alone and maybe several times that, which implies a strikingly high number for 2026. I'm just wondering whether you would walk that number down. Second, for Dave, you noted the positive underlying operational performance year to date. You also noted the positive inflection in FX year to date. Curious how the COVID expectations have changed.\nIt seems they must have come down since revenue guidance is flat or unchanged, or something else in the business turned in a little bit light. Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, maybe on the COVID side, I don't know that our expectations at this moment have changed, but we still have a lot yet to go in Q3 and Q4. As I think about our future projections, we're still internally working to achieve our number. As my guidance reflects, we've now de-risked some of that delivery in Q3 and Q4. I don't think anything's changed. We just know that COVID by itself, because of the nature of that business, will always be a little bit more sensitive, a little bit more fluid, and harder to predict quarter over quarter. This is just allowing us to de-risk that a bit.\nOn the MFN perspective, we're not going to comment on those numbers at this point. Thank you, though.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThe final question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nBiotechnology and Pharmaceuticals Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two on the pipeline. Just for abemaciclib, was wondering if we'll get an update from the phase II study on PFS, potentially at San Antonio later this year. I know you've already committed moving into phase III, but I don't think we've seen anything on durability there. On Lorbrena, any thoughts about exploring that in the adjuvant setting? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nChris.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nThank you for the question. Abemaciclib, you're correct. As we stated, we're focusing now on the first line space and focusing with CAP6 for second line. We remain very confident in abemaciclib on all the data we've seen. The study, the first line trial in positive HER2 negative breast cancer, is recruiting extremely well, in fact, four times faster than we actually planned or predicted. We've not disclosed the date when we will show the data on the second line, but we'll keep you posted on that. For Lorbrena, there's no current plan for an adjuvant study.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Thank you for your attention.I want to say that I'm very pleased with the execution of this team in terms of the target that we have set. I would describe Pfizer right now as a company with a very strong floor and no ceiling. We plan to maintain the prudent way of allocating capital, the focus on execution, the relentless focus on our pipeline productivity, and big assets, and improving our margins by the use of technology, focus, and simplification of our business process. Thank you very much, and enjoy your summer to those that did not take vacation like me.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Good morning and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of 2025 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions.\nMembers of our leadership team will also be available for the Q&A session. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter as we continue to execute with focus and discipline on our strategic priorities.\nWe are strengthening our R&D organization in our efforts to advance our pipeline and productivity. We are maximizing the value of key products in our commercial portfolio, and we are improving operating margins with our continued progress in making our company more efficient. In the current volatile external environment, the underlying strength of our business and strong relationships with government leaders across the world help us navigate with agility. While we continue to engage and plan for contingencies, we are focusing day to day on what we can do to move our business forward. I want to emphasize our continued confidence that we are well positioned to enhance shareholder value. Now, I will turn to our top strategic priority in 2025: improving R&D productivity as we advance our pipeline with sharpened focus. We are intensifying our rigorous commercial assessment and portfolio prioritization from early clinical development.\nThis means we will be disciplined in managing our portfolio, directing investment and attention to potential blockbuster or mega blockbuster, and scrutinizing the total number of assets under development. Our Danuglipron announcement earlier this month demonstrates our commitment to this approach. This continued the development of Danuglipron, one of our candidates in our obesity portfolio, although difficult was the right decision for the company. Going forward, we are committed to building our cardiometabolic pipeline, including obesity, by advancing internal programs such as our GIPR antagonist, and pursuing external opportunities that could include partnerships or acquisitions. We will continue to be disciplined as we move through key decision points for our pipeline or our business development targets. We believe we have the potential to address significant patient needs with differentiated approaches that focus on supporting optimal weight management and related conditions.\nWe will work on potential medicines and combination regimens that could be more accessible, better tolerated, easier to dose, and more effective in supporting the right effects on body composition and muscle mass. In addition to sharpening our focus in internal medicine, since expanding his role in January as our Chief Scientific Officer, Chris Boshoff has moved both thoughtfully and quickly in reshaping our R&D organization to also center on oncology, vaccines, and inflammation immunology in addition to internal medicines. Chris has enhanced his leadership team with some terrific additions, who are recognized as leaders in their field. Patricia Cavazzoni is our new Chief Medical Officer, Jeff Legos is our new Chief Oncology Officer, and Jim List is our new Chief Internal Medicine Officer.\nThese leaders each bring many years of experience, deep expertise, and proven track record in guiding the discovery, development, and approval of practice-changing therapies, and they are an excellent addition to our already strong cast of leaders in R&D. We are on track for a strong year of anticipated pipeline catalysts in 2025. We are making progress towards anticipated multiple key milestones, including at least four regulatory decisions, up to nine phase three readouts, and a significant series of pivotal program starts. With one of our key oncology programs, we are aiming to bring forward what could represent the first potential treatment advancement in more than 30 years for patients with BCG-naive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We are encouraged by a positive result of the pivotal phase three CREST trial of sasanlimab in combination with BCG, a current standard of care.\nWe presented the full data from this study this past weekend at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is a condition predominantly treated by urologists. In multiple market research and focus group studies, urologists stated a significant preference for a subcutaneous PD-1 because it can be used in their practices and eliminates the need to refer their patients to infusion centers. We also anticipate meaningful readouts this year for Padcev and Elrexfio. Padcev already is a core therapy in our oncology portfolio. Padcev plus pembrolizumab is the most prescribed first-line treatment for locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer in the US. We are working toward more than doubling the total addressable patient population in the US for Padcev with potentially registrational interim data we expect this year from ongoing pivotal studies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\nWe are also working to reach a significantly expanded population of patients with multiple myeloma. We are anticipating a phase three readout this year for Elrexfio in a study for double-class exposed relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. If successful and approved, this would more than double the addressable population versus the currently approved indication. In addition to the increased addressable population, moving to earlier lines of therapy is expected to increase the duration of treatment and potentially create an inflection point in Elrexfio's growth. We expect to begin pivotal studies for our investigational PD-1 Vedotin ADC later this year. This will be for first-line metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and second-line non-small cell lung cancer. We also anticipate a first-line pivotal study start for SV, Sigvotatug Vedotin.\nThis is a novel integrin beta-6 targeting Vedotin ADC that, if successful and approved, has the opportunity to change the standard of care globally for IBC-expressing tumors. Both these ADCs, PD-L1 V and SV, are potential first-in-class ADCs using a Vedotin payload that elicits immunogenic cell death, and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, demonstrates significant results. Early data for PD-L1 V and SV in combination with pembrolizumab are highly encouraged. With both ADCs, we are targeting non-small cell lung cancer, the most frequently diagnosed cancer globally, and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Lung cancer represents a substantial area of patient need, and a growing market with the highest projected CAGR in oncology through 2030. In vaccines, another of our priority therapeutic areas, we see opportunities to enhance and augment our strong positions in the market.\nWe are also planning a potential registrational study in adults later this year with our fourth-generation PCV candidate. With our fourth- and fifth-generation PCV candidates, we believe we can build on our leadership in the industry. Our fourth-generation candidate covers 25 serotypes, including potentially improved immunogenicity for serotype 3, which is one of the largest remaining contributors of disease. We are also working to accelerate progress with our fifth-generation candidate, which is in preclinical development and covers over 30 serotypes. As we continue to scrutinize the number of programs we are actively advancing, we will have opportunities to accelerate or add others to help address significant patient needs. One example is the recent accelerated start of a pivotal study for Nurtec for menstrually related migraine, which is estimated to impact more than half of women who experience migraine.\nWe look forward to providing future updates about our pipeline progress as we continue to sharpen our focus on our most meaningful programs in prioritized therapeutic efforts. Commercial excellence is our key categories in another 2025 strategic priority. More than a year ago, we decided to separate the US and international operations. Under the leadership of Aamir Malik, our Chief US Commercial Officer, and Alexandre Djiane, our Chief International Commercial Officer, we refined our commercial model to bring heightened focus, helping us strategically prioritize our most impactful products and regions. It is working well. In the US, our team demonstrated focus, the strength of our key products, and continuous improvement and execution. In international, we are back to operational growth in the first quarter across all parts of the division.\nThis was the result of prioritization and discipline focus on key growth drivers to maximize return and accelerate new product penetration there. Our performance was strong both in the US and international markets across several key products, including the Vyndaqel family, Nurtec, Padcev, and Lorbrena. Our Vyndaqel family of products had robust growth in the quarter, though we are seeing the impact of competition with a new market entrant, and we anticipate this will continue through the year. We will work towards maintaining our market-leading position that has come from six years of establishing credibility and expertise with the cardiology community. Our team remains committed to addressing high unmet patient needs by helping to improve diagnosis and ensuring appropriate patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy receive treatment. Demand continued to strengthen for Nurtec, with revenue growing 40% operationally in the quarter.\nOur commercial teams effectively engaged with healthcare professionals, and we were pleased with strong outperformance of our newly launched consumer campaigns. We are pleased with the continued strength also of our oncology portfolio. Padcev, for example, grew 25% operationally, driven by increased market share in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer. Lorbrena grew 39% operationally as we continue to see strong adoption, with its emerging as a potential first-line standard of care for patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. INI is another key commercial category for Pfizer, and we are drawing on our extensive experience in launching medicines in this therapeutic area. Familiarity among healthcare professionals continued to improve for Cibinqo, which grew 42% operationally in the quarter. Our commercial team is continuing to work towards increased patient access for this JAK inhibitor for patients aged 12 and up with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.\nWith Litfulo, we are encouraged by the growth we have seen today. We will seek to further unlock access to this advanced systemic treatment for patients with severe alopecia areata. This highlights how we are positioned to further expand and sustain our performance trajectory among our key brands. Now I will turn it today to speak about the other two strategic priorities.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning. I'll begin this morning by reinforcing the fact that our solid financial results demonstrate our strong executional focus. We continue to concentrate on driving positive patient outcomes and delivering on our financial commitments while navigating an ever-complex external environment. Our productivity improvement programs continue to drive a more efficient organization, enhanced by our strong operating margins in the quarter.\nGoing forward, we expect to improve our cash flows, reduce our debt leverage, and have more flexibility for our three capital allocation pillars. Our focus remains on creating long-term shareholder value. We will continue to invest in our business for the long term, while prudently returning capital to our shareholders. Now, first, let me start with our first cut of results. Second, I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities, and then I'll touch upon our cost improvement initiatives. I'll finish up with a few comments on the macro environment and our 2025 guidance, which we are reaffirming today. For the first quarter of 2025, we recorded revenues of $13.7 billion, a decline of 6% operationally. The decline was largely due to lower Paxlovid revenues, in part due to last year's one-time Paxlovid revenue credit recorded in Q1 2024. In addition, US.\nRevenues were tempered by changes in the IRA Medicare Part D redesign, which took effect in the first quarter. Partially offsetting the decline was growth in several inline products in the US, and overall growth internationally. On the bottom line, we reported first quarter 2025 diluted EPS of $0.52 a share and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.92, ahead of our expectations due to overall strong gross margin and cost management performance. Our performance continues to show that our refined commercial approach is working. We continue to focus on key products and geographies, the deployment of our commercial field resources globally, and the continued optimization of our marketing resources into key priority areas. We saw strong contributions across our product portfolio, primarily driven by the Vyndaqel family, Comirnaty, Padcev, Nurtec, and Lorbrena, which were more than offset by declines in Paxlovid, Eliquis, Xeljanz, and Ibrance.\nAdjusted gross margin for the quarter expanded to approximately 81%, primarily a result of favorability in crude royalties, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Focus on cost management across our manufacturing network will remain a priority. Total adjusted operating expenses were $5.2 billion for the first quarter of 2025, a 12% decline operationally versus last year. Now, looking at the components, adjusted SIA expenses decreased 12% operationally, primarily reflecting our ongoing productivity improvements, driving a decrease in marketing and promotional spend for various products, as well as lower spending in corporate enabling functions. Adjusted R&D expenses also decreased 12% operationally, driven primarily by a decline in spending due to our pipeline optimization efforts expected to be reinvested later this year and into next year. We continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management.\nQ1 reported diluted earnings per share were $0.52, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.92, which benefited from our efficient operating structure, in addition to favorable global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years, as well as a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. With that, now let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at the appropriate level of financial return, and making value-enhancing share repurchases. In Q1, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $2.2 billion in our internal R&D, and completed business development activity as expected was minimal. We achieved our 3.25x gross leverage target at the end of 2024, a key priority towards improving our capacity for business development.\nIn addition, the monetization of our Haleon investment has contributed to our improved cash position. As a reminder, in January, we monetized approximately $3 billion of our Haleon shares, and in March, we monetized the last tranche of our Haleon shares, receiving approximately $3.3 billion in net cash proceeds. With this sale, we have now fully exited our ownership in Haleon. Overall, our objective remains to deliver our balance sheet over time, which will further support our return to a more balanced allocation of capital between reinvestment and direct return to our shareholders. We continue to be disciplined on our operational expense management, progressing multiple improvement programs as we remain focused on driving long-term margin improvement over the coming years.\nWe continue to expect initial savings from phase one of our manufacturing optimization program in the latter part of this year, with approximately $1.5 billion in savings from phase one expected by the end of 2027. In addition, we are progressing the evaluation of other strategies to improve our network structure and product portfolio, respectively. As part of our goal to return to pre-pandemic operating margins, we remain on track to deliver on our goal of at least $4.5 billion in cumulative net cost savings from our ongoing cost realignment program by the end of this year. Today, we've announced our expectation that this program will deliver an additional $1.2 billion in net savings, primarily in SIA, and in part by leveraging digital tools, including automation and AI, as well as simplification of our business processes.\nThe savings are expected to be fully realized by the end of 2027. Furthermore, we have identified additional opportunities to drive improvements in productivity and operational efficiency in our R&D organization, again through enhanced digital enablement, as well as automation. We expect approximately $500 million in savings associated with these efforts to be realized by the end of 2026, with the savings reinvested within our R&D program. In total, we expect approximately $7.7 billion in savings by the end of 2027 to drive operational efficiency, strengthening our business with the potential of contributing significantly to our bottom line over this period. Now, let me turn to our full year 2025 guidance. As you are aware, the pharmaceutical industry is currently navigating a complex global landscape shaped by rapidly evolving trade and tariff policies.\nTo help navigate this fluid environment, we've established a cross-functional team to analyze a range of potential outcomes while developing strategies to help us mitigate the potential impact to our business in both the short, as well as the long term. These actions include the management of current inventory levels in certain jurisdictions, leveraging our domestic manufacturing footprint, and the potential production of certain API and products in the US. Should we be impacted by further tariffs in the future, we will assess the impact of these policies enacted and provide information at the appropriate time. Let me now spend just a few minutes on our 2025 guidance, which remains unchanged and, to be clear, does not include the potential impact of future changes in trade and tariff policies.\nWe expect total company full year 2025 revenues to be in the range of $61 to 64 billion and full year 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to 3 a share, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio, and our focus disciplined on cost management. As we finish Q1 with earnings strength and excluding the potential impact related to future trade changes, we are currently trending toward the upper end of our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range. In closing, let me emphasize several key aspects of our business. We will continue our focus on executing to maximize the commercial value of our product portfolio, and we remain committed to driving value, creating innovation, while strengthening our pipeline. Additionally, our cost improvement programs are set to deliver operating margin expansion.\nExpected productivity gains will be driven by leveraging our digital capabilities and simplifying our business processes. Our improved balance sheet sets the stage for more balance and enhanced capital deployment, focused on creating value for our shareholders. With that, I will now turn it back over to Albert for Q&A.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Operator, please assemble the queue and let's start the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star 2. Once again, that is Star 1 to ask a question. We'll go first to Vamil Divan with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Investments\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two if I could. One, just appreciate your prepared remarks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe mentioned the dividend, your commitment to maintaining and growing the dividend over time. I think we've just gotten sort of increasing questions about this from investors over the last few months, especially with some of the tariff uncertainty and how that might impact cash flows. Obviously, you're not talking about maybe getting more active on the business development side. Maybe just to reinforce that one more time, if nothing else, just the level of commitment you have there. Even if there is an impact from the tariff side, you still feel comfortable in being able to maintain and grow that. My second question is about.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nDave, Dave, you will. Go ahead, Ramin. Sorry. Okay.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Investments\n\nYes, I just had one other, if I could, just on the COVID business and just your views, obviously, understand the nuances around the Paxlovid sales this quarter and, obviously, vaccine sales will come late in the year. Do you still see that business being relatively stable this year relative to last year, or has that changed from what your expectation was at the beginning of the year? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Ramin. Dave will tell you about dividend, and then Aamir and Alexandre about the\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nCOVID business. For me, all clearly consistent with my prepared remarks, the dividend remains a critical component and a key component of our capital allocation strategy. As you can tell, we've been very focused on improving the operating margin and performance of our business, thus improving our cash flow yield over time.\nThis is all in support of all of our capital allocation priorities, with dividend being a key component of that.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Let's start with Aamir.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks, Aamir. You asked about Paxlovid. Paxlovid utilization trends very closely to infection rates, and we see a 50% treatment rate and close to an 80% fulfillment rate when there is infection. We've set up a very good commercial model to do that. I think what you saw in Q1 was largely the function of the fact that we have a lower winter wave, but we still treated over 750,000 patients, starting the year with about 100,000 a week and tapering off at around 35,000 to 40,000. While these numbers are lower than the consensus numbers, they're very much in line with our expectations and what we track for the business.\nWhat we've seen in multiple years now is that over the course of the year, you have two COVID waves, one in the summer and one in the winter. The peaks and valleys and the timing of those vary, but we have had consistently multiple waves. Our baseline assumption is that we will have those waves this year as well and that we will be able to execute our business, including Pax utilization in the way that I described, consistent with those waves. We've also set up a model where we can successfully transition the Medicare patients out of USG and into our traditional Medicare model beginning 1 March 2024. We can't predict exactly what the timing and shape of those waves will be, but we're ready to execute again.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nChief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, international, I will start with Comirnaty.\n\nOperator\n\nAs you know, international community is bigger than Paxlovid. On Comirnaty, we beat consensus quite nicely by $130 million, essentially driven by execution. As you know, in international, December is in the Q1 2025. In December, we continue to execute our contracts in the UK and in Europe. In a competitive setup, like in Japan, we maintain very strong leadership there until the end of the vaccination. Now, as we move into Q2 and Q3, we will start actually shipping our vaccine into 1,001/2 countries where vaccination campaign is going to start, in particular in Brazil, where we won the two-year contract for adults, which is a very important vaccination country. Now, when we talk about Paxlovid, you know Paxlovid is smaller internationally, and we performed as we were expected.\nWe have now Paxlovid commercially sold in 49 markets, so there is no more advance purchasing phenomenon. It is really associated with utilization. The point is, in international, we have actually low utilization compared to the US, so we still need to do some work in terms of utilization and treatment.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Alexandre. Operator, please the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, BMO Financial Group\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I did not want to touch on the reasons for the Danuglipron discontinuation, but I more want to look forward. As you think about a potential obesity asset, what are some key aspects of the profile that you're looking for, either from an internal perspective or potentially externally? Thank you so much. Let's start with Chris and then go to Andrew. Thanks very much. Thanks for the question.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes, as Albert has stated, Danuglipron was the right decision for Pfizer based on totality of data. As we stated previously, a single asymptomatic participant in a dose optimization study with rapid dose titration experienced a potential drug-induced liver injury, which recovered rapidly after treatment discontinuation. Although we're not 100% sure this is due to Danuglipron, the risk was high enough for us to discontinue the program while still being committed to obesity and employing our global resources for other opportunities. Cardiovascular metabolic is one of our core strategies within internal medicine, an area with significant remaining unmet need. Just a reminder, for obesity alone, up to 60% of patients discontinue current approved medicines after 24 months.\nWe will continue to apply our global capabilities to advance our pipeline of differentiated oral medicines, including our oral GIPR antagonist currently in phase two, and advancing our preclinical portfolio to the clinic. We believe the future will be more fragmented based on differentiated or unique combinations, with an emphasis on tolerability, accessibility, and convenience. The future will also become more personalized based on combinations addressing specific diseases associated with obesity and with metabolic dysfunction, including neurology, cardiovascular, and respiratory. Andrew?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, I mean, I think Chris gave you a fairly full answer. I would just underline that although you referenced obesity, the role of incretins and potentially other modalities or targets more broadly needs not to be underestimated. Obviously, this extends beyond cardiovascular medicine, and we're interested in all the potential opportunities that exist with these molecules.\n\nOperator\n\nIn terms of which assets or which portfolio of assets we're seeking to build, I think there's two axes. Number one, obviously, is clinical differentiation. Albert referenced some of the ways you can do that in terms of scheduling, tolerability, muscle preservation, but there are others too. Then separately, there's commercial differentiation, which really references the indications that we pursue. I hope that gives you some idea of our direction of travel. When we have something to say, you'll be the first to know.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nGood to know. Thank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Tim Anderson with Bank of America.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Corporation\n\nHi, thank you. I have a question on tariffs. I figured if anyone's close to this, it's probably Pfizer, Albert, seeing as you're chairman of pharma.\nIf sector-specific tariffs come through, do you think that's likely to be through the 232 investigation route, or do you think it could still happen somehow through the IEPA route? To me, it seems like it would be 232, not everyone agrees. Your best sense of timing for when everyone might have more information from the administration. Last question, is it an absolute pipe dream to think that sector-specific tariffs might really only be applied to countries that could, in fact, pose a threat to national security like China? It's hard to see Ireland being an enemy of the country.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Tim, I would agree with the last comment that you made also. Let me tell you where we stand with tariffs.\nFirst of all, we had on 2 April an executive order that basically placed tariffs across the board to everything we can see or feel or dream, except two things: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Clearly, there is risk going forward, but it's a very, very different ballgame. If you are part of the tariffs and you hope to be excluded, then if you are not part and you try not to be included. On 14 April, the administration made even more clear what is their concern with the pharmaceutical sectoral investigation. They made it clear by launching it through a 232, which, as you pointed out, is an investigation that is connected with national security threats. This is not something new. The first Trump administration had expressed serious concerns about several essential medicines that they are made outside the US. The Biden continued with his concerns.\nActually, the Trump administration had also a list that had created with those medicines in the first one. Now, with the second Trump administration, not only through the 232, but through my discussions with the highest level of the government, they are confirming that this is their primary concern. I think it's legitimate. I think no country wants to have critical medicines produced outside of the country. Particularly, they don't want to have critical medicines produced in countries that tensions are high or can be escalated. There is, I think, a very clear distinction in the way that they look at it in terms of what products they are talking about. There is a very clear distinction as to what comes from friendly countries or what comes from adversary countries.\nWith all of that in mind and knowing that we are engaging and we have very productive discussions with all the secretaries that are involved and the White House staff that are involved in that, I'm cautiously optimistic, as I said, given the data that we have not been there. I hope that we will weather it successfully. We will work with the administration to make sure that their concern on national security will be addressed in the best possible way. I think that was the only question, right? Yes. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Securities Inc\n\nThank you. Two questions. The first one's very similar to the one that Tim just asked.\nAlbert, given your unique insights into the thinking in Washington, do you think MFN legislation is only the most remote of possibilities or even simply not going to happen? Secondly, what is the percent utilization of the US plants? It's great to have this vast network in the US, but if there's little or no excess capacity or flexibility, then it's a more limited advantage. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much for both questions. Look, on the MFN, first of all, I can't speak about what are the intentions of the government, but I can comment on what I have seen so far. The president issued an executive order that was focusing on pharmaceuticals that was very, very expensive, so covered a lot of topics over there. MFN was not mentioned over there.\n\nOperator\n\nOn the contrary, what was mentioned over there was the pill penalty that he instructed so that we will find ways to resolve. What was mentioned over there was PBM reform, and transferring of rebates to the base. What was mentioned over there was 340B reform. I would say that clearly, one can say that when the president issues an executive order, then you can read into what are the priorities of the administration. I think that so far, the way I have seen it, it is the pill penalty, it is the 340B, it is the PBM reform, and it is to lower the cost for the patients. Right now in the US, the patients, they are paying disproportionately out of pocket for their medicines compared to other medical interventions. That's my two cents on that. Again, I'm cautiously optimistic, but nothing is certain.\nWe are working continuously to influence the thinking and the decision-making, and particularly understanding what is it that they want to achieve so that we can provide productive solutions. On the percentage of utilization of our manufacturing sites, first of all, it is quite good. I wouldn't want to go to the details, but there is ample room if there is a need to transfer production to accommodate. We have huge manufacturing capacity right now in the US, particularly for everything that is injectable. Our ability, if there is a need, is clearly there, and without the need to build new facilities, just utilize the current ones and transfer production there. With that, let's go to the next question.\nWe'll go next to Uma Rafit with Evercore ISI.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two here, if I may.\nFirst is on dividend, and second is a follow-up to something Albert mentioned. Perhaps first, on dividend, I know there's obviously LOEs coming up over the next three to four years with net income and free cash flow pressures. How much of that pressure could be offset by potential OPEX cuts that you're taking underway? I guess said differently, can you hold net income at or near the current levels? That's part one of the question. Also, if a tariff impact approaching, I don't know, 15% to 20% of bottom line kicks in, can you still confirm your commitment to dividend? Finally, Albert, you mentioned the distinction between friendly versus unfriendly countries, but in the initial tariff announcement, that didn't necessarily seem to hold true. Why should that apply in the case of pharma? Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nDave, why don't you take the dividend question?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Umar, clearly, in my prepared remarks and what we said very consistently is our objective is to improve our operating margin performance over time. We've said that knowing quite well that we have LOEs approaching. Some of the improvements in productivity that we are making are designed to improve operating margin in the face of those LOEs. At the same time, our business is actually evolving such that, particularly in the oncology space, where we're leaning into that business and those products actually yield a very high gross margin and operating margin performance. The short answer is yes, we can withstand that. Secondly, we're very focused on improving our operating margin over time in the face of those LOEs.\nClearly, you've also heard us reiterate very specifically our focus on maintaining and growing our dividend over time, and we would continue to do that. We would work hard to understand the environment looking forward. I don't want to hypothesize on what could happen, but clearly, we're watching the situation closely, and our commitment to dividend is steadfast.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nI think, David, you made also very clear quantitative calculations of what we expect. When we put a number out there, we know that we can hit it. David spoke about $7 billion by year 2027 while maintaining the R&D at the current levels of investment, which I think is a key strategy to offset, first of all, to navigate an uncertain environment. That's the best way to do it, to be productive.\nAnother comment I want to make on that is that the cuts are not across the board or they are not by just reducing resources that are valuable. They are very strategic, and they are happening, first of all, with the deployment of technology. AI right now has a dramatic impact in the ways that we have been able to secure cost reductions and digital technology in general, but also through significant business simplification that we are implementing. We looked at every single thing of how we do things. When you find simpler things of doing it, there is a significant cost element associated. All in all, I think, as Dave said, we have our targets, and we are very confident. You can calculate it. We made them public, and we are very confident that we will achieve them by the year 2027.\nNow, as regards the tariffs, if that will be on friendly or non-friendly countries, look, it's up to the government to decide what they want to do. It is very, very clear in my discussions that national security concerns are pretty much associated not with friendly countries. Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHi, great. Thanks so much. Just my first question on guidance. Pfizer's gross margins for this year, should we still think about full-year gross margins in the mid-70% range, or has that changed at all following some of the upside with Q1? Maybe just in a second part of that, I'm just interested in the level of conservatism that's baked into the guidance here.\n\nOperator\n\nIt seems like the year's off to a very strong start, particularly on the cost side. Just as we think about the progression the rest of the year, should we think about any offsets from the upside we saw this quarter? Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. Dave here. Clearly, we're very confident in our outlook for 2025. As you noted, we finished Q1 in a position of strength, both from a top-line and a bottom-line perspective. As I look at our operating plan, we've exceeded both top-line and bottom line in Q1 based on our expectations internally. We're off to a very solid start. Secondly, as I look forward, we're in Q1, we have three quarters left to go.\nI look at us maintaining our guidance range, but giving you some color that on top of it, we're essentially de-risking the balance of the year from a financial delivery perspective. We're still faced with some uncertainty from a macro-environment perspective. We're watching that cautiously. At the same time, we're prepared to go into the vaccination season in a position of strength, but really, with still some uncertainty around how the macro-environment might play out in that space as well. I hope that helps. I think from a gross margin perspective, off to a nice start. We haven't changed our guidance and our color on that, but we're continuing to focus on improving our gross margin over time and improving our operating margin over time, which I think is even a more critical component for us.\nIf you look, in Q1, we posted a little over 40% from an operating margin perspective, which is really solid performance. Again, off to a really solid start.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you. You don't have any conservatives in your guidance. I don't. He is the best. Let's move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Jeff Meacham with Citi.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I had two quick ones. Albert or Andrew, just from a strategy perspective, what would you say ranks as a higher priority just with respect to how you tier what would be multiple BD options? Is it the TAM? Is it sales through LOE? Is it peak sales after? Wasn't sure how much that's evolved in the current macro backdrop.\nI guess the question for Albert, what incentives would you want to see in tariff negotiations that would maybe tip the balance for Pfizer to increase manufacturing investments here in the US? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes. On the strategy, maybe I make some comments, and then I ask also Andrew. It is very clear that we are facing—well, everybody knows LOEs. Those LOEs are starting in 2026, 2027, 2028. 2026 is a smaller number. 2027 is a bigger number. 2028 is the biggest number. Then goes down. LOEs are one-time events, right? To prepare for that, we had a significant number of new launches that are growing. We did significant business development, but it is growing because they were all early assets that we bought. They were, let's say, having in front of them the growth period.\nWhat we project is that those growing assets will offset the LOEs in 2026, 2027, 2028, more or less. Following that, because LOEs are a one-time event, they continue growing. We have a significant step up in the growth when the last LOE is going out. Now, what is our strategy in addition to having business development and new product launches? As we know, with the LOEs, we are not going to be a strong top-line growth story for the next three years, given the LOEs. We expect to become an EPS growth story. This is why you see here right now the very acute focus on our improvement of margins. Also, we expect, even more importantly, that there will be a pipeline story during the next three years. We are very focused on the R&D productivity.\nWe have learned from past mistakes in the R&D productivity. We are moving with very decisive steps to bring new phase three studies. I think once the studies start, also people will start modeling in their models, or upgrading their probabilities of success as we are moving to phase three studies, to reflect what I just told you, that as the pipeline matures, the growth post-2028 should look among the top tier of the industry. That's more or less the strategy. Now, within that, we have $10 to 15 billion of capital to allocate that we are very prudent in how to do it. Andrew will speak about it. In bottom line, it is that we would like to see in the first three years a multiple expansion given the maturation of our pipeline.\nOf course, an EPS growth given our strong focus on the costs. Andrew and the BD will be a bonus to all of that. What do you think? Just on, I think Albert gave you a very clear answer. In answer, just picking up on the explicit question that you asked, I think it's all of the above: TAM, LOE, as well as obviously as value. I think the other thing I would also add that perhaps you didn't mention is I'm very keen that we build sustainable franchises. I'm thinking more of the longer term than the shorter term, but we need to have breadth and durability, just as we've done internally with expanding and building on the Ibrance franchise with our novel CDK4s, CDK2s, and we have other assets as well within breast cancer.\nSimilarly, with Adcetris, BD is another tool within our arsenal to build on the internal discovery and development that we have with our existing pipeline. Yeah. On the tariff negotiations that you said, what would you expect to see so that you will invest in the US? I think it's certain. If I know that there will not be tariffs and I have this certainty, then there are tremendous investments that can happen in this country, both in R&D and manufacturing. The reason is that the tax environment that has forced a lot of manufacturing outside the US has significantly changed now. We have a global minimum tax around 15% that has been established right now. It's not as good in the US, although when President Trump did the first tax, we had a huge inflection of capital coming back from Pfizer and others.\nI'm sure, and I know because I talked to him, that he would like to see even a reduction in the current tax regime, particularly for locally produced goods. That would be a huge incentive to also bring manufacturing here, right? It's not that bad. That requires a lot of capital. In periods of uncertainty, everybody is controlling their cost, as we are doing, and is very frugal with their investments, as we are doing, so that we are prepared for rainy days. That's what I want to see. Thank you very much. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Trung Huynh with UBS. Great.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for the question. Just another one on costs and guidance and one on BD. On your cost realignment program, you announced an additional $1.2 billion saving by 2027.\nHow much of that can come out in 2025? How should we think about the step-up of costs for the rest of the year following what seems to be you guys exceeding savings targets, but also reiterating a guide? On BD, you've mentioned external opportunities. How much is that macro-environment impacting your decision in the timing of BD, given the volatility and unknowns? On the other side of the table, do you think sellers are hesitating, given valuations are meaningfully lower than the start of the year? Thanks.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Dave, why don't you take the guidance? Andrew, you can speak to the BD a little bit, and I will also comment. Yeah. On the cost side, keep in mind that we're focused on taking $4.5 billion out by the end of this year. Well on track with that.\nThe additional $1.2 billion that we've identified, probably modest delivery of that in 2025, most of that in 2026 and 2027, but maybe a little bit. I think from an R&D perspective, the $500 million that we're saving in improving productivity in R&D, largely that will happen this year to be reinvested in R&D late this year or maybe even bleed into next year to some degree. Thank you. On BD, Andrew, valuations are low. Uncertainty though is high. How do you see things?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I mean, I think, as you might imagine, we're very awake to the external environment, but we're comfortable with the $10 to 15 billion budget that Dave effectively forecasted or gave at the beginning of this year. In terms of the question of have sellers adjusted to the new valuation the market's applying, I think it depends.\nI think generally it takes some time in some categories where there is increasing therapeutic density because there's an ever-expanding array of assets mainly coming from China. I think there's an additional force which is causing companies to become more amenable to lower valuations. I think it really depends. Truong, what I tell my team constantly is never let a good crisis go to waste. With crises, there are risks, but also there are tremendous opportunities because things are changing. The status quo is changing. You need to be strategic, you need to be smart, you need to be disciplined. You need, as Warren Buffett said, sell when prices are high and buy when prices are low. Prices are low now. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Berenberg",
    "content2": "Thank you. A couple of questions for me, please.\nFirstly, in the context of US tariffs and the debate there, I wonder if you might tell us what proportion of your US drug sales are currently made end-to-end in the US. Can you give some examples of brands that are delivered end-to-end in the US today? A question for Dave here on COGS. Can you just quantify the US dollar impact of that revision of estimated accrued royalties in Q1? Can you tell us what that specifically relates to? Just to confirm, that's intended to be a one-off adjustment. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nNo, thank you, Kate. Look, around which percentage of production we have here, etc., we are not disclosing this information, so we won't go into those details. When it comes to the impact of the US dollar, I will ask Dave to comment.\nDave, also, you speak about the impact of IRA so that people can get a good picture of the puts and takes of the first quarter sales.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, sure. Maybe let's take this in points here. First, I know there's been a lot of volatility in FX and currency fluctuations. We're probably an outlier in the sense that we gave guidance in December. If you look point to point from December to now, FX is largely immaterial to us, given the fact there's been a roller coaster ride to get from point A to point B. Right now, FX is largely not an impact to Q1 and for the balance of the year. Secondly, if you look at Medicare Part D redesign, in Q1, it dampened our US revenues by approximately $650 million, as we expected.\nThat dampening will lessen in the back half of the year as we continue to offset that a bit with incremental prescriptions. Third, included in our guidance that we did not really speak about is there are some tariffs in place today. We anticipate those tariffs to be approximately $150 million for 2025. We are contemplating that within our guidance range, and we continue to, again, trend to the top end of our guidance range, even with those costs to be incurred this year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Akash Tewari with Jefferies.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies Financial Group\n\nHey, thanks so much. I realize there's a lot of uncertainty on tariffs, but hearing Merck give color on Q1, it seems like some of your peers are hinting the bottom-line impact of tariffs could be manageable.\n\nOperator\n\nLet's say the tariffs are broadly 25% on your transfer price, which I'm sure is a scenario your team's planned for. Would it be fair to say that the bottom-line earnings impact would be a single-digit percent basis with reasonable mitigation steps? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Akash. I will never go to that statement. We have made statements in the past, but we have been burnt. I am very cautious and careful about that. If there are tariffs, we have detailed contingency plans that are minimizing the impact. I am right now focusing more on the fact that we should not have tariffs. Only if we have, we should try to implement measures. I am sure all companies are doing the same. Sorry, I can't be more specific. I know you're interested in that. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director and Biotech Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for me. Another one on tariffs. I know Scott Gottlieb, who's on your board, referenced a grand bargain on the news a couple of weeks ago. You've given a lot of color here, Albert, in terms of your discussions with the administration. Can you confirm if something along those lines is in the works? The second question is on the pipeline that you guys and your partner, Arvinas, recently reported some phase three data for vepdeg from the Veritech II study. Just wondering how that data changed or impacted your strategy for this drug in the front-line setting. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of Scott's comments on the grand bargain.\nOf course, I follow him on TV, but also, more importantly, I speak to him very regularly, very often, and he advised me on several topics. I do not know his comments on grand bargain. Clearly, right now, there are two things in the horizon. One, it is an executive, one it is a 232 process on tariffs or pharmaceuticals that have been excluded from overall tariffs, geographical reciprocal tariffs, and that is on national security. There is also an executive order of the president that is focusing on 340B, reducing the cost of patients, PBM reform, removing the pill penalty. Those are the things that we are engaged in right now, not in any other type of bargain. On Arvinas, I will ask Chris to comment on that.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you for the question.\nAs you know, the phase three top-line results, Veritech II was reported in March in the last two months. We met the primary endpoint in the SP1 receptor 1 mutant population, which was statistically significant and clinically meaningful for progression-free survival. Overall survival still too early, very immature. We did not reach statistical significance and improvement in PFS in the intent to treat overall population. We plan to present detailed results at ASCO. It's a late-breaking oral presentation. We'll also start sharing the data with global regulatory authorities to potentially support regulatory filings. We are continuing the combinations with CDK4, atenoziclib, which we're excited about, as well as with CDK6. On this project with Veritech Astrand, the combinations with Veritech Astrand. We shall then work with Arvinas to not just only file, but work with Arvinas to discuss future plans for the phase three program.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nOkay. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to David Risinger with Leerink.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks very much, and thank you for all the updates. I have two questions, Albert. First, current Washington leadership is very supportive of the traditional technology sector, but is taking the opposite approach towards biotechnology. Notwithstanding a few of the things that you mentioned that might be marginally positive, such as the pill penalty, Washington is actively degrading proven medical science, collapsing the NIH, and driving reduced investments in the biotechnology sector in the United States. Could you please comment on that and how you and other biopharma companies are responding when you engage with Washington?\nSeparately, with respect to the 232 investigation, since we can't see what's going on outside, could you just explain exactly how that investigation is progressing, how Pfizer is engaging on the 232 investigation front, and what we should watch and when? When should we see news on 232? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes. Thank you, Aamir. Look, we are clearly concerned about several of the statements that we have seen and approaches regarding FDA and some statements that they are not in correlation with what science has proven over the decades and what the vast majority of the scientific community—when I say vast, I'm talking 99.9%—are behind. Sometimes they use this 0.1% as a point to challenge the remaining. I think there is scientific truth, and that scientific truth, it is well presented. This is not only a US thing.\nIt's not only the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH, but it is the UK health authorities, the French health authorities, the Spanish health authorities, the Korean health authorities, the Japanese, and the Israeli, and I can go on and on. This thing of the conspiracy theory that someone is not, that the whole world and the whole authorities of the world want to implement wrong science. I am very convinced that we are on the right side of history, and those people are in the wrong. I want to tell you that those views are not expressed by the entire administration, and there are many people that do not share those views.\nI would say that we had also a president that spearheaded the War Speed operation, and he created this miracle that was saved. I mean, there was no other country that had done something like that in the world. The entire world was able to save their economies and survive based on what Operation War Speed did. The president and members of his cabinet at that time, on SER and Jared and all of them, they worked with us to do it. Actually, I told him that he should have received the Nobel Prize for that. That was unfair, but he didn't. It was a serious contribution.\nThe thing that I discuss with everyone in the administration—and I think that resonates a lot with Democrats, with Republicans, with everybody in the administration, including HHS and everywhere—it is that Chinese right now are progressing with the speed of light in their science. Biotech, it is dominant. The US has the dominant scientific position in biotech because we have created this ecosystem of biotech, pharma, academia, and all of that. This is exactly what the Chinese have replicated in the last four years. In the last four years, IRA was a significant setback for us that took down a lot of funding of the private sector towards biotech. The biotechs now currently, also because of tariffs, but also because of the four previous years, are at historical low. As a result, there is very little money going to the biotech.\nThe Chinese are doing the opposite. Right now, they are having very, very good science. I think that's something that everybody should be concerned about. They should be concerned not only from a commercial, but also from a national security point of view. Imagine if in the next pandemic, the medicines that will help will not be invented in this country, but in another country. That will be a problem. Now, the 232 investigation is an investigation that is basically launching, and the Secretary of Commerce is running it and is gathering information to see if there is any national security risk with the way that medicines are available in the US, the supply chain of the medicine. The process has been launched. They have requested information publicly, and companies will submit information. The Pharma Association will submit information.\nEverybody who has an interest in that will submit information and probably proposals. Those things will be assembled. Although this process is time-limited, which I think is 270 days. I don't recall well, but I think they need to complete it within 270 days. Knowing how fast this administration works, I think they will do the work faster. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question.\nAlbert, one more for you. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a little bit more complex. There are layers of API manufacturing of drug substance as well as the fill-finish. To my understanding, a fill-finish majority of part is already in the US.\nWould love to understand from your conversations, is there a specific focus of the administration to bring the API part of it or the drug substance manufacturing part of it to the US? How feasible is it to bring API or move it to some friendly countries, if not America? Would love to get your perspective on that. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes, I think for things that they are considering national security, they are looking at the entire value chain. They want to see the precursors, the APIs, and where the products are made. They are making very clear distinctions, I think, on where those products are made so that they can assess the risk. Transferring manufacturing, even under the most lucrative investments available and even under the most favorable regulatory framework to provide approvals, etc., is a multi-multi-year process.\nIt's not something that can be resolved within a year. I believe they will focus on a manageable number of products, which are the most important, so that they can have that built and secure the national security. I think their questions right now are on everything: on APIs, on precursors, on where products are made, etc. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Courtney Breen with Bernstein.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi everyone. Thanks for taking the time for a question today. A couple that we had, one clarification on tariffs. Apologies if we missed it. This was just kind of if you can provide any comments on inventory and kind of work that you're doing already to bring inventory into the US. The second question is just on the pipeline.\nI know kind of you've given us some details about the things that you're looking to prioritize. Can we expect an R&D day at some point this year that will help us better understand the overall pipeline strategy and help us understand that reallocation, and perhaps even better assess and evaluate that pipeline in our cell-side models? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Courtney. I will ask Chris to comment on the pipeline. On the tariffs, as David also said, I think in the beginning, you can imagine we have done everything that we have to do to make sure that we mitigate. That includes inventories, of course, and many other things that we have built into the country so that we can weather any scenario that is needed.\nEvery month also, we are increasing those positions to make sure that, as I said, in rainy days, we are well positioned. Chris, on pipeline.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you for the question. Just to remind that we've got a number of products that we're currently excited about that will read out later this year. For instance, Padcev, muscle-invasive, if that's positive, it will triple the population. Elrexfio, Albert mentioned, double-class exposed will double the population. Sasanlimab, obviously, read out just now, potentially up to 38,000 patients eligible in the US. A number of phase three programs, we're accelerating all that already started or will start later this year in the next six to nine months, including for oncology, the two ADCs Albert mentioned, sickle cell, tachycardia, and PD-L1 V. Atemocyclib, continuing phase three in first-line positive breast cancer.\nVaccines, PCV fourth generation, but also potentially starting first and only to market opportunity with the C. difficile vaccine. For internal medicine, Ponsagramab, which again, discovered in-house, potential brand new opportunity. This is opening a new field in cancer cachexia. In terms of an R&D day, we're not planning it. As you know, we currently have the flashes, which is organized by our team. The next one coming up will be on breast cancer, and we will continue throughout the year these flash events.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nIn general, our intention is to provide as much visibility on our data as possible without undermining publications, of course. I think the flashes are making a very good job right now.\nWe can intensify also how we do that so that we have smaller bites of information that are referring to a specific product, and then after a month, another product, and then after a month, another product, rather than sour everyone with a lot of data and information in one day. We will find the best way. We are listening right now. We are listening to all the analysts that are giving us ideas on that. We are listening to all our investors that they are giving us ideas on how best to communicate our pipeline. Let's go now to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Asad Hadir with Goldman Sachs.\n\nAsad Hadir\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the questions, and thanks for all the color on the macro and tariff side. I'll ask a couple of product-specific questions.\nFirst, on Vyndaqel, can you just double-click on how competitive dynamics are playing out in that market relative to your own expectations? Second, on the internal oral GIPR agonists, can you remind us of the timelines on when we'll start to see more data? Third, on these nine phase three readouts that you're highlighting, other than Elrexfio, which you've highlighted in the past, where do you see the biggest disconnect in analyst models relative to your own internal expectations? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nAamir, you talk about Vyndaqel. Chris, maybe you explain on GIPR. Andrew, you can speak about where the biggest differences are. Aamir? Okay.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks for the question. On Vyndaqel in the US, I think we are off to a very good start in the new year. We've grown revenue at 31%.\nThat is a combination of multiple things, including the fact that diagnosis rates are improving. We've improved access and therefore have had strong new patient starts, certainly versus last year, more than 70%, and versus Q4, almost 20% new patient start growth, and continued compliance with our existing base of patients. All of that has driven very, very strong volume growth year over year and sequentially. We are managing that revenue growth despite the offset of the impact of IRA Part D redesign that Dave spoke to. Now, we're obviously seeing impact of competition, principally a true beat, and principally on newly diagnosed patients. We'll continue to stay close and monitor that and how that evolves and how Mvutra settles into the market as well. The year is off to a good start. Our team is executing well, and we have confidence.\nWe will grow for the balance of the year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Alexandre, can you comment also on Vyndaqel in the international market that is growing very healthy overall?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nChief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, absolutely. We had also a good growth of 36% this quarter, above expectation from the analysts. What's driving that is essentially a significant increase in our treated population. We have actually reached a 52% growth in patients treated on Vyndaqel in Q1 versus Q1 last year. Very healthy trends, and we see that this trend will continue for essentially three reasons. One, our diagnosis rate has potential to expand in pretty much all our key markets outside of the US. Two, our clinical profile is differentiated and will support our standard of care status, with believing in our key markets.\nThree, which is often underestimated, we, after three years of hard work, have finally reached access reimbursement in 46 markets. We just received actually reimbursement in Korea in March of 2025. That will kind of flow into our business and will continue to sustain significant growth, we believe.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Alexandre. Chris, GIPA?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer, Pfizer\n\nOral small molecule GIPA antagonist was discovered in-house. It's potentially first-in-class oral small molecule GIPA antagonist. The phase two study is now ongoing. This is a study on obesity in combination with liraglutide with the GLP-1. The PCD is listed on clinicaltrials.gov at the end of 2025, so expect beginning 2026 potential data. If the data are positive in the phase two study, then it could be a potential to be used in combinations to drive weight loss, both with internal or external opportunities.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Chris.\nAndrew, disconnect between our projections that you came to interrogate very carefully and your colleagues in your previous life.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nChief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nWell, thank you for the opportunity, Albert. I'd start with the two ADCs, which are now in phase three first-line trials for non-small cell and HEVNEX, so SV and PD-L1v. Part of the reason I think that the street may have these may have flown under the radar is they move very, very quickly on the back of very strong phase one data straight into phase three. I think some focus on that will be useful. We obviously have the benefit of having seen access to more data than you have, but we look forward to sharing that with you in the near future. Hopefully, that will align your expectations closer to ours internally.\nChris already mentioned CDIF, which will begin at phase three end of this year, beginning of next year, a very significant medical need. This is not by any means a comprehensive list, but the two other ones I would mention is the CDK4, which I name-checked previously, which builds on a legacy with Ibrance. It's the first in class. It promises much better tolerability and efficacy. Again, it's in our frontline head-to-head trial versus the current standard of care. That is a $15 billion-plus market, so very sizable, an area that we have a lot of expertise in. The final one is Ponsagramab, which I've addressed before. Look, we need to see how the data pans out.\nIf it translates into a meaningful progression-free survival benefit or even a survival benefit, obviously, it's a home run in terms of the value to both patients, but in addition, the revenue potential. Alternatively, if it's supportive care therapy, it's still a significant product, albeit at a different price point and a different order of magnitude. Nonetheless, there is a very substantial delta when we look further out between what I can see or we can see and how the street is modeling some of those forecasts. We look forward to hopefully narrowing the gap in the months ahead.\nThank you, Andrew. That was the last question. Just a couple of comments. We had a very solid performance in the first quarter.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer\n\nKeep in mind that already $650 million negative in the US have been already absorbed in the results of the first quarter because of IRA. That's from a total of $1 billion net, $1.5 billion gross for the year. It's a very strong start. I think in the strategic priorities, we continue to guide us in acting on our greatest opportunity. The discipline will continue. I think the team that we have running right now, the company, probably the best I have ever seen in Pfizer. Pfizer had traditionally very, very strong teams. I'm cautiously optimistic that we will turn this around and we will translate the very good operational performance of the last five quarters, at least, into also meaningful shareholder value.\nThank you very much, and till the next earnings call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.\nYou may disconnect at any time.",

Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nFrancesca DeMartino\n\nChief of Investor Relations Officer and SVP, Pfizer\n\nGood morning and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions.\nMembers of our leadership team will be available for the Q&A session. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website at pfizer.com.\nForward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. 2024 was a strong year of execution and performance for Pfizer. We were guided by clear strategic priorities, and we met or exceeded our goals for each one while also delivering on our financial commitments. I'm pleased with the progress we made in executing transformative changes that strengthened our company.\nFirst, we successfully integrated the Seagen business, one of the largest investments we have made in the past decade, creating one of the best oncology companies in the industry. At the start of 2024, we split our commercial operations into two divisions, US and international, and appointed two senior commercial leaders to increase focus in both. AAamir Malik and Alexandre de Germay have done a tremendous job to upgrade our commercial capabilities. They consolidated our external agencies down to one powerhouse, global advertising company, and leveraged the power of AI to transform our marketing and selling engine.\nNew data-driven deployment of our commercial and medical field resources, precision market targeting in social media, and elevation of the Pfizer brand in commercial communications are some of the strategies that have significantly increased our commercial and medical effectiveness, and returns on investment. We are seeing the impact of these actions in our strong financial performance, and in the recognition of our market leaders.\nWe earned the top position in the 2024 IQVIA US Field Force ranking report, and improved our ranking to claim number one or two spot in 70% of the specialties in which we focus. I'm also proud of our strong year of pipeline progress in 2024, including more than a dozen approvals, seven pivotal study starts, and eight key phase III readouts. I'm very excited with the changes in our R&D engine under its new leaders.\nChris Boshoff moved fast to create four end-to-end R&D units focused on oncology, vaccines, internal medicine, and inflammation and immunology. This structure fully empowers research units that can operate with the focus and agility of a biotech company while tapping into our differentiated enterprise-wide capabilities, such as AI power, drug discovery, and development.\nOur focus on financial discipline also has yielded good results. We ended the year with expanded margins after a series of actions to realign our cost base, and we strategically deployed capital to enhance shareholder value, investing nearly $11 billion in support of internal R&D programs, delivering by $7.8 billion, and returning $9.5 billion directly to shareholders through our dividends. Finally, we also reinforced our commitment to strong governance. Our two new Board members bring deep expertise in financial markets and shareholder value creation.\nAll these changes have created a strong foundation and allow us to start the new year from a position of strength. Now let me speak about our 2025 priorities. Last year, we had a significant emphasis on improving our commercial effectiveness. In 2025, the emphasis will move to improving R&D productivity while maintaining focus on margin expansion, commercial excellence, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation.\nLet me start with R&D. Across our pipeline, we believe we have a strong year of catalysts ahead of us and expect our new R&D organization to achieve multiple key milestones, including the possibility of at least four regulatory decisions, up to nine potential phase III readouts, and 13 potential pivotal program starts. For example, with Adcetris, our next-generation highly selective CDK4 inhibitor candidate, yesterday we dosed our first patient in a phase III study in first-line metastatic breast cancer.\nWe also anticipate starting an additional first-line study in combination with the degrader, we are co-developing with Arvinas. Our ADC, sigvotatug vedotin, continues its phase III study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, and this year we expect to start a phase III study in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Our PDL1 V ADC candidate, a potential first-in-class PDL1 targeting vedotin ADC, is expected to begin two phase III studies this year, one in first-line metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and one in second-line plus non-small cell lung cancer, where the unmet need is significant. We have a robust clinical development program aimed at expanding Elrexfio indications in multiple myeloma. This year, we anticipate the readout of a phase III study in double-class exposed relapsed refractory multiple myeloma that, if successful and approved, will triple the addressable population versus the currently approved indication.\nIn vaccines, we expect to start a phase III study this year for our PCV25 candidate, covering 25 serotypes. This is important foundational work that could help us bridge to, and accelerate progress with, our fifth-generation PCV candidate, covering more than 30 serotypes. This year, we also expect to start a phase III study for our C. difficile vaccine candidate. In internal medicines, we remain on track to provide an update of our dose optimization studies of Danuglipron in the first quarter of this year. For polysaccharide, we expect to start a pivotal study this year in cancer cachexia. Ibuzatrelvir, our second-generation COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate, continues its phase III study. Within IRA, we continue to progress a portfolio of medicines that include two potential first-in-class tri-specific antibodies currently in phase II. Now, let's discuss our commercial strategy.\n2024 was a strong year of commercial execution, and we are pleased with our progress in improving performance of our newly launched products, and gaining and maintaining market share for several of our core brands. I will start by highlighting the strength and impact of our oncology portfolio. Padcev plus pembrolizumab is an important growth driver, as it has already become the number one prescribed first-line treatment for locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer in the US. We are expecting potential registrational interim data this year from ongoing pivotal studies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which, if successful and approved, would nearly triple the total addressable patients in the US. Braftovi-Mektovi achieved 27% year-over-year worldwide operational growth, and expanded its leadership position in multiple BRAF tumors, which are some of the hardest to treat cancers.\nYesterday, we announced that Braftovi, in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation. We are very excited with the robust improvement in PFS and OS, and are looking forward to presenting this data in a scientific conference. Lorbrena, a treatment for adults with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, achieved 37% worldwide year-over-year operational growth, and is emerging as a potential standard of care in the first-line setting. Following last June's unprecedented CROWN trial data showing 60% of patients were alive without disease progression after five years, Lorbrena has seen a double-digit share increase in the first line in both new patient starts and new prescribers.\nElrexfio had a strong performance in 2024 with more than $130 million in full-year revenues and increasing overall share within the class of BCMA-directed bispecific antibodies for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the United States. I also want to comment about our COVID-19 portfolio. We continue to see stabilizing patterns in the disease burden, with a strong correlation between the COVID-19 burden of disease and Paxlovid utilization. We see the same stabilizing patterns in US vaccination rates at relatively low levels. Our assumptions for 2025 are on par with these 2023 and 2024 patterns. With the multi-year contracts we have secured in international markets, we are confident that our COVID-19 portfolio will continue to be a predictable and durable contributor to our business.\nIn another key category, our Vyndaqel family of products achieved continuing momentum with 90% year-over-year growth in the US and 32% operational growth in international markets. We drove progress in diagnosing more patients and improving access to this treatment for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Eliquis is a core brand for Pfizer with 10% worldwide year-over-year operational growth.\nIt is prescribed to millions of patients, and we continue to strengthen its leadership position in a growing oral anticoagulant market. We are also pleased with the ongoing positive momentum for Nurtec, with 36% worldwide year-over-year operational growth, driven by strong commercial execution. Nurtec is a leader in the oral CGRP class used for treating and preventing migraine, with about 49% market share, and we see opportunities for continued growth. Our respiratory vaccines, Abrysvo and Prevnar, also are key products in our commercial portfolio.\nWe have achieved a market leadership position for the season in sixth dose for Abrysvo, with an approximately 13% points increase in market share, and remain confident in our ability to retain our position through strong commercial execution, even as we see a decrease in the total adult RSV market volume driven by a reduction in vaccination rates in the US for the older adult indication. We achieved positive momentum in key regions such as Europe and Latin America, and are also seeing strong demand for our maternal indication. Abrysvo's season-to-date cumulative maternal vaccination rate nearly tripled compared to last season. With Prevnar, we are confident that we are well positioned for strong, sustained leadership with over 87% market share in the US across indications.\nGlobally, the pediatric market accounts for approximately 2/3 of our Prevnar revenues, and we also continue to make progress for the adult indication in key international markets. We are encouraged by opportunities to maintain our leadership in the PCV space with our next-generation PCV25 candidate mentioned earlier. In phase I, we demonstrated potentially improving immunogenicity for serotype 3, one of the largest contributors of disease at approximately 20% of invasive disease in adults aged 65 and older in the United States and Europe. Across our commercial portfolio in 2025, we are confident that we are in a strong position to build on our 2024 success and achieve commercial excellence in our key categories of oncology, cardiovascular, migraine, vaccines, and IMI. With that, I will turn it over to David.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I'll build on Albert's comments by reinforcing that we are very pleased with the financial results for both the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2024. These results demonstrate that our focus and execution against our strategic priorities are driving both positive patient outcomes, as well as financial and operational strength. In addition to our strong top-line performance, our cost reduction programs are creating a more efficient organization, driving operating margin improvement. As we move into 2025, these efforts will continue to lay the groundwork for potential increased capital returns and reinforce our commitment to maintaining and growing our dividend, while enhancing long-term shareholder value. With that said, let me start with our full year and fourth quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities.\nI'll finish up with a few comments on our 2025 guidance, which we are reaffirming today, and our near-term expectations that will continue to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full year of 2024, we recorded revenues of $63.6 billion versus $59.6 billion last year. Importantly, our operational revenue growth, when excluding contributions from our COVID products, was 12%, exceeding our expectations of 9% to 11%. Full year 2024 adjusted gross margins expanded to 74% as we continue to drive cost improvements across our manufacturing network. On the bottom line, we reported full year 2024 diluted EPS of $1.41 versus $0.37 last year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.11 versus $1.84 last year, significantly ahead of expectations due to our overall strong P&L performance.\nNow, turning to the fourth quarter performance versus the same period of last year, let me walk down the P&L. Total company revenues were $17.8 billion versus $14.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Once again, our non-COVID-19 products exhibited robust performance, with revenues of $13.7 billion reflecting 11% operational year-over-year growth. This performance continues to show that our refined commercial approach is working. We continue to focus on key products and geographies. We've refined how we allocate our commercial field resources globally, and we're further optimizing our marketing resources into key priority areas. We saw strong contributions across our product portfolio, primarily driven by the Vyndaqel family, Paxlovid, Eliquis, and Nurtec, partially offset by declines in Abrysvo and Xeljanz.\nAdjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter was approximately 68%, primarily the result of a net unfavorable mix related to our COVID-19 products, primarily due to the commodity profit split with BioNTech and applicable loyalty expenses. This was partially offset by an ongoing focus on cost management across our manufacturing network, as I previously mentioned. As we previously communicated, long-term improvements in gross margin will remain a key focus for the company over the next few years. We expect to begin to achieve initial savings from phase I of our manufacturing optimization program in the latter part of 2025 and continue to expect approximately $1.5 billion in savings from this first phase by the end of 2027.\nWe continue to evaluate other strategies to improve our network structure as well as our product portfolio, and we plan to share more information on those components of the program once it becomes available. Total adjusted operating expenses are essentially flat operationally at $7.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, and I will note that this amount includes spending acquired via our Seagen transaction. Looking at the component specifically, adjusted SI&A expenses decreased 4% operationally, driven primarily by a decrease in marketing and promotional spend for various products, including both Comirnaty and Paxlovid, partially offset by an increase in spending for certain oncology and recently launched and acquired products.\nAdjusted R&D expenses increased 8% operationally, driven primarily by a net increase in spending, mainly to develop certain product candidates acquired from Seagen, partially offset by lower spending on certain ongoing vaccine programs, and certainly as a result of our cost realignment program. We continue to be disciplined with our operational expense management, and delivered on our goal of at least $4 billion in net cost savings from our cost realignment program. Q4 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.07, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.63, benefiting from our top-line performance as well as our efficient operating structure, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate driven primarily by jurisdictional mix. In support of our goal to enhance R&D productivity, and to focus on high-impact medicines, our fourth quarter GAAP results reflect strategic decisions in our development plans and updated long-range revenue forecasts for several medicines.\nAs a result, we recorded approximately $2.9 billion in non-cash intangible asset impairments related to several medicines in development as well as several inline products. These decisions reinforce our focus on future growth as well as innovation. Now, let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return, and finally, making value-enhancing share repurchases after delivering our balance sheet. In 2024, we returned $9.5 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $10.8 billion in internal R&D, and, as expected, completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to delivering our capital structure to a gross leverage target of 3.25x by the end of 2025 remains a key priority.\nIn support of that goal, in 2024, we delivered by approximately $7.8 billion, paying down approximately $2.3 billion in maturing debt and approximately $5.5 billion in commercial paper. In January 2025, we monetized another tranche of our Haleon shares, which for reporting purposes is a Q1 2025 event. We received approximately $3 billion in net cash proceeds, and now our ownership in Haleon was reduced from approximately 15% to approximately 7%. We intend to monetize our remaining Haleon investment in a prudent fashion during 2025. Overall, in Q4, we generated robust operating cash flows, which, combined with the most recent Haleon net sales proceeds of approximately $3 billion, resulted in significant free cash flow generation as we enter 2025. Our objective remains to deliver and return to a more balanced allocation of capital between reinvestments and direct return to shareholders over time.\nGiven we issued our full year 2025 financial guidance on 17 December 2024, let me just hit a few highlights. We expect total company full year 2025 revenues to be in the range of $61 billion to 64 billion, and full year 2025 adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to 3 a share, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio, as well as our focus on disciplined cost management. Importantly, we believe the steps taken to right-size our cost base will put us on a strong footing towards increased operational efficiency, and support our goal to return to pre-pandemic operating margins.\nIn further support of this initiative, we now expect to deliver overall net savings of $4.5 billion from our ongoing cost relaying programs by the end of 2025, while continuing to advance programs that will improve cost of goods sold in the years to come. As a reminder, the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D redesign is expected to be a net headwind to the company's revenue of approximately $1 billion across our product portfolio, dampening growth by approximately 1.6% versus 2024. The impact of catastrophic coverage is expected to exceed the potential volume benefit from the reduction of the patient out-of-pocket cap, leading to a negative impact beginning early in the year, while the positive impact of lower patient out-of-pocket costs is expected to build throughout this year.\nAs the IRA is felt more acutely in higher-priced medicines, we expect Vyndaqel, Ibrance, Xeljanz, and Xeljanz to reach catastrophic coverage much earlier in the year. Due to these changes, we expect a higher gross-to-net impact on our revenues for all drugs in the beginning of 2025 that is expected to moderate throughout the remainder of the year when compared to 2024. Lastly, I will mention that we continue to monitor currency fluctuation as the year progresses. In closing, let me just emphasize several key aspects of our business. We believe our financial targets for 2025 are both reasonable and achievable, reinforcing our commitment to operational excellence. We also believe our revenue volatility is largely in the past, as COVID-related uncertainties have diminished. Additionally, our cost improvement programs have set the stage for ongoing margin expansion.\nWe will continue our focus and execution to maximize the commercial value of our product portfolio. Our new R&D leadership is committed to driving value-creating innovation and strengthening our pipeline. Lastly, we have a clear path to reloading our balance sheet, enabling enhanced capital deployment and pursuit of additional opportunities to strengthen our business and create value for our shareholders. We are dedicated to maintaining and growing our dividend, and meeting our delivering targets by the end of 2025, providing for a more balanced capital allocation. With that, I'll turn it back to Albert to start the Q&A session.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, thank you, David. Before we turn to the questions, I would like to close the year with one comment. Pfizer knows how to execute well when we set our focus on something. We saw what we could do in 2020 when we rapidly developed and prepared to manufacture billions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. In 2021, we repeated the same with Paxlovid. In 2022, with successful commercialization, we exceeded $100 billion in full year revenue. In 2023, despite the difficulties with the rebased COVID-19 expectations, we invested in our future with a big bet in oncology with the acquisition of Seagen.\nLast year, we exceeded expectations repeatedly with four consecutive quarters of strong financial performance from our disciplined commercial execution. Now, as we are directing similar focus and our proven ability to execute on our R&D pipeline, we are confident that we are well-positioned to drive meaningfully improved productivity. With that, Operator, please assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star one to ask a question. We'll go first to Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thank you so much. I have two questions. First, on the danuglipron dose optimization data, it's apparently still on track for the first quarter of this year. What is the range of possible outcomes, and is dropping this version of the compound a possibility, and what would be the next step? Second question is Chris Boshoff. I assume he's on the line. Under the heading of \"Nothing's Perfect,\" can you share with us two or three things in the Pfizer R&D portfolio or system that you think need to be fixed? New leaders usually say they want to move quicker, but sometimes they also thoroughly go through the portfolio and shed many projects. Is that also a possibility? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nChris.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nWe start with Danu. For Danu, just to be clear, as we stated previously, we're now targeting first quarter to have data from the ongoing dose optimization and formulation study, the PK study, and we're on track to deliver that in Q1. We haven't seen the data yet, but obviously that data will then determine decisions for the future of Danuglipron. On your second question, as we've recently announced, we already focused our portfolio further.\nWe've now established four end-to-end therapeutic areas: oncology, vaccines, internal medicine, and INI. Part of that will be to focus on those opportunities that could provide the biggest value, both for patients but also for Pfizer. You will see during the coming months how we further focus, execute, and accelerate those medicines we believe could be potential future blockbusters.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Steve, you're right that usually new leaders are taking their time to assess. The good news with Chris is that he knew really the Pfizer organization, and I'm very impressed with the speed and thoughtfulness that he's deploying his changes. Already he announced the new organizations, selected a lot of leaders, and refocused our pipeline in collaboration with Andrew Baum. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Geoff Meacham with Citibank. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nAnalyst, Citibank\n\nMorning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had a couple of quick ones. For the COVID franchise, you guys talked about stabilizing revenue for this year. Maybe just give us some level of conviction and your level of investments in this business kind of going forward. I think most investors kind of would like for it to kind of be viewed as just maybe upside to the story. From a capital allocation perspective, when you guys think about the appetite for potential VD as you reprioritize or look at the pipeline and evaluate a lot of the assets and say early to mid-development, just want to get a sense from you guys for the appetite for growing out the number of TAs, if you had more optimization to do that can be achieved through VD. Thank you very much.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nChief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nI'm in. Jeff, on COVID, maybe I'll start with Paxlovid. You saw Albert describe. We have multiple years now of reference where Paxlovid utilization tracks directly to the level of disease outbreak. The year 2024 was no different. We know that to be the case. We've also put in place a very effective commercial model in Paxlovid that allows us to deliver on that and continue to improve.\nIn fact, if you look at 2024, we had higher physician treatment rates than 2023, and we also had gains in market share versus 2023. We know we have a model that works. With regards to resource allocation, we have targeted our resource modeling for Paxlovid so that we are investing in the places where it's relevant, when it's relevant. We have a very, very tailored model. I think you see that in the results.\nWe had a very big summer and early fall wave of COVID in 2024, and then we had a milder and shorter winter wave. You see that reflected in Paxlovid utilization. We've also ensured that we have the right pricing model in place and put in place a new agreement with the US government on our Paxlovid contract that defines the eligibility for the USG path going forward.\nThere's clarity on that for January, February, and going into March. With regards to vaccinations on community, again, we saw a pattern in 2024 that very closely mirrored 2023. Vaccination rates were quite stable. Again, here we also saw an improvement in our market share position for community. We are confident that our commercial execution, both with regards to the retail setting and the non-retail setting, will continue to put us in good stead as we move forward.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Of course, in international, to save time here, we have contracts with our multi-year contracts that are covering not only this year, but the year after. All of that makes us feel that this is a very stable and predictable revenue stream. Why don't we go to capital allocation? Then, Dave, maybe also, Andrew, you can comment on the VD.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nAlbert, I'll be real quick. From a capital allocation perspective, I'm very pleased with the company's cash flow generation throughout 2024 as we've continued to enhance our cash flow yield, number one. Number two, continue to aggressively deliver. Now as we enter 2025, we'll be in a position from a cash and a delivering perspective to have a more balanced capital allocation strategy, allowing us to do slightly bigger business development programs, if so desired, in 2025. With that, maybe I'll pass it over to Andrew to give some context around how we're thinking about that.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nChief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. To recap what Chris says, we've narrowed our current therapeutic areas to the four: oncology, vaccines, INI, and internal medicine. I expect to say that those are fairly broad areas. They're big buckets that you can put lots of therapeutic indications in. If we were to explore adjacencies or indeed therapeutic areas where historically Pfizer hasn't been active, I think firstly, we'll be looking for truly breakthrough science that's tractable with a drug. Second, a non-medical need that we feel that can be monetized. Thirdly, and most importantly, we have to have the talent with it in order to develop those assets if we go into a therapeutic area that is one that is unfamiliar to us or we don't have historically that backbone of talent.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Andrew and Dave. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. Just coming back to capital deployment. Dave, just to build on those comments, you talked about slightly larger BD transactions. Can you just help size the range of what Pfizer is able to look at from here and how you think about balancing business development versus share repo, which I don't think you talked about as you started to deliver would be part of the story? The second is on the RSV market. Can you talk a little bit about the thinking and the size of the opportunity from here and the potential for growth given some of the 2024 results, both the US as well as globally? Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nGreat. Yeah. As far as capital deployment goes, Chris, I think the good news is the company has very robust cash flow generation capabilities. Over time, we'll be able to do both dividends, as well as BD, as well as value-enhancing share repurchases. Specifically, as we come into 2025, given the strength of the company from a cash flow perspective, we have the capacity in the $10 to 15 billion zip code from a business development perspective within 2025 if we chose to focus in that area.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Aamir and Alexandre, the RSV.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP, Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nVery quickly in the US. Firstly, the market did decrease in 2024, and that's something that we have been signaling for quite some time. This was because of shifts in ACIP as well as the early adopters of the vaccine in 2023. The important thing for us, the things that we can control, the strength of our commercial execution led us to the leading market share of doses shipped to end customers at 50% for 2024, and an improvement in the shots and arms market share by 18 percentage points versus last year.\nOur maternal indication also performed very well, tripling the uptake from last season. Now, as we look forward, in the absence of any major policy or ACIP change in 2025, the RSV market without that is likely not to grow. There are a lot of catalysts for midterm growth. One is any policy updates to year-round vaccination. Second, age expansion for 18 to 59-year-olds that are at risk where we have great data, as well as potential revaccination recommendations as data becomes more available. Those are midterm growth catalysts. In the meantime, we remain confident in our ability to execute as that evolves.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nChief International Commercial Officer and EVP, Pfizer\n\nOn the international front, Chris, what we see in this quarter is the beginning of financial impact of the work we've done in approving and getting through the VTC and the payers for Abrysvo. In the countries where we received positive VTC and got reimbursement, we start to see great execution working hand in hand with the authority and SCP. Let me give you two examples in maternal immunization.\nIn the UK, after winning the exclusive tender, ASCA Professional vaccinated with Abrysvo over 60% of the eligible pregnant women in just one quarter in Q4. In France, in a competitive setting, Abrysvo was administered to over 40% of the eligible pregnant women in Q4 alone. Clearly, we see a potential as we move into 2025 in the MRI, a great opportunity to expand usage and to expand vaccination. Of course, that is not just in the developed market, but also in emerging markets. For instance, as you know, Abrysvo was listed at the Pan American Health Organization.\nStarting this year, we can have Latin American countries start contracting Abrysvo. In the older adults, we also start to see some traction. The vaccination campaign in the UK already reached 44% of the eligible population. Regional vaccination was granted late 2024 in about half of the German population. We're expecting to get full German population access in Q1 2025. Again, on both maternal immunization and older adults, plenty of opportunity to grow.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nYeah, great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a couple that I could on the pipeline. Prevnar 25, you mentioned starting phase III in adults this year. Just curious if you can comment on what you've seen so far. It gives you comfort in moving that forward when we might see the data publicly and also any updates on the pediatric population and where things stand there.\nThe second one's on Ponsegromab. You have the obviously cancer cachexia, which you're starting phase III. We also noticed in the phase II heart failure program, you increased the patient enrollment significantly there. Just curious if you can provide any perspective on what drove that change and maybe your broader views on the heart failure opportunity for that product. Thanks.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, Chris.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nFirst of all, PCV25, as Albert mentioned, this is an ongoing phase II study with a potential best-in-class vaccine. The phase II study is ongoing in both adults and in pediatrics. As we've mentioned earlier, serotype 3 is very important and is emerging as a very important serotype, with up to 20% to 30% of the population actually developed serotype 3.\nWe're very pleased that we're now seeing what looks like best-in-class immunogenicity against serotype 3. On the pediatric front, as you mentioned, the study is ongoing. We hope to provide additional data later this year. Everything we've seen so far suggests to us that we've got improved immunogenicity of PCV25 versus our current vaccine.\nJust a reminder as well, we do have a first-generation vaccine, 30 Plus, that's also now in preclinical development that we hope to launch in phase I later this year. On Panzacromab, very quickly, we're excited about the data for cancer cachexia. The cancer cachexia study should start later this year in a phase III experience. We stopped the development of the cardiovascular study.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. I want also to emphasize that the development strategy on PCV30 Plus involves the development of PCV25. We find a strategy which is development and regulatory that will allow us to accelerate the 30 Plus by investing now in 25, which will come earlier, of course, to the market. I think there was a question also on the penetration of PCV, but right now, both pediatric and adult, we have very, very high market share. We reported actually 87% market share. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Courtney Breen with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHi everyone. Thanks for thanking Michael today, and thanks for the details on kind of how you're thinking about the R&D organization. Just a clarifier, and perhaps you can help us understand the strategy a little bit more here. It sounds like you're shifting into four R&D organizations. I also heard reference though to end-to-end areas. Can you talk about whether these are similar or different to how oncology was set up earlier this year or earlier last year? Additionally, can you talk a little bit about how you're allocating investment across R&D across those four separate engines? How are you making sure that the bar is high in all of those different therapeutic areas and ensuring you've got the right prioritization given the independence of these units?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOh, thank you. That's a great question. Chris, start, and then Andrew can chime in.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nYes, thank you very much for the question. For oncology, as you stated, since the beginning of 2023, we had an end-to-end organization covering discovery, early-stage development, late-stage development, as well as medical. We already had that in vaccines since 2009. Now we build the same structure for INI and internal medicine. Essentially, all four of those will be end-to-end organizations for quicker decision-making and quicker handover between discovery phase I and then from early development into late-phase development. Andrew, regarding the—\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nChief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, Courtney, you hit upon a critical question. Historically, when you look back, there's no shortage of first-in-class breakthrough molecules that we've successfully shepherded through development. However, some of those really have not delivered in terms of financial revenues and therefore to shareholders. The key issue is really ensuring that we have successful portfolio prioritization, bringing that commercial lens to much earlier during the process, and having estimates that are derived in an unbiased way and are dynamic, subject to continued revision.\nIn my role as chair of the PMT since I joined Pfizer, partnering with Chris, we've been working through that pipeline, starting with the late-stage assets, then moving earlier to make sure the decisions we make, drug by drug, indication by indication, are ones that are going to deliver value for shareholders as well as the patients.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you for the question, Courtney. I want also to chime in and say that in our R&D organization that we have right now, I think it's very, very, very strong capabilities. It's proven with the number of approvals. We have 13 last year and even the same number in 2023. No one even had even close to these numbers. If you see, our success rates are at 17% compared to 10%, 11% of the industry. Very few have this success rate.\nIn time to the market, we are having approximately 5.6 years when most of the industry is in seven, eight years after improvements. However, looking back, I don't think that we necessarily could have done way better in choosing the right products to focus our R&D capabilities, which is, I think, what now, Chris and Andrew, with the commercial assessments, will try to do. The good news is that if it was a question of capabilities to improve our R&D productivity, that would be a multi-year undertaking. When it is a question of refocusing your investments, that's way more quick. I'm very optimistic that the results will come out very, very quickly. With that, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Given Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s approval by the Senate Finance Committee this morning, can you walk me through how you plan on working with him as a likely head of HHS, especially with his views on vaccines and general skepticism of the pharma industry?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. I was also informed that the Senate committee voted in favor of him. I think his confirmation is pretty much secure right now. Of course, we will see what the full Senate will do. Look, I mean, we have, with the Trump administration, as a pharma industry, in particular, I will speak as Pfizer, a very good relationship. Personally, myself, I have a very long-lasting relationship with the president, but it was cemented during the operational war spree when we developed the vaccine for COVID.\nI know that the president is very proud of what he was able to accomplish, and he has made public statements on that. We met with Mr. Kennedy, actually, the president introduced me to him, and we had dinner all three together, and we tried to understand his views. I focused more not on the things that we clearly disagree, like the vaccines, but on the things that we can agree and we can do things together.\nThose are things in chronic diseases, in cardiovascular diseases, and, more importantly, in cancer, which is something that is very, very high in the mind of the president. It is also very high in the mind of Mr. Kennedy. I met him a few times also after that. We expect that we will have a collaboration. It's not my—do I expect that we will agree on everything on vaccines?\nI don't know, I think probably, as I hear all the statements that have been done by him and by the administration, he will have a way more tempered view on how to interact with the vaccines. I don't want to speak about him. I think there are a lot of opportunities that probably outweigh the risks that we have with the radical change that we will see from the Trump administration, actually, that we are seeing now with the Trump administration. I'm cautiously optimistic. Now, let's move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question, and congratulations on all the progress. I have a question on your breast cancer franchise. You recently announced a strategy for developing your CDK4 in first-line breast cancer as monotherapy and also in combination with the vepdeg, the ProTac. As the landscape evolves with other CDK4/6 inhibitors, different combinations, how do you see Pfizer's portfolio in breast cancer evolve over the next few years? Do you see this as the strategy as getting a piece of the broader pie, or are there areas with your CDK4 and with vepdeg where you think you could establish a niche? Also, with the phase III data from vepdeg expected any time in first quarter, what needs to happen with these data for it to be considered competitive? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nChris,\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nthank you very much. Thank you for the question. We are very fortunate because we've got a lot of optionality now in breast cancer. I'll start with CDK4. We believe this is a best-in-class CDK inhibitor in what we've seen for compliance and the rate of AEs, specifically treatment-related AEs, as well as discontinuations. We are very optimistic that CDK4 could not only replace Ibrance, but all CDK4/6 inhibitors in early-line breast cancer, including first-line, as well as potentially in the future, also in the adjuvant setting.\nAs Albert has mentioned, we are pleased that the first-line study is now ongoing, that CDK4, atevacyclib in combination with letrozole. To your point, we also expect the readout for vepdeg in the second-line setting with a D-risk study that includes ESR1 population, as well as all common population, and that medicine potentially could become a replacement for backbone endocrine treatment. We are planning a study in the first-line setting combining vepdeg plus CDK4 in first-line positive breast cancer.\nI also just quickly want to mention CDK6 because CDK6 is a differentiated epigenetic molecule. This is a first-in-category medicine. You've seen the data, very exciting, very encouraging data in later-line disease, and we're accelerating that also into a registration study with an ongoing phase III trial in second-line plus positive breast cancer. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Was there a question also for Daniel? No, it was not. Okay, good. Let's go now to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next with Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two for me on the pipeline. On Elrexfio first, just on the commercial side, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of uptake at the academic versus community centers? Are you seeing any broadening out into the community setting, or is that really going to be contingent on getting some of the earlier-line data that you're expecting later this year from the phase III trial? On Danuglipron, on the dose optimization study, can you just kind of clarify how much data you're going to share later this quarter? Will we get weight loss data? Will we get tolerability data? How much data will be in the initial press release? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Aamir?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP, Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. We're very excited about the momentum on Elrexfio. We continue to see increase in share and new patient starts quarter over quarter in the class. The uptake also does include community receptivity, awareness, and new account adoption. Obviously, with the whole slew of trials, assuming they're successful to follow, I think there's a lot of momentum behind Elrexfio.\nOver the course of this year, we expect it to grow rapidly, driven primarily by increased demand in our top 100 accounts, as well as increased adoption in the community setting, which I think positions Elrexfio very, very well for the future as we expand indications into earlier lines of therapy in 2026 and beyond.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer",
    "content2": "Thank you. Myself, I was quite impressed with the community oncologist uptake of this product as quickly as it's happened in the US. We have very good news for Elrexfio in the international market, Alexander.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nChief International Commercial Officer and EVP, Pfizer\n\nYeah, indeed. Elrexfio was commercially launched in already six markets in 2024 out of our top 15 markets, quite fast penetration. In 2025, we're expecting to get an additional 18 markets, and four additional of our top 15 markets will launch this year. The combination of the expanded access, plus the performance of the brands where we already have introduced the product, gives us great confidence for accelerated growth. To give you a sense, Japan is the second largest market outside of the US, and we had significant and very rapid demand in Japan where Elrexfio was introduced first to market, BCMA-specific.\nWe've seen an immediate acceleration of utilization, actually deep into the community in Japan. Where we've launched with other products, BCMA-specific, like in the UK, Spain, and Italy, these are markets where we have demonstrated the Elrexfio leadership, and we expect to continue this leadership position in 2025. The combination of increased access and where we already introduced growth expansions are two reasons why we believe the product has great performance.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nIn general, Elrexfio, because we do think that it is a mega blockbuster that will become. You need to understand that already in the first year, we've had more than $130 million of sales. This is in a very niche indication. This is triple refractory, which means patients that they have short duration of treatment, and they are really failed after everything else that was tried.\nAs we move to, we have four phase III studies, right? One could read this year. That not only triples the population, so we go to bigger population, but also expands significantly the duration of treatment. That it is true as we go to the next line and to the first line eventually. We think that in the US and international, this product will become a very big oncology product for Pfizer. With that, Daniel, please, Chris.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah, just what we stated earlier. In Q1, we expect the PK data. We are on target for that. Remember, this is looking at different formulations and will determine the dose selection for a once-a-day tablet, for a once-a-day approach for a potential taking forward into a registration strategy. Although you mentioned weight loss, weight loss is a secondary endpoint on the study. This is a smaller study. It's an in-unit study, so it may not be that reliable for weight loss on a small number of patients.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about Prevnar, how are you seeing Prevnar's share? I mean, you did talk about the market share here, but in terms of PEEPs versus adults, how are you seeing the market share evolving now that also vaccine nuance has an expansion in next US? There's also a lower adult eligibility in terms of age. Can you talk a little bit about these dynamics, and how do you see market evolving here?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAll right. Let's start with international, and we go to the US for a change.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nChief International Commercial Officer and EVP, Pfizer\n\nAll right. On Prevnar, as you know, international, 2/3 of the business comes from the pediatric indication. This kind of macro view with our Prevnar pneumococcal vaccine, we have maintained exclusivity in an IP of in about 140 markets around the world. That gives you the sense of the breadth of our pneumococcal vaccine.\nAs we move over time, our intention is, of course, to replace our Prevnar 13 with our Prevnar 20. Now we go into the details. In emerging markets, we have a very large cohort of babies every year, so around 76 million new babies. Of course, alongside our great collaboration with the Gavi organization, we have our commercial organizations where we have demonstrated this year a double-digit growth of our Prevnar franchise. A great execution in emerging markets. In the developed markets, following the EMA and the Japan approval, remember, in March only of 2024, we started to gain VTC approval and funding. Where we start to see that, we see that we are recapturing very quickly some of the business that went to competition. To give you an example.\nIn Japan, Prevnar 20, as I said, was approved in March. We got the VTC recommendation in October, and our market share in first dose went from 3% in September to 86% in December. We see that when the Prevnar 20 gets approved, we really have an opportunity to regain that business. On the adult side, here again, we've seen very strong growth in 2024. We continue to expect significant growth just because we are expanding access in more mature markets with our Prevnar 20 adults.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAamir, in the US?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP, Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nIn the US, let me start with the adult market. We have right now a very strong position in the adult market. We are going to face competitive pressure over the course of 2025 from Tepaxive, but we are confident that we will continue to maintain meaningful market share. A lot of that has to do with our commercial execution, as well as the fact that many accounts, particularly non-retail accounts, prefer to stock a single vaccine. We'll see that evolve over the course of the year.\nWhile we don't think that there's much catch-up opportunity in the 65-plus, we also think there is growth opportunity in the 50 to 64 age group that brings about 30 million adults into the eligible population. Those will be the dynamics in adults. Now, in PEEBs, there again, we have very significant market share. On the theme of improved market share across all of our vaccines, we saw a 12% improvement from August 2023 to December 2024 in our pediatric market share. Here, we expect this to be a much more stable market. We plan to retain that kind of leadership share, and we expect volumes to be more stable here.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Risinger\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes. Thanks very much, and thanks for all the updates. My question is just going back to RFK Jr. Assuming he is confirmed as HHS secretary, and given his history of suing manufacturers and his commentary on lawsuits in the hearings last week, could you just help us understand his ability as HHS secretary to remove US vaccine liability protections that manufacturers currently benefit from and allow manufacturers the freedom to develop and sell vaccines that save lives? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Look, I don't want to comment because these are legal issues, but I believe that the liability is through Congress approval. I don't think anyone can change that without, let's say, Senate approval. I know that creates a turbulence in the market today with RFK. It was almost certain that he would get confirmed. We have engaged with him early enough so that we can mitigate all the issues. If he does the things that he has said in the past, because during the hearings, of course, clearly he tempered his statements on vaccines, but if he tries to do some of the things that he said in the past, I think that he won't find in front of him the industry.\nHe will find in front of him the total medical community, the total scientific community, and payers that don't want to see a reduction in vaccinations because that's a very cost-effective way of controlling healthcare costs. More than important, this is not what the Trump administration would like to see in other health crises. I would say that I feel cautiously optimistic that they will be very, very prudent with everything they try to do. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Truong Nguyen with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTruong Nguyen\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi guys. Thanks for the questions. Just two from me. Firstly, going back to Abrysvo, I think AAamir noted potential policy changes in RSV. Do you have any insight if there's going to be a discussion from ACIP on revaccination or cohort expansion this year?\nI guess that could be a positive for your guide. Then, on Padcev's potential registration on the muscle-invasive bladder cancer trial, in general, I think cystectomy is used to cure patients in this setting. Just wondering how you're going to position this and how quick could you penetrate this population if approved? Thanks very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Very quickly, Aamir on Abrysvo, and then we go back to you.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP, Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. What I just got during were the catalysts that could result in market expansion for Abrysvo. Obviously, it's too early and not our place to comment on what exactly ACIP's going to take on it. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nChris from Padcev.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nThank you for the question. Reminded that this is an event-driven study, so we hope by the end of this year, but if the event doesn't happen, we'll move a little bit on. Muscle-invasive, about 28,000 population in the US alone, so it could more than double, as we mentioned, triple the population currently eligible. Currently, there's no standard of care treatment other than surgery, cystectomy, for patients considered cisplatin ineligible.\nThere are two studies, one for cisplatin-eligible and one for cisplatin-ineligible. For the cisplatin-eligible, the current landscape is dominated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There is a real need for both adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment and to replace chemotherapy in the setting of cisplatin-eligible disease. Of course, for cisplatin-ineligible disease, it will completely change the future treatment paradigm. We are very excited if these studies are positive and based on what we have seen. We have confidence in these data from earlier studies. Yeah.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will go next to Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. Just on QD danuglipron, it looks like you are using a bilayer immediate release in matrix technology here, but you do not actually test your bilayer formulation until the second half of your weight loss trial. Is that what your team's waiting on before you make a formal update, or is it perhaps the Lilly Orphan Glipron data that's also going to factor into this decision? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI don't think we have disclosed the technology. I know that there were speculations into the marketplace, but we haven't disclosed the technology. I'm not sure we can say much. Chris, you want to add anything?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nNo, I don't think we need to add right now. Yeah.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nNext, we go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Great.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Quick one on the pipeline, and another on business development strategy. On the pipeline, I noticed in phase II, you've advanced the GIP antagonist. Is that something that you'll be continuing to share data on, particularly as a monotherapy? Do you have any efforts ongoing to do a combination? In terms of business development strategy, I think the vocabulary you used included a capacity of perhaps in the $10 to 15 billion zip code.\nI am curious to know what you are solving for. I ask this in part because historically, there had been a view of using cash to acquire $25 billion in revenue by the end of the decade. Now, when we think about where we are in this decade and what you could be solving for structurally, there seem to be approaches sourcing assets from China, for instance. Many of your competitors are doing this. Are you solving for near-term revenues, or are you looking to use other methods, including perhaps partnerships over M&A? That would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Let me start a little bit on the BD, and also you can chime in. We had very clear that so far we have acquired $20 billion of revenues. We are very confident that we will hit this number. Very confident. So, so far, so good on that, right? Looking forward, of course, we are looking at more strategic opportunities right now, which will enhance pipeline in areas that we would like to play rather than near-term revenues on BD. I would ask Andrew to comment, and then if you can speak, Chris, about the GIP antagonist.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\nSure. Hi, Chris. Nice to hear your voice. On the BD side, Albert said the key word, which is strategic. Everything we do will be viewed through a strategic lens of building around our core competencies, or building competencies in areas that maybe we have not been in previously, if that's what we decide to do. On your point regarding China, it has not escaped our attention. Of course, the innovation from China across multiple therapeutic areas, and indeed, that was most evident with oncology some years ago, but now it's expanding to most therapeutic areas. They're mostly fast followers, but I expect that will change as well. It's an area that we are very, very active in. We continue to have very fruitful discussions, and let's just see where we go. I'll hand it to Chris.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nWe have a very strong footprint in China, and that includes not only commercial, but we have a very strong R&D footprint. They are looking at Chinese innovation because they are progressing very fast to identify opportunities. Chris,\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President, Research & Development, Pfizer\n\non the GIP antagonist, this is potentially a first-in-class oral small molecule GIP antagonist. It's currently in an ongoing phase II placebo-controlled study evaluating the GIP antagonist in adults with obesity on the background of GLP-1 receptor agonist. If the data from the phase II study are positive, we may potentially be able to develop also fixed-dose combinations, including with GLP-1, including potentially danuglipron in the future.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Alexandria Hammond with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for squeezing me in. On Vyndaqel, with new competitors on the market and on the way, can you walk us through how we should think about the near-term commercial dynamics? Where could we see the largest share impact, newly prescribed patients or switches? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Alex. Aamir?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP, Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Vyndaqel obviously had very significant momentum in 2024. You saw the growth rates, and that was due in large part to the commercial efforts, the attention, and investment we put behind it. We saw improvement in diagnosis rate as well as new patient starts. We also did benefit from what was a one-time bolus of annual enrollment patients in the first quarter of 2024 due to favorable affordability. As we look into 2025, there are both headwinds and tailwinds, and we're confident in the growth of Vyndaqel, obviously at a different rate than it grew in 2024.\nWe do see increased diagnosis education, growth in the prescriber base, and there will continue to be favorable affordability conditions. We do expect that there will be some headwinds. Obviously, you referred to two new market entrants that will have some impact that remains to be seen both on switching patients as well as new patient starts. I think it's also important to remember that there will be impact of IRA on Vyndaqel and the effect that it has on the calendarization of our GTN, with more of the GTN impact coming earlier in the year as we reach the catastrophic phase.\nNow, with all of that said, I think we remain really confident and excited. With Vyndaqel, we've got a robust clinical profile that has data both from the clinical trial and the long-term extension. We've got five-year real-world data on Vyndaqel. We've got strong access, and we are confident in our position as the standard of care.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nLet's move to the last question now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I have a question on just obesity strategy. To me, late-entrant companies with one lead asset might struggle unless they have real clinical differentiation. It could be in a better position if they have a collection of assets. There's naturally turnkey solutions out there in terms of companies that any larger company could either partner with or acquire outright. How is Pfizer looking at its BD efforts in this regard, either partnership or acquisition, that could bring you one or more assets that aren't far away from being in phase III?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAndrew?\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nChief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Hi, Tim. I agree with your assertion that obesity is heterogeneous and likely requires a set of tools encompassing both different modalities and different delivery devices in order to manage what is a lifelong condition. These assets do exist. Some are scattered. Some have portfolios. You could imagine that, of course, we are looking at all the opportunities and trying to understand what delivers most value to patients, and obviously to Pfizer shareholders.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. I think that concludes our call. Thank you all for your interest. 2024 was a strong year of performance, and our 2025 strategic priorities are very clear. We are planning to execute as well on them as we executed in 2024. Thank you very much, and have a nice day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nFrancesca DeMartino\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call, I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, and Dave Denton, our CFO, Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions.\n\nJoining us for the Q&A session are Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D, Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel, and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing [inaudible] non-GAAP financial measures, I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website at Pfizer.com.\n\nForward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Francesca, good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that we had a strong first half of the year, and our business is performing well. We drove progress in the second quarter with solid execution as we continue making a difference in the lives of patients around the world. Through the first six months of 2024, we reached more than 192 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. Today I will provide updates about how we continue advancing our key strategic priorities in the second quarter.\n\nI will also mention examples from just the past few weeks when we have achieved a series of regulatory approvals, pipeline advances, and other positive developments that we expect to fuel our progress through the rest of the year. We are pleased with the strong financial results coming from our disciplined execution. In the second quarter, for example, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2022, when our COVID revenues decreased [inaudible]\n\nToday, we'll talk about the recent additional aspects of our financial performance, as well, of course, our outlook, and then we will take questions. Before we go further, I will touch on some recent announcements about our leadership team and Board of Directors, I'll start with Michael Dolsten's coming departure. It's hard to find words that do justice to the substantial impact Michael has had during his 15-year tenure at Pfizer, Michael transformed our R&D engine, ultimately delivering 35 approvals that have been meaningful for millions of patients globally, I thank my colleague and my friend for his tremendous contributions to human health.\n\nI look forward to working closely with him over the coming months as we search for his successor, until then, Michael will continue to lead as our Chief Scientific Officer and President of Pfizer Research and Development. I want to welcome Andrew Baum, our new Chief Strategy and Innovation, Andrew brings deep clinical, scientific, and biopharmaceutical sector expertise, and we are fortunate to have him to help shape and guide our strategy. While Andrew is not able to join us today because he is relocating with his family to the United States, he will be with us for future corporate calls.\n\nI also want to mention there is the addition of Cyrus Taraporevala to our board. We are committed to strong governance supported by directors with a breadth of unique experiences and skills, exactly like Cyrus. Cyrus was the President of [inaudible] Global Advisors until he retired two years ago, and he brings vast experience in investment management and financial markets. We are thrilled to have him joining our board.\n\nNow I return to our performance. The five strategic priorities we set at the beginning of the year remain unchanged, with our focus on the most important opportunities for advancing and strengthening our company, we are confident we will remain on track in 2024.\n\nIn the second quarter, our colleagues moved our business forward in each strategic area. As a reminder, they are achieving world-class oncology leadership, delivering the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximizing the performance of our new product, expanding margins by realizing our cost base and allocating capital in ways that will enhance shareholder value. We believe we are well positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders. I want to reinforce our commitment to maintaining and growing our dividends over time. And, as Dave will discuss in more detail, we are raising our full year 2024 guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted diversity earnings per share.\n\nNow I'll turn to our progress towards achieving the first one, world-class oncology leaders. Last year, we acted on our bold vision of combining seasonally transformative ADC medicines with Pfizer's expertise, innovation, and scale. We believe we can help people with cancer live better and longer lives and capture a differentiated opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth for our company. At the halfway mark in 2024, we are on track to make this vision a reality, and we are pleased with the continued success of our integration.\n\nWe've had high rates of quality retention, and acquired seasoned products are contributing meaningfully to our efforts. In particular, PADCEV is rapidly progressing toward becoming the standard of care for patients with front-line locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. We are pleased with the strength of other key products across our conglomerate portfolio. XTANDI, LORBRENA, and the BRAFTOVI+MEKTOVI combination, for example, continue as significant growth drivers during this quarter. A robust oncology commercial performance in the first half of 2024 included full FDA approval for TIVDAK and European Medicines Agency approval for the TALZENNA+XTANDI combination. We also received positive CH&T opinions for the BRAFTOVI+MEKTOVI combination and for PADCEV.\n\nThe last one is a notable development because Pfizer receives royalty revenues for this product marketed in Europe by our partners. These highlights illustrate how we are already delivering breakthroughs that dramatically improve the lives of people with cancer. Of course, we are also working to develop future breakthroughs where we have the opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need. I will describe a recent pipeline highlight, starting with obesity.\n\nEarlier this month, we announced our plans to move forward with the development of DANUGLIPRON, our oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, that is the most advanced candidate in our robust clinical and preclinical obesity pipeline. In previously reported results from the phase 2b study in obesity, DANUGLIPRON demonstrated what we believe is good efficacy in it's twice daily formulation. For tolerability, we previously reported the maximum rate of GI adverse events across all those investigated. Looking at individual dose levels, in our Phase 2b, however, we observe tolerability profiles that are competitive for [inaudible]. Our efforts are now focused on developing the once-a-day formulation essential to delivering a competitive oral drug.\n\nWe are empowered by a pharmacokinetic study evaluating multiple modified release technologies and formulations. If strengthened our confidence in potentially delivering a competitive once-daily pill, a dose level expected to be escaped. We plan to conduct those immunization studies in the second half of this year, but they are intended to inform our registration-level studies. Obesity represents a growing area of patient need, and it is a key area of focus for Pfizer's R&D program, we believe this study's results, along with learnings from our previous Phase II studies and data that we have accumulated from more than 1,400 participant patients, leave us well-positioned to execute on a registration-enabling study as we work to deliver a competitive product in a rapidly-growing market.\n\nWhen we hosted our Oncology Innovation Day in February, we shared the pipeline milestones that would mark our success over the next year, and we are already demonstrating progress. A highlight was our strong presence at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting last month, which was anchored by three positive Phase III relapses. Follow-up data from the Phase III Crown Study of LORBRENA in patients without positive metastatic non-cell lung cancer, showed 60% of patients on LORBRENA were living beyond five years without disease progression. This strengthens LORBRENAS's position as an emerging standard of care in the front line setting.\n\nData from the Phase III ECHELON-3 study of ADCETRIS in combination with LENALIDOMIDE and RITUXAN demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and data from a Phase III study evaluating an additional ADCETRIS combination [inaudible]. So progression-free data in patients with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkins lymphoma while significantly reducing side effects compared to the standard of care regimen used in Europe in this setting.\n\nWe have advanced our oncology clinical pipeline in 2024 with Phase III studies for SIGVOTATUG VEDOTIN are Integrin beta-6 Directed-ADC, ATIRMOCICLIB, our selected CDK4 inhibitor, ELREXFIO in the second line setting in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, and MEVROMETOSTAT, our EZH2 inhibitors, plus are now moving to phase three and anticipate enrollment beginning in August. We will continue working towards our 2030 oncology strategy goals of delivering eight or more blockbuster medicines and doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines.\n\nWe also have Momentum with our Vaccine Drop, in our next-gen PCV candidate, for example, we have advanced to a Phase II program in both adults and pediatrics, based on encouraging clinical data that we received that highlight our industry-leading capabilities in expanding [inaudible] beyond [inaudible]. We expect to be highly competitive by offering the largest serotype coverage in a single vaccine while strategically addressing the persistent medical need across invasive disease, antibiotic resistance and [inaudible] serotypes.\n\nIn RSVV with ABRYSVO I'm pleased to report that yesterday we received approval for ABRYSVO Act-O-Vial presentation in the United States, a presentation that offers significant advantages, such as never-frozen, unique system-enabling, one-step reconstitution, high value by far. Additionally, we have submitted for label expansion in both the United States and Europe for adults 18 to 69.\n\nIn our malignant hematology programs, we are also driving progress, last week, we reported positive results from a Phase III study demonstrating the safety and efficacy of our one-time gene therapy candidates for people with hemophilia A. As we continue to advance our pipeline, additional milestones include expected updates later this year about our COVID/flu combination vaccine, about MARSTACIMAB for Haemophilia A and B, and for PONSEGROMAB for Cachexia, a wasting disorder associated with chronic disease. Now I'll turn to our strength with the commercial execution of our business\n\nAnother strategic area of focus is protecting and growing our core product portfolio while we also maximize the performance of our new products, we continue to see encouraging progress with our team's execution. NURTEC is an example of where we are rising to meet substantial demand, this product delivered strong results in the quarter, with 44% year-over-year global operational revenue growth. We see additional opportunities for expanding care in both acute and preventive use, as well as growth opportunities in international markets where we are making progress with our long-term goals. I hope Alexandre will be able to pass on that during the Q&A session.\n\nNow I will touch on a few additional products for our highlights. In the pediatrics segment, PREVNAR-20 continues to demonstrate strong performance that reinforces a leadership position among pneumococcal vaccines in the United States, where our market share grew to greater than 80%. During this quarter, the performance of ABRYSVO was in line with seasonal vaccine trends. We remain confident in our full-year performance as we believe we are well positioned to help address the expected rise in need later in the year among older adults at increased risk for RSV.\n\nLITFULO is a product we launched last year, and we are encouraged by strong demand, approximately 1 out of every 2 new patients on advanced systemic therapies is receiving a LITFULO prescription, a position we expect to grow as we continue focusing on execution. We view VELSIPITY as a promising and much needed option for adults with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, we are encouraged by recently securing preferred coverage for VELSIPITY as our first large national payer, we expect to see the impact of this in 2025, and now we are working to build on this with additional payers.\n\nWhen we consider core products in our portfolio, we are also seeing positive impact from strong execution, the VYNDAQEL family of products offers a good example of how we are making a difference for patients and our business. We are accelerating growth by working with physicians to drive improvement in identifying appropriate patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy, and helping patients to access and stay on the therapy once prescribed. With strong growth through the second quarter, we believe there is additional opportunity to identify more patients who can benefit from our VYNDAQEL products because of high unmet need, it is estimated that nearly half of those with this progressive and deadly disease have yet to be diagnosed. ELIQUIS was another significant contributor to our results, as we continued to claim a greater share in a growing oral anticoagulant and decoagulant market.\n\nNow, let me briefly wrap up. First, I would like to thank my more than 80,000 colleagues for the dedication they're show each day to our purpose of delivering breakthroughs that change patients lives. We are confident in our business, with our focus and execution, along with our deep expertise in driving innovation and advancing our pipeline, we believe we are on track to deliver on our full year financial commitments in 2024.\n\nI walked through our progress with three of our strategic priorities, and now Dave will cover our work to expand margins by realigning our cost base and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value as he discusses our financial performance and outlook. With that, I turn it to you, Dave.\n\nDave Denton\n\nEVP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone, as we close out the first half of this year, I'm very pleased by our second quarter results. We continue our relentless focus on execution, demonstrating our ability to both protect and grow our core brands, while also continuing to advance our science-led transformation by investing in key TAs to build durable franchises. Our initiatives to right-size off-backs and to reduce the cost of goods will result in a more efficient organization, setting the stage for strong capital returns and long-term improved shareholder value, enabling our commitment to both maintain and to grow our dividends.\n\nThis morning, I will briefly review our second quarter results, including some one-time items, touch on our capital allocation priorities, and wrap up with an update on our 24 financial guidance, our key priorities and expectations for the remainder of this year.\n\nTurning first to Q2 for performance versus the same period of last year, let's walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, reflecting operational growth of 3%. Our revenue and cash flow continue to be impacted by the post-pandemic COVID environment on a global basis, but to a much lesser extent than prior quarters.\n\nLooking at our business excluding our COVID products, we've demonstrated strong commercial execution across the enterprise, resulting in 14% operational revenue growth in the quarter. Performance was positively impacted by our continued focus on key products and geographies, refined allocation of commercial field resources globally, and further optimization of our marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance were our acquired products from Seagen, as well as Nurtec, alongside in-line products VINDAQEL, ELIQUIS, and XTANDI, as expected, dampening our growth in the quarter were XELJANZ and IBRANCE.\n\nAdjusted gross margin for the quarter was 79% compared to 76% last year, and this was primarily the result of scalable sales mix from our non-COVID products, as well as continued strong cost management across the manufacturing network. Improvement in our gross margin rate will continue to be a focus for the company over the next few years, as we execute on our recently announced manufacturing optimization program. This new program, and together with our cost realignment program, is focused on returning the company to pre-pandemic operating margins on a mixed-adjusted basis, excluding COMIRNATY.\n\nPhase 1 of the Manufacturing Optimization Program, which focuses on operational efficiencies, is well underway now. The first phase is expected to deliver approximately $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2027, some of which is anticipated to be realized beginning in 2025. Total Adjusted Operating Expenses increased 5% operationally to $6.3 billion and include spending from our legacy Seagen business. Looking at the components, adjusted SINA expenses increased 8%, driven primarily by marketing and promotional expenses for recently launched as well as acquired products.\n\nAdjusted R&D expenses increased 2% operationally, driven primarily by increased spending related to the acquisition of Seagen, partially offset by lower spending primarily the result of our cost realignment program. Q2 reported diluted earnings per share was $0.01, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.60. Unique one-time items included in our GAAP results and excluded from our adjusted results this quarter include a $1.3 billion charge related to our Manufacturing Optimization Program, primarily for [inaudible], and a $230 million charge for IP R&D asset impairment and other related costs associated with the discontinuation of our D&D program.\n\nAdditionally, we expect to record a charge of approximately $400 million in the third quarter of 2024 after a decision was made in July to sell one of our facilities as a result of the discontinuation of the DMD effort. Now, let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value, our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time. Reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return, and finally, making value-enhancing share repurchases after delivering our balance sheet.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders via our dividend, invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D, and, as expected, the completed business development activity was minimal. Our commitment to de-levering our capital structure to a growth leverage target of three and a quarter times remains a key priority. In support of that goal, year-to-date, we have paid down approximately $2.25 billion in maturing debt, including $1 billion dollars in May of outstanding notes, and though we did not monetize any Haleon shares in Q2, we expect to resume monetization of our 23% Haleon stake in the future.\n\nI would also note that once our Haleon ownership is less than 20%, our accounting will transition from recording equity income, and it will no longer be included in our adjusted results. This change is factored into our long-term financial planning as well as our guidance. As we've previously stated, we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels this year, and particularly during the first half of fiscal '24, due to the decline of certain payments and one-time expenses.\n\nWe expect a heavy weighting of revenues to the fourth quarter as our businesses becomes more seasonal in nature with the potential that a high level of cash collections may carry over into Q1 of '25, despite this near-term pressure, clearly, our objective remains to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time. Now, let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of the year, we enter 2024 focused on delivering on our financial commitments, as well as on commercial performance.\n\nWith a successful first half now complete, we believe it is appropriate to update our four-year earnings outlook to reflect our strong business performance, I'll remind you that our revised guidance assumes the seasonal cadence of our product portfolio and that we expect PAXLOVID results to trend with infection rates. With that said, we are raising our full-year revenue range by $1 billion and our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.30, we now expect revenues in the range of $59.5 to $62.5 billion dollars, and operational revenue growth, excluding COVID products, is now projected to be 9% to 11%.\n\nCOVID product revenues are now expected to be $8.5 billion dollars for the year, $5 billion dollars for COMIRNATY, and $3.5 billion dollars for PAXLOVID. Our guidance for adjusted SINA and adjusted R&D remains unchanged, while our effective tax rate on adjusted income is now expected to be approximately 13%.\n\nAnd lastly, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.65, primarily reflecting the increase to the top line and the revised tax rate, among other items. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs.\n\nIn closing, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion dollars of net savings from our cost realignment program by the end of this year. This improvement in our cost base, alongside our new initiatives focused on manufacturing, is expected to put us on a strong footing toward margin expansion and improved financial returns. Additionally, our continued focus on execution and our recent investments have positioned the company for continued success moving forward. This quarter's results are a testament to the performance of our commercial business and our prudent approach to improving our cost base.\n\nThough we've had a strong first half, we do not take lightly the continued focus needed to deliver in the second half, considering the seasonality of our respiratory products. We are clearly striving to bring about improved performance on both top and bottom lines through focus, execution, and delivering on our near-term commercial and financial goals. 2024 is clearly a foundation year for Pfizer. Our achievements to date set the stage for generating compelling shareholder value, through our science-led transformation, we will methodically build on this space with breakthroughs and innovations driving growth in the back half of this decade. And with that I'd now like to turn it back over to Albert to start our Q&A.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYes, thank you, Dave, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star Q. Once again, that is star number one to ask the question. We will pause for a moment to allow questions to queue. We'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Candor, please go ahead.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nGlobal President, Worldwide Research and Development & Medical, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYeah, we are, as Albert said in the oral remarks, doing the dose optimization for PK and formulation to select potential doses for, pending data progression to Phase III, and we expect to share that first quarter.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nMikael, do you want to address this very quickly?\n\nThank you very much, let's move to the next question\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAnd that's a question for Dave\n\nDave Denton\n\nEVP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nYeah, so, Mohit, just a couple things, as you recall in my prepared remarks, we are focused on and actually launched our Manufacturing Optimization Program, the result of which will begin to yield results in 2025 and to generate over $1.5 billion dollars in savings by 2027. As we think about margin expansion, just given the guidance that I provided for the balance of this year, it would imply that gross margin rates would actually improve versus the low 70's total that we've given previously, to probably the mid-70s at this point in time.\n\nWe do expect that all these investments, both our cost realignment program and our investments from the manufacturing optimization program, are all designed to improve operating margins to get us back to pre-pandemic levels in the near future.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. Operator, the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYeah, thank you, Terence, some very good questions. RSV, why don't Aamir and then Alexandre speak about the roles, and then Chris, you cover the rest.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nHey Terrence this is Aamir, for ABRYSVO, I think we are very well positioned going into the fall season in the U.S. for three main reasons. One is contracting, so we have significantly strengthened our contracting position, many of those decisions were confirmed shortly after the June ACIP and are set to take effect in August, commensurate with the beginning of the season. The second is the ACIP guidance itself, with a recommendation for a single dose for all adults over 75 and those 60 to 74 that are at increased risk, we think that is clear and strengthens the directive for those who are eligible for a vaccine.\n\nAnd then thirdly is just ABRYSVO itself, we've got great data, including two seasons of durable efficacy data, as Albert alluded to earlier, we have both our current needle-free constitution kit that is never required to be frozen or thawed, as well as our new active bio system, which offers many advantages, including 80% storage efficiency, so, there's good options for customers. And I will also remind you that there's many healthcare providers in pharmacies that prefer simplifying their vaccine management by having one vaccine for both older adults and maternal, which only ABRYSVO can offer. So, the combination of contracting, the ACIP guidance, and the value proposition of ABRYSVO positions as well.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAnd Alexandre, what about the international market?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nYes, Terence, good question on ABRYSVO. We are making great progress as well on the international front, [inaudible] approval, remember, in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the UK. We already are progressing nicely with the vaccine technical committee [inaudible] positively ABRYSVO, so we've got positive recommendations in the UK, in France, in Canada, in Australia, and several other markets, and in Saudi Arabia as well. So, we're moving very nicely, that's right that actually the UK authorities have selected ABRYSVO for RSA prevention in older adults, as well as maternal immunization for pediatrics for the next two years with an option of an additional two years.\n\nAnd we also were selected in Canada specifically also for adult vaccination.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nSo, good news for Pfizer, and let's go to Chris now.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you for the question on ELREXFIO, as you saw, we recently demonstrated the updated median overall survival data for ELREXFIO in the intent-to-treat 123 patient population in the late Lyme disease, we see an overall survival of 24.3 months, and which we believe is differentiated. ELREXFIO also has a differentiated profile in terms of the safety profile, as well as other factors, including subcutaneous administration and plus non-waste-based dosing, and a flexible dosing regimen overall.\n\nAnd we've now launched in 16 countries, and, in fact, in Japan, we were the first to launch, and its early days, we've also recently got approval in the EU and UK. In the US, total demand is +40% growth sequentially quarter over quarter, and early next year or during 2025, you'll see the lead out for the bigger opportunities, which are MagnetisMM-5 in the double-gloss exposed population, and then later in the year potentially MagnetisMM-32 which is post-CD38. The overall view remains confident that we've got a very differentiated molecule that could become a back bone across the continuum of care for multiple myeloma.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Alex Hammond with Bank of America.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, great questions. Aamir and and then Alexandre.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nNow it's on NURTEC in the US, I think there are a number of things that we did in the first half of the year to strengthen our demand. So we revamped all of our consumer activation efforts, we sharpened the clinical value proposition and how we communicated that, including but not only limited to the fact that we have an indication for treatment and prevention. We also realigned our field forces to ensure that we're really maximizing activation of both primary care and neurologists providers.\n\nAnd then we made a lot of efforts through the co-pay support and other means to just reduce friction in patients actually getting access to NURTEC once a script is written. And so what you see this quarter for us is a combination of all of those things starting to take effect. The Nurtec TRX was up 28% over the prior year, revenues were up close to 39% in the US. We maintained leadership from a TRX and a NRX perspective at 49% and 48%, respectively, and there were 9,000 new NURTEC writers, so that's about 85% of all new CGRP writers. So as we look forward, we continue to see strength in Nurtec demand, we'll continue to manage the gross finance dynamics of that business, but we are optimistic about where we take it from here.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you. Alexandre.\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nYeah, on the international front, we also have expanded access and the number of countries where we have introduced the product. As you know, the growth that you see in the second quarter, this is the first quarter of 2024, is really the effect of the introduction of Biotech in China at the beginning of this quarter. As of today, we have Biotech members in 15 countries, including some of our key markets and [inaudible], and what we see is once we get reimbursement, we have a significant uplift in demand, and so our focus now is to increase access and reimbursement in some of our key markets.\n\nMoving forward, we see significant growth behind Biotech, and the reason behind that is that there is today, at the international level, less than half of the diagnosed patients are treated with prescription medicine, so that's why we think we have an opportunity with Biotech. And we believe Alexandre, what we hear is we've got almost 55 countries registered, NURTEC in international markets, 55 markets, of course 15 we have seen already a reimbursement, and we're waiting for the remaining 40 receive reimbursement. Let's move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Akash Tewari, with Jeffries.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nMikael\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nGlobal President, Worldwide Research and Development & Medical, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, as you know, we have worked over several decades in optimizing how to expand the number of serotypes while maintaining strong immune responses for as many as possible. We have not disclosed yet how many serotypes we have, we have recently pursued expansion of that next gen into Phase II of both pediatric and adult, and look forward to adult data coming quite soon, which will allow us to move swiftly in that indication.\n\nWe have made significant improvements on existing and new serotypes with new technologies, and that is these capabilities, so it's not just about having the highest number of serotypes, it's really to show the consistency and the data before you can draw any conclusions. So we remain very confident in our ability to defend our leadership position and continue to expand it through this new technology toolbox.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Mikael. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Chris Shibutani of Goldman Sachs.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nSo thank you Chris, I'd like Aamir to speak a little bit about ELIQUIS specifically, and then, Dave, can you cover the general impact of IRAs?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Inc.\n\nChris, as you noted, BMS led the discussions with CMS on ELIQUIS maximum fair price because they are the NDA holder, and they shared their perspective on that process during their earnings call last week. Honestly, we don't have much to add to what they said, we share their view that we have the ability to navigate the impact of IRA on ELIQUIS, and ELIQUIS will be an important drug in our portfolio for the foreseeable future.\n\nDave Denton\n\nEVP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nYeah, and then I just add to that, you know, as we look at IRA across our platform, first, I think we were very fortunate at Pfizer that we had one product selected. And secondly, if you look at the remaining products that are likely to be, that could potentially be selected, they are nearing the end of their patent protection life. So if you think about it from a present value perspective, the impact on Pfizer is somewhat muted when you think about it economically.\n\nI will say this is a piece of legislation that clearly is harmful to supporting research and development in the sector, so we were hopeful that this could be changed in the future, but we will continue to actively manage our way through this.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you Dave. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd as a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question today, please press star one. We'll take our next question from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYes, Mikael, why don't you give a little bit on the obesity candidate? Other than Danu.\n\nYeah, as we heard from Albert, Danu is a more advanced drug with a large tolerability strength and efficacy experience, as always, in our project, we have additional drugs in the same class in phase one, it's in stage one, performing as expected. We have another mechanism of action that would combine with oral GLP, such as Danu later in the development of a life cycle, and we have other mechanisms to protect heart and kidney, that could also be part of an internal medicine, larger cardiometabolic transplant. Thank you.\n\nAnd What about the cost reduction for Danu?\n\nDave Denton\n\nEVP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nYeah, so let me just anchor us on a few facts here. First, the cost reduction effort that we have currently initiated is Phase I of a multiple phase program, so this $1.5 billion savings is only a part of the story, we will tell more of the story as we define the program more specifically, so you get more clarity on that. Secondly, if you look at the $1.5 billion dollars cost improvement effort, if you think about that on a cost of goods sold platform, we're probably closer to $16 billion dollars versus $15 billion dollars, this is an anchor point.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAamir, about maternal RSV.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nSure, Kripa, so thanks for the question. I think, let me start by just underscoring the interest that we see in maternal vaccination. So, when you talk to OBGYNs, there's a clear preference that they have to vaccinate during pregnancy, and similarly, you hear the same from pregnant mothers. Greater than 50% prefer vaccination versus vaccinating the baby, or maternal vaccination. So, our launch on maternal did exceed our expectations, so, we saw uptake rates through the end of January with about 11% of eligible mothers taking the vaccine, and that is significantly higher than other maternal immunization at the same point in the life cycle, I think TIDVAK was less than 2% at the same time.\n\nSo, the other thing I will note is it does require education, as you note, and last year's maternal ACIP recommendation occurred just after the RFC maternal vaccination season began. So, this season, we have the benefit of using the first half of the year to invest in that education of both HCPs as well as pregnant women, and we look forward to the season ahead.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAnd the International [inaudible]?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYes, very few points, just to say that following the approval, we also had great progress on the Vaccine Technical Committee on Vaccination in Maternal. In the UK, we received positive recommendations, as well as in France, in Australia, Belgium, Australia, Argentina, so many others, and including an interesting one, which is the PAL for Latin America, and now, we are progressing into access, final access into those markets.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAnd about the competitiveness of PADCEV, Chris?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you for the question. We're very pleased that in this quarter, as you've seen, we printed just shy of $400 million for PADCEV, with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth of 15%, and based on the claims data through the end of May, we are seeing U.S. first-line share increasing into the low 50% range, and as you know, the next opportunity is obviously in [inaudible] Bladder cancer, with two ongoing studies being conducted by Merck, which can expand the population to include and an additional 28,000 addressable patients. So overall, we are seeing that PADCEV with PEMBROLIZUMAB is becoming entrenched in the first-line setting as the standard of care, and future studies, including future nectin, [inaudible] medicines, radioligands, or ADCs, will likely have to do studies against PADCEV+PEMBROLIZUMAB in the first-line setting, which could be challenging.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAamir, what about the stocking?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYeah, so I'm just going to provide context on the U.S. performance dynamics. So the change year-over-year is predominantly a result of lower adult demand due to shrinkage of the opportunity size in that market, and the quarter-to-quarter change that you see is a function of the CDC order timing for pediatric vaccines, which tends to be quite lumpy, as well as some of the adult vaccination dynamics of both shrinkage and seasonality. And I think it's important to continue to think about these two segments very differently in the US, so with pediatrics, as Albert mentioned in his remarks, we exited Q2 with a share of 81%, which is up 71% in August.\n\nAnd then the adult market continues to behave differently in the US in that it is contracting because there are just fewer eligible 65+ adults and a more difficult to activate younger population, and that's the same population that Merck's B116 will be launching.\n\nAnd in the international market?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nInternational, as you see, the first quarter and second quarter together for the [inaudible] grew by 6%, and this is in line with our expectations. What we see is, of course, we are going to capitalize on the very strong franchise that we have on PREVNAR 13 with 140 exclusive NIP around the globe. And so as we get PREVNAR 20, we think we're going to launch this product and switch from 13 to 20. Now in adults, it's a very interesting dynamic because in adults, our vaccination was in Europe and outside of developed countries quite limited, now that we see PREVNAR 20 registered and validated by VTC, we see significant pick-up.\n\nAnd I will give you an example, in Germany, we got a VTC recommendation for 60 and above, all comers, and uptick from 18 to 59, and there in Germany, since the beginning of the year, we've seen significant growth. We expect that we will have similar trends in other major markets in Europe.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, and Chris?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Development Officer, Oncology, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you very much for the question on KAT6. KAT6 is a first in category medicine, we're very proud that this medicine was conceptualized and discovered at our laboratories in La Jolla. As you've seen, with the most recent data, the object response rate is over 35%, the same durable responses, and it is well tolerated. We therefore plan to initiate a Phase III program over the next 6 months, and you'll learn more about that, but thank you for the question, we're also excited about PADCEV.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, we are very excited about this. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nMikael?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nGlobal President, Worldwide Research and Development & Medical, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYes, for your questions, we'll likely present a comprehensive data set on PK after collecting all the data from the two studies, but we are looking into what's the best way to share it in a timely manner. We have some of the most aggressive timelines when we agree a protocol with the regulatory agency and pending data, and as Albert has said, if that becomes the case that we move forward with pending data, you can bet that, like every Pfizer program, it will be verified.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you Mikael, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nChris, given that, for the interest of time, let me tell you about Danu. We have said it multiple times, but it's going to be PK data right now, we have done with Danu 1,400 patients, so we feel very comfortable about the profile, we know the product. Right now, the question is if we have a formulation that will allow us to take this product into phase three, registration, and enabling studies.\n\nWe made an announcement because we feel that what we saw from the first round of testing multiple formulations, we felt encouraged that we have several that can deliver and one that it was the preferred one, and it is the one because it was the best of all, and now we are going to test it. Also, we can't speculate if tolerability will be better or not because of once a day compared to twice a day because we don't have the data.\n\nBut as I said in my prepared remarks for Danu, the profile that Danu right now has, based on the 1,400 patients that we have seen, is very competitive both on tolerability and efficacy with whatever we have seen from others in the oral space so far. And in terms of timing, right now, with everything we know, we are the only one with two big data on an oral GLP-1 after, of course, [inaudible]. So, right now, for everything we know, we should be the second after [inaudible] if this Danu progresses into registration-enabling status. Now, let's go to RSVN, Aamir.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nSo, Chris, what I would say is we are only in the second season now of a standing market, right? So, you had your first season last year, this year, with the ACIP recommendation, as I mentioned earlier, we think that that provides clarity and strengthens the need for those identified in the recommendation to get a vaccine. And we've had another six months plus of opportunity to educate ACPs, as well as consumers, and we see a growing relevancy and urgency among people who vaccinate, so, we do think that the opportunity is [inaudible].\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, operator next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolf Research.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nTim, I don't know. They have the decision-making, so they will do what they think, I can't comment on that. I know they discussed that thing, so I will emphasize once more. If TMS says that that was a big win for them against [inaudible] so what I would say was the whole low of IRA. It is a very big loss for innovation and for the crown jewel of the American industry, which is life science technology physics.\n\nBut, you know, it is the law of the land, and we are doing our best to make sure that we minimize any impact, particularly in the future, because for now, as the days that said we were probably the next few years. The NGVs that are at stake for us are quite small because mostly we were fortunate not to have them, up to four products, so let's pick only one. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAamir, why don't you take the first one?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nSure, so, Steve, on VYNDA, maybe what's going on now and then what's to come with competition. So, VYNDA is continuing to grow at a very healthy cliff, this is the result of multiple factors, a very important one of which is that we are focused on expanding our HCP base that we're targeting, as well as really investing in diagnosing and identifying patients. Diagnosis remains the biggest unmet need in this condition, because almost half of patients are still undiagnosed, so, we do see a lot of growth opportunity in VYNDA.\n\nNow, for this year, it may not continue as the same cliff that we've seen in Q1 and Q2 because we had a big bolus of enrollment patients at the beginning of the year, partially as a result of some of the IRA reforms, and the incremental diagnose is becoming harder and harder to find, but we do expect continued growth with VYNDAQEL. As far as competition, there's still a lot that needs to be understood exactly about the competitors, their data, their profile, what actions they're going to take. But what I will say is that we obviously welcome more treatment options for patients, but there's a lot that we're very confident in with VYNDA.\n\nThere's a body of clinical evidence that includes five-year follow-up, clinical trial data and real-world evidence, including statistically significant mortality and CB hospitalization data that is in our label, as well as quality-of-life benefits that we think continue to position VYNDA well. But, of course, with competition coming in, we will take that into consideration and provide further guidance as things evolve.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.",
    "content2": "Thank you, and, again, in the interest of time, for the RSV, when we provided the $2 billion dollars, it was in the framework of a pipeline asset, what is the key potential annually? We don't give them once the products are registered, typically, projections, not even for the peak years. But what I would say, if anything, things have become more promising since the time that we gave these $2 billions because we were all surprised how much the medical community and the recommended authorities are putting emphasis on the disease. So that's my comment, sorry I couldn't be more specific to you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYes, for the next gen, I will make it easy. We announced that we entered into Phase II studies, both in pediatrics, and so one can calculate, we can't comment on how long it will take because these are event-driven studies, particularly when you go into Phase III. So we don't know how long that will take, and we don't comment at this stage. But let's go to Paxlovid and explain the dynamics of it.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nYeah, so for PAX in the US, you know, you pointed to the momentum in Q1, which I'll remind you was a combination of both true health, as well as ongoing utilization that was very high given the wave of COVID infections. What happened then is that in the first half of Q2, infections were low, and the very clear trend that we see with PAXLOVID is when there is a COVID infection wave, we have healthy PAXLOVID utilization. So starting in May, all the way through June, there was increased COVID infection waves, and our PAXLOVID utilization followed.\n\nSo we had about 35,000 treatment courses a week in April and May, peaking to about 100,000 in June, so we have seen continued utilization. Now, it is trickier for wholesalers and end customers to manage utilization around a disease that is a little bit unpredictable, so we did enter Q2 with higher-than-normal inventory levels, but the wave of utilization that we've seen in Q2 has helped normalize those inventory levels. And all of this dynamic, combined with the fact that we've built a commercial model to successfully get PAXLOVID to those who need it, including very healthy coverage with commercial payers.\n\n90% of pharmacies across the US already participating in our USG Pax program, and a simplified model for delivering that Pax program to patients, when there is a COVID infection wave, we're confident about Paxlovid utilization.\n\nAnd just real quickly, as you think about the guidance, I think your question was, was this what was dri-\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThe technicians have told me to wait a moment, please, otherwise we will stop the call here.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our final question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nEvan, so this, as I mentioned earlier, yes, we do expect to see continued growth momentum for VYNDA in the back half of this year, and going forward, for the reasons I described earlier, it may not be at the level that we saw in the first half of the year because of the Q1 bolus of patients. But the combination of what we're doing in terms of physician expansion, investment in driving diagnosis, and tailwinds from IRA reform do give us conviction around short-term VYNDA growth.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Pfizer Inc.\n\nAamir.\n\nYeah, and when it comes to, you know, IEP right now, it's very difficult, once a product is getting generic, to be able to fight with a new molecule unless you have substantial differentiation, and, you know, VYNDAQEL has tremendous efficacy. So, we do not expect that the market will continue to be as big, particularly for us, after the seed generics enter in brief, so, thank you for the question.\n\nSo I just want to make some closing remarks, we had a very strong first half of the year, and we are confident that we will deliver on our full year financial commitments in 2024. We are driving progress with solid execution as we continue to sell patients and grow our business, execution makes the difference. Thank you for your interest in Pfizer, and we hope you have a wonderful day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program, thank you for your participation, you may disconnect at any time.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nFrancesca DeMartino\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer and SVP, Pfizer\n\nGood morning and welcome to Pfizer's Earnings Call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of 2024 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D; Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and AAamir Malik, EVP and Chief US Commercial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and our disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. In the first quarter, we had a solid start to the year, and we are cautiously optimistic about what we will achieve in 2024. I'm pleased and appreciative of how our Pfizer colleagues are executing with discipline as they focus on the patients and others we serve. This helped us deliver a strong performance during the quarter in our non-COVID product portfolio, drive progress towards our oncology leadership, advance our pipeline, and continue to strengthen our business. Today, we'll discuss highlights from the quarter and provide updates about how we are continuing to make progress with the five strategic priorities we shared with you at the start of the year. We are proud of the positive impact we achieved around the world with our deep capabilities and global scale.\nThrough the first three months of the year, we reached more than 119 million patients with our medicines and vaccines. We will continue to build on Pfizer's 175-year history of driving medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs as we maximize the opportunities in front of us. Our confidence in the year ahead comes from our focus on executing the strategic priorities that we believe will deliver operational, commercial, and financial success across our business. The priorities are: achieve world-class oncology leadership, deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, maximize performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. In the first quarter, we made notable progress with each one, and I will share some highlights.\nMany of you joined us in our Oncology Innovation Day in February, and I hope you found it to be a valuable opportunity to see how we are well-positioned to achieve world-class oncology leaders. We are pleased with the excellence we have been able to achieve in both integration and commercial execution. With a strong mix of Pfizer and Seagen colleagues in the newly combined team, we believe we have one of the most experienced and talented groups of oncology leaders in the industry. We are also already seeing the benefit of strong commercial execution with our newly cross-trained sales and field medical teams.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, our oncology revenues grew 19% operationally over the same quarter a year ago, driven in part by the acquisition of the foreign line products from legacy Seagen, in particular, the strong ongoing launch of PADCEV in frontline locally advanced metastatic urothelial cancer, regardless of cisplatin eligibility, following FDA approval based on the groundbreaking EV-302 data. We have an increased demand for XTANDI, which continues to be a backbone therapy across the prostate cancer treatment continuum. We have continued growth from LORBRENA, which could emerge as the potential first-line standard of care in ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Earlier this week, we also announced the full FDA approval of TIVDAK to treat recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. TIVDAK is the first antibody-drug conjugate to have positive overall survival data for patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.\nGoing forward, we are guided by a strategy focusing on our greatest opportunities to make a difference for patients with cancer. With the power of our deep expertise, broad and diverse portfolio, and global scale, we are confident we are well on our way toward our 2030 goal of doubling the number of patients treated with our innovative cancer medicines, increasing the number of blockbuster medicines in our portfolio from five today to eight or more, and driving an anticipated tenfold increase in the proportion of revenue from biologics. This is important because it brings the potential to provide more durable revenue based on several factors, including inflation reduction considerations, and the greater challenges of coping with complex biologics. We will look forward to sharing continued updates with you on the progress in accelerating oncology breakthroughs. Now, I'll turn to our progress in delivering the next wave of pipeline innovations.\nIn oncology, during the quarter, we had three pivotal phase III study starts, including the first phase III trial for our selective CDK4 inhibitor, atimoside, our integrating beta-6 directed ADC, sigvotatug vedotin SV, and the fourth phase III trial for ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma. At the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, we will present data spanning each of our tumor areas of focus and core scientific modalities, including new five-year progression-free survival data for LORBRENA, basic data for ADCETRIS in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and additional developments from across our deep and diverse pipeline. We are also driving continued execution beyond oncology, with a sharpened focus on key value drivers expected to build potential multi-billion dollar product portfolios. Through the first quarter, we are on track with delivering on our anticipated milestones and have important updates in both our growing respiratory and hematology portfolios.\nWith ABRYSVO, we believe we have the opportunity to further expand what is currently the broadest approved range of patients for the RSV vaccine, including adults 60 years and older, and infants from birth to six months via maternal immunization. We recently reported positive results from the phase III MONeT trial evaluating ABRYSVO in adults aged 18 to 59 at increased risk for RSV disease. The trial met its primary endpoints, and we intend to submit this data to regulatory agencies. We believe ABRYSVO has the potential to become the first and only RSV vaccine for adults 18 years and older. Hematology is another priority area. With the progress of recent and near-term milestones, we are confident that we could establish a potential multi-billion dollar product portfolio across hemophilia and sickle cell disease.\nWe recently received the first US FDA gene therapy approval for Pfizer with FDA approval of BEQVEZ, a one-time gene therapy for adults with hemophilia B. This program builds upon our growing presence in hemophilia. We expect an FDA decision before year end for marstacimab, which has the potential to become the first once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for the hemophilia B market, and the first treatment delivered as a flat dose for both hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Moving to sickle cell, we recently started the phase III study of osivelotor, our potentially best-in-class next-generation hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor. We are committed to addressing the underserved needs of the sickle cell disease community, and we are leveraging our capabilities for potential breakthroughs for this patient. Now, I will turn to our strategic priority of maximizing performance of our new products.\nWhile it may take a year to realize the full benefit of the change we put in place as we speak to bring a more efficient structure to a commercial operation, we are pleased by the impact we are already seeing from our sharpened focus, and Pfizer colleagues embracing our high-performance culture. Earlier, I mentioned the momentum of our oncology product. Our Pfizer US commercial, Pfizer International commercial organizations are also moving ahead in driving progress with growth in their respective markets. We have several potential key growth drivers for this year and into year 2025. With ABRYSVO, we are very pleased with the positive data in the 18 to 59 age group that differentiates our product, and we are encouraged by the opportunities to continue increasing overall RSV market growth and market share.\nAnother example is our enthusiasm for the potential of NURTEC to help the more than one billion people living with migraine worldwide. With all of CGRP penetration leaving room for potential significant growth, we will continue to focus on reducing access barriers for healthcare professionals and patients, as well as on education through direct-to-consumer market. With OXBRYTA, we will continue to educate healthcare professionals and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic and proactive treatment. VELSIPITY is coming off its annual launch, and we are focused on ensuring patient access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. I will mention LITFULO. We will work toward continuing to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate patients with alopecia areata, and further unlock access to LITFULO.\nAdditionally, we continue to protect and grow our core brands and key blockbusters, including PREVNAR, VYNDAQEL, and ELIQUIS, and Evidence. In a moment, Dave will provide updates on how we are also making progress with two other strategic priorities. The two other strategic priorities: expanding margins by realigning our cost base, and allocating capital to enhance shareholder value. When we consider what we achieved in the first quarter, along with our continued progress in executing our five strategic priorities, we are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead. We are continuing to focus on commercial execution, protecting and growing our products, and driving strong starts with new commercial launches. With the progress we are making in advancing our cost realignment program, as well as our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and our continued execution, we have raised our outlook for 2024 adjusted earnings per share by $0.10.\nWe have confidence in our company. With some of the most experienced and talented colleagues in the industry, we have demonstrated many times before that we are very good at execution, and we expect to continue delivering life-changing medicines for hundreds of millions of patients globally, and meaningful value for our shareholders. Now, I will turn it over to Dave to discuss the financial performance during the quarter, as well as our progress in strengthening our business and enhancing shareholder value. Dave?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we continue to navigate a challenging post-COVID environment, I'm pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start. We are both protecting and growing our core brands while investing in building a more effective organization. Our relentless focus on execution is positioning Pfizer to improve shareholder returns.\nThis morning, I'll briefly review the highlights of our first quarter results. I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities. I'll wrap up by outlining our 2024 financial guidance, as well as our key priorities for the remainder of this year. Turning to the first quarter, let me walk down the P&L. Total company revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, reflecting an operational decline of $3.5 billion, or 19% versus last year. As you know, our business continues to be negatively impacted by a declining COVID environment on a global basis. To that end, we expect our COVID products will continue to have an outsized effect on both our top line and our bottom line throughout this year. However, I do want to point out that we expect our COVID products will continue to be contributors to both revenue and cash flows for the foreseeable future.\nStrong commercial execution across the enterprise drove 11% operational revenue growth in the quarter when you exclude COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. Performance was positively impacted by our renewed focus on key products and markets, refined allocation of commercial field resources globally, and further alignment of marketing resources into key priority areas. Contributing to this performance were our acquired products from Seagen, alongside inline products such as VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS, and ABRYSVO. Dampening our growth in the quarter was the expected lower global demand for IBRANCE and SULPERAZON, driven largely by lower demand in China in the first quarter of 2024 versus last year. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter improved by 530 basis points to 79.6% versus Q1 of last year. This improvement was driven by three factors. First, were lower sales of COMIRNATY resulting in favorable sales mix.\nSecond, in the quarter, we recorded a product return adjustment for PAXLOVID associated with our US government contract. I'll touch upon that in just a moment. Finally, we executed strong cost management across our manufacturing network. Improvements in our gross margin rate will continue to be an important focus for the company going forward. Total adjusted operating expenses increased modestly by 1% to $5.9 billion compared to Q1 of last year, despite adding expenses associated with the acquired Seagen business. This disciplined cost control puts us squarely on track to delivering on our $4 billion net savings commitment by the end of the year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 3% operationally in the quarter, driven by an increase in marketing and promotional expenses for recently acquired or launched products, partially offset by a decrease in expenses for both PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY.\nConsistent with our strategy, we are prioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns while supporting growth for our pipeline. For the quarter, adjusted R&D expenses were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 1% operationally versus last year. This slight decline was driven primarily by lower spending resulting from our cost realignment program and lower spending on certain vaccines programs, largely offset by increased investments mainly to develop certain assets acquired from Seagen. Q1 reported diluted earnings per share were $0.55. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.82, which exceeded our expectations due to favorable gross margin performance, as well as strong cost management across the enterprise. As I stated earlier, during the quarter, we recorded a favorable product return adjustment associated with our US government contract for PAXLOVID. Recall that during Q4 of last year, we estimated the US government credit for PAXLOVID was $3.5 billion.\nEarlier this year, the US government announced that the EUA labeled product was no longer authorized for emergency use, and the agreed-upon return period had now expired. Given those facts, we can now finalize the total value of the US government credit. This resulted in a favorable adjustment to revenues of $771 million for PAXLOVID and contributed $0.11 to the company's earnings per share. Now, let me quickly touch upon our capital allocation strategy, which is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value. Our strategy consists of maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in our business at an appropriate level of financial return, and making value-enhancing share repurchases after delivering our balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D, and, as expected, business development activity was minimal in the quarter.\nWe are committed to delivering our capital structure with a gross leverage target of 3.25x, which we expect to achieve over time. In support of that goal, during the quarter, we paid down approximately $1.25 billion in maturing debt, and in May, we will pay down another $1 billion of outstanding notes. Importantly, during the quarter, we began to monetize our Haleon stake through an initial sale of $3.5 billion, which reduced our equity position in the company from 32% to approximately 23%. Looking ahead to the next couple of quarters, I'd like to point out that we expect operating cash flow to be significantly below typical levels, largely due to the timing of certain payments. Despite this near-term pressure, clearly our objective is to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy over time.\nNow, let me spend just a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of this year. As we entered 2024, the company was highly focused on delivering on its financial commitments, and our performance in Q1 demonstrates that we are off to a solid start. With that objective in mind, and the fact that it's still early in the year, we are modestly updating the earnings outlook for this year. We are raising our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10 to a new range of $2.15-$2.35. Looking ahead, this increase takes into consideration both our improving line of sight to our cost savings targets, and continued strength in our underlying business. As a reminder, our EPS guidance also includes an anticipated $0.40 of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, largely due to financing costs.\nWhile the PAXLOVID revenue return adjustment moves us to the upper end of the revenue guidance range, our top-line revenue expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect revenues in the range of $58.5 billion t-$61.5 billion. In addition, even though COMIRNATY revenues continue to perform consistent with our plan, it is important to remember that we expect approximately 90% of our sales to occur in the second half of the year, mostly in Q4, given the seasonal nature of this product. Lastly, we remain on track to deliver at least $4 billion in net savings from our cost realignment program by the end of the year. Improving our cost base will put us on strong footing towards margin expansion and improved financial returns as we move forward.\nAs you know, over the past two years, the company has made significant investments to drive growth in the back half of the decade, and we remain encouraged by the long-term growth outlook for Pfizer. 2024 is clearly a year of focus. The foundation that we established this year sets the stage to deliver on our commitment to enhance shareholder value both this year and through the end of the decade. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert as we begin our Q&A session.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, David. Now, let's start the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press the Star and 1 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any point by pressing Star 2.\nOnce again, that is Star and 1 if you would like to ask a question. We'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is now open.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Cantor\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question for you on your RSV vaccine sales. Just curious what drove the downtick versus the fourth quarter. It looks like GSK had a similar downtick. How do you think about potential competition coming into the market for vaccines and treatments? Does that impact your future growth projections for the franchise? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI think Aamir has a question for you. Maybe Alexandre also can add because now we started already to register and approve the product in international markets. Aamir?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nLouise, thanks for the question. It very much appears like the RSV vaccination market is following a seasonal trend.\nYou expect the dynamics in Q4 versus Q1 to be different. In Q1, what we saw for the market is, for older adults, it certainly attenuated over the course of the quarter. There was a peak in the second week of January, and then a steady week-by-week decline since then. Now, in terms of the dynamics for our business and ABRYSVO, our performance was in line with what we expected. We do think this will follow a seasonal trend, and we think we're very well positioned for the fall season for several reasons. One is we're progressing our retail contracting. Second is we have a real strength in the non-retail channel. You referred to GSK. They reported their revenues. When you look at the mix of US revenues as reported, it's about a 60/40 mix.\nOur retail share is lower than that, but our non-retail share is much higher. That portion of our business really doubled between Q4 and Q1 from about 9%-17%. I think that just speaks to our strength in doctor's offices and the relationships we have with organized customers. I'll also note that later this year, if approved, we will have a new presentation of ABRYSVO, which demonstrates ease of administration, and also our clinical data, which Albert referred to in his remarks for label expansion for ABRYSVO for 18 to 59-year-olds who are at risk, as well as durable efficacy through two seasons. I think the combination of these commercial efforts, as well as potential label expansion, really positions us well for a fall season.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Now, Alexandre?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes. Louise, thanks for the questions.\nOn the international front, we actually made great progress on the ABRYSVO. As you know, we got approval in the second half of 2023 in Europe and in the UK. Since then, we've been working with the health authority and the expert to provide medical evidence and healthcare system benefits associated with the protection against lower respiratory tract infection associated with RSV through immunizations of maternal, also the immunization of older adults. We're making good progress. Actually, we've already received the recommendation in the UK, in Austria, in Norway, and we are progressing and waiting for some recommendations from the Vaccine Technical Committee in many other European markets.\nWe also had good progress from a regulatory standpoint because it was a milestone with the approval of older adults and MI during the maternal immunization in Japan in the first quarter, as well as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Overall, they don't yet translate into financials because it takes time to get the approval, to get the VTC, and to get funding for those campaigns. We see significant opportunity that we can address and make medical need in the international. Just to give you one example, in Europe, for instance, half of the hospitalizations due to respiratory tract infection in the first year of life were caused by RSV. There is definitely a great opportunity, and the majority of those hospitalizations occur for the first three months of age.\nAs you know, ABRYSVO is the only maternal vaccine that helps protect infants from lower respiratory tract infection caused by RSV immunization from birth to six months. We see a great opportunity.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Alexandre. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a two-part from me. Just wondering if you can comment at all about any potential impact in 2025 from the Part D redesign. We've heard a couple of other companies already comment here. And then one in the pipeline, can you give us any update on danuglipron and your plans more broadly in obesity? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Thank you. Can you add that danuglipron is in the industry? Let me take that one to clear the way. It's not new.\nWe don't have news on danuglipron. Everything is as we have discussed before. We are waiting around mid-year to get the totality of the data that relates to the once-a-day formulation. Based on the data and everything else, we will make decisions for future plans. We'll speak about them when we have more to say. Now let's go to Aamir about the Part D redesign in 2025. Do you expect anything?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. Terrence, thanks for the question. As you can imagine, there are many moving parts to Part D redesign. I think relevant to our business, it's important to first note that as part of what already went into place with the redesign, there is no cost sharing imposed on vaccines. That, given our significant vaccines portfolio, is a positive.\nOver the course of 2024 and 2025, there's other dynamics with out-of-pocket cost caps, which create better access for patients. That is helpful to volumes, and we're starting to see that in 2024 in some parts of our business, including on VYNDA. There's things to come, including a change in that cap as well as patient smoothing. We'll see how that plays out. Obviously, there's also changes in how costs are shared between plans, manufacturers, government, and patients. How all of that gets implemented, we're tracking that very closely. We're not offering any specific guidance in terms of direct dollar impact on our business in 2025 because there's still a lot to come on this. When we're ready to do that, we certainly will.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. Onto famous, really strong quarter, but I wanted to ask on patent life. Given we've seen the EU patent office strike down multiple invalidity oppositions, and on the US side, it looks like defendants are conceding infringement, how should we think about IP for this product? Why shouldn't this stay patented out to 2035? Number two, really strong quarter for PADCEV, and you do have the pending TIVDAK launch in first-line cervical. Is there any possibility we could see Seagen become accretive to Pfizer earnings by next year? Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThat's a very good question. Why don't we go first to you, Dave, to speak a little bit about. Clearly, Seagen is doing very well. If you expect that it can become accretive earlier.\nAlso, I would like to hear some comments from Chris about the progress of the Seagen portfolio. Then Doug can comment on the IP situation or legal counsel. Dave?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Just maybe on Seagen from a financial perspective, obviously, clearly a very solid quarter and a very solid start to the year. I think we're not changing our expectations, both short-term and long-term for Seagen, but I think we're cautiously optimistic as we look forward. Probably nothing to update financially other than our continued commitment to the financial metrics that we've already established. Again, we're probably cautiously optimistic on the trends that we're seeing underlying that business at this point in time.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYou want to make some comments also, Chris, about the performance of the Seagen business?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah.\nI think just to add to what David said, it's early days for PADCEV, as you pointed out. For 302, the data was we just launched early this year. We've already seen 164% year-on-year pro forma growth. It's early, but we're very pleased that we've got NCCN guidelines, category one. We've got the New England Journal publication. We've got uptake in both academic and community settings. In fact, 70% of the current accounts are in the community. We're looking forward now because I think we're well set for the future in the muscle-invasive bladder cancer setting and those two studies that will read out later, in 2025, 2026, and 2027.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Chris. Doug, what about the situation with the IP disputes?\n\nDoug Lankler\n\nEVP and General Counsel, Pfizer\n\nYes. VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX currently have US patent exclusivity, excuse me, through the end of this year.\nWe have a patent term extension, which would take it out to December 2028. We may be filing additional requests for patent term extensions while that is pending. In major European markets, our patents expire in November 2026. In Japan, the patent expires in 2026, but there's regulatory exclusivity through March 2029 for cardiomyopathy.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Doug. All right. Let's move to the next question. Thank you, Alexander.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want to touch on gross margin. Obviously, a nice improvement in this quarter. I believe back in December, you had said for the full year it'd be around 70%.\nDo you expect that we could actually see a better gross margin for the full year given kind of the benefit we've seen, or are there some other puts and takes that we should be aware of?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. This is Dave. We're always looking to improve our performance from both a gross margin and operating performance perspective. I'll say we'll continue to focus on that. Obviously, as you know, there are three things that improved our gross margin rate in the quarter. Some of those are temporal, some of those are more permanent. I think what is encouraging within our gross margin performance is the fact that our cost control element across our manufacturing platform was really strong. We expect that to continue to be a focus. Keep in mind that our commodity volume is very back-half weighted.\nCommodity, as you know, because of our profit share, carries a very low gross margin rate. That mix will reverse itself in the back half of the year, compressing and putting pressure on our gross margin rate. You should expect that dynamic to occur as that product plays itself out through 2024.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. All right. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nSenior Biopharmaceuticals Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the quarter. The two products I want to just kind of touch on in terms of on the sort of newer growth drivers. One is NURTEC, which came in a little bit lighter than we expected. Obviously, the first quarter there tends to be impacted a lot by gross to net.\nI'm just trying to understand if you can give a little more detail on what the dynamics on the quarter and any sort of change to your sort of expectation on that product's outlook. The second one's on the myeloma side, ELREXFIO. I just noticed in your slide presentation that used to be listed under the key growth drivers in prior quarters. This year on slide nine, when you show your key growth drivers, it's no longer listed there. I'm just curious if that was, it looks like it was an intentional change. I'm just curious what drove the decision or moved that from the group of key growth drivers.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Vamil. Aamir, NURTEC. Chris, myeloma.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks for the question, Vamil. I'm happy to talk a little bit about NURTEC.\nWe'd like to accelerate the momentum of NURTEC, and we're taking several steps to do that. For the quarter itself, what we're encouraged by is the demand and the volumes that we saw. On the flip side, as you already alluded to, the performance in the quarter was impacted by gross to net. On demand, a few points to just keep in mind. NURTEC continued its market leadership within the class with a 49% TRX share, and that was up 28% from Q1 of last year. Secondly, NBRX share, which we keep a very close eye on, that volume as a whole hit its high point since we closed the Biohaven acquisition at the end of 2022. That was up versus last year, but also importantly, up versus Q4 of 2023.\nThere were about 11,000 new NURTEC riders in Q1, and this is 90% of all the new riders within the oral CGRP class. That says a lot about the volume and the demand that we're encouraged by. Now, on gross to net, there were three issues this quarter. One is you typically tend to see this dynamic in the first quarter of every year. We saw that last year too, just given the benefit design dynamics. Secondly, we did have some pyramid issues between government and commercial channels this quarter. Finally, there was an unfavorable one-time prior period adjustment to our GTNs in Q1. Your question about the rest of the year, for NURTEC, we expect continued growth. We've talked about the fact that the fundamentals in terms of untreated patients and undertreated patients remain strong.\nWe also think that some of the gross to net that I described is going to be temporal, and it'll slowly abate over the course of the rest of the year. We have made a number of changes in our commercial execution in terms of what we're doing with patient engagement, focusing our field force resources on physician awareness in a different way, and also working to reduce friction for patient access. Overall, we do expect continued growth from NURTEC in the balance of 2024.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Chris, about ELREXFIO?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert. The reason Albert didn't list ELREXFIO as a major growth driver, just to remind, he pointed out LORBRENA, XTANDI, and PADCEV as the immediate biggest growth drivers for oncology. We're absolutely confident that ELREXFIO will become, over the next couple of months and years, a major driver for oncology.\nJust a reminder, we've seen very promising efficacy data in highly refractory patient populations with deep, endurable responses. We've reported the longest reported median progressive pre-survival in the recurrent relapse refractory setting of 17.2 months. Of course, recognizing there's no definitive conclusion because there's no head-to-head studies, we currently encourage what we've seen with the uptake, the bulk of new patient starts as we've planned. We remain very optimistic for the future from the current indication, as well as from the future indications. A reminder that we have four ongoing registrational studies in the next 12 months. The first phase III study will read out, the MM5 study. We've also recently received J-code for access, we've smoothened the reimbursement process, and continue to gain favorable positions on various pathways, and in some of the most favorable pathways.\nWe're looking forward to update you very soon on more things on ELREXFIO.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Maybe Alexandre, do you have anything to add about the product in international markets?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes. On ELREXFIO, we actually have it's been progressing very nicely because, as you know, we got approval in Europe in December 2023, in the UK in January, and in Japan in March 2024. We're now moving into reimbursements, and we got early access considering the clinical profile, the exceptional clinical profile of the product. That's why we got in some markets early access, and that's why we started sales in the first quarter. We are very satisfied that we could close the time-to-market gap as a competitor. In some cases, like in Japan, we actually indeed became first-in-class approved.\nWe are moving into reimbursement discussion and introduction of the product later in the year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nRight. Overall, in most international markets, there is a gap between the approval and the access grant. Because of the profile of the product, we saw early access, which is basically something that happens on an exceptional base if the product is unique. Some countries, before they approve the price, are allowing you to have access with your own price, and then they make the adjustment. It is a very good sign for this product. We are really feeling very bold when we see the clinical profile and the opinions of the key opinion on it. Thank you. Let's move now to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes. Thanks very much.\nHow many questions am I allowed to ask?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYou, Dave, you don't have a limit.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nVery kind of you, Albert. Okay, I'll keep it to two. First, regarding the company's cost structure, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether it bottomed out in the first quarter or if there are additional cost reductions ahead after 30 March such that the cost structure of the company is coming down after the first quarter. Second, with respect to VYNDAQEL, I appreciate the comments in response to the question earlier, but I'm just trying to get a little bit better understanding of how to think about it. There was a comment about patent term extension potentially applying beyond December of 2028. If Pfizer is successful, what would the date be instead of December 2028 for the US?\nFor the EU, the comment was November of 2026, but I've heard that there was a positive EU patent development, and I'm trying to understand what that would extend the EU to. Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Dave. Dave, please you take the cost structure.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. First, as you well know, right-sizing our cost structure is incredibly important for us as we think forward for margin expansion and improving our financial returns. As we look through Q1 and through the balance of the year, keep in mind that the cost changes that we've made in the US are largely complete. Obviously, in ex-US, some of those changes lag. You will see changes in the cost structure ex-US for the balance of the year. Those are probably not quite as large as we look forward compared to what has already happened at this point.\nI would just say that this will be a constant focus for us as we think about cost and margin enhancements going forward. This is a now we're on a continual cycle of thinking about how we invest and what is the appropriate cost structure in support of our revenue objectives for this business going forward.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Doug, can you please clarify a few things about VYNDAQEL to Dave's recent question?\n\nDoug Lankler\n\nEVP and General Counsel, Pfizer\n\nSure. Just to be clear, Dave, we shouldn't think beyond December 2028 on VYNDAQEL and VYNDAQEL. We've got a patent term extension that is filed and is pending. All I was saying was that in addition to that patent term extension, which would take it out to December 2028 that we filed and is pending, we may file additional patent term extensions, again, though, just to take it out to December 2028.\nI hope that's clear.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you for clarifying that. Okay. Now, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi guys. Trung Huynh from UBS. Thanks for taking my questions. One on the ACIP meeting coming up and just a clarification on the guide, if I may. On ACIP in June, what's your expectations on the recommendation for the 50 population-59 population? Could this be a shared clinical decision like the 60+? Do you think this is going to be risk-based? Is there any chance you can get the 18 to 59 data on the agenda for this meeting? Just on the guide, a clarification here on the credit for the quarter, because you've kept your $3 billion guide for PACs.\nI appreciate the comment you're now going to be at the upper end of guide. On PACs, do you expect to have $770 million less PAC sales than you imagined at the start of the year, given that you outstated your EPS guide? Or was this expected? Thanks.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nWell, maybe I'll take that first. From a guide perspective, we obviously did not expect this final adjustment. It was an estimate that we did at the end of the year. We're now finalizing the adjustment based on the returns that we've seen, and it is now complete. I would say that as we look forward for the full year, both for PAXLOVID and for the full year of all of our products, we're cautiously optimistic about where we are. I think PAXLOVID started off from a very solid utilization.\nKeep in mind that product will trend consistent with infection rates across the globe. We're still cautiously optimistic that we will achieve our objective, and we do not expect anything less than our original expectation at this point in time.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, David. Mikael, on the ACIP meetings and the June-October recommendations, etc.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of R&D, Pfizer\n\nYeah. First, to punctuate, good to hear you're interested in our RSV vaccine. We have a lot of positive and informative data that's coming. Eighteen to 59, we have already been out sharing robust outcome for that, and filing is imminent to happen in US FDA. We also have data coming on second season, full second season, and data so far that have been available show robust and probably best-in-class profile for us. You heard Aamir mention we also have new delivery formats.\nThere are a lot of positive things happening to further strengthen ABRYSVO. For a formal decision on recommendation, ACIP normally waits until a product is FDA approved. We do not know exactly when FDA will potentially approve. We think, clearly, given this unique age range, that it can happen to be meaningful for the fall, but that needs to be, of course, pending FDA's views. We will certainly be very open to share data from several of these new important data sets that could help ACIP to understand the planning of the various RSV products. We think that would be very helpful for ACIP, as ABRYSVO data sets are robust and in some sense unique in a positive way.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. In general, a couple of comments for both of these questions. On the ACIP, we always do not speak for ACIP, so it is not appropriate.\nACIP will do what they can do. Of course, typically, as we say, they wait to see FDA approvals, and we hope that they will ask us to present the data in June. It is something that we do not know. What we know is that whatever they decide, whenever they decide, we have prepared our marketing and commercial plans in the US, as we do, of course, in other countries, so that we can maximize the approvals, the recommendations, or the data that we have available. That is one thing. David explained that we are cautiously optimistic, of course, about that, which comes through the entire line of guidance that we gave. We are cautiously optimistic on revenues, we are cautiously optimistic on margins, and, of course, we improve, again, cautiously within the EPS.\nYou need to see all of that in the context that, guys, we have been burned last year with a big misalignment between what we were expecting to come for COVID and eventually what came. That is something that makes us be double cautious. When we speak about projections, we know credibility is extremely important for us. Everything we say, we feel rocket solid that we will achieve, and we do not say anything more than that. We prefer to achieve rather than save. That is the context to all the guidance that we have provided this time. With that, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Umer Reffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of financial-focused questions, if I may.\nFirst, on gross margin, Dave, I remember last time you mentioned two specific things: insourcing of recently acquired products, as well as new launches, as being a drag on gross margin. Considering both those things were presumably baked into 1Q, and 1Q looked more like what the historic margin build would have implied, wouldn't that suggest full-year margin is tracking meaningfully north of the full-year guidance of 70%? Were there one-offs, like some inventory work done from recent acquisitions in 1Q, that helped it? Secondly, and maybe this is for you and Albert both, is there potential for significant monetization for some of your excess manufacturing capacity from over the years, be it fill, finish, or beyond, just considering what the broader environment is and some of the questions on dividend? Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI think David can take both of them. Dave?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYes.\nOn the gross margin side, as I said, there were a couple of things that impacted favorably our performance in 1Q. The items that you listed, both new product launches and insourcing, the insourcing is probably a longer-term implication to us because those do not happen in an immediate quarter. You think about Seagen, that is probably a multi-year phenomenon that we have here. I do not think there was an outsized impact to that. Obviously, the new launches, we planned for those to be compressing our gross margin rates, which they did. I think we are off to a very solid start. Keep in mind what I said earlier. In the back half of the year, commodity sales will begin to ramp up. They compress our gross margin rate fairly significantly given the partner contribution and payment that we have to our partners.\nI would expect that to dampen our gross margin performance in the back half of the year. Umer, as you well know, we're focused on over-delivering if we can. I think we will do everything we can to continue to improve our performance there. Finally, as we think about the balance sheet, first and foremost, I just want to reiterate that our number one priority from a capital allocation perspective is both supporting and growing our dividend over time, and that is not at risk. Secondly, yes, we always look at the assets that we have across our platform and understand what's the best way to capitalize on those assets. Some of that may be monetizing some of that. Some of that may be operating them more effectively. Everything's on the table from that perspective.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer",
    "content2": "Thank you, Dave.\nAlthough your answer was very complete, I will just reiterate something that you said because it seems like some people, they want to hear it again. The dividend is a sacred cow for us. Dividend, it is secure, and we will continue our policy on dividend as we have promised, repeated. We do not have to monetize things to be able to achieve that. The reason why we are looking at all our assets is because we want to maximize return on the card. Of course, we will see opportunities when it makes sense, like the ones that you described. There is a serious now issue with sterile capacity that people are looking to acquire.\nWe will look at everything, but it's not that we are looking right now on this, on that, because we need to support the dividend, or we need to support the delivering opportunities, or we need to support the investments in the business, right? We can do that without doing any of that. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had two quick ones. The first is, now that Seagen has been fully integrated and you'll see some commercial leverage from the deal, would you expect to see more of a gradual impact on the PADCEV and etc. trajectories looking out a few years, or could you have a more near-term inflection?\nThe second question, Dave, Albert, the capital allocation commitment to the dividend is super clear. Would we view on slide 12 as dividend and deleveraging as the two highest priorities, or is bolt-on BD still in the mix for this year or next? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Let's go to Chris to understand the commercial impact on Seagen and how that will take time.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. As you know, we did a number of months' planning prior to close to ensure we had a seamless integration. We completed cross-training of our commercial field force teams in January, especially for breast cancer between TUKYSA and IBRANCE, but also for hematology between ADCETRIS and ELREXFIO. We should start seeing that further playing out now over the coming months. As we've mentioned, we're obviously very pleased that there's been tremendous colleague retention.\nWe haven't had an issue with colleague retention, both from the legacy Pfizer and the legacy Seagen organization as we build the new business. We expect PADCEV to continue to do well. There's significant enthusiasm from healthcare providers, from patients, and from patient advocacy groups because of the groundbreaking data, double the overall survival. We are confident that we'll continue to see PADCEV growth. We've also seen TUKYSA, for instance, 21% year-over-year pro forma basis growth. In fact, the last quarter was the highest performance of TUKYSA. Overall, great confidence. We started the first new phase III study with an NME from the Seagen portfolio with sigvotatug vedotin. We hope to update you on other phase III studies from the Seagen portfolio, legacy Seagen portfolio.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nFrom my perspective, of course, we have invested so much into this business, and we think that this is an area that we can make a huge difference to the world. I'm monitoring that very closely. I'm very impressed, actually. I would say nicely surprised on the positive side, how well both on the Pfizer impact, the 1 + 1 = 3 rather than two, but already we have started seeing it both in the research organization because we are putting now a lot of phase III on start. You don't see, but I have high visibility on what's going on in earlier stages where we put a lot of stuff in the clinic.\nAlso in the commercial, you can see now stabilization for IBRANCE on the Pfizer side, and then high growth of the Seagen asset despite the fact that, as I said, you should expect a decline in the first six months. When you have an integration, always you have a decline. I haven't seen a single integration that we have done that didn't face challenges because people are changing territories, people are changing, let's say, jobs, marketers are moving around. All of that creates, let's say, a disruption. Here, we have the opposite. We have very, very strong growth on both sides. I'm really, really pleased. Now, of course, cautiously optimistic. It will take time to see the full benefit. Certainly, under Chris's leadership, and he has formed a terrific team, we are off to a very good start.\nNow, Dave, why don't you take us to the next question?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nAs it relates to your question regarding capital allocation, clearly our first priority, number one priority, is supporting both the dividend, as well as delivering our balance sheet. That is job one from my perspective. As it relates to bolt-on acquisitions, in the near term, you would not expect us to do much there. That is a lower priority in the near term until we get our sales up. Hope that helps.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist. Your line is open.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nVP and Biotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Truist\n\nHey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions, and congrats on the progress. I have a question about your breast cancer franchise from the IBRANCE perspective.\nYou have pivotal data from the estrogen receptor PROTAC, the collaboration with the partnership with ARV-471 expected later this year. One is, what are your expectations for these data? How important are these data for you to make decisions around either continuing or initiating SEPTEC combo phase III trials, whether it's CDK4/6 combo, CDK4 combo, or both of them? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Chris?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Thank you very much for the question. Just a reminder to point out with IBRANCE that over 773,000 patients have now been treated globally with IBRANCE. It is currently still the CDK4/6 leader. We're very excited about two programs, the vepdegestrant, which we believe could be best in class, next-generation estrogen receptor degrader, and also a atimociclib, next-generation CDK4-specific inhibitor.\nFor DEGASTRAN, as you point out, we'll get the data later this year for VERITAC-2, but we are planning additional studies at ROTH. You can expect to see first-line studies, both a first-line study with a termocyclib and standard of care endocrine therapy, as well as a termocyclib plus the vepdegestrant. For a termocyclib, as you've seen in a heavily pretreated population, we've seen an overall response rate of 32% with median prognosis survival of 8.1 months. We're therefore highly encouraged and definitely very encouraged by the safety profile. We've seen more continuous dosing, very good compliance, and more complete coverage of CDK4. That's why we're confident to accelerate CDK4 into a registration strategy. The first study has already started, as you know, the second-line study.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nYour line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up, as I think it's important, and I fully respect the focus on 2024 and Albert's commentary on conservatism around guidance, but to come back to the IRA impact for thinking about 2025, when do you think you'll be in a better position to comment a little bit under your contracting discussions are underway pretty late in the earnings season here, and most of your peers have already made comments, and your Part D exposure isn't exactly a surprise. Any color there on timeline would be helpful. I guess for David, you've talked about the operating margin improvement being sort of a multi-year process. Is there a risk that the IRA sort of presents a little bit of a hiccup to that in 2025? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you.\nAamir, do you have any comments on that?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. Carter, I think you heard us describe the dynamics. Later this year, we will have more clarity on what that means, and we can certainly share that. I think there's also a specific question that comes up often about ELIQUIS. Let me just address that now because we're clearly in a live negotiation on that. BMS, our alliance partner, is leading that process. You've heard them describe, and we'll also describe, that there will be transparency around the outcome of that for impact in 2026 in the September timeframe. At that point, we'll be in a position to share more.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYes.\nAs it relates to 2025 and the impact of the IRA from a margin expansion perspective, I would say without giving any specifics on that, as we look forward, we obviously run multiple scenarios around how our business might perform. In those scenarios, we would model different impacts to the IRA because it's still unclear, because there's still a lot of moving parts, specifically as we just spoke about. Under those scenarios, we will work hard to offset any implication we might have through improving our cost structure.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI want to be also to set something that clearly in 2025, we will have two events happening which we will have to contribute to as pharmaceutical industry so that we put pressure on the pricing, let's say.\nAlso because of the significant pains in the out-of-pocket dynamics, which I hope that will be implemented as the law says immediately, because I'm hearing efforts to try to play with that. If that is the case, which we are certain because that's the law, we will see significant work update, right? For everyone, not for us, of course, for everyone, because there is a huge number of abandonment that is happening at the pharmacy level when people are asked to pay this very high out-of-pocket, particularly the first quarter and maybe two when they need to exhaust their, let's say, their copays or the deductible.\nI think that dynamic, you know, that the industry always asks that we contribute to the out-of-pocket payments as long as the patients are paying less because there is a significant benefit for all, for the healthcare system, for the patients, for us. I'm not that concerned about that for the industry as a whole. I'm very concerned for the industry as a whole with the mandatory cost reductions. There is no negotiation there. They are just cutting prices that are occurring for biologics and for more molecules particularly. One good thing for us, it is first of all that we have good exposure on vaccines, but they are not part of that. Actually, they are benefiting from the IRA because there is no co-sharing. We can see that in the volumes here.\nOn the small molecules where we do have exposure, I would say that we were lucky only one product was selected for 2026. We could have three or four, and only one was selected. So ELIQUIS, as Aamir said, we will wait to see. We know, of course, but we can't discuss in the middle of negotiations about anything that is happening. We'll see the impact of whatever that is in 2026. If next year they bring some of the other products that could be included and they were not in this year, that would be the IBRANCE of the world. That would be the standard sellers. Those are products that anyway are approaching their LOE.\nEven if they come into the IRA, the MTV risk that we have at place is not that big because really we'll cut the price for something that will not be for a very lengthy period of time, but will be for a smaller than others period of time. This does not mean that this is not very bad for the industry and for innovation, and we're clearly opposing it. We'll try whatever we can to defend it. Let's go to the next question because we are running out of time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC. Your line is open.\n\nRajesh Kumar\n\nSenior Global Healthcare Analyst, HSBC\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First question is you very helpfully provided some color on the gross margin. What are the takes and puts there?\nIf we look at your early 70s guidance and the gross margin you've achieved in Q1, do we see below 70% gross margin at some point in some quarter this year, or you sort of will get to early 70s throughout the year maintaining over 70% margin? The bit, which is quite difficult to work out from the disclosures, is how did the PAXLOVID number impact the gross margin? Any help there so that we can model that right would be much appreciated.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nDave?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nGreat. Yes, I think we just gave some color around gross margin being closer to 70% versus closer to 80% when we entered 2024. We are maintaining that color at this point in time. I would say that it's unlikely for our gross margin rate to fall below 70% in any given quarter.\nI want to just emphasize the gross margin rate will fluctuate a bit, primarily given the mix of sales, specifically within the vaccine portfolio, which carries a lower gross margin, number one. Number two, when you look at our performance for gross margin in Q1, the dominant effect of that versus last year is the mix, the lower sales volume of COMIRNATY in the quarter in Q1 versus last year's Q1. Obviously, the final adjustment of the PAXLOVID reserve actually did also have a one-time positive impact on the gross margin rate in Q1, but that was less of an impact compared to the mix. I hope that helps.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize that on PAXLOVID, what really makes me pleased is the underlying demand of the product, right? It was approximately the first quarter only in the US, 2 million scripts, right?\nThat's significant. Keep in mind that this was the quarter that we moved from a previous way of go-to-market approach to a commercial model, right? That had a lot of minds in execution, but we didn't step into any of that. It was, again, I'm very pleased how Aamir and the US team executed on that. Meticulous execution. We had a very smooth transition with very low copays on commercial plans for the vast majority of the insured lives. At the same time, very good execution with thousands of pharmacists participating, almost 90,000 pharmacists, if I remember well, 90%, excuse me, of the pharmacists participating into the Medicare part. That went extremely well.\nI want to remind that the Medicare that goes clearly with different price level because it's through the credit of the US government compared to the commercial plans that they are at 1,000. It's a different list price. That difference exists for this year on. Next year, everybody moves to the list price and, of course, the discounts that we give plan by plan. Next door to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nManaging Director in the Global Investment Research Division, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Two questions, if I may. The first on pneumococcal vaccines with PREVNAR as well. Last quarter, you provided some commentary about your thoughts on the tone of the markets, particularly for adults being somewhat more mature. Obviously, competition is coming across the different categories, adult and pediatrics.\nCan you comment about your view given that performance was relatively strong and how you're preparing for competition? The second question I have is on commercial models. There has been some nascent efforts in the industry to go more direct to consumers. I cite, for instance, Lilly has a LillyDirect for their obesity products. Aamir, I'm curious about your thoughts about integrating this type of approach, particularly as I think about certain product categories that you have like migraines and NURTEC. How might this work? Where is Pfizer in terms of exploring these opportunities? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAamir?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nOkay. Chris, thanks for the question. On PREVNAR, you alluded to the commentary we provided around dimensionalizing the market, and I think it's worthwhile just reiterating that. The adult market continues to contract, and that's for two reasons. There are increasingly fewer eligible 65+ adults.\nThe 19 to 64 underlying medical conditions population is obviously more difficult to activate. That is a dynamic that is true for our business, but it's also true for any competitor that's going to come into the adult vaccine market. I think that's important to note. Now, for our overall franchise, we continue to expect growth. We did very nicely in Q1. We saw 6% growth, and the big driver of that is increased uptakes as well as market share growth in the pediatric sector. Pediatrics in Q1, we saw a lot of conversion from PCV13 to 20, and our share exiting Q1 was at 80%. That was from 71% at the time of launch of PCV15. We see good momentum on pediatrics. Now, back to your question about the adult segment and competition, we're continuing to see very good performance where we are.\nWe have 98% market share. We acknowledge that V116 is coming. As Albert alluded to earlier, we're not going to speculate on what the regulatory outcomes or recommendations are going to be. There are a number of things that we can do to defend our business in the adult segment. Firstly, we have a portfolio approach to contracting that we're deploying in the retail setting, but also in the non-retail setting. It's also important to note that in the non-retail setting, many organized customers have a preference for workflow management to stock one vaccine that satisfies all the current basic recommendations. Until we know more, I think the best way to defend our share in the adult segment is to continue to do what we're doing.\nThat's to be laser-focused on maximizing the opportunity that we have in the adult segment, albeit contracting, and then continue to drive growth in pediatrics. On your second question around consumers, look, engaging and activating consumers is, as you pointed out, a very, very important part of our business. It's true in vaccines, it's true in categories like PAXLOVID and NURTEC, just to name a few examples. We're always looking at ways to enhance that connection. One example I'll point to is the work that we've done on VaxAssist as a mechanism to help consumers determine their vaccine eligibility, but also book appointments. That's a really good example of value that we can bring. To the extent that we can do more of that, create value for patients as well as for our business in other categories, we'll certainly look to explore that.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAlexander, very quickly, anything on PCV in the international markets?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, no, we had a great quarter. As you know, we grew by 8% operationally. More importantly, we also have achieved some key milestones. We got the European approval of pediatric PREVNAR 20 in Europe. We also got it approved in Japan, which is a very important market, Australia, and many others. This is great because we want to build on the very successful PREVNAR 30 franchise around the world. As you know, we have exclusive NIP status in 130 markets, and now we're going to be able to build on that. Just one comment on the adults. We still are in the process of getting BTC recommendation in most of the European market, but where we got it in Germany and in France, we see very nice pickup. And why?\nBecause they extended the population covered by the PREVNAR 20 adults. For instance, in Germany, STIKO gave us 18 to 59 population at risk, and all comers 60 and above. Since that, and we got this recommendation in February, we get very nice pickup and utilization in Germany, and we are about to launch in France as we speak. In adults as well, we see a great potential of growth. It's very nice cadence of approval, and very nice cadence of recommendations.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe a question for Dave.\nJust wanted to understand the cadence of margin improvement as you are embarking on the cost management journey throughout the year because, I mean, you had a really high EPS because of the one-time item. If you think about margin profile over the year, how should we think about it? I understand fourth quarter could be impacted with COMIRNATY revenues. When we get into 2025, should we think about better leverage, or do you think there could be more opportunity to reduce expenses in 2025 as well? Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, thank you for the question. I would say that without giving you, since we do not guide to quarterly expectations for gross margin, I would just say that the focus that we have around improving our cost of goods sold is a multi-year journey.\nThese costs that we are working to improve take time to adjust and to further implement ways to be more effective and efficient in this infrastructure. I wouldn't think of that having a significant impact on 2024, but more if it would, it'd be late 2024, but more 2025 and 2026. More to come as we know more and as we develop our plans more specifically, we'll be certain to share some specifics around that.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Just two ones for me here. Just on ABRYSVO, just really quickly following up on the earlier commentary. Can you just update us on where we are in terms of contracting efforts and progress in the retail channel, just addressing some of the market share issues you highlighted last year?\nI guess my specific question is, do you have line of sight on contracting at this point, or is that still something that's going to evolve as the year progresses? The second quick one was just on VYNDAQEL, obviously very strong numbers. Maybe just a quick update in terms of where we are with penetration in that market, how much higher can this go, and just how much more of a growth runway is there for that drug? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAamir?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief US Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks, Chris. On ABRYSVO, as I said, we're progressing our contracting conversation. We'll have more to share on that as we do later. In terms of your question on VYNDA, VYNDA had a really strong quarter. We were up 96% year over year, but importantly, also 41% over last quarter. When you look at the drivers, I think there's a few things.\nSome of that is temporal. There were some purchasing patterns with wholesaler and specialty pharmacies. We also made a lot of efforts towards the end of last year to ensure that the re-enrollment process for patients was very smooth at the beginning of this year. All of that leads to a little bit of a Q1 bolus. Importantly, at the heart of it, part of our strong performance on VYNDA is that the fundamentals around diagnosis and demand are really strong. We saw a 33% quarter-over-quarter increase in new patient starts. Diagnosis rates over the last several years, we had talked about getting into the 30%-50% range. We're approaching the top end of that, and there's still significant opportunity to identify more patients. That's the biggest unmet need, and that's where we're concentrating our commercial efforts going forward.\nWe do think that we will sustain this momentum, probably not at the same rate that we saw in Q1, but we will continue to perform well with VYNDA.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Alexander, anything to add?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, very quickly on the international response. We also had a very strong quarter because we saw 28% operational growth, but 43% volume growth, which is comparable to what we see in the US. Exactly as Aamir said, there is still opportunity because we basically have established VYNDAQEL as the standard of care. We have worked with the healthcare professional to establish robust infrastructure so that we can screen, diagnose, and treat faster. The reality is we still have opportunity to grow because, yes, in markets like France, we are approaching 50%, but in others like Italy, we are around 30%, Japan 28%.\nThere is still opportunity to grow and increase diagnosis rates.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Next question. We'll take two more questions because we are running out of time. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nTim?\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Can you hear me?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. It's a busy pipeline readout year. I'm wondering, Mikael, can you just point to perhaps the one or two bigger upcoming readouts that excite you the most where your confidence is highest that could be value-creating? I'm not looking for a description of everything you're reading out, just maybe one or two that excite you the most.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Mike? Excited for us to follow, please.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of R&D, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'm excited about the potential approval for Marstacimab for both hemophilia A and B to continue to grow our hematology franchise momentum.\nD&D gene therapy, we actually today got the equivalent of breakthrough designation, RMAT, based on the early clinical data available. We are super excited about that. Relatively near term, the readout is coming. COVID flu combination vaccine, 8 to 59 readout, phase III. One mid-pipeline, ponsegromab cachexia, which I think pending readout has really a breakthrough mechanism.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThat's fantastic. Anything from your side, Chris?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nPerhaps just to mention again the potential unprecedented new five-year data for LORBRENA, which will be presented oral at ASCO. We could define the growth of LORBRENA over the next decade. There are two other upcoming readouts.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThat's good if you're talking to that enthusiastically.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nThere are two other readouts that are important to us. The one is Breakwater, which is the first-line opportunity in BRAF positive colorectal cancer. Reminder that that's up to 12% of colorectal cancer, particularly poor prognosis.\nWe're looking forward to that readout, Breakwater. As mentioned earlier, VERATEC 2 in second-line positive breast cancer, which can help to define the future path for VYNDAQEL.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. The last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. I have two questions. In the Pfizer mRNA flu vaccine efficacy trial, was superior efficacy versus approved flu vaccine shown in the 65+ cohort? This data was to have been presented last year, but I don't believe we've ever gotten an update. Secondly, your interest in obesity more broadly. The outlook for danuglipron is not good. Boltons don't look likely. This is just one very simple data point. There are postings on pfizer.com for obesity clinical lead positions, suggesting something is moving forward.\nWhat exactly is moving forward in obesity at Pfizer? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOn the obesity end, Mikael also can comment, of course, together with the mRNA flu vaccine. I said multiple times that, first of all, metabolic is an area that we took traditionally very big strength in terms of research. This is an area that we have the right to win. We are strong, and we keep investing in the whole area because we have the infrastructure. Obesity is a very big part of it, given the magnitude of the market. We will be very active in obesity with current mechanisms of actions and new mechanisms of actions. We said repeatedly that we had three agents right now in the clinic, and we have multiple that are preclinical that we are progressing.\nWe don't have anything to say per se right now because on Danu, we are waiting some of the data. For the other ones, it's too early to speak about them. That's why we are not commenting much on that. We will, let's say, continue being very active in the obesity space one way or another. Now, what about the mRNA flu vaccine? Anything you want to add also to the obesity, Mikael?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of R&D, Pfizer\n\nI think you said it so well on obesity. I'll focus on the mRNA vaccine and just say that we did share that we had very robust, favorable data for 18 to 59 in the outcome event trial on the first-generation flu mRNA platform. We actually further refined that product in order to expand activity against these serotypes, although the disease is dominated by A. We saw an opportunity to do that.\nThat technology is now with the COVID flu combo vaccine running for 18 to 59 years old. Relatively soon, we'll have a readout. We think that's really the near-term opportunity to bring both of the variants of viruses under one simple administration approach. For the 65+, what you referred to was an early trial with the first generation. We have now moved focus to the second generation and are in preparation of subsequent clinical studies on them.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest. That was a very good call in summary. We are very pleased with the solid start in 2024. We are cautiously optimistic about the year ahead, and with our continued progress in executing our five priorities, we are confident that we will continue to deliver for our patients, shareholders, and our company.\nThank you again for your interest in Pfizer. We hope you have a wonderful week. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nFrancesca DeMartino\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer and SVP, Pfizer\n\nGood morning and welcome to Pfizer's earnings call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 via a press release that is available on our website at pfizer.com.\nI'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, and Dave Denton, our CFO. Albert and Dave have some prepared remarks, and we will then open the call for questions. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Dr. Chris Boshoff, EVP and Chief Oncology Officer; Alexandre de Germay, EVP and Chief International Commercial Officer; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President of R&D; Doug Lankler, EVP and General Counsel; and Aamir Malik, EVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements and discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. I encourage you to read the disclaimers in our slide presentation, the press release we issued this morning, and the disclosures in our SEC filings, which are all available on the IR website on pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Francesca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to discuss some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and full year 2023, and, of course, the compelling year we have ahead. I would like to begin with a few reflections on 2023. As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and street expectations, predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance.\nDespite, however, this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amidst the missed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 160 million people, approximately, around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people as patients as Pfizer.\nIf you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the declining revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results of the first nine months of 2023, we were the number one pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019.\nNext, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals, with nine new molecular entity approvals from Pfizer, and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer. Finally, we closed a Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies. Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us.\nWe are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success, and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024. From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary. That have not only changed patients' lives, but have changed history.\nOur strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing, and government relations. We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial, and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing five strategic priorities.\nWe will get into each in more detail, but the five key priorities for Pfizer this year are, first of all, to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, to maximize the performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, and allocate capital to enhance shareholder value.\nI'm confident that Pfizer is well positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders. Let's start with our first priority, which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do. As a reminder, 1 in 3 people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest-growing therapeutic areas.\nCompleting the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight, and meaningfully expanded the reach and medical impact of our US commercial and medical footprint with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top-line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers, be a leader in breast cancer, and deliver at least eight potential blood vessel products by 2030.\nWe look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on 29 February 2024. As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on. On the commercial side, the PADCEV launch in locally advanced metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab, and XTANDI launch in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.\nWe are excited by the strength of our PADCEV EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the front-line metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring.\nWe are also looking forward to phase III data readouts from vepdegestrant in second-line HR+ metastatic breast cancer and BRAFTOVI in first-line BRAF colorectal cancer. We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with phase III start of CDK4 in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology, and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE.\nFinally, in the early-stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first in-patient studies of four new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of oncology, in vaccines, anti-infectious, internal medicine, metabolic diseases, and inflammation immunology.\nIn 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates.\nStarting first with our fourth-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with PREVNAR, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity, while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine.\nThe first-generation standalone mRNA flu vaccine data demonstrated relative efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18 to 64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains. Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a phase II COVID/flu combination study for 18 to 64-year-olds and has shown encouraging results in both A and the B strains.\nThis new construct has now moved already into a phase III COVID/flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT601, our next generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential stepwise evolution over OXBRYTA for sickle cell disease. Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill.\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the wave management spectrum, we have ponsegromab, our GDF-15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia, with phase II data expected later this year. ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20% to 30% of all cancer deaths, a significant statistic.\nOur third priority is, of course, to maximize the performance of our new products and corporate sizes through a relentless focus on execution to continue growing our top line. To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing, while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer US Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years.\nTo discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of NURTEC to help the more than 1 billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the US and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for healthcare practitioners and patients.\nWith OXBRYTA, we will continue to educate healthcare practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic, proactive treatment. With ABRYSVO, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion, and expanding our retail contracting and offerings.\nWith ELREXFIO, we are focused on educating healthcare practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness-building, and new patient trials. Coming off the initial launch of VELSIPITY, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to VELSIPITY as a first-line, advanced therapy oral option. With LITFULO, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients, and further unlock access to LITFULO.\nIn addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our conference sizes and key blockbusters, including PREVNAR, VYNDAQEL, and ELIQUIS, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens. We believe we are well positioned to bring our global commercial, manufacturing, and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products.\nWe believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities. With that, I will turn the call over today. We will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base, and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities.\nThese priorities include building a world-class oncology organization, ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations, maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure, and finally, right-sizing our cost base.\nWith that said, I'll start this morning with our full year and our fourth quarter results. I'll touch upon our capital allocation priorities. I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion US dollars, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID.\nThe significant sales decline in our COVID products, including the $3.5 billion US dollars revenue reversal for PAXLOVID, were the primary drivers of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. With the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full year and fourth quarter results include approximately $120 million US dollars in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on 14 December 2023.\nOn the bottom line, we reported full year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 US dollars a share, a 93% year-over-year decline, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84 US dollars, down 72% versus last year. This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. The impact of the $3.5 billion US dollars reversal for PAXLOVID revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the US government.\nFinally, a non-cash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion US dollars recorded in the third quarter for PAXLOVID and, to a lesser extent, COMIRNATY. Now, turning to the quarter, I'd like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again excluding COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID.\nContributing to the strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine, as well as VYNDAQEL and ELIQUIS, partly offset by lower revenues from Ibrance and the PREVNAR family. However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom line, continued to be significantly and negatively impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the result of a significant decrease in both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID sales.\nAdjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points, driven primarily by the $3.5 billion US dollars non-cash PAXLOVID revenue reversal, and to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix. Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10% compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products.\nConsistent with our strategy, we have been focused on reprioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses.\nBoth our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 US dollars and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 US dollars for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion US dollars PAXLOVID revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54 US dollars. Continued declines in both commodity and PAXLOVID sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter.\nAs we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion US dollars intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod based on changes in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations. I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over a billion dollars in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion US dollars intangible asset impairment for PREVNAR 13, reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher serotypes coverage.\nAs discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars. First is growing our dividend, second is reinvesting in the business, and finally, making share repurchases after delivering our balance sheet. For 2023, we returned $9.2 billion US dollars to shareholders via our quarterly dividend.\nWe've invested $10.7 billion US dollars in internal R&D, and finally, we've invested approximately $44 billion US dollars in completed business development transactions, net of acquired cash, essentially for the acquisition of Seagen. Our expectation is to maintain and grow our dividend while delivering our capital structure with a gross leverage target of 3.25x and a goal to preserve our credit rating and access to tier one commercial paper. Upon achieving our delivering goals, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases.\nNow, given that we issued our full year 2024 revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance on 13 December 2023, let me just hit a few of the highlights. We expect total company full year 2024 revenues to be in the range of $58.5 to 61.5 billion US dollars, which reflects our expectation of strong contributions across our product portfolio. Importantly, excluding COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, we anticipate operational revenue growth of 8% to 10%.\nWe remain confident on delivering at least $4 billion US dollars of net savings from our cost realignment program by the end of this year. We believe right-sizing the cost base will put us on a strong footing towards margin expansion and increased operational efficiency moving forward. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to 2.25 US dollars a share for the full year of 2024.\nAs a reminder, this range is inclusive of an anticipated $0.40 US dollars of earnings dilution from the Seagen acquisition, with the vast majority of this dilution resulting from the financing costs associated with the deal. Cycling it into 2024, we have significantly invested in our business to fuel our long-term growth, and the foundation is set to deliver on our commitments to enhance long-term shareholder value. We are acutely focused on driving near-term performance while solidifying our growth expectations for the back half of this decade. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Albert to begin our Q&A session.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. We've actually started the Q&A session. Operator, please assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad.\nYou may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star one to ask a question. Our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotech Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you, guys, for taking my question. Maybe I'm stupid on this question, but if I'm doing your math for your guidance of margins in low 70s for fiscal year 2024, by my math, the margins for other biopharma would have to drop about 60% in order to balance out the other margins. Just help me understand your guidance and triangulate that with your top line and bottom line guidance, and triangulating that with your margin guidance. Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, maybe, this is Dave. Correct. Our guidance for gross margin, although we don't provide it specifically, we've given some color around the fact that it's approximately 70%.\nObviously, our focus going forward is to improve our margin rate and, more importantly, improve our operating margin rate to the bottom line. As we look here at 2024, there's a few things that have compressed our margin rate. Versus as COVID has declined year-over-year, that has served to, I'll say, deliver, if you will, the P&L as COVID takes up and covers some fixed overhead. Importantly, what's happening is we are insourcing products that we've recently acquired.\nThat insourcing requires time before we get up to peak yield and performance so that in the short term, dampens gross margin rate but has a trajectory to improve gross margin rate over time. Secondly, we have new launches that are coming online late in Q3, late in the second half of 2023, and moving into 2024. Again, those are not at peak performance yet.\nThat will ultimately improve gross margin rate as we cycle into later years. Finally, I will say that over the last several years, we have absorbed some amount of inflation within our cost of goods sold. That is an area of opportunity for us as we think about improving performance longer term. I hope that gives you some color.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Carter Gould with Barclays.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe another kind of finance question here. Certainly, R&D in 4Q was meaningfully below kind of where you guys had set the guide there. How should we think about that? Does it just reflect sort of faster cost cutting? Was it just more of an artifact of the later integration of Seagen?\nYou were reaffirming your guide, but just maybe if you just sort of check that box for us, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nSure. Probably not much to read into that. Obviously, R&D came in a little favorable than our expectations previously. Part of this is the fact that we are very focused on re-aligning our cost base, consistent with the program. There probably is some timing that's dampening R&D in the fourth quarter that will slide into 2024 and into 2025. There are some timing implications to that performance level. I think importantly, back to my prepared remarks, our focus is on delivering net savings of $4 billion US dollars. If you look through the end of 2023, about half of that we've achieved already.\nWe're now focused on achieving the additional $2 billion US dollars or so as we cycle into 2024, and all eyes are on that objective.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. We have high confidence on the number that we gave. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise, please make sure that you're unmuted.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor\n\nHi, sorry, I was muted. Thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to ask you on your PREVNAR franchise. First of all, for the fourth generation PCV, could you give more color on how it compares in contrast with PREVNAR-20? Just on the PREVNAR order timing issue, was that US or ex-US? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Aamir, why don't you take the PREVNAR question, and then maybe Alexandre, you can add a little bit color on the situation in the US.\nWhat is the situation in PREVNAR with the orders?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Louise, with regards to PREVNAR, with the pediatric business, we often see some lumpiness in quarterly revenues given the timing and impact of CDC orders. It's difficult to kind of map that all out quarter by quarter. You should expect that on the pediatric business. The pediatric business, otherwise, we're very happy with how our launch is progressing, and the growth momentum that we see there. On the adult business, I think it's different in the sense that we have a 96% market share that we close the adult business with at the end of the year. It's really important to keep in mind that we are operating in a market where the patient pool is steadily decreasing.\nThere was a big catch-up opportunity versus the prior recommendation, and we've worked through that catch-up opportunity already. The remaining patients are generally those that are aging into the 65+ population, as well as those with underlying medical conditions, and those are harder to activate patients. We expect that business to continue to face that smaller patient population going forward. We also expect competition with V116 emerging that will make the adult market more competitive. We see a lot of growth potential in the pediatric market.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Alexandre, how was the PREVNAR situation in the last quarter or in the year in international markets?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes, Louise, good question. As you know, the majority of our ex-US business is driven by tender. Of course, we book the sales when we ship the product, which doesn't reflect utilization.\nThe government schedules their campaign in their respective markets. The reality is that we continue to have IP exclusivity in 130 markets around the world. At the same time, we continue to progress both on the pediatric, as you saw last week, the CHMP positive opinion, and now we're going to go into the final approval and then vaccine technical committees and pricing in all those markets.\nThat will take a bit of time. At the same time, we see some positive traction on the adult franchise, where we have launched in over 30 markets. We see some very good developments with the recommendation of the vaccine technical committee. To give you an example, we used to have very limited access on our PREVNAR 13 in countries like Germany, France, and the UK.\nWe just received a recommendation from the VTC in Germany that actually recommended usage of PREVNAR-20 in all the adults over 60, as well as the at-risk population from 18 to 59, which we believe we have a significant growth opportunity in increasing vaccination in the adult population ex-US.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nMikael, to conclude, what about the fourth generation PREVNAR?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I'm very pleased that the fourth generation has entered clinical studies. It has a fast-track designation from US FDA indicating a unique product offering. It includes some of the new technology we have developed that gives us a really cutting-edge toolbox, whether it's chemistry carriers or reformulations. Of course, it relies on the unique Pfizer platform to have potential prevention of both invasive disease, which is the smaller disease burden, and pneumococcal disease, which causes more than 150,000 hospitalizations.\nTo the best of my knowledge, we are the only one that can address both of them. We feel very good about that entry.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. To summarize the PREVNAR, which I know is in the minds of all, let's start with the commercial front. In the US, clearly, the adult opportunity, we have taken the cream, basically, of the catch-up opportunity. This is happening once you are getting a recommendation from CDC for a catch-up. This market, the pool of patients, has been largely exhausted. We have already 96% market share of that. This is not a market the adult PREVNAR would expect that will continue to grow in the US. Pediatric, very different story because our market share is now growing, and we have indications that will continue growing very strongly.\nWe expect in the US, the PREVNAR situation to be a strong growth story in pediatrics. Internationally, we expect to see growth because the products have just been launched, and the recommendations are following. There is a delay internationally, higher than usually there is in the US. We expect to see growth in the adult and in the pediatric.\nI want to reemphasize that we have basically exclusivity of PREVNAR 13 in more than 100, 100, 113 countries in NI of tenders. We plan to convert that now to 20. On the fourth generation, we are moving full speed. We think that our expertise will allow us to build a polyvalent vaccine that will really compete very, very nicely as a fourth generation, and we'll do that successfully and fast. That's the story.\nLet's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have a question from Trung Huynh with UBS.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Trung from UBS. Two, please. In your prepared remarks, you noted you took a $1.4 billion US dollars impairment charge associated with etrasimod. Can you add more color here? What prompted that re-evaluation and any feedback of how that launch has gone? Secondly, on ABRYSVO, can you give us some color on how your contracting has evolved in 2024 versus 2023? Based on that, what market share do you think you can capture this year versus the 35% last year? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Why don't you take, Dave, the impairment question, and then I will move to commercial guys.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah.\nOn etrasimod, keep in mind that this product we still anticipate to be over $1 billion US dollars in peak sales. As you know, there are multiple indications attributed to this medicine. Financially, as you look at that medication, there were additional indications that met the financial criteria for an impairment, of which we took in the quarter. Clinically, obviously, clinically, there's still some work that will be ongoing in support of the asset. With that,\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Aamir, maybe about etrasimod commercially, how the launch is doing and ABRYSVO.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. I'll start with etrasimod or VELSIPITY, as we call it. In terms of the product value proposition, we think this is a very promising oral option for moderate to severe UC patients.\nIt's got strong efficacy that patients and physicians that we've exposed this to, they want to start transitioning from conventional therapy to advanced therapy. It gives them an option also to maintain once-a-day oral routine, which many are already on, instead of beginning with an injection or infusion. About 80% of those patients that haven't progressed to an advanced therapy prefer an oral option, but only about 10% of those patients actually get one.\nThere's a very clear need here that VELSIPITY can help us fit. The benefit-risk profile for VELSIPITY is also very, very strong. We received approval at the end of last year, and we've invested efforts in building HCP and patient awareness on the label and on the value proposition. I just want to remind you that with any immunoinflammatory product, it takes time to get broad national access.\nThat is where our focus is right now, ensuring that we secure VELSIPITY access as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. That's going to take some time to put in place. When we have that in place, we see upside momentum from the launch.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nWhat about ABRYSVO?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nOn ABRYSVO, I'll comment briefly on the adult and then on the maternal. On the adult vaccine, I think the market was clearly ahead of everyone's expectations and not limited by shared clinical decision-making versus a routine recommendation. We would like to do better than the 30% share that you referred to as well. We're very focused going forward on retail contracting for the 2024, 2025 season.\nI will also mention that we are doing that with real thoughtfulness on ensuring that we secure a profitable share in those contracts and also differentiating using our maternal indication. We also see opportunities in the non-retail setting where, for example, with the VA system and with IDNs, we have a strong share.\nWe're going to also focus on new opportunities that we're currently studying with ABRYSVO, adult age 18 and older with underlying medical conditions, as well as a new packing presentation to better fit our customer needs. We see momentum there. On the maternal side, we're only a few months in, but we're encouraged by what we're seeing as the first maternal vaccine to prevent infants from birth to six months when they're the most vulnerable.\nMore than 65% of women prefer to get the maternal vaccine versus having their infant immunized with a monoclonal antibody. We think that the label provides this opportunity to grow that segment as well.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me. I guess the first one is just COMIRNATY, rest of world, was ahead of consensus expectations this quarter. Just wondering if there were any one-time benefits in that number, if that's a fair go-forward sales level to think about through 2026, given the existing EU contract. The second one is I noticed that danuglipron wasn't mentioned in the PR or the prepared remarks. Just wondering if that once-daily PK trial completed yet and what the next steps are there. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much.\nMaybe very quickly on the time, we didn't mention because we don't have anything to say more. That's the only thing. There is a program which is composed with a lot of experiments that we're doing now in terms of moving it to once daily. We will speak only when we have data. We don't want to become now the focus again of another earnings call. That being said, I'm moving it to Alexandre to discuss about COMIRNATY in the rest of the world outside the US. What are the dynamics over there?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nThat's right. There are several elements playing out on the COMIRNATY franchise. First, what we see is restrictions on vaccination guidelines, right? Versus the previous years, we see that the guidelines are really focusing on the older population, as well as the at-risk population.\nWe have, as you know, already signed several contracts with the European Commission, Canada, UK, and Australia. Following the approval in August last year, we started to execute other contracts with the European countries. As a matter of fact, some countries have decided to advance some of their order into 2023 so that they can execute their vaccination campaign properly. The other trend that we see is that actually we do not see major vaccination upticks in the future year. We think that what we have seen in the 2023, 2024 campaign is really the type of vaccination we will see, and that will be carried on the next few years.\nThe only area where there is a potential future growth in terms of vaccination uptake is if we can increase our co-administration with the flu vaccines, where in all our key markets, the rate of vaccination in flu is actually higher than it is for COMIRNATY. We believe that there is potentially here an opportunity. The last point that I want to say is you see that the COMIRNATY sales pattern is evolving towards a seasonal pattern. You see you have a very strong Q4, like you expect in flu vaccination type of market. That is what we see also to be expected in 2024.\nActually, as I was reading some of your models in the financial community, I think there is some confusion that we will have a higher Q1, Q2, which I believe will be more towards the second part of the year, but of course, in line with the guidance.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Alexandre. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks for taking my question. Albert, I was looking at SEC filings from Cerevel, and they disclosed that Pfizer was open to putting out a bid on Cerevel after phase III data, which would have been in 2024. I also noticed that you're saying you're not open to a buyback in 2024, and deleveraging remains a top priority. I just want to balance those two, especially also in the context of where the stock stands.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nWell, look, I will ask Dave to speak about it. The fact that we are looking at everything and we are engaging in everything doesn't mean that that's our obligation. We are doing all the work. It doesn't mean that our intention is to deviate from the capital allocation strategy that we have just articulated. That is number one priority. It is our dividend, and the growing dividend. It's a year of execution. We try to deleverage, as David said.\nOnce we bring our deleverage to the levels that we are aspiring, we will start also moving into share buybacks and, of course, M&A, which means that for 2024, we will see everything in existence because we never say never to business development opportunities that could come. Our strategy is that you will not see anything major in business development in terms of dollars.\nDavid, did I say it well?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nI think you corrected. Correct.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. You are a good teacher. Thank you. The other question from there, I think that was it, right?\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYes.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Umer.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nLet's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. Maybe for Aamir. ELIQUIS is the biggest drug on the initial list of 10 drugs for IRA. CMS has until 1 February to provide you the initial proposed negotiated price. That's two days away. Two questions here. Can you confirm you haven't already received that initial proposal yet?\nSecond question, can we expect that at some point between now and 1 September, which is the deadline that they have to make the final price public, that you'll give some investors some sort of directional information on how those discussions are going? Are we going to be kind of in the dark until 1 September?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAamir, are you planning to give lies to Tim or give us?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nJust saying, as you can appreciate, this whole price-setting authority in Medicare, this is new, and pharma companies are obviously beginning to understand this process with the federal government. The rules are complicated, so we're wrapping our mind around it. Our alliance partner, CMS, is taking the lead in engaging with CMS in an official process to determine the price for ELIQUIS in Part D that will begin on 1 January 2026.\nAs I'm sure you can appreciate, we're not going to comment on an ongoing price-setting process and negotiation.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. It's very difficult, Tim, to comment on these things because they are ongoing. It's very inappropriate and absolutely could complicate things. I understand that there is a need for people to understand because that's an important product. We will try as soon as possible and practical to be able to provide the level of details that we are looking at, everybody's looking, so that they can model it appropriately. Thank you very much. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Andrew Baum with Citi.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nMany thanks. A couple of questions, please. First, to Aamir.\nUnder your new leadership and commercial focus, what key products would you guide us to of recent launches that we should look for in terms of acceleration of rollout trajectory? It doesn't have to be recently launched, established ones as well. Second, to Mikael, could you just share a little bit more information about your next-generation PCV vaccine, specifically how many serotypes? I'm assuming that given it's a new technology, you will lose the ability to grandfather the pneumonia claim from the CAPiTA trial into the product profile as it matures. If you could confirm, that would be great.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Andrew. Your assumption, I don't think it is correct, but Mikael will answer to that. Let's first go to Aamir to basically give us a view of how you see in 2024 the priorities of the commercial execution in the US.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah.\nAndrew, I'll take a step back. Let me start by saying I've been very excited by this role and this opportunity, and also to do it with the team that we've built, which is a mix of both seasoned Pfizer leaders, as well as experienced leaders from outside of Pfizer. I mean, my focus, and we can talk about specific products. We've touched on many of them already. My focus overall is on execution excellence. In our primary care and specialty care portfolio, we have a lot of great brands. We have some really enduring franchises: VYNDAQEL, ELIQUIS, PREVNAR. I've spent quite a bit of time talking about that. Our focus there is to defend and grow where we can, and we do see some opportunities.\nWe also have to acknowledge that we have some brands that have great value propositions, but they happen to be in highly competitive categories with some very, very well-entrenched competitors. In a situation like that, my focus is principally, let's really prioritize the actions that can grow each of the brands, and we can talk about the individual launches. There's a lot of operational focus on blocking and tackling, including contracting.\nWhen we look at our main resources, we have our field force, our advertising and promotion dollars, and our medical capabilities, just prioritizing exactly where we put those. That is what I'm focused on with me and my management team. As I mentioned, we see opportunities in some of the core franchises in defending and growing our share, but then also in a number of our launches.\nAlbert mentioned in his opening remarks what we hope and expect to do with ABRYSVO, with NURTEC, with LITFULO, CIBINQO. Those are all brands that we're going to continue to focus on, including some of our recent acquisitions like OXBRYTA as well.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Andrew, let me take the liberty to ask also the other commercial leaders to comment a little bit on their priorities, because that will give you a better sense of the whole picture. Alexandre, in international, as you're taking over, what are your key priorities?\n\nAlexandre de Germay\n\nEVP and Chief International Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks for the question, Albert, and the opportunity to share my priorities. My main focus is really to focus on the area where we can generate material growth with improved return on investment. This is my mantra. How are we going to do that?\nMy top four markets, in the order, China, Japan, Germany, and France, represent 40% of our international divisions. It's quite concentrated. Those four markets will report directly to me so that we can have the resources and support the country to execute on their plan at best, and to generate the most growth. Our top 15 countries represent 70% of our total international. It's, again, quite concentrated.\nWhat I'm actually doing currently is, in each of those markets, we are selecting our drivers of growth, what are the key inline and the key new products where we can have material impact with improved return on investment. To give you an example, of course, it's going to be different from one country to the other because the archetype and the dynamic of those markets are different. Last week, I was in Japan.\nFor instance, VYNDAQEL diagnosis rate is half the diagnosis rate that we have in the US and in France. We reviewed last week the plan to go and catch those increased diagnosis rates, and we're going to continue to, of course, track on the execution. In Germany, ELIQUIS has a very strong ELIQUIS franchise. We believe we have growth to untap opportunity.\nI'm next week in Germany to actually review the plan on the ELIQUIS precisely, and we'll do the same thing on the new product. It's going to be, for instance, LORBRENA in China. As you know, lung cancer in China is an opportunity affecting a large proportion of the population. As a matter of fact, the proportion of the lung cancer that can benefit from LORBRENA in the worldwide community is about 1.7%. In China, it's actually 7%.\nWe believe we have a huge opportunity. What we're doing is actually developing a plan. Last week when I was visiting China, I worked to quickly get LORBRENA to those patients that could benefit from the clinical outcome. This is really what I'm doing in each of our top 15 countries. Frankly, the rest of the year will be simply tracking our execution, tracking all the metrics, both from activities, medical activities, and KPIs for each of our key products.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Maybe, Chris, also on the commercial front, how do you think the oncology in the US evolved?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Andrew, Albert. Our biggest priority right now is obviously continuity of the business. We've done a lot of work here in the last nine months during integration planning, and we don't want to miss a beat.\nIt's now moving towards flawless execution with immediate priorities, obviously, the PADCEV launch for advanced metastatic bladder cancer from the EV-302 study, the launch of XTANDI in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from the INVARP trial, the early launch, and also focus on access and awareness during 2024 for ELREXFIO in late-line multiple myeloma. For TALZENNA, we have up to 25% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who would be eligible in the US from the TALAPRO-2 indication.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Let's go to Mikael Dolsten. If you can make some comments on the next generation, as much as you can share about phase.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I think we have a very strong position with good momentum in the PCV conjugate. I think, Alexandre, you mentioned just the positive recommendation we got for PCV20 in Europe. Now, we're building on that unique platform.\nAs Andrew did say here, we are able, what you call grandfather, in unique claims for the adult segment for pneumococcal pneumonia. It's really the major burden with 150,000 US hospitalizations. To the best of our knowledge, the Pfizer platform with the new fourth generation, as was with the third generation, will be the only one that can carry that claim based on, as you said, the original CAPiTA studies.\nThe new generation will contain more serotypes, has applicability for adult and possibly pediatric, as we have done with all of ours. It also will include improvements on existing serotypes to altogether get a very good increased coverage versus the PCV20. I do think we are the one that really can continue this expansion of more serotypes by unique conjugation chemistry, carriers, and reformulations.\nI am cautious to abandon any serotypes where you work on infant and adults as the characterization of cause disease, for example, pneumonia, is not very well described. Maintaining the coverage, as we have uniquely, and it's not really happening with other products, is a unique differentiation. I feel very good about the fourth generation.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nMorning, everyone. Thanks so much for the question. Albert, the oncology franchise following Seagen, I suspect, will probably be one of your bigger growth drivers for Pfizer going forward. The question is, is there an intermediate or long-term target as a percent of revenue that you're looking to achieve for this segment? Are there technologies beyond ADCs that you think could be added to the pipeline? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer",
    "content2": "Yes. A very general event, I will ask Chris to comment a little bit on the technologies that we are having here. I can't say how much oncology will contribute, but clearly, we have given expectations about Seagen, and we say that we expect it to be $10 billion US dollars by year 2030 from $3.1 billion US dollars, what we gave guidance in 2024. Actually, we feel very good about the $10 billion US dollars.\nThe more data are coming. When we gave the $10 billion US dollars, we were not aware of some of the readouts that followed that projection, so we feel very, very good about that. Now, I have to say that the Pfizer pipeline in oncology, I think, was also among the strongest in our current therapeutic area. I think the combination in general is giving us, let's say, a lot of strength.\nChris, why don't you comment a little bit about how you see the R&D evolution of oncology, the platforms you are going to base your strategies?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. The modalities we want to focus on for now are those where we see we have significant strength and capabilities, including with medicinal chemistry, our protein engineering, as well as our strength in cancer biology. We therefore want to focus on small molecules, especially from our La Jolla site, bispecifics, both La Jolla and the new Seattle site, and ADCs in Seattle. Small molecules, biologics. As you know, we do have an interest also in allogeneic CAR T cells with the formation of Allogene, the company we still follow and have a significant interest in.\nFor now, focusing on those three modalities where we see significant opportunity also for combinations, for example, doing small molecules, ADCs, but also potentially in the future between ADCs and bispecifics.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe a question on NURTEC, the trends in market share as well as pricing. Just wanted to make sure that is there a significant price delta between NURTEC price versus the competitor price? I mean, the discount that they are offering, given that your competitor has multiple offerings in the headache market. If there is a delta, do you expect this to grow or decline over 2024 on pricing? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mohit, very much. Aamir, about NURTEC and in general, the migraine franchise.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah.\nMohit, thanks for the question. We were encouraged by Q4 for NURTEC, and I'll also include some comments on ZAVZPRET as part of my response. We were up more than 30% versus the prior year and over 20% versus the prior quarter. There are a few things that are encouraging. NURTEC continues to be the number one prescribed CGRP, so we have leading TRx volume and share. Interestingly, more than 90% of new prescribers in the category, many of whom were primary care physicians, are prescribing NURTEC.\nOur pills per Rx has also, over the last several quarters, been steadily rising. We continue to see opportunity. There are a few things to keep in mind. One is there's still a lot of unmet need. Albert referred to it in his written remarks, but there's a lot of patients undiagnosed, and very few get an Rx therapy.\nOral CGRPs are still only less than 20% of the Rx market. As you point out, this is also a very competitive category with QULIPTA and UBRELVY. I won't comment specifically on their pricing strategies versus ours, and GTMs play a role in all of it. Our focus for NURTEC, one, I think we want to be sharper and more competitive in our patient engagement and activation. Two, we have an opportunity with our field force to focus on both the most relevant CGRP writers and, as I said, PCPs. PCPs write 2/3 of triptans, but only about a little over 1/3 of CGRP. There's an opportunity there. Patient access and experience, there's an opportunity to really reduce the friction there.\nI will also mention ZAVZPRET because with an intranasal, we think we can have a very nice complement to an oral for either rapid pain relief. There's also unmet need for patients that have nausea and vomiting from the use of an oral. We want to continue to invest and grow in our NURTEC and ZAVZPRET franchise.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Two questions. First, on danuglipron, I know Pfizer doesn't want to provide an update, but clearly, the company has greater insight than we do into how the once-daily version is performing in the phase I PK trial. I'd like to ask, how would you characterize that performance so far? In the absence of any visibility, it's kind of hard for us to be confident in the outlook for this program.\nSecond question is, a new weight loss agent was added to phase I, designated 6016. Can you tell us what the mechanism is, please? Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Steve, I'm going to disappoint you because you are asking things that we have said we are not willing to disclose at this stage for multiple reasons. Clearly, on danu, we have more information than ours. It's very normal with everything that we are doing because we're having a very complicated, as I said, multiple experiments plan right now. Because we don't have new data, we're not going to comment on that. On the new weight loss molecules, we said that, unfortunately, we are not going to disclose the mechanism of action. The reason is because, first of all, it's too early, and we don't want to keep competitions. Nothing strange about that.\nI'm sorry to disappoint you, but there is not much to offer at this stage. Hopefully, as we said, mid-year is where we expect to have more information on that. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks very much, and thanks for all the updates. I have two questions, please. First is for Dave. Could you please discuss the 2024 gross margin cross in some detail? I think on the last call, you had discussed potentially a low 70% gross margin, but if you can comment on that in more detail, that would be helpful. The second question is for Mikael.\nIf danuglipron once daily does have a profile that you're looking for, would the company then conduct a phase IIa dose ranging study to assess the efficacy and tolerability in order to decide on a dose to advance phase IIb or phase III? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, DavID. Very quickly, Mikael, resolve danu, and then we'll go to Dave.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. You heard Albert say that we are running a number of clinical experiments to gather insight in that molecule, and we have a second lip. Pfizer has always been open to consider different types of clinical study design. In general, we tend to move into directly whenever data is supportive, if there is a large safety database, into phase III with a lead-in phase. We have to look at each program by program. When we have all the data, we will be able to share with you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Let's go to the gross margin where we can share a little bit more information.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nDavid, this is Dave Denton. I'll be very brief here. Obviously, as you indicated, our 2024 gross margin expectations are in the low 70s, as we discussed previously. As you know, as we cycle into 2024, there's a few things that are happening, as I indicated earlier. One is, as COVID comes down, we're kind of deleveraging now, as COVID had absorbed a lot of fixed overhead, so that's compressing gross margins.\nSecondly, we're in the process of insourcing many of the acquired products over the last couple of years. As we insource, the short-term effect of that is dampening on gross margin. It gives us an opportunity to improve gross margins as yields improve over time. Finally, there are two things finally here. New launches have that same characteristic.\nAs we launch a new product, yields and performance are not at peak performance. That will be an opportunity for us going forward. Finally, we have absorbed some inflation over time. That is an opportunity for us to take out over the next several periods. Again, an opportunity for us to enhance performance over time, but again, we're in the roughly low 70s for 2024, is our expectation.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nDavid, let me add a little bit more color here, but the COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID are big products, but they are manufactured in the same facilities. They are separate facilities, so they are not affecting the margins of the other products. The margins were really absorbing in those facilities when you had such a huge volume production and value production. Of course, the margins were seriously—those products were seriously taking a lot of the overhead.\nNow, as we are reducing our expectations for COVID into very realistic, we think, targets, this does not mean that we have eliminated our capacity to produce more if the demand is there, because that would be not responsible, first of all, from a public health perspective, but also from our investors' money perspective. That is why, so far, we maintain all this capacity, although the revenues are down.\nThere is a significant—the second thing that David said, keep in mind, all basically our new acquisitions that brought so many new products, they were from smaller relative companies. They did not really have their own manufacturing. These were all outsourced. Outsourced, of course, is way more expensive than when you are able to bring it. There are plans for everything to insource, but in manufacturing, that takes three years, right, to be able to reduce the margin.\nLast but not least, we have a disproportional amount of new launches. Those new launches are coming with a very big cost when you build infrastructure for something new to be developed. Of course, you build it for your peak revenues. Of course, you start with very low revenues, and then those are going up.\nAs the infrastructure is there, but then higher revenues for these new products are coming, it's always the case with new products, but margins are expected. It's not something that gross margins, you can't see it in months. You see it in years, the improvement. Clearly, this is an area that we know why it's happening, what's happening, and how we can improve it. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question.\nMaybe just for Dave and Albert, just kind of building on the longer-term margin piece of the equation. It sounds like we should think about margin recovery as a gradual process versus a snapback. Is that fair? I guess kind of the bigger picture question I was asking is just, how do we think about reasonable longer-term margins? Maybe not giving specific timelines, but can we think about kind of mid to high 30% operating margins as still a reasonable target for Pfizer? Just kind of factoring in some of the dynamics we're seeing now, do we need to kind of rethink where margins can go over time? Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nNo, I think you're absolutely correct.\nMid to high 30s is a reasonable target for us, with a slight caveat in the sense that the vaccine program, COMIRNATY, has a shared, as you know, gross margin level with our partner, and so that's dampening to gross margins and operating profits. I'll say slightly mixed adjusted for that product. From a progression standpoint, yes, you need to think about this as a gradual, steady improvement story over the next several periods.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.\n\nRajesh Kumar\n\nSenior Global Healthcare Analyst, HSBC\n\nHi there. Good afternoon. Just on the medium-term margin profile, thank you for the color you've provided. If you think about the growth aspirations you have, does that require you sacrificing some of the margins?\nIf you were to say hit the top end of your growth profile, would we be looking at mid-30s gross margin or lower, or what is the balance there? The second one, you briefly touched on your capital allocation priorities earlier. Obviously, cost-cutting and deleveraging is a priority for 2024. In the medium term, which are the therapy areas where you would deploy more capital after 2024 deleveraging exercise is done? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nDavid, why don't you take it?\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Maybe on the margin discussion, obviously what we've said is we have invested pretty substantially in our business over the past couple of years. Largely, the investment phase, at least from a business development standpoint, is behind us. We have work to invest to improve performance going forward, but the big dollars are already invested. Now it's an execution story and a continued improvement story.\nYou should expect that to occur over the next several periods. Obviously, the higher the revenue, the better performance because you get to leverage your fixed costs. Clearly, the higher those revenue targets and achievement happen, the better improvement from a margin perspective you should expect from us. From a capital allocation perspective, I think you said it right.\nWe are, at the moment, focused on executing our plan, focused on supporting our dividend growth over time, but importantly, beginning to deleverage as we cycle into operations and assets. From a priority standpoint, clearly, we've made a significant investment in oncology. You should expect us to put the investment thesis behind that franchise going forward. Clearly, that's number one at the moment.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI would add that following oncology, where clearly we have right now the biggest part of our R&D expenses, and we have a significant also part of our SI&A expenses. The other areas that we are putting a lot of emphasis when it comes to research, clearly vaccines, it's a crown jewel, and we plan to have significant productivity. In internal medicines, our metabolic franchise, it is an area that we are very excited. Obesity is part of that.\nWe do believe that obesity is a big market and is growing. We do believe that Pfizer has the capabilities that allows us to play and win in that area. That's an area that we will continue investing. Immune inflammation, we have significant investments, is the other area. Of course, we're among the fewers that they have antiviral and the effective steel investment.\nThose are the areas that we will be putting money on: oncology, number one, then vaccines, metabolic diseases, Immune inflammation, antivirals are the ones that we are continuing to invest in. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Researc, Berenberg\n\nThank you, just a couple of pipeline questions from me, please. Firstly, on RSV, can we expect you to announce the data for ABRYSVO following next third season in Q2? Also, on the two phase III starts you've highlighted today, B6A in lung, CDK4 in breast, when can we expect phase III data readouts for these two products? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI'm not sure what was your question on RSV?\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Researc, Berenberg\n\nIt's to understand whether you're going to publish the data from the following third season, third winter season of RSV.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Yes, I got it. Thank you. Thank you.\nWhy don't you take that, Mikael, on the ABRYSVO? Then Chris.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nWe continue to accumulate important RSV data and expansion of how this important vaccine can be used. You should expect this first half of the year, likely Q2, that we share more from our clinical trials, including full second season, but also expansion in traditional age groups. As you can note on clinicaltrials.gov, we have active trials, and we think that will very nicely allow high-risk groups across a large age span to be addressed.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. Then Chris.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nEVP and Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much for the question. The immediate readouts for this year, second half 2024, will be vepdegestrant in second line, hormone receptor positive, metastatic breast cancer, the VERITAC-2 study.\nAlso, second half 2024, we expect or anticipate results from BREAKWATER, very important indication, up to 12% of colorectal cancer with BRAFTOVI in first line and BRAF CRC. The new study starting right now is CDK4, B6A, and disitamab vedotin in phase III programs, and then also I hope later this year for EZH2. Those will appear in clinicaltrials.gov as primary completion dates beyond 2025 and 2026, but obviously, there could be interim results with earlier results.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, guys, for answering Kerry's question. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much. Two questions, if I may. Aamir, with your prior role, you had talked about a $25 billion US dollars in revenues by 2030 that the company was looking to deliver based upon M&A. We have the impairment with Arena. Is there an update for that?\nNow that you're in the role of US chief commercial officer, non-oncology, non-COVID, what would be on your wish list in your current seat in terms of where you feel an opportunity to expand those revenues, potentially through business development, that could work to hit that $25 billion US dollars target by 2030? Secondly, with the M&A activity across the industry, investors are always paying attention to what's going on with the FTC.\nHaving passed through this gauntlet with Seagen last year, is there anything you can comment about to help us think about how regulators are thinking about the M&A environment in terms of particularly size of deal or any other dimension that you think is worth being aware of that might have been your observation from your experience in 2023? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Aamir, why don't you take the question? By the way, let me clarify that Aamir's responsibility includes COVID revenue. Go ahead, Aamir.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nOkay. Chris, there's a lot in what you asked. Firstly, on the $25 billion US dollars goal that we put out there, I'll just remind that we guided to $20 billion US dollars for what we plan on getting to by 2030 for the deals that we had done. I would also just remind you that the $25 billion US dollars was a 2030 goal. There is lots of time between now and 2030 to achieve that goal, consistent with our capital allocation priorities that Dave described.\nOn your second question, I mean, to be honest, yes, everyone's got a wish list, but my focus is on exactly what I described right now and what we talked about as a management team, which is delivering value from our launches and delivering value from the deals that we've done.\nThat's where my focus is. Now, lastly, in terms of the FTC, it's not appropriate for us to comment on what the FTC is going to do or not do, but what I can say is that we feel very good about how we have operated with all regulators and all regulatory bodies across the world to get done all the deals that we did. I think that just speaks to our patient-centric approach and our collaborative nature with regulators.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nFair point on the PREVNAR comments with the impairment charge and kind of the moving parts between adult, pediatric, and international. Consensus has modest top-line growth over the next few years for the entire franchise. Is that a reasonable expectation for investors given the increased competition from Merck and the US pool shrinking?\nDo you have an internal view on what the ACIP recommendation will be regarding PREVNAR and V116? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nLook, Aamir, why don't you take the—is it the PREVNAR expectations? We don't comment on what the expectations of the Street are, right? I think we gave a very good, let's say, high-level trajectory how we see this market. In the US, the adult opportunity, it is mainly, as always, in with the adult, a catch-up opportunity. When you come, you have a pool of all the people that are eligible, but some of them would choose to make the vaccine. Usually, that happens in the first year and maybe a little bit then on the second year. We have exhausted, I think, this opportunity within 96% market share.\nRight now, I don't think that we will see in the US, in the adult, huge opportunity. Merck competition is coming into that. This is not a very big growth area for us because, as I said, this is not where we plan to do it. It's huge when you launch it, then very quickly goes down because then it is just the people that are really graduating, they are going into this cohort in terms of age. The big opportunity is the pediatric because it is four doses, it's not one, and because it is a huge cohort every year, way bigger the cohort of newborns than people that are becoming 65 in the country. That's how we should see it. There's nothing much to add into that. Next question, please. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nEvan, you're last.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much. Thank you, Albert. I appreciate it. Two questions from me. One, when you think about the additional $25 billion US dollars revenues by 2030, now that Seagen's part of this business, where are we in getting to that metric? My second question is really on OXBRYTA and sickle cell disease. When you bought the asset, you noted that you planned to speed up the distribution of the drug to parts of the world most impacted by the disease.\nWe haven't really seen much OUS given recent competitive approvals of Casgevy in the Middle East. How do you think about the OUS opportunity in context of competitive updates there? Seagen and then thinking about some OXBRYTA comments.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOn the season, maybe I can take it because that's an easy answer. From Seagen, we expect to get $10 billion US dollars by year 2030. That was a number that we put out there when we announced the acquisition. Since then, a few things that have reinforced our confidence in this number have occurred. The first one, it is that ADC became the hottest thing on the M&A activity. Everybody wants an ADC, which basically our big bet was in this technology.\nIt looks like there is an overall consensus among investors, companies, and analysts that this is a technology that will deliver a lot. That gave us a lot of comfort that happened after we announced. The second thing that also happened after we announced this $10 billion US dollars was that Seagen came out with significant readouts of significant products and that were beyond our expectations.\nWhat you don't see, but we see, they are advancing a lot of stuff that some of them we will show you on 29 February 2024. It was a bet in the technology and a bet in the company. We feel that we did very well in both. The $10 billion US dollars is $10 billion US dollars of the $25 billion US dollars, but we don't change it, and we remain confident that we can make it. Of course, in addition to that, there was an additional $10 billion US dollars for all the other things that we have done and these $5 billion US dollars that we could execute. Now, on OXBRYTA, how OXBRYTA is doing, Aamir?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Evan, with regards to OXBRYTA, and then I'll comment on the acquisition as well since you referred to that. We're pleased with the US performance.\nQ4 was up 30% over the prior year and 14% over the prior quarter. The prescription trends are very solid. We've made a lot of investments in customer-facing teams since we made that acquisition. We like the momentum that we're seeing in the US, and we expect to see more. Right now, the rest of the world is a very small part of OXBRYTA revenue, and that is something that will take time to develop, and we'll obviously look at that appropriately. As you think about the GBT acquisition, it's important to look at OXBRYTA, but I also would remind you that we're also very excited about GBT601, which we expect can bring a lot of value in addition to OXBRYTA.\nSome of it will, if it's successful from a clinical and regulatory perspective, some sales will be cannibalized, but there will also be room for OXBRYTA in the market to continue to grow. When you look at the combination of the momentum in the US, the opportunity that's yet to be developed outside the US, and 601, where we presented great data at ASH in December, we think that there's a lot of value to be gained from this acquisition.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. I will add, it is the same exactly with the GBT acquisition. When we did the acquisition, we announced our projections for year 2030. Since then, things have improved in terms of our confidence to deliver these numbers.\nI'm not talking only that OXBRYTA is performing exactly as we thought it would, but the most important upside is that we had data that we didn't have when we made the acquisition on the 601 that has the potential to become a transformative therapy in sickle cell and really, really brings to the next is a step change if that thing, if the phase III, let's say, reconfirms the phase II results.\nAlso over there, I think what we announced, we feel now we're more confident that we should be able to achieve and hopefully exceed. With that, I think it's time to end the call. In summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead. We have defined our five key priorities that will keep us focused, and I repeat again, this will be a year of execution.\nI have assembled a team that I handpicked that I believe are the absolutely right leaders to execute. I know that the whole world was impressed with the way that we executed our COVID strategies, how we were able to execute on the R&D front, on the manufacturing front, and on the commercial front with two products, the vaccine with the highest market share, and with a per product in oral antiviral.\nWe plan to repeat the same execution excellence level as we are building oncology leadership, as we are progressing the next wave of our pipeline, as we are maximizing the performance of all these new launches that have happened, as we execute our cost realignment program starting this year with SI&A, but also which you will see the results.\nOf course, the program to improve the gross margin that you won't see results now because it takes long, but we started now as we speak. Laser focus in maximizing value for shareholders with the way that we allocate our capital. The team is there to make sure that this will happen, and I think we should meet again in three months, and we will see how we are progressing against those stated goals. Thank you very much all. Bye-bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Pfizer fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer and Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nFrancesca DeMartino\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer and Senior VP, Pfizer\n\nGood morning and welcome to Pfizer's Earnings Call. I'm Francesca DeMartino, Chief Investor Relations Officer. On behalf of the Pfizer team, thank you for joining us. This call is being made available via audio webcast at pfizer.com. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the third quarter of 2023. Our earnings materials can be accessed on the IR website at investors.pfizer.com.

With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Francesca. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Pfizer continues to have a far-reaching and positive impact on human health. Through the first nine months of the year, more than 467 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. Compared with the first nine months of 2022, we have reached more patients in several key therapeutic areas, including oncology, cardiovascular disease, and anti-infectious diseases. Patients will always be on our side, and this figure serves as a testament to our leadership in innovation, and our commitment to understanding and serving patients' needs. During the third quarter, we were encouraged by the continued strong performance of Pfizer's non-COVID products, with revenue from these products growing 10% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. We saw significant contributions from new launches, and robust year-over-year growth for several key inline brands.\nOur recently launched respiratory syncytial virus, the RSV vaccine, this is called ABRYSVO, contributed $375 million in US revenue. With the recent approval of the maternal indication, Pfizer is the only company with an RSV vaccine approved for preventing RSV in older adults and in infants via maternal immunization. We believe ABRYSVO will be a significant and growing contributor to revenue, as many customers have indicated to us that protecting both populations with one vaccine is desirable and a competitive advantage for ABRYSVO. In the US alone, there are approximately 80 million adults over age 60 who are eligible for RSV vaccination, and an estimated 1.5 million pregnant women are eligible for maternal immunization with an RSV vaccine between September 2023 and January 2024. NURTEC, VYDURA, and OXBRYTA, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022, contributed $233 million and $85 million in global revenues, respectively.\nFor NURTEC, in the US, oral CGRPs represent about 17% of the migraine market, and the unmet need is high. We believe oral CGRPs can ultimately be the first-line therapy for migraine and could eventually account for as much as 40% of the overall migraine market. Primary care is a clear source of potential growth in the migraine marketplace. Year to date, primary care healthcare providers wrote more than 6.1 million prescriptions for tractants, compared with approximately 1 million for oral CGRPs, which highlights a significant potential opportunity for growth. Regarding OXBRYTA, there is a significant burden of illness and unmet need for patients suffering from sickle cell disease. An estimated 12 million people around the world have SCD, sickle cell disease, with the highest prevalence in countries with the lowest resources.\nWhile in the US, 95% of children survive to adulthood, 99% of children in other regions will die before they reach their fifth birthday, many without even being ever diagnosed. Our VYNDAQEL family of products, including VYNDAQEL, VYNDAMAX, and VYNMAC, recorded 47% operational growth globally compared with the third quarter of 2022. This growth was driven largely by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication, primarily in the US and developed Europe. We estimate there are between 120,000 and 150,000 people suffering from ATTR cardiomyopathy, with the majority still not yet diagnosed. The largest unmet need continues to be the lack of general understanding and ability to diagnose this deadly disease, which is why we are focused on educational activities to expedite diagnosis and get appropriate patients on the treatment with the products as the proven standard of care.\nSuch efforts significantly contributed to this quarter's revenue increase in the US, and our Prevnar family of products, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, saw global revenue rise 15% operationally compared with the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven primarily by strong patient demand for Prevnar 20 adults in the US, the US approval of Prevnar 20 pediatric and associated stocking, and growth of Prevnar 15 pediatric in certain emerging markets. These were partially offset by anticipated lower market selling in the US for Prevnar pediatric due to competitive entry. Of note, Prevnar 20 adult remains the category-leading pneumococcal vaccine for adults in the US, with a 95% market share in the third quarter. Year to date, revenues for our non-COVID products have grown 7% operationally, and we remain on track to deliver 6% to 8 operational revenue growth for these products for the full year.\nWe continue to progress toward our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. Recent milestones include US and EU approvals and launch of ABRYSVO in pregnant individuals, US approval and launch of ELREXFIO in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, US approval of our BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI combination in BRAF-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, US approval of VELSIPITY for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, EC approval of LITFULO for severe alopecia areata, and US approval of PENBRAYA, the first and only pentavalent vaccine that provides coverage against the five most common serogroups causing meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults 10 through 25 years of age. Today, we have now executed 13 of the 19 originally identified potential launches, with four other products approved and preparations being made for their launch.\nIn fact, five of the six remaining potential launches have been largely de-risked from a technical perspective. The only one remaining would be our mRNA flu candidate. Given our recent positive results from our next-generation mRNA flu COVID combination candidate, and pending results for our 65 and older first-generation first-stream standalone mRNA flu study, timing of our standalone mRNA flu is now expected after 2024. If successful, our next-generation mRNA flu COVID combination candidate is expected to market in 2025. Mikael will share more about these programs shortly. We remain excited about our proposed acquisition of Seagen, and the dramatic impact we think this combination can have on human health. One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, so conquering cancer would have an almost unimaginable impact on humanity.\nWe recently gained unconditional antitrust clearance from the EC, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance by the US FTC. We have raised $31 billion in acquisition financing so far and continue to expect incremental 2030 risk-adjusted revenues in excess of $10 billion, and expected cost efficiencies of $1 billion to be realized by the end of year three post-closure without impacting any R&D program. With that, I turn it over to Dave, and after Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO and EVP, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning. Before I review this quarter's results, I'll address a couple of topics that have been top of mind with investors since our announcement on 13 October 2023. These topics relate to our future US government PAXLOVID revenue forecast, as well as our multi-year cost realignment program. With respect to revenue recognition associated with the amended agreement, the US government is expected to return an estimated 7.9 million EUA-labeled treatment courses, and in return, will receive a volume-based credit at an approximate value of $4.2 billion at the end of 2023 for future treatment courses. Pfizer will also provide an additional 1 million treatment courses into the US strategic national stockpile.\nAs a result of all of that, Pfizer has an obligation to deliver an estimated 8.9 million treatment courses, for which we will record approximately $4.2 billion of revenue beginning in 2024 as we deliver these treatment courses. It is important to note that there is no cash compensation for the estimated 8.9 million treatment courses delivered. Regarding our cost realignment program, I want to reiterate that we expect to achieve at least $3.5 billion of net cost savings by the end of 2024 versus the midpoint of our August 1st 2023 SI&A and R&D guidance. We expect $1 billion of targeted savings in 2023, and expect an additional savings of at least $2.5 billion in 2024.\nIn a moment when I review the components of our full year 2023 guidance, you will see that we have lowered the midpoints of both our SI&A and R&D guidance ranges by $500 million, respectively. Now, turning to the quarter, our Q3 results, both top and bottom line, were significantly and negatively impacted by our COVID products. Revenues declined 41% operationally, the result of the decrease in both PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY sales, while adjusted diluted loss per share was also significantly impacted by $5.6 billion of non-cash inventory write-offs of COVID-related inventories. I want to emphasize, as Albert stated previously, that the operational revenue growth of our products in Q3, excluding both PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY, was strong at 10%. Contributing to the strong performance was our newly approved RSV vaccine and the families of products associated with both Prevnar and VYNDAQEL.\nAdditionally, our recently acquired products, NURTEC and OXBRYTA, also contributed to this strong performance. Our reported diluted loss per share of $0.42 and adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.17 in the quarter are primarily the result of the decline in PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY sales, and the non-cash charge related to write-offs of COVID-related inventories. The inventory write-off of $4.7 billion for PAXLOVID and $900 million for COMIRNATY negatively affected adjusted loss per share by $0.84. Foreign exchange movements had a de minimis unfavorable impact on third-quarter revenues and increased adjusted diluted loss per share by $0.04, or 2%, compared to last year. Now, let me briefly touch on our full year guidance. Given we updated our full year revenue and EPS guidance on October 13th, I'm just going to hit a few of the highlights.\nTotal company full year 2023 revenues are expected to be in the range of $58 to 61 billion versus the previous range of $67 to 70 billion. Importantly, we continue to expect 6% to 8 full year operational revenue growth for non-COVID products year over year. As anticipated, the majority of this growth is occurring in the second half of the year, given the timing of new products and indicated launches. I want to remind you that beginning in Q4, we will overlap the acquisitions of both Biohaven and GBT, which were completed in October 2022. Adjusted cost of sales and percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 41% to 43, primarily the result of the $5.6 billion non-cash charge related to inventory write-offs for our COVID products.\nAdjusted SI&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $13.3 to 14.3 billion, and adjusted R&D expenses to be within a range of $11.9 to 12.9 billion. The midpoints of both ranges are now $500 million lower than our original guidance. As a result of all these, the company now expects full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to 1.65 per share versus the original guidance range of $3.25 to 3.45. All additional components of our guidance are included in our press release that was issued earlier today. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is based on three core pillars. First is reinvesting in our business, second is growing our dividends over time, and third is making value-enhancing share repurchases.\nIn the first nine months of 2023, we invested $7.9 billion in internal R&D, returned $6.9 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend, and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed Seagen acquisition. Lastly, in addition to completing a $31 billion unsecured debt offering in Q2 of this year, we are ready to execute the remaining short-term financing to complete the proposed Seagen acquisition upon fulfillment of the required closing conditions. We expect to deliver our capital structure following the completion of this transaction. As we deliver, we anticipate returning to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. In closing, I want to reiterate that our product portfolio remains very strong. We continue to be encouraged by the momentum of our non-COVID products in Q3, and are committed to the successful execution of our new product and indication launches.\nWe expect the cost realignment program will improve our operating margin, enhancing long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Mikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Today, I will share important updates from our robust respiratory vaccine portfolio. Our respiratory vaccines are built upon three cutting-edge platforms that enable us to bring the right science to the right pathogen. These include our mRNA platform in partnership with BioNTech, targeting highly variant viruses, our subunit platform, targeting viruses that remain relatively consistent season to season, and our conjugate vaccine platform designed to help prevent bacterial infections. We have achieved FDA approvals of vaccines derived from each platform within the last year, and aim to further expand our leadership with additional vaccine candidate development. Today, I will provide information on our standalone flu vaccine candidate, flu COVID combination vaccine candidate, and next-gen pneumococcal vaccine candidate. We are pleased to announce that we achieved both primary endpoints in the 18 to 64-year-old cohort of our ongoing phase III flu trial.\nIn the trial, our first-gen mRNA flu vaccine candidate demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to a licensed flu vaccine at the time of the primary analysis. This represents the first and only demonstration of efficacy and superiority for an mRNA-based flu vaccine candidate. In this age cohort, efficacy was maintained through the trial's end-of-season analysis, with our candidate remaining non-inferior to the licensed comparator. Safety was similar to the standard flu vaccine. The primary and end-of-season efficacy analysis considered both influenza A and B cases collectively. The vast majority of cases recorded in our trial and during the 2022/2023 flu season overall were flu A cases. Immunogenicity data showed robust antibody responses against influenza A compared to licensed flu vaccine. Humoral responses against influenza B were lower than those achieved with the comparator.\nRecall that our standalone flu vaccine phase III study also includes a 65-year-old cohort that we previously shared encouraging T cell data for all four strains from the phase II study in this cohort. Our belief is that the ability of the vaccine candidate to induce T cell responses may contribute to the improved efficacy of a current seasonal flu vaccine, particularly those 65 and older. We expect the readout from this age group later this year. To address the lower B responses seen with our first-gen standalone flu candidate, Pfizer created next-generation reformulations. These were incorporated into our mRNA flu candidates in combination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which I will review now.\nIn positive phase I to top-line data announced last week, we observed that reformulation of the lead flu candidates resulted in improved immunicity against influenza B, allowing us to meet all criteria for advancement to phase III. In the trial, our lead candidate formulations induced robust immune responses with point estimates for geometric mean titer ratios that were consistent with criteria applied to approved vaccines for all matched flu and SARS-CoV-2 strains. Notably, point estimates for geometric mean titer ratios with selected candidate formulations were greater than one relative to their licensed comparator for all matched flu vaccine strains. The safety profile of evaluated candidates was consistent with Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine. Following these positive immunicity data, we plan to initiate the phase III study in the coming months.\nSuccessfully developing a broad seasonal vaccine franchise anchored around the mod flu mRNA vaccine is a key priority, as it may allow us to tap into the nearly 50% annual flu vaccination rate in the US adults. We're taking a differentiated approach in pursuit of this goal, leveraging both mRNA and protein subunit technologies. Our development program includes double and triple combination vaccines to potentially help protect against flu, COVID-19, and RSV. Now, turning to Prevnar, I'll start by reminding you that this is the only PCV business with an FDA indication for pneumonia in adults. Providing protection specifically against pneumococcal pneumonia is critical. It's the most common form of pneumococcal disease in adults, leading to 150,000 US hospitalizations each year. The prevalence of non-bacteriemic pneumococcal pneumonia is more than 15-fold, greater than that of invasive pneumococcal disease in US adults 50 and older.\nPrevnar's pneumonia indication is supported by the capital trial, which was enabled by a pneumococcal vaccine population and proprietary assay. These innovative characteristics make it challenging for others to conduct a similar study, given the high level of pneumococcal vaccine coverage that exists today. Capita's innovative design and landmark results helped establish our leading and differentiated position in the PCV space. To solidify this position, we are committed to pursuing continued innovation. Our goal is to potentially maximize valency and improve immunicity while maintaining coverage of the serotypes clinically demonstrated to protect against pneumonia. In line with this commitment, we have been developing a fourth-generation PCV candidate that builds on the Prevnar business' 20+ years of innovation. Our next-generation technology leverages cutting-edge conjugation, chemistry, carriers, and reformulation. Using these new proprietary vaccine technologies, we observed a several-fold improvement in select serotype immunicity in a monovalent phase I study.\nBased on these data, we're confident that when we move this technology into our multivalent fourth-gen candidate, we have the potential to achieve increased valency with improved serotype immunicity. We are now advancing our fourth-generation candidate into our first in human trial, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023. Finally, I will leave you with our list of milestones and call out the recent approval of VELSIPITY, [inaudible]] and PENBRAYA, the first pentavalent pneumococcal vaccine. Pfizer has delivered more than a dozen regulatory approvals this year alone. I'll also note the recent launches of ABRYSVO for maternal immunization and ELREXFIO in multiple myeloma. Thank you. Let me turn it back to Francesca to start the Q&A session.\n\nFrancesca DeMartino\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer and Senior VP, Pfizer\n\nThanks, Mikael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We will answer as many questions as time permits, and IR will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Operator, please assemble the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star one to ask a question. And our first question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotech Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I think I have a big-picture question on your new launches, which is extremely important for your growth. Are you seeing any impact, given, I think, vaccine fatigue that we've seen with COVID impacting RSV and pneumococcal vaccines? And how do you think about that impact as you think about 2023 and 2024? Do you think that will dissipate? Thanks.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nThank you for your question. First of all, I think it's good when you have a portfolio. And we have a quite strong portfolio because we have RSV, we have COVID, and we have pneumococcal in the respiratory front. But I think the biggest impact will be when and if we have combination products. We think that combination products, because of their convenience, because vaccines are preferred by pairs with Zero Copay, will increase basically the volumes and vaccination rates of all vaccines because of the convenience of one injection. And I think this is why you saw from Mikael all our efforts right now are in developing multiple combinations so that consumers and physicians will have choice which ones to administer always with the same convenience. I think we can go to the next question. Thank you very much, Robyn.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Huynh Trung with UBS.\n\nHuynh Trung\n\nExecutie Director Equity Research, UBS\n\nOh, hi. Thanks for the questions. I have one on flu and then just one on danu. So on flu, can you confirm the comparator in the 18 to 64 and also the 64 age groups was the low-dose flu vaccines? Is there a risk FDA is going to need data against high-dose flu vaccines? And from a commercial perspective, do you think you still need high-dose flu data, the comparator against high-dose flu data, given that's what's recommended by CDC in the older population? And then on danu, just on the data that we expect before year-end, what do you need to show in that in order to move it into phase III trials? Is something similar to the phase II we saw earlier this year enough to move it to phase III? Thanks very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. On the flu comparator, I can confirm that it is the low dose on the younger population because that's the only one that's allowed. On the older population, we are having studies now with the low dose, but we will do also with the higher dose. We have both. On danu, there's not much to say. We need to wait to see the data. Clearly, when you are moving ahead with a program like that, you need to see the totality of the data. We are working now intensively to be able to have those data presented before year-end. Let's move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to continue on the oral obesity theme for a second. I noticed there's a new molecule, 522, that you moved into phase I. And my question is, is the chemical structure and the chemical series akin to the danu and lotiglipron programs? And also, Albert, you mentioned you want to wait to see the danuglipron phase II data, but I realize the trial's been wrapped up for a few weeks now. Have you not seen it yet? Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Mikael, would you like to take the question about the new molecule and the danu?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. We are building a platform around the GLP area and also obesity in general with multiple different mechanisms and compounds. We remain focused on the danuglipron readout, as Albert mentioned, as our main opportunity here for getting data to review for obesity in type 2 diabetes. But there are many indications where GLP may play a role outside the typical metabolic. So this one gives us just more options to explore and have interesting data. And you will see more new mechanisms also coming from Pfizer. We have a pretty strong effort here. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Let's go to the next call.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for me. I was just wondering, on your RSV launch, how we should think about the potential for revaccination in 2024. And then on your DMD gene therapy program, I think you've previously talked about having interim data by year-end. Is that still the case? And does the recent competitor data make you more or less optimistic in your program? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. First of all, let me make a comment on the recent data that we saw about the DMD failures. It's very, very bad news for patients. This is a patient population that doesn't have solutions. I hope there will be a solution for them with the discussion of the FDA, or I can't comment. Now, on our DMD program, I will ask Mikael to comment on that. And then on the RSV, Angela. Mikael, why don't you start with the DMD, and then Angela go to RSV?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I echo Albert's comment that we also always had when someone failed a study. We are very encouraged about getting to the readout. You are right. There is an opportunity for an interim analysis around year-end with final analysis second half of next year. And overall, I think our gene therapy for DMD has shown a very consistent effect across biomarkers and functional endpoints. And what has been differentiated so far is that when you look at the functional data we have reported, it has been giving encouraging signals in both the younger and the slightly older boys. And that has not been seen with the other company you referred to. So in a way, I remain, as earlier, very positive about looking forward to the readout and let the data tell the story.\nOf course, this makes our gene therapy, in a way, the main game in town.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThen there was a question, Angela, on the RSV.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Pharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nWell, as you heard during the ACIP discussions, our recommendation for ABRYSVO today is really one around shared clinical decision-making. We were asked to bring additional data when they are ready. Just to confirm, we will have additional data in vaccine effectiveness in broader populations. We will have safety data also in broader populations. We will also have immunogenicity data in younger populations. All of this will be, I think, available in the next year when we plan to bring this back to the CDC. In addition to that, I omitted to mention that we'll also have second-season efficacy data. We'll be able to bring this totality of data together to determine whether the recommendations will change, but also what the vaccination schedule will be. That's to come in 2024.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Angela. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thank you very much. As was just noted a couple of minutes ago, the danu data has reached its primary completion. It was a while ago. Albert, when you were asked, you stressed the words \"totality of the data,\" implying that you could have seen some part of the data. Mikael, when you were asked, you talked about different indications. These are not confidence-building statements. So I'm curious, what have you seen? And Mikael, you've said in the past you were absolutely encouraged and confident in the profile of danu. Are you still absolutely encouraged and confident? So that's the first question. Secondly, a competitor spoke to potentially COVID-derived decrease in diagnosis of inflammatory diseases such as UC. And I'm wondering if you've seen any of that. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nSteve, I think you likely misunderstood my comments on the totality. It has nothing to do with any data that I have seen because I have it, right? So the data have not been presented. I don't think the study has been completed yet. So I will ask also Mikael to comment on that. But don't read, please, anything on the totality of the data. What I meant is that we are doing this. We are doing the release formulation, which will make it once a day. There are multiple things, but we need to wait and see. We see how competitors are doing before deciding what we will do. But the most important thing is to see what is the efficacy and safety of the study that will readout. So nothing to read in my comment on the totality of the data. So Mikael, do you want to add?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I can just echo what you said so well, Albert. We and I remain very enthusiastic to look forward to see the data. We have not seen the final top-line report coming yet. So the study is still ongoing, but will be available before year-end. danuglipron has shown, as you know, some really interesting profile as a full agonist. And it's our main opportunity and effort for obesity in type 2 diabetes. We got earlier today a question about new molecules that are coming in. And that's when I mentioned that there are additional indications to pursue for such new molecules. And we also have new mechanisms that are validated that are coming in in oral versions. So it just punctuates our big effort we have around both this class and obesity and other disorders.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nSo in essence, he's still excited. Thank you very much, Mikael. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Louise Chen with Cantor.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nResearch Analyst, Cantor\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you, on this fourth-generation PCV, how much additional serotype coverage will you have? And then also on ABRYSVO, will that be available to pregnant women in the pharmacy, or do they have to go to their OB-GYN? And then lastly, just on danuglipron again here, will you also have the modified-released data before year-end? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nMikael, you will take the PCV question and the danu, but also, Angela, very quickly, ABRYSVO is available also in pharmacies for pregnant women.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Pharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nYes. It's going to be available in pharmacists, in doctors' offices, in OB-GYN offices. I think we have a real stocking advantage here, Louise, because anyone just needs to stock one product for two indications for both populations. So I think the uptake is to come. And certainly, the next few months, being that it's the winter, is when we begin to believe we'll see some good uptake.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nMikael?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nOn the PCV fourth generation, I hope you looked at today's data. And what you could see is that we are really the first company that has been able to put in place a whole set of new technology that can bring immune responses to a higher level than have been seen. And that allows us to go with even more comprehensive coverage than the current 20. I'm not going to give your curiosity an answer how many serotypes. I can just tell you it's considerably more than the 20. On danu, we look upon danuglipron as a once-a-day QD molecule because of the reformulation technologies that we have put in place and already generated some clinical data on and are now concluding. So that's really how we look upon danuglipron. And we'll have final data on the best formulation option early next year.\nBut as Albert said, we're enthusiastic to look forward to the efficacy data later this year. So very exciting time.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Mikael. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have David Risinger with Leerink Partners.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes. Thanks very much. So I have another question on danuglipron since it appears to be the company's number one pipeline candidate based upon your forecasts. So regarding the phase II-B results that are expected soon, how should we expect Pfizer to share those results? And then with regard to the once-daily formulation that you just mentioned, Mikael, will that be ready for the phase III start, assuming that the company moves to start phase III shortly after the phase II-B results are generated? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI mean, the first question, given the importance of the molecule, we'll start them with the press release. There may be a call or not. But with the press release, we'll make them publicly available. Now, Mikael, you want to take the second part of the question of David?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I can first echo what Albert and I said. We look forward with enthusiasm to get the danuglipron obesity data later this year. And of course, as Albert said, pending totality of reviewing everything we have, we have made a lot of progress and been able to accelerate the QD danu. Now, we're waiting for some more clinical data early next year. But I think it's within our reach if we decide to start the pivotal study next year to do it with a once-a-day molecule.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Mikael. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just two for me here. First, could you just comment a little bit more on what we're seeing with NURTEC and the ramp relative to your expectations? And maybe just as part of that, just any color on pricing we're seeing within the market today and how we should think about that going forward. And then my second question was on 2024. And I know you're not giving guidance today. But as you look at where consensus has kind of shaken out post the COVID and cost restructuring updates, I think the earnings are in kind of the low $3 range at this point.\nI guess just are there any directional kind of pushes or pulls in the numbers that you feel the street isn't capturing properly and should be kind of thinking about before we get your kind of final formal guidance as we look to early next year? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. David, tell us a little bit about 2024 guidance that you are not going to tell us.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO and EVP, Pfizer\n\nRight. So obviously, it's a little early for 2024. I will just say that clearly, we had a clearing event as it relates to our COVID expectations for this year. So a lot of that risk is behind us as we think about the balance of this year. I do expect that the balance of this year will be very informative, particularly in the US, as we think about utilization trends, both for vaccination rates and, importantly, PAXLOVID here in the US. That will allow us to have a better clarity as we cycle into 2024 of the utilization around those specific products, which will still be meaningful to us at an enterprise level.\nClearly, when we get to providing guidance, we'll give you a lot of information beneath that so you can get a good sense of, importantly, our non-COVID products, which continue to trend very favorably and very well. And we can layer on, I'll say, the optionality associated with our COVID franchise as we cycle into next year. So obviously, a lot more to come. We're looking forward to sharing those very specific details after the first of the year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, David. Angela about NURTEC, not alone, about the NURTEC performance in the marketplace, including the price.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Pharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nYes. So thanks for the question, Chris, because it's a great opportunity for us to share that we are seeing NURTEC perform just as we expected, in fact, with some really strong performance indicators that I'd like to share with you. First of all, from a TRX perspective, we grew 28% compared to last year this time. And sequentially, we grew 6% versus last quarter. In fact, on October 20th, we saw the highest week of TRXs and NRXs to date. That growth is also seen in the number of prescribers. Just this quarter alone, we had 73,000 prescribers write NURTEC. And we are now moving at a clip of about 23,000 writers a week, which is 30% more than UBRELVY and double that of QULIPTA. Another good place to look is also in new-to-brand starts, right, and BRXs.\nAnd when you look at that, MBRX growth for NURTEC is higher than UBRELVY and QULIPTA in all the deciles of physicians, but particularly in the decile 8 to 10s, which, as you know, is where the highest prescribers are or who are the highest prescribers. And then when you look at pill count, we see something interesting there too. We have been very intensely or intently driving our pill pack toward the larger pill pack size, which is the 16-pack, because of our prevention indication. And so when you look at the totality of all the pills or the total volume of pills, we have a leading market share there, more than 50%. And so I think when you look at all these indicators, at least from the way that we're looking at it, it's a very positive story. It's exactly how we see it.\nThe expansion into primary care, as you heard in Albert's comments, is what it is that we're after. And today, only 17% of the entire market is oral CGRPs, which tells you that most of the market is still an opportunity for us and represents growth that we're really looking forward to. And I think that we put the right investments in the right places to generate this growth in the future. From a pricing perspective, obviously, it's a product that is rebated. And so I think the way to think about it is that from a patient perspective, which is where we really put a lot of focus, we want to make sure that our patients are able to get these scripts, are able to get access for NURTEC, especially as you consider that we're trying to mobilize people away from topiramate and away from triptans onto all CGRPs.\nSo the growth and effects here are significant. And you see that quarter over quarter because we are making sure that we're able to provide access to patients who deserve and are eligible for NURTEC.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. And I have a question regarding your S1P at trastuzumab. Would love to get your thoughts on the label. It seems like, I mean, you could avoid a lot of cardiac monitoring, but at the same time, there's this new requirement of eye exam as well as skin exam. How do you think about uptake considering these examinations before the start of the treatment, given that these doctors are not used to it?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAll right. Mikael, quite a medical question. Would you like to answer it, please?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nI'm happy to start on it. I think we have a very robust label for VELSIPITY. It's the only S1P in this drug class, old shots like this, that have a simple flat dosing and immediate start without any prior need for, let's say, cardiac rhythm exams like the other drug in this class. All S1P have various eye exams to monitor. And I think our label similarly has a recommendation to do that. So it's really nothing new. And our efficacy data in UC has been very favorable. So we are very optimistic that this can be a true best-in-class versus colitis.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAnd David, you want to add? Yes, please.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Pharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nSure. I was just going to add to that that, I mean, competitively, we believe that we have an excellent efficacy and safety profile. We don't have a need to titrate up, as Mikael said, but also our assessments are standard versus our competitors at the initiation of therapy. So I think that this is a level playing field that we're in. Certainly, patient support is an area of focus for us, right, to ensure that patients are getting the assessments that they need. But we feel that this is pretty standard practice, and we'll be able to launch this product as planned.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Angela. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nMorning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple of quick ones. First, I know Seagen obviously hasn't closed yet, but does all the emphasis on the ADCs from ESMO, does it affect how you guys prioritize the pipeline or maybe investments you could make today commercially? And the second question on danu, Mikael, I know a lot's been asked on the upcoming data, but from a commercial perspective, where do you see the bigger opportunities for differentiation and metabolic? Is it really just oral administration and obesity, or do you guys look more aggressively at related indications like cardio, renal, etc.? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nChris, you want to take the question about the season and the pipeline?\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Oncology Research and Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Obviously, we remain very confident that we will close Seagen towards the end of this year, beginning next year. As you pointed out, there's a significant interest now in ADCs because of the potential that they could replace most of the chemotherapeutics in the future for most cancer types. Seagen obviously has a significant track record with four of the current approved ADCs from their laboratories. And as you've seen, three potential registration phase trials just read out with PAXLOVID to Kaiser and sorry, with PAXLOVID and with Ceftx, but also with a small molecule to Kaiser. They recently started two phase III studies, one with decitumab, vedotin, in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced metastatic HER2-positive or HER2-low bladder cancer. This is a program that we're very excited about. Already, decitumab received previously brachytherapy dissertation in the US.\nAnd they also just about started another phase III program in non-small cell lung cancer with their B6A intervene beta-6 antibodies. So we remain very confident in their portfolio and the depth of expertise they're bringing to the development and discovery of ADCs.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. And then, Mikael?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I think you asked about how could new oral glit in the obesity be positioned for maximal attractiveness and using Danres one example, pending, of course, our excitement to see the data. Well, clearly, as obesity and type 2 diabetes with overweight are moving from being treated from endocrinologists and metabolic physicians increasingly now to primary care, particularly with the impressive effects of these drug labs on obesity and body weight, oral agents in general are preferred. So I think a once-a-day drug such as the new reformulated potential danagliprum would have an interesting role there. I think there is also a growing discussion among opinion leaders in the field that patients regain weight when they stop the injectable, and in general, they are only available for maybe a year.\nSo an oral agent that could be taken for a longer period could also play a really interesting role to maintain body weight at a low level. And finally, you're absolutely right. The new data for this drug class suggests that patients could benefit from both cardiac and renal protection. And oral agents allow you to build combination with drugs that already are used in this population, such as SGLT2 to protect the heart, etc. So I think that's why there is such a big interest in drugs in this class. So thank you for the question.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Tim Anderson with Wolf Research.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. I have a couple of questions on danaglipron. The early dataset showed a QTc signal. Do you think that was a red herring that won't show up in later data? To me, when I just think about drug classes and seeing QTc signals, it seems like it often persists in later datasets. And then second question on mRNA flu, you mentioned that safety is the same as licensed vaccines. Does that mean tolerability was as well? I usually think of safety and tolerability as technically being different from each other. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nVery good. Thank you very much for the questions. Mikael, both questions for you. QTc for danu and then tolerability on RTC.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I mean, we have, I think, more than 1,400 patients on danaglipron, and it's a very safe drug. It's a very safe drug. And we look forward to the readouts and efficacy, as we have said before year-end. So that's very straightforward. mRNA flu, you had a very good comment. Particularly in initial studies, tolerability is really what we focus on. And tolerability was similar to standard of care available vaccines or the other mRNA vaccines experienced from Pfizer. And we haven't really had any concerns about safety. So on both tolerability and safety, the statement stands that it looks like previous versions of our vaccines.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. And let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director of Biotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Two questions, if I may. On the cost savings program, you've been outlining what the plan is for 2024. But if we look at the pattern of the spending for R&D and SI&A in the quarter you just reported, I would observe that the magnitude of reduction in the R&D spend was greater than expected relative to SI&A. How should we be interpreting this number? Is there anything to read across in terms of the relative amount of cost reductions coming from SI&A versus R&D on the forward? And then a question on ABRYSVO. First quarter sales were solid. Can you just elaborate how much may have been attributable to, for instance, inventory stocking versus actual demand? And if we look at prescription data, it looks like from the retail setting, there's about a 30% market share. Is this similar to what you're observing in the broader market?\nHow is this comparing with your expectations? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nLet me ask David to answer the question about the R&D and SI&A expenses. And then Angela will take the prior brief.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO and EVP, Pfizer",
    "content2": "Yeah. Hey, Chris. On the cost program, I would not read into the allocation of savings in 2023 as it relates to 2024. Obviously, we have a fairly robust program up and running today. We're working aggressively on those programs and beginning to implement those programs. As we cycle into 2024, we'll give you and the markets specific color on how to think about those cost savings as we wrap into next year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThanks. Angela?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Pharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nSure. So we're really pleased with our performance on ABRYSVO. It has exceeded our expectations. You first asked whether this is all about stocking, and I can say that it isn't. Of course, there were stocking effects in the beginning because this was a new vaccine. But we're also closely tracking vaccination rates and uptake. And what you see is that there is very fast uptake. We were that really benefit from the fact that this was approved and in market prior to the vaccination season actually happening. So it was able to ride off of the coattails of flu vaccinations, which you know are very high, right, September, October. We have about a 70% co-administration rate. So the performance we're seeing on ABRYSVO is truly driven by vaccinations. To your comment about market share, yes, we are seeing a similar market share to what you have just said.\nThat is because right now, the retail setting is driving a lot of the vaccinations. But don't forget that that's not where all vaccinations are taking place. We also have non-retail settings such as health systems, doctors' offices. Those are also being engaged. And in those particular settings, Pfizer actually has a leading preference. They are smaller in proportion, but still. So I think we have to look at all channels of the market. Finally, I think that just from a momentum perspective, we expect things to continue. The vaccinations really are happening throughout this time now. October, November, December are big vaccination months. From where we are right now, RSV is only 5% of the entire vaccination rate of the eligible population. So I think that the conclusion is we're very early in the innings of this launch. We're doing better than we thought.\nBut that where we are going to be, I think, is a place where there's tremendous opportunity for driving uptake in all the results, but also maternal, which, as you know, we just got the approval for.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Carter Gould with Barclays.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe to go back to Oral danu, when we do get the phase II data, what should our expectation be around communicating plans for phase III, which I guess is just a quicker way of saying what's a reasonable expectation for how quickly you could turn around the phase II and start a phase III and how much work Pfizer has already done on that front? And then maybe just coming out of ESMO, on the back of the EV-302 data and the response, would Pfizer say that reaffirms their expectations or represents upside to their expectations when the deal was originally announced? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nNo, thank you very much. On the danu, let me take that so I can spare a little bit Mikael's time. We are expecting the data to show up before the end of the year. And of course, it's an important event. So we will have to make it publicly known when we know the data. And of course, when we are ready with our phase III, and we hope that the data are good so that we can move in a phase III. And I hope that we are going to do it in an expedited manner because speed is of essence in this battle between competing molecules. But we will announce our plans for phase III. I know the interest is very high right now, but I want to be very prudent in not saying things without the data.\nThe data are the king, and the data, we haven't seen it again. Now, let me move to Chris so that we can discuss about the estimate.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Oncology Research and Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nAnd yeah, thank you for raising EV-302. These are truly monumental data for the field of bladder cancer and urothelial cancer. As you pointed out, with overall survival and progression-free survival nearly doubled, moving median overall survival for this population now towards nearly towards three years. We expect the final data to be even longer than 31.5 months. So this just reaffirms our belief that antibody-drug conjugates could become a standard of care across the treatment paradigm for many, many different tumor types.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Akash Tewari with Jefferies.\n\n[Analyst] (Jefferies)\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. This is Ivy Allen for Akash. Thanks for taking our questions. Our question is also on danaglipron. So for the once-daily modified release version, is there any possibility to do a bridging study for QD formulation? And also for danu, I think as we've heard a lot of times on the call that the trial is marked as completed in October, I know you haven't seen the top-line data. So at this point, are we waiting for data from the slower four-week titration cohort? Also, would it be fair to say that you will have discontinued the program already if there were any clinically significant serious safety issues with danu? Thanks.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nMikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. On the once-a-day reformulated danu, we have initially tested a standard swellable core technology and could show that it worked very well with danu. And now to be able also to incorporate a more sophisticated technology, we work on a matrix technology. And all data suggests it's going to be a really intriguing alternative because, as you know, in diabetes, oral drugs, and obesity, you will over time end up with incorporating different drugs to prevent different downstream effects. And that's the beautiful of having this type of novel technology that you have a potential in the future to go to fix those combinations. And we are really masters in developing sophisticated formulations. And we will have this available in 2024.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAnd there was a second part, I think. Or not. There was a second part from danu?\nI think.\nI maybe I was totally here. Okay. Let's move then to the next question, please. Thank you, Akash, for your question.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nThank you. Two questions on vaccines for me, please. For anti-RSV, in August, GSK filed a lawsuit against Pfizer alleging patent infringement. So I wonder if you could just talk through the next steps here, perhaps a timeline that you anticipate for this. And should we think that this could ultimately result in some form of royalty payment from Pfizer to GSK? And then on PENBRAYA, how does the recent ACIP recommendation sit against your expectations for the sales ramp and peak potential for this vaccine? If the vaccine is effectively only used for dose two of three, does that significantly reduce the commercial opportunity you had anticipated for the vaccine? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Doug, can you please answer the question about this legal situation with GSK?\n\nDoug Lankler\n\nGeneral Counsel, Pfizer\n\nYes. So it's very, very early stages with respect to the RSV litigation. We have patents. We feel strongly about our own intellectual property. And it's certainly too early to say whether one party or the other will be required to pay any royalties or otherwise. Very early stages in that regard.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. And Angela in the real, and how do you feel about it?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Pharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nSure. We continue to feel confident about the peak sales. The reason is that right now, we have the first set of recommendations. But ACIP has also told us that we'll have the opportunity again to come back next year when we have additional data, which is when we'll have the opportunity to look at the schedule for how quads and Bs are being the schedule that they're being delivered today. And we'll have an opportunity again to take a look at the benefit of Pembria in this population. So I feel like it's great that we have an opportunity to get out now and to begin vaccinating our teenagers. We'll have a second bite at the apple, which will allow us to achieve our peak sales.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nGlobal Head of Healthcare Research, Citi\n\nThank you. Couple of questions. Would you comment on your stake in RVT-3101, the tier 1A, pending the approval of the licensing of the asset to Roche? Will you hang on to it, or is that subject to divestment? And then second, a question for Chris. Just looking at the recent EV-302 data and with you seem to have the Seagen portfolio, when you think about the combination of ADCs with pembro or with a PD-1, do you believe the efficacy that you're seeing is associated with bet hedging, or do you think it's true synergy through an immunologic mechanism of increased cell death? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAmir, you want to speak a little bit about the Roche acquisition of TL1?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nEVP and Chief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. So thanks for the question, Andrew. I think we're very pleased with the outcome of the TL1A program. When we created Televant, we did this as an R&D prioritization decision. Just as a reminder, this was a phase II program that required significant phase III investment. And so we held on to a 25% stake. We also had rights to royalties on US sales as well as the full ex-US and ex-Japan rights. And we did that all without any R&D spend. So Roche's proposed acquisition of Televant will give us access to about $1.75 billion of pre-tax cash, which is the translation of our stake. And we still retain all the other rights. So we're looking forward to having Roche as a partner.\nWe're looking forward to the investments that they're going to make in advancing the clinical stage programs on TL1A and benefiting from the outcome of those.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAnd then Chris about the synergies or not.\n\nChris Boshoff\n\nChief Oncology Research and Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks, Andrew. That's a very good question. As you know, Seagen pioneered the MMAE or [orostatten]-based payloads. And we see the potential synergy in combination with the PD-1 with ADCETRIS, with TIVDAK, and recently, as you've seen, with PADCEV. Although Seagen does have the next generation of ADCs with TOPA1 that will enter the clinic this year and next year, we don't know yet if the [TOPA1s] are going to show the similar type of immunogenicity as what appears to happen with the MMAE or [orostatten]-based payloads. So I think we're very confident that Seagen has both TOPA1 as well as [orostatten]-based payloads. In case with TOPA1s, we do not see what appears to be the correct type of synergy.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Chris. And let's go to the last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman (BMO Capita\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research, and Senior Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. So I have one on danu and then a bigger picture one. So point of clarification on danuglipron, Mikkel, is the ultimate goal to develop the fixed dose combination with, say, an SGLT2 or other anti-diabetes drugs? You kind of had mentioned that in your commentary. And taking a big step back, how should we think about how you risk-adjusted your long-term revenue guidance? And do you plan on updating this figure as you have clinical or regulatory successes or failures, for example, with the approval of AstraZeneca? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nMikael, can you please take the danu question?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Research and Development, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I mean, the near-term goal is really to look at the data we've said, both Albert and myself. And pending review, of course, there's an option with a once-a-day danu to move forward in obesity and diabetes. I think we just commented that the upside with oral drugs are many in this sector, and that's why it has been such a big interest. And that includes fixed dose combination, which aren't available with injectable. But we will keep it simple and clear. We'll review the data and take a decision about potential in obesity and diabetes once-a-day danu. That's the near term.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. And also about your question, if we are going to change the 20 billions or the 25 billions that we have declared. First of all, the 25 billions is billions that we are going to acquire by the end of 2030. According to our estimates, we have acquired, pending Seagen acquisition, 20 billions of that. If you see the analyst expectations for these acquisitions at the end of 2030, they are very, very close to what we have right now. And I think this is trending very nicely. And when you see the internal pipeline launches that we are having from our internal pipeline, which we declared at 20 billions, there is a gap between what we believe and what the analysts believe. And this is where we are focusing our attention. Right now, it is very early with the launches.\nSome of them are doing better than what we thought. Some of them are doing worse than what we thought. And if we realize that the totality of 20 billions is not anymore what we think will be, of course, we will update.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nBut I think what is important to that is we look at our business. Our core business is performing nicely. We continue to make traction. We have, obviously, a lot of launches that we've completed and still several ahead of us. We're excited about what Seagen could potentially bring to the companies we think about our focus now in oncology. And then, importantly, I think we've rebaselined, if you will, the COVID franchise. As we think about utilization in the back half of this year and cycling to next year, we will then take a step back and look at what would be prudent as we think about the revenue in totality of this company as we cycle into 2024 and beyond. So I think look forward to, as we begin going into 2024, those expectations and laying those out specifically.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. So I would like just to say that if you walk away from today's call with just one takeaway, it should be that I think Pfizer's future remains bright. We have rebased our COVID expectations, and now I think it's very easy for everyone to be able to model what I think will be stable COVID revenues going forward. And with the recent, particularly with the recent amended PAXLOVID supply agreement. And of course, we are having very strong performance of our inline and new products portfolio, excluding COVID. It's 10% growth this quarter. And that positions us to be able to have growing going forward. So I will now bring this call to an end. Thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's Pfizer Third Quarter 2023 earnings conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChristopher J. Stevo\n\nHead of IR, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chelsea. Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's second quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; Dr. Mikael Dolsten, Chief Scientific Officer and President, Pfizer Research and Development. Joining for the Q&A session, we also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President, Global Biopharmaceutical business; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer; Dr. Chris Boshoff, our Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer; and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.\nBefore we begin the call, I want to remind you of some logistical items. The materials for this call and other earnings-related materials on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com, and of course, my favorite, our forward-looking statements. Please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 3 and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on our earnings release and in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results were solid and in line with our expectations. Non-COVID-19 revenues grew 5% operationally compared to the year ago quarter. Total revenue declined 53% operationally, primarily due to the anticipated revenue declines in both PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. Even with these declines, our COVID-19 portfolio remains a significant contributor to the business with more than $1.6 billion in combined revenue during this quarter.\nOf course, our patient impact data are equally important because patients are the reason we exist. Through the first 6 months of the year, more than 356 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines. We continue to make progress towards our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. In fact, Pfizer is more than halfway of its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in 18 months' time. In addition to the 6 approvals and 5 launches that occurred prior to 2023, we have 6 approvals and 4 launches in the first 6 months of 2023. For the second half of 2023, we expect 6 additional approvals and 6 additional launches, including the 2 launches that occurred in July.\nThen in 2024, we expect 1 approval and 4 launches which is approved and recommended, which would raise the total to 19 new launches in approximately 18 months. As you can see in this chart, for this year's launches, we expect the revenue contribution to occur largely in the second half of 2023 because the first half launches occurred late in the second quarter. And then in 2024, with the additional impact of next year's expected launches, we anticipate an even greater total contribution for our 19 launches. It is important to note that 18 of the 19 potential launches have been largely derisked from a technical perspective at this point, with the only 1 remaining being our RNA flu\nEqually encouraging is that our pipeline is expected to contribute -- continue generating breakthrough treatments and vaccines long after the 19 which have been discussed. We recently reported milestones from several exciting pipeline candidates with the potential to be significant future value drivers. These include: Phase III data from marstacimab, a novel antibody being studied for the treatment of hemophilia A and B; regulatory filing acceptance of our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate; the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of Phase II results for our vaccine candidate for maternal immunization against Group B; and first-in-human data from our pipeline of potential next-generation breast cancer treatments, including our novel CDK4, CDK2 and KAT6 inhibitors.\nNow I would like to provide some commentary on our COVID-19 portfolio. As you all know, during the pandemic, Pfizer demonstrated impressively the power of our research and manufacturing capabilities by bringing to the world the first and most widely used vaccine and oral treatment for COVID-19. These scientific breakthroughs have played a significant role in bringing the global health crisis under control, and we are very proud of our contribution. The profits that these products have generated today have enabled us to invest in acquiring Arena, ReViral, Biohaven, and Globe Blood Therapeutics, which together, we expect to contribute approximately $10 billion of revenues in year 2030.\nIn fact, the acquisitions of Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics are already contributing to our operational growth while the acquisition of Arena is expected to start generating revenues towards the end of this year. We also remain very excited about our planned acquisition of Seagen, which if approved, is expected to contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 revenues. As a result of the positive momentum of our non-COVID-19 revenues and more importantly, the success of our COVID-19 portfolio, Pfizer's overall revenues have increased exponentially compared with our 2019 revenues, pro forma for the divestitures of Amgen and our Consumer business. This allowed us to increase investments in R&D and SI&A to support this new revenue base and our expected new product launches.\nThe increased investments we are making in R&D and SI&A this year were sized based on certain revenue assumptions we made in January for both our COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 products. These assumptions also were incorporated in our 2023 financial guidance. Clear, there is a higher level of uncertainty regarding the demand projections for our COVID-19 products than for the rest of our business. For example, in January, we served our expectation that approximately 100 million doses of COVID-19 would be administered in the U.S. this year, of which we estimated Pfizer to capture 60% market share. In the first 6 months of 2023, 12.4 million doses were administered in the U.S. While the 12.4 million doses are behind our earlier projections, our market share for COVID-19 is ahead of our previous expectations at 65%.\nHowever, the vast majority of respiratory vaccinations happened during the fall and winter respiratory disease season, which starts in September. And we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to follow this pattern going forward. The uncertainty of the exact timing of COMIRNATY commercialization was largely removed with the decision by the FDA and CDC to request a change in the composition of the vaccine to address the Omicron XBB.1.5 strains. We believe this will allow us to commercialize the vaccine in September, assuming the updated vaccines are approved and available by the end of August, of course.\nIn the European Union, the uncertainty regarding the vaccines revenue contributions for '23 and beyond was removed when we renegotiated successfully our long-term agreement. This agreement spread the agreed volumes over 4 years. And while it puts pressure on this year's volumes, we believe it also provides longer-term revenue certainty in this important market. Similar to what we are experiencing with the vaccine, the second half of the year will play a bigger role in informing our expectations for the long-term demand of PAXLOVID, the utilization of which follows very closely the COVID-19 infection rates.\nWe expect a new COVID-19 wave to start in the U.S. this fall, and this expectation is supported by the increase in infection rates we are already seeing. Obviously, the severity of disease and people desire for treatment also will be factors, as will the ongoing dialogue with the U.S. government regarding when we will transition to a commercial model for PAXLOVID. These are the uncertainties. We are acutely aware that all these uncertainties are making it difficult to project the future revenues of Pfizer in this area Pfizer and also affecting our surprise as a result.\nThe good news is we will have much more clarity and certainty regarding how our COVID-19 products will perform in the commercial market by the time we report our third quarter financial results. And we expect the uncertainties to be largely eliminated by the end of the year. This is because we expect the vaccination and treatment rates from the upcoming respiratory disease season to be a reliable predictor of trends in subsequent years, with some potential upside, of course, if a combination of COVID-19 vaccine is brought to market in the future.\nAdditionally, by that point, the timing of transitioning to full commercialization of both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID should become clear. Despite this uncertainty, we'll continue to invest in our COVID-19 portfolio this year, in advance of the upcoming respiratory disease season. This is very important. But given the uncertainty, we are also preparing to have the ability to adjust our 2024 total cost base to align with various future COVID-19 disease -- revenue scenarios. In fact, we've already identified specific areas where we can make adjustments primarily within our COVID-19 cost base if demand comes lower than expected. Dave will provide more details during his remarks.\nNext, I wanted to share a few quick updates of our planned acquisition of Seagen, which we believe will be a major driver of our future success. Seagen's shareholders recently overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition, and we have already raised most of the external financing needed to fund the transaction. We also continue to work closely with regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. In the meantime, our integration planning continues, which will allow us to hit the ground running following an anticipated close later in 2023 or early in 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nLast week, we announced that Chris Boshoff has joined Pfizer's executive leadership team as Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President, reporting directly to me. In this role, Chris will lead a new end-to-end oncology R&D organization and be the single point of accountability for the entire oncology pipeline from discovery to early and late Phase II [indiscernible] This is similar to the structure we currently have in place for our vaccines R&D organization, which has proven to be very productive.\nPfizer and Seagen serve a common vision to deliver life-saving treatments for people living with cancer, which is why I'm so pleased that after closing, Chris oncology leadership team will include talented, purpose-driven and highly productive leaders from both companies. And we made already announcements about the people that are joining Chris' leadership team. We believe this new structure will help further accelerate the delivery of cancer therapies, which is critical because in the battle against cancer, time is life.\nAs Pfizer's one of core business principles is the belief that trust is everything. I'm proud to say that in recent months, we have received some wonderful accolades that speak to the trust we are building with external stakeholders. We were named 1 of the [ 2023/'24 ] Best Companies to Work For by U.S. News & World Report. We were listed in Newsweek's List of America's Greatest Workplaces 2023. For the third year in a row, Pfizer has earned a top 100 score in the 2023 Disability Equality Index. And our own Rady Johnson received the Disability in '23 Executive Sponsor of the Year Award at the National Conference in July. And lastly, our site in Italy is being recognized by the United Nations for the Welcome Award working for refugee integration. These recognitions are very important because they strengthen the unprecedented brand equity that Pfizer built during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBefore now I hand it over to Dave, I want to quickly comment on the situation at our facility in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First, all of us at Pfizer were relieved that no colleagues were seriously injured when the tornado struck. That said, our facility sustained substantial damage and did the neighborhoods where many of our colleagues live, unfortunately. The local leadership team has done an incredible job responding to this devastating event. And we are proceeding with both urgency and caution to determine the best way to get the site back online as quickly as possible so as to minimize any impact on patients. Of course, we are also taking steps to ensure the continued safety of our colleagues and contractors, which remains our top priority.\nAnd with that, I will now turn it over to Dave, and after Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Dave?\n\nDavid M. Denton\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CVS Health Corp.\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 24 months, Pfizer has made important investments to position it squarely on track to achieve profitable and sustainable growth, particularly in the back half of this decade. We have strategically invested to expand our commercial portfolio and our late-stage pipeline, strengthened our market launch capabilities and enhanced innovation through internal R&D and business development actions. These delivered efforts continue to solidify Pfizer's ability to overcome upcoming LOEs and drive sustainable revenue growth, all while enhancing long-term shareholder value.\nTo further support our long-term growth objectives, we are executing the capital allocation strategy designed to effectively deploy our cash. Our strategy is focused on 3 main pillars: first is reinvesting in our business; second is growing our dividends over time; and finally, making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first half of 2023 alone, we've invested $5.2 billion in internal R&D, returned $4.6 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed acquisition of Seagen. During the second quarter, Pfizer successfully completed a $31 billion unsecured debt offering across 8 tranches. The net proceeds of this debt offering will be used to substantially fund the Seagen acquisition. The new debt carried a weighted average yield of 4.93% and a weighted average maturity of 16.3 years, consistent with our expectations.\nOn a full year run rate basis, the annual financing cost associated with the acquisition is expected to be nearly $2 billion. With the completion now of this debt offering, the company is positioned to close the Seagen acquisition immediately upon post-regulatory approvals. While we plan to continue investing in our business, we expect to delever our capital structure following the closing of the Seagen transaction. As we delever, it is our expectation to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases.\nNow with that, let me briefly cover a few highlights of our quarterly financial performance. As Albert said, our Q2 results were solid and in line with our expectations from both the top and a bottom line perspective, albeit slightly better than EPS consensus. As expected in our guidance, our overall Q2 revenue declined 53% operationally. The contraction in revenue is driven by the anticipated decline in both PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY sales. We expect these products to transition to the commercial market in the second half of this year. Our operational revenue growth, excluding our COVID products was in line with expectations at 5% versus Q2 of LY, with strong contributions from the inclusion of both NURTEC and Oxbryta as well as the continued growth from the VYNDAQEL family.\nDuring Q2, adjusted SI&A expenses were $3.4 billion and grew 20% operationally versus LY. We continue to invest in support of our upcoming launches and grow our recently acquired products. While it's clear that these near-term investments are dampening our current profitability levels, we are laser-focused on maximizing the longer-term performance of these products.\nNow moving to the bottom line. The reported diluted earnings per share this quarter declined by 77% to $0.41, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67 declined 65% on an operational basis. Earnings compressed at a greater rate than revenues, primarily due to the steep and anticipated contraction in PAXLOVID sales during the quarter. Once again, foreign exchange movements continue to unfavorably impact our results, reducing second quarter revenues by approximately $280 million or 1% and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 or 2% compared to last year.\nNow that we are at the halfway point of our 2023 financial plan, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on how we are executing across our business while navigating within an incredibly unique and dynamic environment. As a management team, we remain committed to transparency, ensuring our assessment of the evolving marketplace, given the magnitude of launches, the ongoing shifting nature of the COVID landscape and the continued integration of acquired assets.\nLet me begin by elaborating on our full year '23 financial guidance. We are narrowing our expectations for revenues to between $67 billion and $70 billion and maintaining guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.45 for the full year. For our more durable and predictable non-COVID revenues, we are updating our guidance range to 6% to 8% operational revenue growth. From a launch timing standpoint, I'll point out that the majority of our 2023 launches are anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023, and our commercialization schedule remains materially unchanged. As a company, we always strive to achieve the highest revenue level possible while maintaining a realistic view of the key input that inform our outlook.\nRegarding RSV for older adults, the shared decision-making recommendation by ASIP is likely to slow its near-term uptake in the U.S. In addition, the recent approval of TALZENNA in the U.S. results in a more narrow patient population than originally planned. These factors, coupled with the impact of the damaged Rocky Mount manufacturing facility presents near-term revenue challenges. However, we expect positive revenue momentum as we exit 2023 and head into 2024. And importantly, the long-term outlook for our non-COVID business remains intact relative to our 2030 ambitions.\nTurning now to our less predictable and more variable COVID portfolio. Year-to-date, we have booked slightly over 40% of the $21.5 billion full year revenue forecast for both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID with the important fall vaccination and respiratory infection season ahead of us. We are acutely aware that COVID demand depends on many evolving market variables, making a range of potential revenue outcomes increasingly large and difficult to predict with certainty. These variables include the overall level of vaccination and infection rates, the speed of drawdown in government inventory levels and the mutating nature of the virus itself, just to name a few.\nIn the interest of public health and with the important fall season ahead of us, we are maintaining our COVID revenue outlook for the year while continuing to invest largely on a variable expense basis to support our COVID products in 2023. These variable investments are important to support our efforts to reach as many patients as possible, helping to ensure that the most at-risk individuals are both vaccinated and treated while maintaining our leading market share. We are proud of what we have achieved through the COVID portfolio, and this has allowed the company to invest in support of its growth agenda for the back half of this decade. Our visibility into future COVID revenues and demand should improve throughout the remainder of 2023 as we gain clarity on a more typical annual run rate.\nWe are well aware that our 2023 profit outlook is currently being dampened by incremental cost in support of our launches as well as higher R&D investments aligned with the company's current revenue base. We remain committed to both defending and growing our overall level of profitability. As Albert mentioned earlier, we expect this fall's performance of our COVID-19 products to help us more effectively forecast future sales performance.\nTo that end, if our COVID-19 revenues are less than what we have assumed, we are prepared to launch an enterprise-wide cost improvement program aligned with the longer-term revenue projections for our business. This program will be designed to support our objective of growing our operating profit margin and we'd expect to begin to yield results in 2024. And we look forward to sharing the specific details of this program in our upcoming earnings call.\nIn closing, this is an extraordinary time for Pfizer. Our confidence and our commitment to our strategy and to achieving our 2030 goals is unwavering. We will continue to focus our efforts to drive growth while enhancing long-term shareholder value. And with that, let me now turn it over to Mikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Worldwide Research, Development & Medical\n\nThank you, Dave. Today, I will provide updates on a few different therapeutic focus areas, starting with breast cancer. We are working to deliver the next wave of innovative therapies for SGN receptor positive breast cancer. The pillars of this strategy are threefold: establishing our investigational CDK4 inhibitor as a next-generation cell cycle therapy establishing vepdegestrant as the next-generation endocrine therapy backbone; and establishing novel mechanisms like our investigational CDK2 inhibitor and KAT6 inhibitor candidate as next-gen combination partners to enhance efficacy.\nOur clinical strategy entails first, developing assets for the metastatic setting in which IBRANCE is currently the leader and unmet need followed by an opportunity to expand to earlier-stage breast cancer, including the CDK4/6-naive population and adjuvant or near-adjuvant settings. Data presented at ASCO from 3 key investigational medicines from our next-gen portfolio demonstrated antitumor activity heavily pretreated populations for patients with breast cancer.\nAs a reminder, the majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancer expressed low CDK6 while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia, which requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibitors. Across the CDK4/6 inhibitor approximately 30% to 60% of patients experienced severe neutropenia. On the left, in our Phase I dose escalation study in patients with receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer, all of whom have previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, treatment with our CDK4 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy resulted in a confirmed objective response rate of 29%, clinical benefit response rate of 52% and median progression-free survival of nearly 25 weeks. The combination was well tolerated, which may enable maximum CDK4 inhibition. We are actively planning the Phase III randomized study.\nIn addition, I'd like to highlight encouraging data from the Phase I dose escalation study of our novel CDK2 inhibitor, which showed activities, including confirmed partial responses in breast cancer patients who have previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Also, durable clinical responses were observed in a Phase I trial of our novel KAT6 inhibitor as a monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy in heavily pretreated patients with breast cancer.\nTurning now to blood cancer. ELREXFIO, also known as ilbenatamol, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be the anchor of an anticipated multibillion-dollar franchise. An FDA decision for the potential first indication in the [indiscernible] relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma population is expected this year, and we continue to advance the programs to expand into earlier lines of treatment. In addition, development of maplirpacept, also known as TTI-622, is underway, including in combination with ELREXFIO to support potential mutations in myeloma and acute myeloleukemia.\nHere, we show ELREXFIO data presented at EHA from the MagnetisMM trial in patients with [indiscernible] refractory multiple myeloma who had no prior exposure to direct therapy. On the left, we observed highly meaningful survivor with ELREXFIO monotherapy with a [indiscernible] of survival of 57 patients. In patients who achieved a complete response, 15-month survival was remarkably 93%, underscoring the potential for deep and durable responses.\nWe can see evidence of broad activity in on the right with the graph showing single agent complete response rate of 35%, which rises to 46% in the subset of patients with 2 to 3 therapy. Our ongoing randomized trials are in less pretreated to newly diagnosed population. To get to approval, ELREXFIO may have key differentiator 50% low hospitalization time during the step-up dosing period protocol and an extended dosing that moves from once-weekly to every other week dosing beyond week 24.\nTurning now to the AMD, the pivotal trial of marstacimab met its primary endpoint with statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on annualized bleeding rate or ABR. It was a 35% reduction in ABR compared to [indiscernible] factor replacement and 92% reduction in ABR versus on-demand factor replacement. Marstacimab offers a differentiated mechanism of action and dosing regimen compared to standard of care therapy. If approved, it has the potential to be the first once-weekly subcu hemophilia B treatment for patients without inhibitors and the first hemophilia A or B treatment administered in a patient-friendly pen as a flat dose. Regulatory submission is expected in the second half of '23.\nNext, LITFULO, also known as ritlecitinib, is the first medicine to receive FDA approval to treat severe alopecia areata in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older. It also recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency, CHMP recommending body, but it's not just. It has the potential to redefine the standard of care for alopecia areata. LITFULO is the first-of-its-kind kinase inhibitor with a unique mechanism that inhibits both the [indiscernible] family and [indiscernible] that have been implicated in the alopecia areata pathophysiology.\nIn addition, we're exploring how its unique mechanism of action could potentially be applied across immune disorders, including vitiligo in which a Phase III study is ongoing and other potential indications. Finally, we're making excellent progress on the milestones we have set out through the first half of '24. As Albert noted, we recently received FDA approval for PREVNAR 20 in the pediatric population. We have robust strategies in place to potentially improve the protection provided by current pneumococcal vaccines. I look forward to sharing more about this in the coming quarters.\nIn addition, we recently published Phase II data in New England Journal Medicine, showing our group [indiscernible] maternal vaccine candidate was generally well tolerated and generated robust antibody levels. The Journal also published a natural history study, which was used to determine protective antibody levels as well. These 2 studies indicated that the vaccine candidate may offer meaningful protection to infant [indiscernible] mothers. We were highly encouraged that [indiscernible] an infectious disease expert from the [indiscernible] editorial, highlighting the important future prospects of our [indiscernible] GBS vaccine\nThe progress of the GBS vaccine candidate does play nicely with a positive result and anticipated upcoming regulatory decision for our RG vaccine [indiscernible] for administration in pregnant women. ABRYSVO recently received a positive opinion from European Medicines Agency CHMP for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect the infant. ABRYSVO is approved for adults in the U.S. and under regulatory review for the maternal indication.\nIn addition, we remain excited to see the Phase II data from danuglipron by end of '23, which we expect will enable us to finalize our [indiscernible] plan. Finally, on [indiscernible] Phase III trial start of our anti-interferon data candidate for the treatment of inflammatory neuropathy, which has received Fast Track designation from FDA. Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\n\nChristopher J. Stevo\n\nHead of IR, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mikael. Chelsea, if you could please queue up the callers. We have at least 30 minutes for our Q&A session now.",

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 was a solid foundational quarter in what we expect to be an exciting year for Pfizer and patients. Our financial results were as we anticipated. Our non-core revenues grew 5% operationally compared with the year ago quarter. while overall revenues declined 26% operationally, primarily due to a previously communicated and expected decline in commodity revenue. Even with Comirnaty's decline, our COVID franchises remain significant contributors to the business with a combined $7.1 billion in revenues during the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by recently acquired products Nurtec for migraine and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease, our anti-infective Sulperazon. Eliquis in the non-valvular atrial fibrillation indication in the U.S. and our Vyndaqel family of products for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. We also continue to be proud of our patient impact. During the first quarter, more than 250 million patients were treated with our medicines and vaccines.\nWith this solid start to the year, we remain on track to grow our non-COVID revenues by 7% to 9% operationally in 2023. That's because the majority of our potential near-term product launches, as you can see mapped out on this slide. are expected to occur in the second half of the year following regulatory approvals were not yet secured. As such, we expect our non-COVID revenues to grow at a faster rate in the second half of the year than in the first. Overall, we are in the midst of an 18-month period in which we expect to launch up to 19 potential to products and indicates. Over the first 4 months of the year, we have made excellent progress towards this goal with the approval of Zavzpret, an expanded indication for Cibinqo to include adolescents and last week's approval of Prevnar 20 for pediatric use, all in the U.S.\nWe also have secured regulatory filing acceptances for elranatamab, for Braftovi and Mektovi for non-small cell lung cancer and for our RSV maternal vaccine candidate which if approved, would be the first vaccine for administration to pregnant individuals to help protect against the complications of RSV disease in infants from birth through 6 months.\nIn addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted priority and the European Medicines Agency has accepted our MAA filing for a view of Talzenna for use in combination with Xtandi for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic resistant prostate cancer based on the TALAPRO2 results.\nRegarding our COVID-19 franchise, we continue to expect June 2023 to be in a transitional year as the virus continues to mutate and to remove from advanced purchases under government contracts to more transitional supply arrangements in the commercial model for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. As previously discussed, in 2023 and 2024, we we expect vaccine utilization to decline compared with 2022. Then starting in 2025 and continuing in 2026 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates assuming the successful development and approval of various COVID combination vaccines. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar with some variations from country to country.\nRegarding Paxlovid, we continue to expect the government inventory that was built around the world last year to be absorbed by the end of this year. We then expect that in years '21 and beyond, the courses sold and courses used were more closely align. With its robust efficacy, consistent safety profile and potential to help mitigate the burden of COVID-19 on patients and their families, health system and society, Paxlovid is proving to be an important and durable complementary tool to vaccination strategies for the estimated 40% of the global adult population at high risk for progressing to severe disease.\nNow let's take a look at Pfizer's mix potential moonshot, the battle against cancer. Oncology remains a core therapeutic area for Pfizer, and we believe the proposed acquisition of Seagen will enhance our position in this important space. Integration planning is already underway and we continue to expect the deal to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. By combining Seagen's category-leading antibody-drug conjugate technology with Pfizer's scale, expertise and capabilities, we believe we can accelerate potential breakthroughs in cancer medicines and introduce new solutions to patients around the world. The potential combined commercial infrastructure for Pfizer and Seagen will be 3x the size of that of Seagen alone in the U.S. and 4, 5x larger globally. As a result, we believe acquiring Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 risk-adjusted revenue with potential significant growth beyond 2030.\nEven with the Seagen deal, given the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, we continue to have the flexibility to take additional actions to create shareholder value. Dave will provide more details on this during this presentation.\nOne of the key areas of focus for Pfizer in 2023 is continuing to build trust, which is a key asset for every biopharmaceutical company. Since the beginning of the year, we have received 2 accolades that demonstrate we are doing just that. In February, Pfizer was named to the top 10 of Fortune's Most Admired Company List for the second year in a row. And in March, Ethisphere recognized Pfizer as one of the world's most ethical companies, also for the second year in a own.\nAt Pfizer trust is everything. It gives us our license to operate, allows us to attract the best talent and enables us to deliver breakthroughs that change patients' lives.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Dave. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on R&D pipeline. Dave?\n\nDavid M. Denton\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CVS Health Corp.\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin with Pfizer's capital allocation strategy before we dive into additional commentary about our quarterly performance and importantly, our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As you know, our strategy includes 3 main pillars: reinvesting in our business, growing and paying dividends and repurchasing our shares. In the first 3 months of 2023, we have invested $2.5 billion in internal R&D and returned $2.3 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend. And importantly, allocated approximately $43 billion for the proposed Seagen acquisition. Over the last few years, we have reinvested heavily into our business to drive long-term growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. We have invested in Pfizer's own science while acquiring the best external science to supplement our pipeline. Since 2022, we have invested approximately $70 billion, including Seagen and business development. In addition, we have continued to grow our dividend. For the past 14 years, we have raised our dividend annually. Since 2010, our quarterly cash dividend grew from $0.16 a share to $0.41 a share in 2023. Looking ahead, as we exit this unprecedented period of anticipated launches, we would expect to achieve operating margin improvement over time. As we began to delever our capital structure after the closing of the Seagen transaction, we expect to return to a more balanced capital allocation mix between our 3 pillars. While we will continue to invest in our business, we do expect more balance between that priority and returning value to our shareholders via increased dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy is squarely focused on driving shareholder value, while at the same time, remaining committed to a high investment-grade Tier 1 commercial paper rating. Now turning to the quarter. As Albert said, our results were in line with our expectations, albeit slightly better than consensus. As expected, overall revenues declined 26% operationally and primarily driven by the anticipated decline in commodity, which was partially offset by strong Paxlovid sales. I want to point out that our COVID-19 products produced $7.1 billion in revenues in the first quarter alone. Our non-COVID operational revenue growth was solid at 5% year-over-year. Primarily driving this growth was the inclusion of Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta and an increase in Sulperazon revenues in China. Revenues for Eliquis in the U.S. and the Vyndaqel family globally also contributed to this growth.\nNow I want to remind you of the seasonality of some of our products. In the first quarter, Nurtec ODT and Oxbryta typically have lower sales quarter-on-quarter due to annual co-pay reset dynamics with higher sales anticipated in the latter quarters. Most importantly, both products continue to experience strong growth in demand. Sulperazon revenues increased more than $100 million year-over-year due to higher demand in China during the quarter, which we do not expect to be sustained going forward. The demand was due to increased bacterial infection from patients being hospitalized for COVID. To help ensure the success of the expected launches of a large number of new and acquired products and indications we've increased our investments in SI&A. These investments are squarely focused on Pfizer's 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations.\nNow moving to the bottom line. Reported diluted earnings per share this quarter declined by 29% to $0.97 a share, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.23 and declined 20% on an operational basis during the quarter. Once again, this quarter, foreign exchange movements significantly impacted our results, reducing first quarter revenues by $730 million or 3% and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.07 or 4% compared to LY.\nNow turning to the full year financial outlook for the company. Our full year 2023 guidance remains unchanged. On a total company basis, we continue to expect revenues of $67 million to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint, with 5% operational growth in our non-COVID revenues this quarter, we are on track to achieve our non-COVID revenue guidance of 7% to 9% operational growth for the full year. Given that a large number of launches are expected to incur in the third and fourth quarter of '23, we anticipate our quarterly revenues will not be linear this year and that our non-COVID revenues will grow more quickly in the back half of this year versus the first half of '23.\nIn terms of our COVID products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we expect sales to trend more seasonally this year. Given these dynamics, we expect significantly lower sales contributions from our COVID products in the second quarter versus the first quarter. In fact, given the anticipated timing of approvals for a fall vaccine with strain change, we would expect more substantial vaccine deliveries to start in September, which is late in the U.S. third quarter and the beginning of our international fourth quarter. With respect to Paxlovid, we continue to expect '23 to be a transitional year as we anticipate shifting to a commercial market in the second half of this year. We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. On a full year basis, we expect that foreign exchange will have an unfavorable impact compared with full year 2022 of approximately $0.13 on adjusted diluted earnings per share. We are also reaffirming the remaining components of our full year 2023 guidance which you can find in the appendix of the Q1 '23 earnings presentation.\nSo in closing, this is an exciting period for Pfizer as we continue to invest to drive long-term growth and, importantly, enhance long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, now let me turn it over to Mikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Worldwide Research, Development & Medical\n\nThank you, Dave. Today, I'd like to start off with 1 of the 4 pillars of our oncology portfolio, which are breast, urogenital, blood cancers and precision medicine. Within urogenital, prostate cancer scenario in which we have strong momentum. Recent positive study results further strengthen our franchise, building upon the global standard of care set by XTANDI and underscoring our long-standing commitment to the pursuit of breakthroughs that define new standards of care in prostate cancer. I'll highlight data from two Phase III studies, EMBARK and TALAPRO-2 as well as early, but promising signals from our EZH2 inhibitor, each of which has the potential to reach broader patient population across the treatment continuum in prostate cancer. Final analysis from TALAPRO-2, evaluating our potential blockbuster PARP inhibitor TALZENNA, in combination with XTANDI were presented at ASCO GU. Results showed significant and clinically meaningful improvement across the all-comers population in radiographic progression-free survival or rPFS in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutation, there was a 37% reduction in risk of disease progression. Median rPFS in patients treated with TALZENNA and XTANDI was not reached at the time of analysis versus 21.9 months for placebo plus XTANDI. A trend in overall survival favoring TALZENNA plus XTANDI was also observed, though these data our immature. The final OS data will be reported once the predefined number of survival events has been reached. Treatment with TALZENNA and XTANDI resulted in statistically significant improvement in overall response rates, which suggests a potential cooperative effect between the 2 treatments. The U.S. FDA has granted priority review for our sNDA for TALZENNA in combo with XTANDI for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with a decision expected in '23. The ongoing TALAPRO-3 study, if successful, may further expand the reach of this potential blockbuster into the HRR deficient metastatic castration-sensitive population. We recently presented data from our Phase III EMBARK study, evaluating XTANDI plus leuprolide in men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high risk biochemical recurrence at the American Urological Association 23 Annual Meeting. The study met its primary endpoint with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in metastasis-free survival with a 58% reduction in risk for radiographic progression or death. Key secondary endpoints were met, including time to PSA progression. These results suggest XTANDI, the only novel hormone therapy approved for 3 disease states of prostate cancer in the U.S., has the potentially approved to expand to patients in the hormone-sensitive or castration-sensitive setting for the first time.\nNext, I'd like to share early data from one of our next wave candidate potential first-in-class and best-in-class EZH2 inhibitor, which we shorthand as 1497. EZH2 is an epigenetic transcriptional repressor that frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer. We believe that inhibition of EZH2 may provide synergistic effects in combination with XTANDI with a potential to address unmet needs of patients with androgen sensitive and resistant disease. Here, our data from our ongoing Phase I/II study evaluating 1497 in second-line mCRPC patients with prior abiraterone and/or XTANDI and up to one line of chemo.\nOn the left are updated data from a Phase I dose escalation study shared at ESMO last year. These encouraging results show durable antitumor activity in both XTANDI-naive and experienced patients, with all XTANDI-naive patients having received prior abiraterone. Importantly, this suggests that the addition of our EZH2 inhibitor has the potential to sensitize XTANDI-resistant tumors, which is an increasing clinical unmet need. The early rPFS data also highly encouraging, reaching 8.7 months in XTANDI-experienced and 17.1 months in XTANDI-naive, both of which are notably longer than historical controls. For example, in the control arm of the CARD study, rPFS for extended alone was only 4.8 months in XTANDI-naive patients. And although cross-trial comparison cannot be made these results in combination with emerging objective response rate and PSA50 response are supportive of the contribution of our EZH2 inhibitor candidate in driving these responses. From a safety perspective, the combination was generally well tolerated with mostly Grade 1 and 2 events. The randomized Phase II study in second-line mCRPC is ongoing with data expected early '24.\nNow we turn to the potential of a near-term growth across our respiratory vaccine franchise. Prevnar 20 or our 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is now approved for children aged 6 weeks through 17 years. We are confident in our ability to maintain leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space with Prevnar 20, which offers the broadest serotype coverage of any pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine helping to protect against the 20 serotypes in the vaccine. We have strong momentum with our RSV vaccine candidate, having received a positive [Indiscernible] committee vote, supporting potential approval to help combat RSV in older adults and PDUFA dates for our old adults and maternal indications in quick succession in the coming months. And just last month, New England Journal Medicine published results from the 2 positive Phase III studies.\nEmerging data from the middle of the second RSV season in the Northern Hemisphere in the Phase III older adult study support meaningful durable vaccine efficacy. We will share the data once completed. In the coming months, we plan to start the Phase III study of the RSV vaccine candidate in 18- to 60-year-olds at high-risk for RSV and in immunocompromised adults 18 and over and a Phase I study in 2 to 18 year old at high risk.\nWith the potential to expand broadly the reach of our vaccine candidate, both to those age 18 to 60 with high-risk condition as well as to pediatrics and adolescents.\nOur RSV-flu coadministration study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority for all four flu strains and the RSV A and B strains. This suggest stores vaccine candidate, if approved, could be co-administered with flu vaccination and add an important component of seasonal protection against respiratory pathogens.\nFinally, the FDA recently updated the EUA for our Omicron BA.4/5 bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to enable those at high risk of severe COVID-19 illness, including the elderly and immunocompromised to partner with the health care providers to be proactive in helping them to protect themselves against COVID-19. We anticipate another update from FDA in June that will provide guidance on COVID-19 vaccine strains and vaccination timing for the 2023 fall and winter season. Beyond vaccines, antivirals are an important component of our strategy in respiratory viruses. Here, we share data for the first time from our second generation oral COVID-19 antiviral candidate, a potent and selective SARS-CoV-2 mPRO inhibitor that is currently in Phase I. We designed this candidate to achieve clinical exposure that would have similar antiviral activity to PAXLOVID, but without the need for ritonavir boosting and with the potential for reduced drug interactions.\nEarly results from Phase I dose escalation are encouraging with no dose-limiting safety and tolerability findings. Dosing achieved concentration manyfold over in vitro EC90 and is, therefore, expected to have similar antiviral activity to PAXLOVID. On the right of preliminary results from our Phase I pharmacokinetic study of midazolam drug interaction, which is a well-known standard for indicating CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interaction. This data show there is a lack of such drug-drug interaction, suggesting there may be no related restriction of co-dosing with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.\nBased on these encouraging data, we are planning to advance to Phase II dose-ranging study in the first half of this year.\nIn addition to the assets I spoke about today, we continue to make progress on the pipeline with more than 25 milestones recently achieved or anticipated through the first half of '24. As examples, in inflammation and immunology, the FDA has approved our sNDA for CIBINQO, enabling a label expansion for adolescents with moderate-to-severe dermatitis. In internal medicine, ZZAVZPRET, the migraine nasal spray has received FDA approval expanding our migraine portfolio. Recently, the FDA Advisory Committee voted in support of PAXLOVID's favorable benefit-risk profile with a soon PDUFA date in May.\nIn closing, we are very excited about the potentially transformative catalyst expressed across the entire pipeline as we work with continued urgency to bring breakthrough to patients. Thank you.\nLet me turn it over to Chris to start Q&A.\n\nChristopher J. Stevo\n\nHead of IR, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mikael. All right. Chelsea, please queue up us for Q&A.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During this morning's call, I will touch on some of our highlights from 2022 and share some thoughts regarding Pfizer's exciting near- and long-term growth plans. 2022 was an outstanding year for Pfizer on multiple fronts. We exceeded $100 billion in revenues for the first time in our 174-year history. We maintained our industry-leading clinical success rates and further improved our cycle times, which were already were among the industry's best. We were named to 10 different best employer lists, including those published by Forbes, LinkedIn, Glassdoor and others. And most important, more than 1.3 billion patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines, a truly humbling achievement.\nOur key growth drivers for the full year 2022 included global sales of PAXLOVID, strong growth of COMIRNATY in developed markets, the launch of Prevnar 20 for the adult population in the U.S., the continued strong growth of Eliquis globally, the strength of our VYNDAQEL family globally and the addition of newly acquired products, Nurtec ODT, VYDURA and Oxbryta. Looking ahead, we foresee strong operational growth of 7% to 9% in 2023, excluding revenues from our COVID-19 products and the impact of foreign exchange. We expect our potential new launches, newly acquired products and in-line products with all -- will all contribute to this growth.\nThese projections include our forecast for several important potential product launches, including our RSV vaccine for older adults, potential Prevnar 20 pediatric indication and products and candidates that came to us through recent business development activities, including etrasimod for ulcerative colitis, Nurtec and zavegepant for migraine and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease. We are in the midst of an 18-month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market. 15 of these 19 are from our internal pipeline, with the remaining 4 coming to Pfizer, as just explained, via the recent business development deals.\nRecognizing the importance of these potential launches as well as those expected in 2024 to both Pfizer and the patients who rely on our innovations, we are increasing the support we are putting behind them by investing an incremental $1.3 billion in SI&A expenses in 2023. Dave will provide more details on these investments during the presentation.\nOne example of a product that is already benefiting from this additional support is CIBINQO, which recently has seen an improving growth trajectory that we expect to continue through the course of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, CIBINQO's new-to-brand prescriptions grew 84% sequentially, the fastest growth rate in the class. We have started 2023 with 55% commercial formulary access, and we expect that access to continue to improve during the year, especially with the upcoming expected expansion of the U.S. indication to include adolescents 12 to 18 years old, if approved.\nWe also introduced a new direct-to-consumer campaign in November, which has increased patient awareness of CIBINQO and led to more patients asking their doctors about it. We look forward to the expected U.S. launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, if approved, as well as the expected launch of ABRILADA, our biosimilar to Humira to further expand our franchise in immunology this year.\nHowever, we recognize that investors are not only interested to hear this year's guidance, but also to understand the long-term growth prospects of the company. Particular questions are focused on our plans to offset the expected $17 billion impact of the LOEs between 2025 and 2030 and our long-term projections for our COVID-19 products. We will try to address both, starting with this slide regarding our business, excluding COVID.\nAs you can see in this chart, we expect the 15 of the 19 potential launches that are coming from our internal pipeline to generate 2030 revenues that will more than offset the expected LOE losses forecast for '25 to 2030. The potential $20 billion in this chart is a risk-adjusted number. I would also point out that some of the potential launches are expected to be bigger contributors to our growth than others. And if all 15 were to achieve their full potential, this figure could go even higher.\nIn addition, we believe we have the ability, if successful, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top line expectations through business development activity. As we have said previously, we believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 40% of the way there with approximately $10.5 billion in expected 2030 revenues. I am very pleased to see that the analysts' consensus expectations for the same revenues have already reached $9.5 billion, closing materially the gap that previously existed between internal and external expectations.\nFour of these products have already launched or are expected to launch, subject to regulatory approval in 2023. We also have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target. And of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline, with numerous launches expected in the '24 to 2030 time frame, if successful in clinical trials and approved. Some of the most promising assets include our oral GLP-1 candidate for diabetes and obesity. All of them are under this dotted box, XB. Potential combo vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and RSV; our potential vaccines for Lyme disease and shingles; multiple new oncology product candidates, including ARV-471 and our CDK4 inhibitor for endocrine receptor-positive breast cancer; our gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, hemophilia B and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our pan-hemophilia A and B antibody treatment; and many more.\nIf approved, we expect each of these to be key incremental contributors to our growth aspirations through '25 and beyond. Even without any of these additional potential products, we expect our '25 to 2030 revenue CAGR to be approximately 6%. And if some of them are successful, the CAGR could exceed 10%.\nNow let me turn my attention to our COVID-19 portfolio. At the JPMorgan conference earlier this month, I spoke about expecting 2023 to be a transition year, representing a low point in our COVID-related revenues. Let me provide a little bit more color on that. I will start with COMIRNATY in the U.S. as an example. In 2022, 31% of the population or 104 million Americans received an average 1.4 doses of COVID-19 vaccines for a total of 144 million doses. COMIRNATY's share was 64% or 92 million of these 144 million doses, as you can see in the first column.\nIn 2023, we expect about 24% of the population or 79 million people to receive vaccine doses for COVID during this year. This drop is due to expected fewer primary vaccinations and reduced compliance with recommendations. We expect they will receive about 1.3 doses per person on average in 2023. The drop is because fewer people are expected to receive their primary doses and, for the most part, only those who are older or at higher risk are expected to continue receiving more than 1 booster per year. This should result in about 102 million total vaccine doses administered in 2023. We believe Pfizer will maintain at least 64% markets share and therefore expect about 65 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be administered in 2023.\nIn 2024, we expect the utilization rates and market share figures to stabilize and come in roughly the same as in 2023. Then starting in '25 and continuing in '26 and beyond, we expect to see an increase in COVID-19 vaccination rates, assuming the successful development and approval of the COVID/flu combination product. A successful introduction of a COVID/flu combo could, over time, bring the percentage of Americans receiving the COVID-19 vaccine closer to the portion of people getting flu shots, which is currently about 50%. Outside the U.S., we expect these general trends to be similar, with some variations from country to country.\nSo what does this mean for our revenues? We expect 2023 to be a transition year in the U.S. In 2022, we sold at pandemic prices more doses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed sometime in 2023, probably the second half of the year. Around that time, we expect to start selling COMIRNATY through commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect that in years 2024 and beyond, the doses sold and doses used in a year will more closely align together and the commercial price to remain relatively stable with only inflation-like price increases.\nNow let me briefly run through PAXLOVID. In 2022, we estimate that 110 million COVID-19 symptomatic infections were reported in the world, excluding China. Approximately 12% of them were treated with approximately 14 million oral therapy courses. And PAXLOVID had the lion's share of them with approximately 90% market share. Average was 86%, but in the second half of the year exceeded the 90%. Keep in mind that this reflects a full year of reported infections, but only a partial year of PAXLOVID availability due to supply constraints in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn '23 and beyond, we expect infections to increase slightly at 2% annually due to waning immune protection of the population, resulting from reduced vaccination rates. Similarly, we expect treatment rates to increase as awareness, education and additional oral entries will grow the oral antiviral market. Finally, we expect PAXLOVID to maintain very high share despite additional competitive entries, given its strong benefit-risk profile and brand recognition.\nSo what does this mean for revenues? As with COMIRNATY, we expect 2023 to be a transition year for PAXLOVID as well. In 2022, we sold at pandemic prices more treatment courses than were eventually used. This resulted in a government inventory build that we expect to be absorbed sometime in 2023, probably second half. Around that time, we expect to start selling PAXLOVID through the commercial channels at commercial prices. We expect in years 2024 and beyond, that the courses sold and used will align closely together within every year.\nThere has been a great deal of speculation regarding the new but uncertain market opportunity for PAXLOVID in China, so let me share what we are seeing. We have an agreement with one company to import and distribute PAXLOVID in China, a local company, and we have a manufacturing agreement with another local Chinese company for local manufacturing. Pfizer shipped only tens of thousands of courses to China in fiscal year 2022. From December, which is the first month of our non-U.S. fiscal year through March, we expect to ship millions of courses to meet local demand.\nWe expect we will be able to sell effectively under government reimbursement through end of March. And despite China's recent decision not to include PAXLOVID on the country's National Drug Reimbursement List, we expect to offer the product on the private market after April 1 unless, of course, a listing opportunity opens up before then.\nLastly, I want to point out that while we are expecting increased utilization in all regions of the world as infections increase, we are not including any major non-U.S. or non-China contracts in our 2023 forecasts.\nLet me close with a few thoughts regarding our scientific engine. R&D continues to be the lifeblood that fuels us as a company, which is why we plan to increase our R&D spend by at least 8.7% in 2023 to $12.4 billion and $13.4 billion range. In addition to the increased investments, we are taking steps not only to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times, but also to increase overall return on investment and R&D productivity. As you have seen in the last year, we continuously prioritize our pipeline to focus on the assets that represent potential breakthroughs and have the potential for generating higher returns, putting more capital behind larger opportunities like GLP-1, flu, elranatamab and others.\nWe are at an infection point -- and we are at an inflection point to act from a position of strength with our best-in-class R&D productivity, a robust pipeline of innovative assets and one of the highest R&D budgets in the industry.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Dave to provide details on our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. After Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&D pipeline. Take it over, Dave.\n\nDavid M. Denton\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Pfizer Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. Albert has already taken you through many of the key drivers of our full year performance, so I will focus my opening remarks on some key highlights from the fourth quarter. Revenues grew operationally 13%, primarily driven by COMIRNATY's strong growth in developed markets, following the slowdown in deliveries that we discussed in the third quarter, ahead of the rollout of the bivalent booster. We also saw very strong performance from PAXLOVID outside the U.S. and the ongoing launch of Prevnar 20 for adults within the U.S.\nExcluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to our COVID-19 products, Pfizer's revenues grew 5% operationally in the quarter. And if recently acquired products from Biohaven and GBT are also excluded, revenues were up approximately 3% in Q4. Reported diluted earnings per share this quarter grew 48% to $0.87, while Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 69% on an operational basis in the quarter. Both EPS figures include a $0.32 benefit from lower acquired IPR&D expenses compared to last year's fourth quarter.\nOnce again, in the quarter, foreign exchange movement significantly impacted our results, reducing fourth quarter revenues by approximately $2.5 billion or 11%, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19 or 24% compared to LY. On a full year basis, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $5.5 billion or 7%, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.36 or 9%.\nTurning now to 2023 and the financial outlook for the company. Let me first point out that our approach to guidance in 2023 is fundamentally different than prior years. Given the expected transition to commercial markets for our COVID franchise and away from an advanced purchase agreement environment, our guidance reflects our best estimates for both revenues and profits for these products for the full year, not just what has been contractually secured.\nOn a total company basis, we expect revenues of between $67 billion to $71 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint. Importantly, we expect that revenues from our business, excluding COVID, will grow between 7% and 9% on an operational basis in 2023. That growth is projected to be split between contributions from our new product launches, our recently acquired products as well as our in-line portfolio. The total company revenue declines are entirely driven by our COVID products, which are expected to go from their peak in 2020 to their low point in '23 before potentially returning to growth in '24 and beyond. While patient demand for our COVID products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected to be fulfilled by products that were delivered to governments in '22 and recorded as revenues last year.\nNow I want to point out that our total company revenue guidance range is wider than what is implied by the 7% to 9% operational growth rate range for the business excluding COVID. The wider guidance range reflects the potential volatility that we see in our COVID product revenues, given that they can be significantly impacted by factors outside our control, such as the infection rates and the severity of the virus as well as the timing for transitioning to a traditional commercial model here in the U.S.\nAnd you can see on this slide our cost and expense guidance for '23. As I mentioned in my remarks at our investor event in December, both SI&A and R&D expenses are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 versus '22, despite the fact that our overall revenues are coming down. Higher investments in SI&A are significantly focused on the successful launches of the large number of potential new products that Albert highlighted as well as recently acquired assets. Additionally, the expected commercial launch of both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID in the U.S. will require additional investments as we transition away from the government market. These investments are squarely focused on supporting the company's 2025 to 2030 growth aspirations.\nWe also intend to invest significantly in our research efforts this year, with multiple exciting and potentially high-value programs receiving additional funding, including our oral GLP-1 programs, elranatamab and respiratory combination vaccines. All of this spending to support our commercial and research activities, we believe, will not only yield an attractive return but also contribute toward setting us on a path to achieving our long-term growth goals.\nI'd point out that when you exclude revenues and expenses related to our COVID products, our expected operating margin profile this year is largely consistent with the prior year. This reflects incremental investments in SI&A related to launch products and R&D as well as lower acquired IPR&D expenses.\nIn 2023, we are investing in both R&D and SI&A in advance of revenue contributions from new products. Looking longer term, we expect this spending will be maintained with the P&L growing into this cost base as new product revenues begin to be fully realized, with margins improving as a result. Given that 2023 is both a year of investment and transition, I thought it would be helpful to outline many of our key assumptions built into our guidance. I don't intend to walk you through all of the elements here, but both Slides 19 and 20 outline many of the details.\nIn summary, these assumptions include strong revenue growth of 7% to 9% in our business, excluding COVID; additional investments in SI&A and R&D to support Pfizer's near- and longer-term growth plans; continued patient demand for our COVID-related products worldwide, with vaccination rates declining slightly and utilization of treatments slightly increasing; rephasing of the European Commission COMIRNATY contract over multiple years versus full delivery in 2023; and finally, U.S. commercialization of the COVID products in the second half of 2023.\nIn summary, as we enter a new year, our business is extremely strong with many in-line, acquired and expected launch products capable of driving strong growth with an attractive pipeline of potential products coming in the future. We believe '23 will be an important year for Pfizer, and that is why we are deploying our resources into quality execution in order to fully realize the growth opportunities we see within our portfolio and within our pipeline, which have the potential to impact our growth outlook through 2030 and beyond.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Mikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Worldwide Research, Development & Medical, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. Today, I want to set the stage for an anticipated catalyst-rich 18 months. As Albert mentioned, we are in a position of unprecedented strength in our history, and I'm excited to share a high-level overview of an evolved strategy for Pfizer R&D to focus our resources on transformative programs which could be most impactful for patients, drive improved return on R&D investment and create the most value. We will leverage and continue to innovate our powerhouse capabilities in medicine design and continue to innovate light-speed drug development to further improve our industry-leading success rates and cycle times.\nWe have rethought our approach to rare disease and will move from having a stand-alone research unit to aligning key programs with other therapeutic areas. We plan to externally advance rare disease programs that do not fit into a core therapeutic area of focus. At the same time, we plan to tap into the expanding external innovation ecosystem by actively pursuing biotech innovation and emerging innovation that fits strategically and accessing external assets that are differentiated. Taken together, we believe these actions will help position us to lead the industry in reaching more patients with the most impactful near-term blockbuster breakthroughs while driving forward the next wave of innovations.\nI'm pleased to share some examples with you today. We are pursuing potentially transformative efficacy in our Inflammation & Immunology franchise, with the potential launches of etrasimod in ulcerative colitis and ritlecitinib in alopecia areata, which both have the potential to be blockbusters, and a planned Phase III study start of anti-interferon beta in dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Our next wave of innovation includes 2 monoclonal antibody candidates for atopic dermatitis, which exemplify our multispecific platform and in-house biomedicine design expertise.\nTwo assets currently in Phase 1 clinical trials each targets 3 cytokines in a single therapeutics, so we refer to them as trispecifics. On the right are Phase 1 pharmacokinetic profile of the average plasma concentration. For both molecules, the profiles suggest that once a month or even less frequent, subcutaneous dosing may be supported. There is potential for improved efficacy with more potent interleukin-4 and 13 utilization plus an expanded breadth of efficacy by blocking thymic stromal lymphopoietin to potentially cover more endotypes or by blocking interleukin-23 to potentially enhance itch reduction.\nThe Phase 1 studies continue. We aim to bolster our 30-year experience in hematology with a strong pipeline that complements our in-line portfolio and collectively has blockbuster potential. I will talk more about elranatamab and GBT601 in a moment. So will highlight here that we expect multiple data readouts for TTI-622 in hematological malignancies, 2 Phase III readouts for inclacumab in sickle cell disease in the second half of '24 and a Phase 3 readout for marstacimab in patients with hemophilia A or B in second quarter of '23.\nMarstacimab has FDA Fast Track designation for both hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. If successful, we project submitting for the non-inhibitor indication in both A and B hemophilia in the third quarter of '23. We recently announced positive top line results from a Phase 3 study of our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate and expect the pivotal readout for our hemophilia A gene therapy in the first half of '24.\nWe recently presented strong updated Phase 2 data on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, CD3-targeted bispecific antibody for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in heavily pretreated patients who had received at least 3 classes of prior therapies. This candidate, which has the potential to be a leader in the BCMA bispecific class, demonstrated a high objective response rate of 61% in patients with no prior BCMA-targeted treatment, early and deep responses and a manageable safety profile.\nGiven factors currently limiting the availability of novel therapies in the triple-class exposed setting, elranatamab has the potential to reach a broad and greater number of patients as an off-the-shelf option with reduced dosing frequency that is administered subcutaneously, offering more convenience than intravenous administration.\nWith FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation granted last year, elranatamab could potentially be approved this year. As there is blockbuster potential and patient value beyond the triple-class refractory population, our clinical strategy aims to move to earlier lines of therapy and combination approaches with the potential, if successful, for multiple approvals to expand eligibility and duration of therapy.\nNow to our next-generation oral, once-daily hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor candidate that's in a unique class and has the potential to expand the prophylactic treatment of people with sickle cell disease. Standard-of-care treatment rates have typically been low due to side effects, poor efficacy or both. While Oxbryta made substantial progress in preventing hemoglobin polymerization or sickling, GBT601 is a potentially best-in-class candidate, which may reduce both hemolysis and frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis.\nThe most recent data from our Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose study showed improvements in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels over time, mean hemoglobin occupancy of more than 32% for the 100-milligram maintenance dose and more than 41% for the 150-milligram maintenance dose and improvements in red blood cell health with the higher maintenance doses. The maintenance doses were well tolerated.\nWe believe these results may be transformative for patients, with a potential to achieve 35% to 45% hemoglobin occupancy, which is considered optimal for both hemoglobin oxygen affinity and preventing sickling, and approaches levels seen with gene therapy. This asset is also being studied in an ongoing Phase 2 study with a seamless Phase 2/3 design. We plan to start the Phase 3 part in the second half of 2023.\nNext, we aim to expand our leadership in breast cancer with a pipeline of complementary next-wave candidate. Our CDK4 inhibitor targets improving on CDK4/6 inhibition standard of care by maximizing CDK4 coverage. We're studying it in Phase 1 in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer as a single agent and in combination with endocrine therapy. The majority of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia that requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition, and that complete CDK4 inhibition by these inhibitors is challenging due to dose-limiting hematological adverse events.\nIn the Phase 1 combination study, the confirmed objective response rate in combination with fulvestrant or letrozole reached nearly 30%. And the clinical benefit rate was approximately 50% in 21 patients with measurable disease. The median progression-free survival was more than 24 weeks in 26 patients, including 5 without measurable disease. All patients were heavily pretreated with a median of 4 lines of prior treatment. All patients received prior CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment and 67% received prior fulvestrant. The asset was well tolerated with the CDK4 drug showing only 15% Grade 3 neutropenia and no Grade 4.\nHere we show a scan of a patient who achieved partial response and was on treatment for 47 weeks. She had received 6 lines of prior treatment, including CDK4/6 inhibition and fulvestrant. We are currently engaged in dose optimization, enrolling CDK4/6-naïve cohort and planning to start a randomized study in second-line treatment of estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer this year. Additional data readouts from our next wave of breast cancer candidates are anticipated in the first half of '23.\nIn addition to the assets I spoke about today, we anticipate multiple milestones over the next 18 months. We expect a pivotal IBRANCE readout in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, a pivotal study start for ARV-471 and a Phase 2 readout for our KAT6 inhibitor. We have achieved incredible advancement in our vaccines portfolio, including candidates that harness our leadership in mRNA with an unprecedented number of milestones expected. In addition to the expected launches shown here, we expect a Phase 3 data readout from our modRNA flu candidate vaccine and a potential respiratory combination vaccine study start.\nA Phase 1/2 study of our shingles candidate, the first mRNA-based shingles vaccine program began last week. In Inflammation & Immunology as well as Internal Medicine, key catalysts include potential launches of potential blockbusters, a planned pivotal study start with [interferon beta map] and data readout in metabolic disease.\nWe are also making good progress in our anti-infectives portfolio, including anticipating full approval for PAXLOVID and planned study starts for both our second-generation COVID-19 antiviral candidate, which may have no or limited drug-drug interaction and our RSV antiviral candidate.\nIn closing, we are very optimistic about the many transformative catalysts emerging from the pipeline. Pfizer's scientists are working with urgency and commitment to help the most patients as quickly as we can.\nThank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\n\nChristopher J. Stevo\n\nSenior VP & Chief IR Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Mikael. Chelsea, why don't you poll for questions, please? We'll take as many questions as time permits, and Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any detailed questions that we're not able to address on the call itself.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSVP and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nGood morning. Welcome to Pfizer's third quarter earnings call. We anticipate that this call will last 60 minutes. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, David Denton, our CFO, and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research, Development and Medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Chief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer, Dr. William Pao, our Chief Development Officer, and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Before we begin the call, I'm also happy to announce that we will host Analyst Day in New York City on the afternoon\nof 12 December 2024. Members of our executive team and other leaders at Pfizer will share information on our rich slate of potential near-term product launches, and the R&D readouts which will drive the next wave of product launches after that, both of which will support our 2030 revenues and beyond. In-person attendance will be by invitation, but we will also be webcasting the event. While we're not going to talk more about the agenda today, we look forward to providing more details as we get closer to 12 December 2024. Materials for this call, and other earnings-related materials, are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com.\nPlease see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on slide four, and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release, in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under risk factors, and forward-looking information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will briefly touch on some recent highlights. I will then spend the bulk of my time speaking to our expectations for what we feel will be a promising and prosperous future for Pfizer and the patients we serve, in addition to generating stellar financial performance. Since our last earnings call, we reported positive pivotal data for several exciting pipeline programs, including our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults, Prevnar 20 for children, the potential combination treatment of Talzenna and Xtandi in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine\ncandidate for adolescents and young adults, as well as exciting progress for our GLP-1 program in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Just this morning, we announced positive top-line data from the phase III clinical trial investigating our bivalent RSV vaccine candidate when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth. We established a new commercial structure within our global biopharmaceutical business that is focused on three broad therapeutic areas: primary care, specialty care, and oncology. We believe this new structure will enable us to maximize the commercial success of the multiple exciting product launches, including several\npotential blockbusters that are poised to emerge from our scientific pipeline over the next few years. We have continued to advance potentially game-changing vaccines in the fight against respiratory disease by entering into a phase III study for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate and initiating a phase I study for a vaccine candidate that combines our mRNA flu and COVID-19 vaccine in one shot. We completed the acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics, giving us market-leading franchises in both migraine and sickle cell disease, respectively.\nLess than six months ago, after launching an Accord for a Healthier World, a breakthrough initiative designed to close the health equity gap for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries, I'm proud to say that the first shipments of our products have arrived to these countries, and we are working with governments on health system improvements that can help make sure these products reach those in need. Of course, we continue to lead the fight against COVID-19. Most notably, our Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency, and several other regulatory bodies.\nAs part of Pfizer's commitment to providing equitable access to COVID-19 oral treatments, we agreed to supply at a not-for-profit price up to 6 million PAXLOVID treatment courses to the Global Fund for low and lower-middle-income countries. An exciting quarter, for sure. In our company and our industry, it's all about what's next. The next breakthrough medicine or vaccine, the next game-changing technology, the next solution to an unmet patient need. This continued pursuit of what's next is embedded in Pfizer's DNA and the foundational driver of our purpose: breakthroughs that change patients' lives. It's also why we have confidence that Pfizer's story is a story of growth.\nWe recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer-term growth prospects, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe. That's understandable, given that we currently expect a negative impact of approximately $17 billion in revenues from losses of exclusivity during that period, based on our internal calculations. We believe we not only can overcome these expected declines, but also can potentially generate strong growth through the end of the decade. Let's take a closer look on how we expect to accomplish this. Our strong capital position has given us the ability to pursue business development opportunities with the potential, if successful, of course, to add at least\n$25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top-line expectations. We believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics, and ReViral have the potential to get us more than 1/3 of the way there, and that we have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target. Perhaps even more exciting is the wave of potential growth drivers emerging from our R&D pipeline in the near term. Over the next 18 months, we expect to have up to 19 new products or indications in the market, including the five for which we have already begun pro-promotions, co-promotions, or commercialization\nearlier this year. We can find, you can find a list of these launches in the appendix of the presentation we posted today for this earnings call. If successful, these 19 launches, of which more than two-thirds have the potential to be blockbusters, would be the most ever in Pfizer's history. The 15 in-house developed projects alone could potentially represent approximately $20 billion in 2030 sales, which would more than offset the expected LOE impact. Many of these programs are already largely de-risked from a clinical perspective. The majority of them were discovered in-house, and nearly all of them would be for indications outside of COVID-19. If approved, we expect each of these to\nbe key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond. Of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline, with numerous launches expected in the 2024 to 2030 timeline. These include gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, B, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, our oral GLP-1 for diabetes and obesity, a potential combo vaccine that would cover flu and COVID in one shot, and many, many more. With regard to our COVID-19 products, while their sales may fall from our expected 2022 levels of approximately combined $55 billion, we believe our COVID-19 franchises will remain multi-billion dollar revenue generators for the\nforeseeable future, which should serve as a buffer for any unforeseen challenges with other products in our portfolio. Our confidence to execute this plan stems from the depth of our financial resources and the firepower it gives us to pursue business development opportunities. The power brand equity we have built up over the past 170 years, and further enhanced in the past two years. According to a recent survey, our brand awareness now stands at an impressive 82%, and our favorability stands at 61% compared with 42% for the industry as a whole, results that were obtained just a couple of months ago. The strength of the three foundational pillars of our company:\nour world-class scientific, our world-class commercial, and our world-class manufacturing engines. You will see in this slide some highlights of each one of them. Let me now briefly highlight three potential blockbusters that we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. RSV is an area of significant unmet need, particularly in older adults and infants. Each year, it's estimated more than 177,000 older adults are hospitalized, and 14,000 of them die in the US alone due to RSV. That is confirmed by a diagnostic test. We believe we have the potential to be a leader in this space and have a real impact on public health. On 24 March 2024, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for\nour RSV vaccine candidate for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. We are excited to report positive top-line data from the phase III RENOIR trial in late August, with a recent presentation of detailed results at ID Week 2022. A pre-planned interim analysis showed vaccine efficacy of 67% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness defined by two or more symptoms, and vaccine efficacy of 85.7% was observed in participants with more severe disease presenting three or more RSV-associated symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness. We are also excited about the potential for our maternal\nRSV vaccine candidate. Globally, each year, RSV sickens more than 6.5 million infants under six months old and kills approximately 45,000. As announced this morning, our maternal RSV study met the success criterion for one of the two primary endpoints. Vaccine efficacy of 81.8% was observed against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life, and high efficacy of 69.4% was demonstrated through the first six months of life. There is the potential that, subject to regulatory approval, by late 2023, early 2024, we could have the only RSV maternal vaccine on the market, along with an RSV vaccine for\nolder adults that has high efficacy, and it is well tolerated with no safety concerns. Combined, the two indications represent a potential multi-billion dollar peak revenue opportunity if approved, especially with our highly respected primary care sales force executing these launches. Including the RSV antiviral investigational candidates we acquired with ReViral, we aim to have end-to-end solutions with both preventative vaccines and therapeutics to treat those infected with RSV. Ulcerative colitis, or UC, is a chronic and often debilitating inflammatory bowel disease that affects an estimated 1 million people in the US alone. Many patients living with this disease never\nachieve or maintain remission, and physicians are seeking effective, proven oral therapies with a favorable benefit-risk profile that can be an attractive first-line advanced therapy option. As a result, we expect the market opportunity to grow by about 50% over the next five years. The positive phase III data from the ELEVATE UC 12 and 52 trials reinforce our belief that etrasimod has a differentiated clinical profile and can be an important treatment option if approved. We believe that etrasimod can be a multi-billion dollar blockbuster product. We expect to launch the product in the US as soon as the second half of 2023, pending regulatory approval through our specialty care sales\nforce, which already has strong relationships in the UC market thanks to its work with XELJANZ, biosimilars, etc. Lastly, let's look at migraine. Following our acquisition of Biohaven in early October, we are now aiming to build the world's leading global migraine franchise, with the potential to impact 1 billion patients around the world. Migraine is a debilitating disease and has 11.6% prevalence worldwide. In the US. alone, there are 40 million patients with migraine, and one out of five women are migraine sufferers right now. The economic burden is significant at $36 billion per year. We believe our portfolio, including Nurtec, VYDURA, and ZAVZPRET, could meet a range of needs in\nthe market, allowing physicians and patients to decide how to appropriately manage migraine treatment and prevention. As a result, we see the potential to reach more than $6 billion in peak revenues altogether. In the US, Nurtec is growing very well, including the impact of Pfizer's co-promoting, which began in August pre-close. Nurtec has further strengthened its number one market share position in the oral CGRP market, and we expect even stronger growth as we deliver on our promise to further enhance our commercial efforts behind this product. Outside the US, it has been approved in the EU, UK, Israel, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and we have filed for\nregistration in an additional 10 markets. While this is not a new product launch, we believe this is a great example of how we can take this portfolio to new heights by leveraging the full strength of Pfizer's global commercial engine, including in primary care physicians. Moving over to ZAVZPRET, we recently expect to launch ZAVZPRET intranasal in the US next year, pending FDA approval, and we plan to globally commercialize. Lastly, the oral prevention phase III trial is ongoing with a data readout expected in the third quarter. With that, I turn it over to Dave to update you on the results and outlook for the financials. After Dave, Mikael will speak about the progression of our pipeline.\n\nDavid Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert, and good morning. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding how the company continues to deploy capital in a disciplined manner in support of long-term growth and, importantly, enhanced shareholder returns. As you know, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities have expanded significantly over the past several years, and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever. During the first nine months of 2022, the company has deployed and committed capital in three main areas. First, we've invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D as we continue to support our growing pipeline of innovative medicines. These investments are\nsquarely focused on driving revenue growth through 2030. Secondly, in the first three quarters of this year, we have invested approximately $8 billion in completed business transactions. Additionally, early in the fourth quarter, the company completed investments of more than $18 billion in transactions, including both Biohaven and GBT, which brings us to approximately $26 billion in capital deployed for business development transactions thus far in 2022 alone. These transactions illustrate our progress towards the goal of adding $25 billion in risk-adjusted 2030 revenues through BD. Finally, we have returned nearly $9 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of\nboth dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value through prudent capital allocation will continue to be a major focus for Pfizer. With that, let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I'll limit my remarks largely to adjusted and operating growth figures. Third quarter revenues demonstrated strength across many areas of the business, but much of that strength was somewhat obscured by our incredibly strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Given the strength in the prior year, revenues this quarter decreased 2% operationally. However, looking at it on a two-year basis, revenues this quarter were up more\nthan 120% compared to the third quarter of 2020. The slight decrease compared to last year was in line with our expectations, given the phasing of scheduled deliveries of COMIRNATY, which we discussed in our earnings call last quarter. Also underlining our results this quarter was the strong performance of PAXLOVID, as well as continued strength from a number of our other key products. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to the COVID products, Pfizer's revenues grew 2% operationally in the quarter. Gross margins expanded by 1,450 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. This improvement is largely due to increased sales of higher margin PAXLOVID\nand decreased sales of lower gross margin commodity compared to last year. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of a $400 million charge related to excess raw materials for PAXLOVID. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we intentionally chose to order additional stock to ensure we can meet any global health demand if an extreme need were to arise. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the third quarter grew 23% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and commodity, and higher healthcare reform fees. The 2% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q3 was primarily driven by increased costs to develop recently\nacquired assets, as well as investments for certain oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccines programs. This was partially offset by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19, and various late-stage clinical programs. The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter was 4.4%, significantly lower than typical, driven by tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning several tax years. Excluding these tax resolutions, the underlying tax rate was consistent with historical trends. As a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.51 grew by 6%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.78 grew 44% on an\noperational basis in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements continued to dampen our results, negatively impacting revenues by approximately $950 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 this quarter. Now, let me move to our updated 2022 guidance. Given our strong third quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for revenues by $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19. This operational increase on the bottom line would have been even higher if not for an incremental $0.06 negative impact due to higher acquired IPR and D expenses. Partially offsetting these operational\nincreases is the impact of additional strengthening of the US dollar since the last updated guidance in late July. Incremental foreign exchange movements negatively impacted our expectations for 2022 revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $700 million and $0.09, respectively. The net impact of these cross currents results in increases to the midpoints of our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges.These revised ranges reflect operational growth rates of 31% for revenues and 70% for adjusted diluted earnings per share at the midpoint compared to 2021. This is up from our previous operational growth expectations for revenues and\nadjusted diluted earnings per share of 29% and 65%, respectively. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we now expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $34 billion, up by $2 billion compared to our prior guidance. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales to approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance range unchanged despite the negative incremental impact of changes in effects. You can see on this slide that our updated cost and expense guidance, which incorporates our performance to date, our recent acquisitions, and our updated expectations for the remainder of the year.\nMore information on each of these updates can be found in this morning's press release. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March of 2022. In closing, this is an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter, and our improving operational outlook for the year, sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll now turn it over to Mikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Dave. Today, I will focus attention on high-value programs that will potentially deliver breakthroughs in areas of high unmet need and are expected to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond. With anchor products such as COMIRNATY, PAXLOVID, Ibrance, and Xtandi, we are building out comprehensive franchises in several areas, including respiratory, metabolic disorders, genetic hematology, and certain cancers. We have deep expertise in these areas, and there is exciting science emerging. I will share updates from three of these today: respiratory, metabolic, and prostate cancer. Building on our success with COMIRNATY\nand PAXLOVID, we see enormous potential to help address major causes of respiratory disease through vaccines and therapeutics. Work on the next generation vaccine candidates is well underway, and last week, we started a phase I clinical trial of our second generation oral therapeutic candidates. Our quadrivalent mRNA flu program has progressed into phase III, and we will start shortly a phase I study of an mRNA-based vaccine candidate that combines our quadrivalent mRNA flu vaccine candidate with the Omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine based on BA.4/5. In RSV, we believe a dual focus on developing a vaccine and antivirals could make a significant\nimpact globally. I will share new data with you shortly. PAXLOVID continues to be an important tool in helping to combat the impact of COVID-19, and secondary endpoints from the EPIC high-risk study, as well as data from real-world evidence, support the product's efficacy profile. In the EPIC-HR studies, PAXLOVID reduced COVID-19-related all-cause deaths and ICU admissions by 100%, and COVID-19-related hospitalization by 86% in unvaccinated high-risk patients compared to placebo. It also reduced the duration of COVID-19 symptoms by two to three days compared to placebo. We are pleased to see PAXLOVID leading the COVID-19 treatment landscape and\nremain confident in its safety and efficacy in treating patients at high risk for severe outcomes. We recently reported a positive interim analysis from a phase III study in older adults of our novel RSV vaccine candidate, which targets the prefusion F protein on both RSV A and B without need for an adjuvant. We saw remarkable vaccine efficacy across the first RSV season. The vaccine was extremely well tolerated, with favorable systemic tolerability, a key consideration for vaccines. We're also developing the RSV pre-F vaccine candidate for use in pregnant women so that protection may be conferred to newborns. This morning, we announced exciting results from a pre-planned\ninterim analysis of our phase III trial. We observed vaccine efficacy of nearly 82% against severe medical-attended lower respiratory tract illness, or MA-LRTI, due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life, and efficacy of more than 69% through the first six months of life. Success criteria was not met for the second primary endpoint, however, clinically meaningful efficacy was observed with MA-LRTI of 57% in infants from birth through 90 days of life and efficacy of 51% over the six months follow-up period. The data monitoring committee indicated the vaccine was well tolerated with no safety concerns for either vaccinated women or their newborns. Given these\nimpressive results, we look forward to filing a BLA for both older adults and pregnant women with the US FDA by year-end, with potential launches in 2023. If approved, our maternal RSV vaccine candidate potentially would be the first available to help prevent these common and potentially life-threatening respiratory illnesses in young infants. Turning now to prostate cancer, we're building upon the standard of care set by Xtandi in castration-sensitive and castration-resistant populations. The phase III EMBARK study of Xtandi in non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is expected to read out the first half of 2023, and the phase III TALAPRO-3 study of Talzenna\nand Xtandi is expected in 2024. These trials may indicate benefit in up to 20% more patients than are currently treated and potentially prolonged duration of use, subject to clinical success and regulatory approval. In TALAPRO-2, we observed the first clinical benefit of a PARP inhibitor plus Xtandi in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, with or without homologous recombination repair or HRRM mutation. Irrespective of HRRM mutation status, the study achieved its primary endpoint. The combination delivered a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival, and appears to have resulted in the longest\nobserved survival in a randomized trial in this setting. We are encouraged by these results and believe that Talzenna and prostate cancer may have blockbuster potential, subject to regulatory approval. Turning to metabolic disorders, I have previously shared that we are developing two oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, danuglipron and 1532. Recently presented phase I-b data for 1532 showed dose-dependent reduction from baseline at four to six weeks in mean daily glucose, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and body weight. Both candidates are potentially best-in-class and differentiated by offering full agonism, which may be required to achieve the same level of response as injectable\nGLP-1 receptor agonist while offering a convenient once-daily dose for 1532. Glucose effects plateau at lower doses, while body weight effects continue to improve at higher doses. The planned phase II-b study will evaluate 1532 versus both oral semaglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes, and separately versus placebo in obesity. Using semaglutide as a comparator in the type 2 diabetes arm should allow us to observe potential early signs of differentiation in efficacy, tolerability, and safety. We will evaluate doses up to 260mg in this study, higher than the studies in the phase I-b. We plan to begin dosing soon and anticipate the readout in Q1 2024.\nThe ongoing phase II-b study of danuglipron in obesity, with now once-monthly titration, is expected to complete in H2 2023. Data from these studies will be available in relatively quick succession, and, assuming clinical success, allow us to select one based on efficacy, tolerability, and dosing to advance to phase III in both type 2 diabetes and obesity. In closing, we are excited about the developing science within these franchises and share here recent and anticipated milestones in the next 18 months. We look forward to continued development, both for potential patient benefit and sustainable growth. Thank you. Let me turn over to Chris to start Q&A.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSVP and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks, Mikael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We have about 30 minutes for the session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. Investor relations will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Chelsea, please go ahead and queue up the first question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star and one keys on your touch-tone phone. If you find that your question has been addressed, you may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star one to ask a question, and we'll pause for a brief moment to allow questions to queue. Our first question will come from Uma Rumman with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Uma, go ahead. Sorry. Uma, are you there? Uma, your line is open. Please make sure you are not muted.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSVP and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nChelsea, maybe we should—\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. We'll go to our next question. Colin Bristow with UBS, your line is open.\n\nColin Bristow\n\nManaging Director, Biotechnology, UBS\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On COVID-23 expectations, should we expect anything from you here on the 12 December investor event? Just more broadly around this, how are you thinking conceptually about guiding to this? Would it be similar to last year? Are you thinking of more sort of scenario-based guiding? Anything that would be helpful? Just a sort of temperature check on business development. If you could update us on your priorities and interests. From a deal perspective, just how big would you be willing to go? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. On 12 December, what you should expect is a good overview of our very important new product launches in the coming 18 months, with more details about the science, and the market potential of those launches, as well as some of the most important pipeline potential new medicines and vaccines that are not going to be launched in the next 18 months, but will be launched in the period between 2024 and 2030. Now, for the BD priorities, I would ask Aamir to reiterate once more our strategy when it comes to BD.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks for the question, Colin. The BD priorities remain consistent with what we've articulated before. Principally, we are most excited about scientific substrate that has the potential for patient breakthroughs. That's going to continue to be our North Star. We're looking for deals that accelerate our top-line growth in the back half of the decade. Importantly, we're focused on opportunities where we can add substantial value, and that can come in the form of either shaping the science or also accelerating our commercial momentum. If you look at the deals that we announced and closed in 2022, including Arena, Biohaven, ReViral, and GBT, they would all be very consistent with\nthose priorities. We've said that we are agnostic to size of transaction, but you've also heard us be very clear about the fact that cost-synergy-driven deals is not where our focus is going to be. We're going to be focused on driving growth through our BD.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Also, Dave, maybe you can also address the question about guidance on COVID, and are we going to provide it and when for 2023, etc.?\n\nDavid Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert. Maybe let me set the stage as it relates to COVID and the COVID franchise. I think if you look out longer term, the franchise is going to be a multi-billion dollar franchise in the respect that this is going to be somewhat like a sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu. Therefore, I think the products, both from a vaccine and a therapy perspective that Pfizer has developed, are going to be quite relevant for many years to come. Having said that, when we provide guidance for 2023, when it's appropriate to do so, we will give investors a perspective on what our expectations are for the year, and we will break out that guidance specifically so you can\nhold us accountable for delivering on those revenue promises when the time comes.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next call, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nResearch Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to ask you, first off, how you think about, or maybe more color on how you think about the pushes and pulls in 2023. There's a lot of moving parts there. Secondly, on your RSV franchise, there seems to be several players with drugs in development, and they've all reported out positive data. Curious how you think about this market playing out over time. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Let me say a few words about the pushes and pulls, and then I will ask Angela to complement, and then speaking about how we see the RSV market. Clearly, 2023 is a very, very important year for us, given the unprecedented number of new launches that we are going to have in the next 18 months. Most of them will happen in 2023, and some at the beginning of the first quarter of 2024. We are launching products, not only a very big number of them, but only the internal ones, $20 billion, excluding the BD, Biohaven, and the global brand, $20 billion of big sales we are expecting, 2030 sales we are expecting from those launches.\nIt is a very, very big number, and it is very important for us to do it well. In addition, clearly, that will bring our non-COVID business, will be a significant boost for non-COVID business. Now, when we move to COVID, we expect 2023 will be a transition year, with likely in the US moving from a government model into a commercial model for vaccines and therapeutics. The timing is not certain, so we are ready to do it as up, but we'll be phased over the years. It likely will not be the same for PAXLOVID or COMIRNATY. Clearly, also, there will be some stock that will have to be depleted in 2023. Clearly, there will be new price dynamics as we are moving to 2023.\nCOVID will be a little bit more of a transitional year in 2023 until it will be established into more like a flu volumes type of market, of course, with different price points and different severity of the disease that will bring both therapeutic and vaccines into a multi-billion dollar franchise. We are not going to predict now what will be the number for the years out, but we will try to be as accurate as possible for our 2023 numbers when we will provide guidance. Now, Angela, anything to add on the push and pulls? You are carrying a lot of the weight for the new launches, and also speak about one of them, which is going to be the RSV maternal and adult.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nWell, we're extremely excited about both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine, first and foremost because it is in the sweet spot of what Pfizer does, respiratory vaccines, right? We have a lot of experience of this created through the legacy of our pneumococcal franchise and the strength we have there, but also recently from COMIRNATY. I'll also add that Pfizer is the only company that has both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine, and it really does fit so extremely well into our existing commercial footprint. These are large populations, both the adult as well as maternal. Let me just start with adult and just sort of characterize that a bit.\nThere's 61 million 65-year-olds, all of whom are eligible for this vaccination. It's actually quite a devastating disease. The hospital costs from RSV for adults is over $1.2 billion. It is also underreported and underdiagnosed, and we have a really great opportunity here to drive awareness of this disease, but also to use the commercial footprint that we already have to create awareness, to create education, and to bring this vaccine to those who need it. Equally, in the maternal space, a devastating disease. Most of the mortality and the morbidity is in infants that are under six months old and those that are preterm. Actually, over 102,000 deaths worldwide are resulting from infant infections of RSV.\nAgain, we see a tremendous opportunity to make a difference here. As you know, through the work that we've done on Prevnar, we have a tremendous legacy in pediatric vaccines. That, coupled with our strength in women's health and the commercial footprint we have there as well, is going to be perfectly suited for us to launch the maternal RSV vaccine. Bringing all of this together, I think that we have the scientific knowledge, we have the technology, we have the relationships with the vaccinators and the sites of vaccinations. We are also very well versed in our work with vaccine technical committees around the world in bringing together a broad recommendation, which we believe is\nwhat's going to give us access to many, many infants as well as adults to these two tremendous breakthroughs. I think we have the best-in-class capabilities to do a great job with this respiratory portfolio.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nVery well, Angela, and I agree with you. Operator, next call, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. I have three questions, but they're all short. First, what impact on RSV-associated infant hospitalizations did Pfizer see in the phase III Matisse trial? Second, can you tell us what Nurtec sales were in Q3? I know you didn't own Biohaven in Q3, but you likely know the number. Lastly, all things considered, is it unrealistic to think that COMIRNATY plus PAXLOVID sales could be as much as $15 billion in 2030? Thank you.\nThank you very much. Mikael, what about the RSV data?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical, Pfizer\n\nThank you for the question. As you have seen in our press release, we reported out very impressive data. Two separate primary endpoints that were independent, it is sufficient to hit one for filing. To our privilege and encouragement, we hit strongly on the most important. That was defined as severe, medically attended, lower tract respiratory infections, where we had close to 82% vaccine efficacy.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThat is defined by clinical features such as the rate and distress of respiration, oxygenation levels, etc., in the children, and will include patients, whether they are hospitalized or not. We will later release data on secondary endpoints that include hospitalization. When you look at this dramatic effect on the severe infections, it seems very reasonable to project that we will have a dramatic impact in lowering hospitalizations and probably talking about tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the US that may not happen if this vaccine is used to vaccinate maternal prior to delivering the children as appropriately studied in this vaccination.\nWe are very encouraged and optimistic about that type of value. Thank you, Mikael. Before I turn to Dave to answer the question about the sales of Nurtec in the third quarter, let me make a comment on COMIRNATY, PAXLOVID, and the franchise. Clearly, we said that it will provide us a good picture of what we expect to be the sales for next year. Now, you're asking about year 2030, which is even more challenging. Also, the way you are asking the question, it is, is it unthinkable? Is it unreasonable to think that we could have a $15 billion franchise? Well, taken that it is $55 billion right now, it's not unreasonable to think that in year 2030 it could be that, but it's not clear that it will be that.\nThat will depend on the virus and how it behaves. It will depend on if it will become a standard practice to vaccinate together with flu. If we will have a combination product, clearly, that will enhance this direction. I think it's a little bit too early, but no, it's not unreasonable to think given where we are right now. Now, what about Nurtec sales?\n\nDavid Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, Steve, this is Dave. As you said, we didn't own the business last quarter, but maybe just a little bit of color on how the product's performing. If you look at the volume last year, or last quarter, rather, Q3, if you compare it to last year, it's about a 45% growth rate in year-over-year script volume. If you look at it sequentially, which I think is really important, we saw about a 16% growth rate sequentially Q2 going into Q3. I think this shows the promise of this product, number one. Number two, I think once we get it, now that we have it in the hands of our field force and into our primary care field force,\nwe can really maximize the value of this needed medicine into the patient population here in the US and abroad.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Let's go, Operator, to the next call.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. On PAXLOVID, I was just, I'm sure you saw the recent publication citing how many people have died from not even getting an antiviral. Can you talk a little bit about the efforts you're making to educate physicians to give the drug? Do you think we'll ever get to a point where people will be more comfortable, doctors will be more comfortable taking it, given all the news around the PAXLOVID rebound? Second question, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity for vitiligo and alopecia in your pipeline, and when should we hear the next readouts? Thanks.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Both questions, I think, can be answered very nicely by Angela.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nWell, thank you for the question. Let's talk a little bit about PAXLOVID and how that's been going. I mean, first and foremost, we are under an EUA, so that means that we are working hand in hand with the US government to ensure that we are providing the education to the public. I mean, the US government and the state governments, I think, have created a tremendous amount of education already using public service announcements and public campaigns. Equally, we have provided education to all the potential prescribers of PAXLOVID. If you think about where we are today, over 500,000 physicians have written PAXLOVID.\nWhat you have, in addition to that, is education that we've provided not only to doctors, but also to pharmacists. We've trained over 80,000 pharmacists in terms of how to write PAXLOVID. I think the education is really firing off both at a prescriber level, but also at a consumer level where we have worked, again, also closely with state governments and local governments to ensure that we're providing the right amount of education. I will say that the test-to-treat sites that the government has stood up federally, there's now 27,000 of those around the country, have also been great sources of education for PAXLOVID. I think that it's frankly, I think it's going well.\nI think that we're continuing to do more in anticipation of the fall. The fact that you've had 500,000 physicians write this PAXLOVID already is a great indicator of their confidence with this. The fact that probably the one most important area of education that we need to continue to emphasize is just who are the eligible people for PAXLOVID. Actually, if you look at the definition that the CDC provides, there are 22 risk factors for who should be eligible. They include those who are over 65, right, age-related risks, but equally risks such as mental health illness, risks such as an inactive lifestyle, risks that you may not be aware of.\nI think that that's really where we want to focus now through this fall. What about the vitiligo? I think we're really excited about these new indications for ritlecitinib. I think probably the main theme here is that they are not effective. There aren't any treatments for these highly, very serious inflammatory conditions today. Huge unmet need, just a place where there's just no options today. The fact that we're able to bring a treatment like this to market, I think, will have tremendous uptake by patients who up to now just are left with no options.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nWilliam, can you please address a little bit the issue about the rebounds that was also mentioned?\n\nWilliam Pao\n\nChief Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. Albert, well, Mikael already mentioned that we gave updated data from our EPIC-HR study on the effect of PAXLOVID versus placebo in patients with high risk for COVID-19. We had additional endpoints there, which showed a 100% decrease in ICU admissions, a 100% decrease in mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients, and 100% who got PAXLOVID were DC'd to home versus 53% placebo. We also had 82% reduction in oxygen support, 86% reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization, 89% reduction in mean days hospitalized versus 100 patients, and also 73% reduction in any COVID-19-related medical visit.\nImportantly, we also showed sustained time to symptom alleviation and sustained time to symptom resolution of an impact of two to three days of PAXLOVID versus placebo. Most importantly, about rebounds, there's been several studies recently that have shown actually that rebound occurs with COVID in general. For example, there was a recent publication of 158 patients who got placebo with COVID, and actually 1/3 of those had recurrent symptoms after resolution of their symptoms, suggesting that it's a phenomenon associated with COVID and not with PAXLOVID.\nImportantly, we also haven't seen any evidence of resistance that is clinically meaningful, whereas with antibodies, for example, we have seen that you also can get symptom rebound, but that is associated with resistance. PAXLOVID is not associated with resistance, but the antibodies are. We feel very confident that PAXLOVID has a significant impact in the role against COVID.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, William. Operator, next call, please.\n\nWilliam Pao\n\nChief Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nNext, we have Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nGlobal Head of Healthcare Research, Citi\n\nThank you. A couple of questions. Firstly, as it relates to the maternal RSV vaccine, could you talk about reimbursement coverage in the US? I'm assuming you'll get an ACIP recommendation, and therefore there'll be zero out of pocket, which may differentiate it versus the monoclonal. I'm sure on a cost basis, that will be material. Secondly, could you talk to your efforts with your degrader with Arvinas in light of the evolving data on SERDs, thinking about Astra's recent positive trial and then the ESR1 subgroup? Do you believe that this is a function of defining the right patient population at the right stage of the disease rather than the potential risk to development of the entire category? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAndrew, thank you. In the interest of time, let me give the first answer. Yes, you're right. As long as the product is recommended by CDC, and we believe with this type of efficacy will be recommended, there is zero copay, irrelevant of the insurance, if it is commercial or if it is public, the obligation is zero copay from the payers, and they have to cover it. Mikael, what about the Arvinas molecules?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Thank you for asking. Clearly, we think that the two factors that will separate out the good drugs from the less good in this class of degraders. We think the PROTAC, which is the mechanistic name of the 471, is more effective in downregulating the estrogen receptor and selecting the right patients compared to standard of care. That includes selecting patients that have estrogen receptor mutations and need more powerful drugs, and it's related to the property of the drug itself. We look forward to advance that drug with Arvinas to pivotal studies in the relatively near future and also to soon reveal to you a lot of progress we have in our breast cancer franchise, including the CDK4\ndrug. That may be part of what we consider to share in December at the investor update on launches and X-waves.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael, and I have a reason to attend this great event. Operator, can we go to the next call, please?\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Siegerman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets",
    "content2": "Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Congrats on the progress. Two questions for me. On BD, I want to be brief here, but can you talk about what other therapeutic areas you might want to explore? I know you're in neurology with Biohaven, non-malignant hematology with GBT, and of course, inflammation.Would you consider adding oncology? On the same lines, kind of Albert and some previous comments ahead of this call, you had mentioned going alone with some of your mRNA technologies. What applications of mRNA do you see outside of COVID? I mean, is personalized cancer vaccines an area that you would explore? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nMaybe I'll pass that to Aamir.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. As far as our therapeutic areas of focus, as I mentioned before in our priorities, our focus is on where we can make a difference and shape the science. The good news is we actually have distinctive capabilities across many different therapeutic areas. You've seen us active in internal medicine, anti-infectives, INI, and certainly oncology. Our focus is going to be on where we have breakthrough science and the potential to shape it. We feel very good about the breadth of our scientific capabilities to give us lots of flexibility to work in different DAs.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Operator, the next call, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Mohit Bhandal with Wells Fargo.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nNo, no, no, hold on. Hold on. Kelsey, just one second. Yes, Kelsey. We did not answer the mRNA and how we think about it, Mikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical, Pfizer\n\nYes. I'm excited to share with broadening that platform. You heard about advance of the mRNA flu vaccine successfully to the next stages. Albert mentioned plans that are going to combine it with COVID vaccine to build more broader respiratory vaccine with improved convenience in single administration, single patient visits. We are on our way to the phase I study together with BioNTech on our shingles vaccine that really aim to deliver the power of the mRNA, but remove what is seen as a pretty significant issue with reactogenicity of the current adjuvanted vaccine. We're looking at several other mRNA vaccines that we will share in proper time.\nAlso, as Aamir briefly alluded to, we have made progress in our alliance with BEAM to really identify the first type of candidates that will move forward to genetic medicine in some of the important rare diseases. We're looking at application in certain areas of in vivo cancer medications where we think this technology can be more successful compared to the past of cancer vaccines.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Mikael. Now, Operator, can go to the next call, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I almost wanted to ask about Mounjaro, but this is not the call. Sorry. Just kidding. On RSV vaccine side, I mean, congrats on the data in maternal vaccine. My question is, Sanofi has an antibody which you can give to infants directly, and it shows good results. In your opinion, there could be one strategy: you immunize moms, expecting moms versus infants directly. How do you think about the end market shaking out eventually? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Angela, would you want to say how we could compete potentially with an antibody in infants?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I mean, first of all, if you look at where most of the morbidity and mortality is happening, it's really at the under six months, right, in that age group, and also with preterm babies. You really need that protection from day one. I think that's where we believe our differentiation is from birth, literally from the moment of birth. You have protection, and you have duration of protection throughout the six months, which is what we've shown in our clinical trial. I think while there, I mean, obviously, it's great to have many different options. I think that the option that we have with our vaccine is truly a unique one, and one that plays well to the situation with the infants.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Of course, Andrew made also the point that vaccines, you do not have copays, and antibodies are quite expensive, and you do have copays. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Tsang\n\nVP, Biopharmaceuticals Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, hi. This is Brian, on for Tim. Just two from us. What is Pfizer's current level of interest in Alzheimer's disease? Do you think there are compelling business development opportunities in the market, or would the efforts likely be homegrown? Second, on the Prevnar 20 and the competition, wondering if you can opine on Merck's strategy, which is to bifurcate the market between kids and adults and have a product tailored to each segment. They have strains in each, and they will be going head-to-head against Prevnar. They said a tailored approach is better than a one-size-fits-all approach, which is what Prevnar is. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Clearly, as you know, Pfizer had externalized their neuroscience portfolio, and we have created a company that's working on that, actually, and we have a very significant equity over there. We are monitoring how science is evolving, and apparently, there are a few things that are happening right now. I'm not referring only to the positive data of one study that we just saw. I'm more referring to earlier science that is emerging and that seems to have a high promising for most clinical results. We are monitoring that, and if we think that there is a good opportunity, we may re-examine entering.\nThe reason why we exited when we exited is because we felt the science is not ready at that time. Now, I will move it to Angela to answer your second question.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nWe're really proud of our pneumococcal vaccine franchise, and I want to begin with just talking about the great successes that Prevnar 20 has had. Since its launch, even though it's competing with another pneumococcal or other pneumococcal vaccines, we have a 95% market share. We have 97% formulary access. We just recently had an updated ACIP recommendation that is going to enable Prevnar 20 to be used for catch-ups in those that are 65-plus as well as 65-under. I think that that is a great demonstration of the leadership and the legacy that Pfizer has in pneumococcal vaccines or respiratory vaccines, and the tremendous relationships and knowledge that we have in\nthe space. Equally, that plays out in the pediatric space. Even though we are obviously anticipating the launch of pediatric Prevnar 20, in the meantime, Prevnar 13 is competing really well with the PCV15. I think that, again, the relationships that we have, the deep trust and knowledge that physicians have of our pneumococcal vaccine is really standing. It's really helping us competitively. I think that there's great anticipation for the five additional serotypes that you're going to be able to get with Prevnar 20 over 15 in the pediatric space. I think all in all, we're off to an extremely strong start, and we look forward to bringing our next vaccine to the market.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nOkay. Thank you very, very much, Angela. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. I just had kind of a qualitative question on how to think about OpEx dynamics going forward. It seems like we've seen some upward bias in spend at the company, which has kind of coincided with the ramp in COVID sales. I guess for a position where that COVID market resets as we transition past the pandemic, is there an opportunity or should we think about a pullback in OpEx spend associated with that? Should we think about these as more normalized levels of spend, given all these growth initiatives that you're highlighting and investing behind at this point? Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Nice question, and our new CFO clearly has views on this. Dave, what do you think?\n\nDavid Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nChris, good question. Listen, before getting into this, it's probably a little too early for guidance for 2023, but my expectation is that there would not be a pullback in expenses. I think, if anything, what we're fortunate to have is a very robust launch schedule over the next 18 months. We're really focused on investing to make sure that those launches are extremely successful and these medicines get in the hands of patients pretty quickly. If anything, our focus is to get behind these launches, make sure that we execute them flawlessly, and that we see the ramp-up and drive our sales performance, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 timeframe.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nThank you very much, Dave. Operator, the next call, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question. Next is Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nSenior Equity Analyst and Managing Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Just had a few. The slide on long-term growth is really helpful. On the $20 billion on slide nine that you guys have highlighted, can you talk to the long-term contribution that is not COVID? I know there's a long-term piece for COVID, but most investors are focused on kind of the non-COVID drivers. On I&I, looking to next year when we'll have many biosimilars launching for Humira, how much of market disruption do you think we'll see from higher biosimilar volumes and payer preferences? I'm thinking about the effect on the Cibinqo and then the Etrazimod launch specifically, but also XELJANZ and Inflectra. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes, I will ask Angela to answer the second question. On the first one, maybe I can give some clarifications. On the $20 billion, we have included revenues from new launches. This is our estimation for 2030. New launches that are happening either started in 2022, Cibinqo, for example, is there because it started, and then we are adding claims or are about to happen. We have the list in the appendix. In this list, excluding the BD, which we do not count over there, we count on the previous bar where we have the $25 billion of revenues, are summing to $20 billion in our expectation. Just to clarify, this does not include COVID. This is excluding COVID, excluding new things that may\ncome for COVID, excluding new things that may come in antivirals, new vaccines, or combination vaccines, or any of that. These are not part of that. Now, in the other pipeline, which are things that are not in the near-near short term, there are things that will launch after the 18-month period all the way to 2030. Clearly, a lot of these things maybe are not known to you yet, but among the things that are known to you and that should be included over there should be the DLPO1, any combinations between flu and COVID or RSV, our interferon BIIM, and the Lyme vaccines, the RVNAs, the gene therapies that could come. All of that should count towards that bar that we haven't quantified yet\npublicly. Of course, we know what we expect ourselves. Thank you very much. Now, Angela. I end the biosimilars. Yeah.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nThe way to think about it is the biologics market and the oral market is the way we think about it is that it's different. The reason I say that is because if you look at the treatment algorithms and how the biologics are used and how the orals are used, you take XELJANZ as an example, right? Clearly, the label says that you have to have used an anti-TNF before you move on to an oral JAK. I don't think that the competition is across biologics with orals. I think the competition is literally with Humira and the biosimilars of Humira, and then the orals have their role. I use XELJANZ as one example.\nI'll use Etrazimod as another example. There, the benefit of this is that you have an oral therapy that actually can be used earlier line and actually pre-biologic. There, it's the different lines of treatment and the fact that I think there are distinct places where you would use an oral and a distinct place where you would use a biologic, and I don't think that's the crossover.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Angela. We're running a little bit late, so we'll have three more questions, and we'll try to answer them very quickly. Operator, next question.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical, Pfizer\n\nNext is Terrence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn [Managing Director\n\nEquity Research Pharma & Biotech Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering, on PAXLOVID, it looks like there's going to be some doses remaining on the current US contract as we head into 2023. Maybe, I know you talked about how COMIRNATY would work as we move to a commercial market, but maybe just help us think about how that will work here in the US as we transition out of the pandemic here. The second question I had is just any more detail you can share on the Prevnar data in PEDS regarding the serotype coverage. I know that was a question that came out post the phase III data. Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nVery quickly on the PAXLOVID, it is not very different than what is happening with the vaccine. There will be a transition period. We will have to announce the list price. We'll have to work with the US government to transition so that when they stop distributing their, let's say, goods that they have, we will, let's say, start and we have a seamless transition so the market will always become covered. We will give more details given these dynamics, what happens, and when this happens, the transition, and the guidance for next year. Mikael, anything you have to say on the pediatrics?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical, Pfizer\n\nJust very brief that we have had positive studies in US 3 plus 1 schedule, European Union 2 plus 1. After either four or three doses, which is the toddler complete schedule, we covered 20 serotypes in US and 19 in the EU. The totality of data across all endpoints, we believe, clearly speaks to that this is an important vaccine that adds coverage and is likely going to be the vaccine in the near term and for quite many years that has the broadest coverage.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director, Biotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. In terms of RSV, if you could share some thoughts in terms of the velocity of the uptake that you're expecting. Is flu a good barometer, and how quickly do you think, if that's the case, that we could possibly reach flu? With etrasimod, in the previous owner's hands, there were additional opportunities, I believe, Crohn's disease data, phase II, atopic dermatitis, phase III were originally in the timelines for calendar 2022. Will we get some insights on those clinical programs? Thanks.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. I will ask actually for the clinical programs, William, to speak a little bit about it.\n\nWilliam Pao\n\nChief Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Sure. For etrasimod, we have nothing new to update at this time, Chris.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAll right. For RSV, I will say clearly, we think that it could become flu-like. I think all respiratory disease eventually will have coverage like we have right now in flu. The question is how often that will happen, and that will depend on several factors: education, of course, of the people and the physicians, but also the availability of combination programs and products that could significantly bring all three of them together: RSV, COVID, and flu. Operator, next question, please.\nNext, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask two questions on pricing today, if I may. Perhaps first one Albert, I know the COVID vaccine repricing was a very bold decision, and I understand the dynamics around the value proposition, the pandemic versus endemic era pricing, etc. I think the sheer magnitude of the increase is making a lot of investors ask questions around ESG implications, any political blowback, etc. I'm just curious how you guys thought about this very important decision and how you're thinking about the expectation on net pricing. Separately, on PAXLOVID, I know you're running a 10-day trial versus the 5-day course that's currently approved. Does that mean PAXLOVID will effectively become 2x the price once a 10-day course is approved? Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. I can answer both of them. Look, I think what was very bold and the right absolute decision was to price the PAXLOVID during the pandemic at a very, very, very low price. Clearly, the price that we, excuse me, the vaccine at a very, very low price. That was the right thing to do, and we did it, and we maintained that for the years to come. Now that we are coming to the end of this period, as we are moving to very different products, which is very different presentations, which are now we are moving to single instead of mass vial, multi-dose vial, we are pricing the vaccine according to the cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness of the current vaccine, the way that the CDC is pricing it, it is way, way, way below than what the price that we have set at $110 and $130. Also keep in mind that people will not see any difference, and the system will get the benefit of a cost-effective product, and the people will not see any difference because there's no copay.\nNow, on the PAXLOVID, I think it's too early to speak. We haven't announced any price, and we do not know what will be the outcome of the studies or the outcome of a new class that is coming following PAXLOVID. Thank you very much, Uma. Maybe we move to the last question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from David Risinger with SVB Securities.\nYes, thanks very much. My two questions are regarding the core growth, which was 2% operationally in the third quarter. Could you talk about what you're assuming and how we should think about growth prospects in the future, specifically in the fourth quarter since you guided to that in your updated guidance? Second, could you provide an update? I might have missed this. If I did, I apologize. Could you provide an update on your next-gen oral antiviral for COVID? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. One on the 2% operational, excluding COVID, just to make a clarification. If you exclude also the contract manufacturing business that we have that was really COVID-related, it has very increased revenues last year because we were contract manufacturing for BioNTech territories that we do not have to do now because BioNTech took over for their territories, their own manufacturing. In fact, the growth was 4% of our pharmaceutical business, excluding COVID and excluding this piece of contract manufacturing. Now, Angela, based on that, what will you expect to be the growth trajectory?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nChief Commercial Officer and President of Global Biopharmaceuticals Business, Pfizer\n\nWell, we've talked about our five-year CAGR, right, to be 6%. I want to reiterate that that is exactly the track that we're on. Every year does not necessarily have to look identical, but over the five-year period, we're absolutely confident that we're going to develop, we're going to deliver the 6% CAGR.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAll right, thank you very much. With that, I think we are close to bringing our call to a close. Please don't forget to attend our event on 12 December 2024, where we will provide details about our very important new product launches in the next 18 months, and some of our most important pipeline potential new medicines and vaccines. Thank you for joining us today. Have a great rest of your day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's earnings call, and we appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Joining you now.\nGood day, everyone, and welcome to PFIZER'S SECOND QUARTER 2022 EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nThankyou, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to PFIZER'S SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS CALL. We anticipate that this call will last 90 minutes. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO, Dave Denton, our CFO, and Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research, Development, and Medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, Aamir Malik, our Chief Business Innovation Officer, William Pao, our Chief Development Officer, and Doug Lankler, our General Counsel. Materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of Pfizer.com.\nPlease see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on slide three, and additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and in our SEC Forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. I'm proud to say that Pfizer continued to deliver strong operational performance in the second quarter and has increased its full year 2022 operational financial forecast for revenue and adjusted earnings per share, all while operating in a challenging foreign exchange environment.\nCompared with the second quarter of 2021, global revenues were up 53% operationally to $27.7 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 100% operationally to $2.04. Both results exceeded consensus analyst expectat``ions and the quarterly revenue figure represented the largest in Pfizer's history. Key growth drivers for the quarter included PAXLOVID, COMIRNATY, Eliquis, and VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX globally, and our prevalent family of products in the US. Year to date, we have reached an estimated 845 million patients around the world with our innovative medicines and vaccines, which represents a 77% increase from the prior year period. We did all of this while also taking steps to help address broader issues impacting global health, including climate change, equitable access, and the war in Ukraine. Where do we go from here?\nAfter two and a half long years, like everyone else, we would hope that this global health crisis would be over soon. As much as hope is important, hope is not science. Science is telling us that COVID-19 likely will remain a major global healthcare concern for years to come. We believe that Pfizer is well-positioned not only to maintain, but to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. In terms of our commercial leadership, we believe Pfizer's skills are even better suited for operating in open markets than they are for government contracting markets, and will be even more competitive when this transition happens. Recently, Angela announced a new commercial structure that prepares us to provide even better support for the ongoing COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID revenue streams.\nIn terms of our scientific leadership, we expect to further enhance our position through the continued introduction of new innovations, including preparation of new variants of concern and potentially improving the durability of protection. We have been fortunate that most of the variants have led to less severe illness, but there remains the possibility that a future variant could emerge that combines Omicron's contagiousness with the original virus's severity. This is a scenario no one wants to imagine, but one for which we need to be prepared, and that's why we're doing all these investments. That's why also it is critical that Pfizer continues to invest in the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. With this context as a backdrop, let me provide an update on our current COVID-19 offerings and then continue with other products. I will start with COMIRNATY.\nToday, we have shipped more than 36 billion doses of our vaccine to 180 countries and territories around the world. COMIRNATY remains the most utilized COVID-19 vaccine in the markets in which we operate that report market share data. Pfizer's cumulative share of doses administered in these markets has increased from 52% in January of this year to 63% in July of this year. In developed markets, our share has increased from 59% to 68% over the same time period. Next, I would like to briefly touch on the topic of vaccine boosters for the fall. Outside the US, global regulators have issued guidance to advance an Omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine candidate to help address the continued evolution of the virus. As such, Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted data to the European Medicines Agency on the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the company's bivalent Omicron BA.1 adapted vaccine candidate.\nWe also continue to work with health authorities around the globe on regulatory submissions. The US Food and Drug Administration recently asked biopharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, to develop a modified vaccine containing an Omicron BA.4/BA.5 component, and we begin clinical trials with these vaccine candidates. Pfizer is currently proceeding with development of a COVID-19 bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 booster vaccine candidate and is targeting this fall for rollout in the US, subject, of course, to regulatory authorization. Pfizer is well-positioned to satisfy its current contractual obligations and potential demand within its production capacity through the end of the year. Because of our robust manufacturing capabilities, we are planning to deliver both variant vaccines in the fall, pending regulatory approvals. Turning to PAXLOVID, we continue to be very pleased with how things are progressing in the US, as we are seeing several initiatives supporting increased access for eligible patients.\nFirst, the number of facilities with PAXLOVID in supply has continued to increase, with more than 41,000 sites live as of 15 July, an increase of more than 7,000 sites since early May. We are pleased with the FDA's 6 July revision of the emergency use authorization for PAXLOVID that authorized state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe the treatment under certain conditions, thereby expanding access for patients. As you can see on this slide, we have seen a nearly five-fold increase in PAXLOVID utilization since the first quarter. We also continue to retain greater than 90% market share of oral COVID-19 treatments in the US, and are taking a state-by-state approach to engaging key government officials to discuss their access strategies.\nWe are also continuing to work with states to educate consumers, healthcare providers, and pharmacists about the importance of treating all appropriate high-risk patients rather than limiting treatment to the severely immunocompromised and unvaccinated. In spite of the strong growth we have seen in PAXLOVID uptake in the US, due to our and our government's efforts, we estimate that a significant amount of eligible patients outside the US are not yet being treated with a drug and may not know they are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. We believe there remains substantial opportunity to grow PAXLOVID utilization. For international developing markets, we are seeing significant increases in usage across many markets, reflecting the recent wave of BA.4/5 and resulting increases in hospitalization, ICU admissions, and deaths.\nFor example, over the month from 24 June to 24 July, average daily deaths in Europe almost doubled from a low of 0.6 per 1 million people to 1.15 per 1 million. In Japan, they almost tripled from 0.12 per 1 million people to 0.34 per 1 million people. In Australia, they increased from 1.78 per 1 million people to 2.59 per 1 million. While we have less precise numbers on market shares outside the US, our internal estimates indicate that we saw an estimated 116% increase in usage between 24 June and 15 July across international developed markets, where we have supply agreements. We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue the growth outside the US, as physicians become more knowledgeable about PAXLOVID and treat appropriate patients.\nWhile COVID-19 remains top of mind for many people, we are seeing encouraging performance with some of our other innovative products as well, and I wanted to take a moment to highlight two of them. We are very pleased with the success of our US launch of PREVNAR 20 for adults. Second quarter US revenues for our PREVNAR family of vaccines for adults were up 337% operationally, compared with the prior year quarter to $431 million, with PREVNAR 20 representing more than three quarters of the total adult revenue. The great majority of US healthcare networks, IDNs, and retailers who have made formulary decisions have chosen PREVNAR 20 alone as the higher valency pneumococcal vaccine of choice to help protect adults. This has resulted in PREVNAR 20 having a 97% market share.IN\nThis is also the first time that there has been a routine recommendation for PREVNAR for people in the 19 to 64 age group with underlying medical conditions. This group has an increased risk for contracting pneumococcal pneumonia and, unfortunately, has historically been the hardest to activate. Lastly, we believe the simplicity of PREVNAR 20 being the only vaccine that can help protect patients with one dose in one visit is preferable to competitors' offerings. Quarterly revenues for IBRANCE grew 1% in the US compared with the same quarter last year, despite a continued increase in the proportion of patients accessing IBRANCE through assistance programs. This marked the first quarterly revenue uptick in the US since the fourth quarter of 2020, which is an encouraging sign. Total volume in the US increased 3% compared with the year-ago quarter.\nBefore I turn it over to Mikael, I want to touch on some actions we have taken recently to further demonstrate our commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. We recently announced an Accord for a Healthier World. Under this Accord, we are offering all of our patented, high-quality products that are available in the US or the EU on a not-for-profit basis for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries. This includes all future Pfizer products as well. I'm thrilled to say that the first product under this Accord has arrived in Rwanda, with more on the way. Pfizer experts also held a session with 100 Rwandan medical professionals to discuss efficacy, safety, and dosing of this milestone. This is just the first step of Accord implementation, but an important one that will impact many lives.\nWe also recently announced our commitment to achieve the net-zero standard across our value chain by year 2040. This is 10 years ahead of a new voluntary external standard. This includes aiming to reduce our company emissions by 95% and value chain emissions by 90% within the next roughly 18 years. In response to the war in Ukraine, we are donating the equivalent of all profits from sales in Russia to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Our first down payment of $5 million is going to aid global and local NGOs to support humanitarian relief and response efforts, and we will continue to channel these profits to the Ukrainian people until peace is achieved.\nI'm also very proud to share with you that in a recently published report from MSCI, Pfizer's annual ESG rating increased three notches compared with June 2021, going from B to A. This is just the latest external recognition we have received for our commitment to sustainable and ethical business practices. I couldn't be prouder for our colleagues' commitment to good governance practices, quality, and integrity. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After Mikael, Dave will provide financial details on the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2022.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert. I'd like to start by highlighting two recent leadership appointments. I've appointed Annaliesa Anderson to lead vaccine research and development, succeeding Kathrin Jansen, who previously announced her retirement.\nWith more than two decades of biopharma R&D experience, Lisa most recently served as CSO for bacterial research and hospital. Over the last two years, she has led a team of infectious disease biologists that designed and delivered PAXLOVID to an emergency use authorization. Under her leadership, we also advanced several bacterial vaccine programs into clinical development and approval. I've also named Charlotte Allerton, CSO for anti-infective, a new research unit. Creating this new research unit allows us to expand our focus beyond medicines that typically are used in hospitals. Charlotte is an esteemed scientist who will broaden our antiviral strategies with additional efforts in antibacterial and antifungal science and medicines. Charlotte has been our head of medicine design, most notably co-leading the discovery and development of PAXLOVID, and will continue in that role as well.\nI have had the privilege to work closely with Lisa and Charlotte for more than 10 years and have been continuously impressed by them as world-class scientists in their respective fields of expertise. Both have demonstrated good product-hunting skills and a sound business mindset. I'm looking forward to working with them in their new roles. Let's begin with COVID-19. The pandemic continues to evolve into a disease which is causing significant disease burden, including high rates of acute disease, medical care utilization, hospitalization, and deaths during the entire year. A growing number of patients affected by acute COVID infections are developing chronic disease and suffering from long COVID symptoms affecting multiple organs such as the lung, heart, kidney, brain, and the vascular system. We have seen major waves of variants of concern emerge quickly, become dominant, then be superseded by the next variant.\nOmicron and its sublineages are the most antigenically distinct compared to prior variants of concern, most more transmissible, and show evidence of partial immune escape from existing vaccines. As the composition of SARS-CoV-2 changes, it is essential we advance new approaches to extend the level of protection that COMIRNATY originally conveyed. In a clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of mono and bivalent Omicron BA.1 modified vaccines administered as a fourth dose in more than 1,900 participants over age 55. We're also evaluating different doses of mono and bivalent BA.1 in participants 18 to 55 years of age. While we saw promising responses to both mono and bivalent versions in the over-55 population, we move forward with bivalent following guidance from regulators.\nThe BA.1 vaccine candidate elicited a superior immune response for BA.1 compared to the current version of the vaccine, a serial response rate which exceeded non-inferiority, and utilization activity which increased substantially. The BA.1 vaccine utilized wild type and delta similarly to the current version of the vaccine, suggesting that the Omicron modified version maintained response for the ancestral and other viral variants. Based on these data and following guidance from regulators, we have completed regulatory submissions in Europe, UK, and Canada for the 30-microgram bivalent vaccine in individuals 12 and older, and plan submissions in other markets soon. The data also show this vaccine candidate utilized Omicron BA.4 and 5, though to a lesser extent than BA.1. This suggested a need to develop both a BA.1 modified vaccine and a BA.4-5 modified vaccine.\nWe studied BA.4-5 monovalent and bivalent booster candidates in mice and found a substantial increase in utilization responses to all Omicron variants of concern. Neutralizing titers against BA.4-5 increased 11-fold for the monovalent and 4.8-fold for the bivalent compared to monovalent BA.1 vaccine. These data were shared at the recent FDA Advisory Committee meeting as a potential surrogate to help expedite development of a BA.4-5 vaccine. We plan to submit the BA.4-5 bivalent vaccine candidate for emergency use authorization in the US in preparation for the fall booster campaign. To adapt more rapidly, we've agreed with FDA that this submission will be based on safety and immunogenicity data generated in adults with an Omicron modified BA.1 vaccine, and supported by BA.4-5 bivalent-specific preclinical data and BA.4-5 bivalent chemistry, manufacturing, and controls data.\nThis strategy is bolstered by previous experience showing that overall responses have been similar between human clinical and mouse data, our clinical experience with beta and Omicron modified vaccine candidate, and by leveraging our mRNA platform and manufacturing experience for the current vaccine. To support future potential US licensure and global registration, we plan to initiate a clinical study to evaluate the BA.4-5 bivalent vaccine. The clinical study design is under discussion with FDA. We aspire to continue leading with the science, and are working to identify vaccines that will help provide strong and durable protection as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. We aim to deliver a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that can provide durable antibody and T-cell immune protection against severe disease and hospitalization for at least one year.\nWe plan to take a stepwise approach by designing and testing different candidates that engage multiple arms of the immune system, including antibodies and T-cells. Yesterday we announced the start of a phase II study evaluating a bivalent mRNA vaccine candidate, which consists of RNA encoding novel enhanced pre-fusion spike proteins for the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain and an Omicron variant. The enhanced spike protein encoded from the mRNA has been modified with the aim of increasing the magnitude and breadth of antibody neutralization response that could better protect against COVID-19. We project delivering key clinical data this fall. We plan to initiate the proof-of-concept study with a potential pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate by the end of the year. This combines the super-stabilized spike sequences with a T-cell enhancing construct, aiming to extend durability of protection against severe disease and new emerging SARS-CoV-2 viral variants. Now, turning to PAXLOVID.\nLast month, we submitted a new drug application to US FDA seeking approval for the treatment of COVID-19 in both vaccinated and unvaccinated adults and pediatric patients 12 years and over weighing at least 40kg, and at high risk for progression to severe illness. We anticipate a PDUFA date in the first quarter of 2023. We plan to generate further data in those who are immunocompromised, hospitalized with severe COVID-19, and at increased risk for poor outcome due to the disease, or who are pregnant. We also are considering multiple collaborative studies to evaluate potential treatment for long COVID. Finally, we're working with FDA to finalize a protocol to study patients who may be in need of retreatment. According to CDC, a brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection in some people.\nWe believe the occurrence of COVID-19 rebound is uncommon and not uniquely associated with any specific treatment. At this time, cases are being reported at a rate consistent with the EPIC-HR trial. Turning now to flu. We know that currently available vaccines are not optimal in addressing the unmet need, as each year many people are infected, hospitalized, and die, resulting in tremendous public health and economic impact. In part, this is because the flu vaccine development cycle is inefficient, and even when the current seasonal vaccine strains match circulating strains well, they typically confer only 40% to 60% protection. Potential advantages of the mRNA platform include a shortened timeline to enable a quicker response each season, improved strain matching, faster and more reliable manufacturing, and broader immune response from both antibody and T-cells. The latter is needed particularly in older adults.\nBased on our experience with COVID-19, T-cell responses appear to be critical for the protection against severe disease and hospitalization in infectious viral disease. Here we show phase II T-cell data for our quadrivalent mod mRNA flu vaccine candidate in subjects 65 and older. We believe this is the first evidence of a flu vaccine candidate inducing substantial responses for both CD4 and CD8 T-cells. On the left, at day seven, the CD4 T-cell response was more than twofold for all four flu strains for our vaccine compared to a current high-dose vaccine now recommended in the US for adults 65 and older. Over half the cohort receiving our vaccine candidate had a more than two fold response. On the right, at day seven, the CD8 T-cell response and responder rates were greater for all four strains for our vaccine candidate versus the comparator.\nOur belief is that these encouraging T-cell responses, combined with higher seroconversion rates for flu A strains, which are the most predominant circulating strains and have pandemic potential, may translate into improved efficacy over current seasonal flu vaccines, particularly in those 65 and older. Based on these data, we plan to initiate a phase III efficacy study this year. We are excited to share that new data on our oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, two abstracts on twice daily danuglipron, and one on our once daily candidate known as 1532, have been accepted for the European Association for the Study of Diabetes conference in September. These investigational medicines were designed in-house by Pfizer's innovative chemistry and discovery teams. In a phase I study in adults with type 2 diabetes, after only six weeks of treatment, 1532 drug robustly reduced mean daily glucose to almost near normal levels.\nParticipants also experienced weight loss of up to 5kg compared with 2kg for placebo. We believe this to be a potentially best-in-class profile across both injectables and orals. Similar changes in body weight were observed in participants with non-diabetic obesity. 1532 is characterized by favorable once daily pharmacokinetics, low risk for drug-drug interaction, robust efficacy across multiple metabolic endpoints, and GLP-1 receptor agonist class-like tolerability, which overall encourage us to plan for a phase II study to pick the winning candidate prior to a potential phase III study start. These development programs may lead to potential indications in type 2 diabetes, obesity NASH, and cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. Over the 12 past months, we have built a strong inflammation and immunology portfolio with diverse products to help address multiple drivers of disease and unmet need.\nCIBINQO was approved for atopic dermatitis in adults and last week received priority review designation in the US for adolescents 12 to 18 years. We are nearing a regulatory submission for etrasimod in ulcerative colitis. We have submitted regulatory application in the US, Europe, and UK for ritlecitinib for alopecia areata, and are awaiting acceptances. We also plan to start a phase III study of ritlecitinib in vitiligo this year. We are pleased to now share promising new updated data from our anti-interferon beta monoclonal antibody in specialized rheumatology. Patients with dermatomyositis show elevated type 1 interferon gene signature in blood, skin, and muscle, correlating with disease activity in skin.\nAs we continue our development of these candidates, a potential breakthrough therapy for hard-to-treat dermatomyositis, which attacks skin and muscles, we believe it may have the ability to address a broader set of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, possibly including polymyositis and lupus. On our third quarter 2021 call, I shared data from our ongoing phase II dermatomyositis study focused on skin inflammation, showing significant reduction in disease activity when compared with placebo in just three months of treatment. Now, both doses met the primary efficacy endpoints in skin-predominant disease. The disease also manifests with progressively debilitating muscle weakness and fatigue. Early data suggest that in a small cohort of patients with muscle-predominant disease, our candidate resulted in numerically better efficacy score across all key muscle endpoints, including patient-reported outcomes after three weeks. We plan to submit the data for presentation once the study completes.\nNow, a promising update on elranatamab, our investigational B-cell maturation antigen CD3 targeted bispecific antibody. At EBSCO, we presented data from a phase I trial in people with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma whose disease is refractory to at least one agent in each of the three major classes of medications approved for the disease. We saw a confirmed overall response rate of 64%, and 35% of patients achieved stringent complete response or complete response. More than half who received prior BCMA-directed therapy, such as antibody drug conjugate or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, achieved a response. Responders' probability of being event-free at nine months was 77%. elranatamab elicited durable minimal residual disease or MRD negativity, meaning no disease was detected after treatment in all available patients who experienced a complete response or stringent complete response.\nMolecular responses were durable as well, with 62% of those complete responders documented to have MRD negativity at more than six months, including two patients who were MRD negative beyond 18 months. MagnetisM-1 results and emerging data from MagnetisM-3, which is studying triple-class refractory multiple myeloma, support further development across a broader program with potential registration-enabling studies, MagnetisM-5 in patients with double-class exposed multiple myeloma, and MagnetisM-7 in newly diagnosed post-transplant patients with multiple myeloma. There is potential for deep and durable results that can be broadly accessible to patients due to off-the-shelf, subcutaneous, and convenient dosing. The efficacy and safety profile we've seen to date in a challenging patient population supports advancement into earlier lines of treatment. Finally, here is a snapshot of select milestones for this year, showing healthy progress in the pipeline.\nIt was an important quarter for COVID execution, and we look forward to sharing complete readouts from anti-interferon beta and the Mod flu candidate before the end of the year. Thank you for your attention. Let me turn it over to Dave.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael, and good morning, everyone. As this is my first call as CFO, I thought I would set the stage for the next chapter of Pfizer and our relentless focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Over the past few years, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities have expanded significantly, and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever. It's clear to me the company is uniquely positioned for both growth and at the same time enhancing financial returns. As we look to the future of the company, we are focused on three primary areas to drive significant shareholder value.\nFirst and foremost is our continued emphasis and investment in science and innovation. We are investing internally and externally to create breakthrough medicines, deploying more than $50 billion in this area in the past three years alone. Our second priority is maintaining and growing Pfizer's dividend, paying out more than $25 billion to shareholders over this period. We recognize that our dividend represents an important component of returns for our investors. Finally, from time to time, we will return capital to shareholders through value-enhancing share repurchases. Over the past three years, the company has allocated nearly $9 billion in this area. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value will be a major focus, and I believe that all three areas will contribute to our success. More recently, in year-to-date, we deployed more than $12 billion into innovation, paid dividends of $4.5 billion, and repurchased $2 billion worth of our shares.\nThis demonstrates an ongoing commitment to our robust capital deployment framework. With that, now let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I will confine my remarks largely to adjusted and operational growth figures. Turning to the income statements, revenues increased 53% operationally in the second quarter of 2022. These results were driven by momentum in PAXLOVID sales, strong sales of the COVID-19 vaccine, and underlying strength from a number of our key products. Excluding PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY, biopharma product revenues grew operationally by 2% compared to the prior year. In-line products, XELJANZ and CHANTIX, were impacted by labeling changes and a global pause in shipments, respectively, while IBRANCE continued to transition into a new COVID normal market environment. PC1, our contract manufacturing business, grew 89% operationally in the second quarter of 2021 and therefore faced a tough comparison versus last year, with PC1 declining by 25% operationally.\nBringing that all together, Pfizer's non-COVID-related revenues grew by 1% operationally in the second quarter. Adjusted cost of sales dollars grew more slowly than revenue, resulting in gross margin rate expansion of 570 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. This improvement in gross margin is largely due to the impact of higher margin PAXLOVID sales, partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine sales, and the impact of a $450 million write-off of COVID-related inventory that had expired or is expected to expire. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we chose to manufacture and hold excess stock to ensure we can meet any global health demand for products if an extreme need were to arise. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the second quarter grew by 7% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY, and higher healthcare reform fees.\nThe 27% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q2 was primarily driven by investments in multiple late-stage clinical programs, including programs to both prevent and treat COVID-19, and costs to develop recently acquired programs. The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter of 15.4% declined by 170 basis points versus last year, driven by a favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. As a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.73 grew by 77%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04 grew 92%. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 100% in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements continued to dampen our results, negatively impacting revenues and adjusted earnings per share by 7% and $0.08 per share. Let's move on to our 2022 guidance.\nGiven our strong second quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for both revenues and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year, we are increasing our operational revenue expectations by $2 billion and operational adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations by $0.24. Unfortunately, given additional US dollar strengthening since we last updated guidance in early May, foreign exchange negatively impacts revenues by approximately $2 billion, leaving our reported revenue guidance range unchanged at $98 to $102 billion. This represents an operational growth rate of 29% at the midpoint compared to 2021, a 200 basis point improvement over prior expectations. The improvement in our operational adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook of $0.24 is also negatively impacted by foreign exchange movements, compressing EPS by $0.19.\nThe net impact of these cross currents allows the company to raise the low end of its adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.05 to $6.30 to $6.45 a share. This represents 65% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021. Regarding our COVID-19 related revenues, we continue to expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, unchanged compared to the prior guidance provided on 3 May, despite the impact of approximately $1 billion of incremental negative foreign exchange. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance unchanged, again, despite an incremental $300 million headwind due to FX. Our non-COVID related revenues are absorbing approximately $700 million of impact from negative foreign exchange. Now, given the seasonality that we expect, I'd also like to give you some color on the expected cadence of these COVID-related revenues across the second half.\nBased on current guidance for COMIRNATY, we expect approximately 25% of second half sales in Q3 and 75% of sales in Q4, driven by expected deliveries of Omicron adapted vaccines in Q4, again, subject to regulatory approval. Conversely, for PAXLOVID, we expect approximately 60% of sales in Q3 and 40% in Q4. With that, let me give you some detail on changes in our cost and expense guidance. We are decreasing our expected adjusted SI&A spend by $300 million across the range to $12.2 to 13.2 billion. Additionally, we are also increasing our guidance for adjusted R&D expense by $500 million at the low end only, with the new range of $11.5 to 12 billion, reflecting incremental investments in multiple programs, including mRNA vaccine programs outside of COVID-19, and other programs.\nWe are also slightly reducing our expected effective tax rate on adjusted income by 50 basis points to approximately 15.5%. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases that we completed in March of 2022. In closing, it's an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year set the stage for long-term shareholder value creation. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chris and start the Q&A session.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nThanks, Dave. At this time, let's start the Q&A session. Please limit yourself to one question per caller. If you have additional questions, we ask you to please get back in the queue, and we'll address as many questions as we have time to do so.\nIf you have any remaining questions afterwards, the R&D team will be available to answer those questions for you as well. Chelsea, if you could queue up the callers, please.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and then the number one on your telephone keypad. We will pause a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first questions come from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Great.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nBiopharma Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. I appreciate all the disclosures there at the end, but I wanted to follow up on the COMIRNATY guide. Again, obviously, you had some incremental contracts that got signed since the last time you gave guidance. You highlighted sort of the FX headwind.\nI'm just trying to tease out exactly, kind of explicitly, what you're assuming around potentially, I guess, EU doses getting pushed into 2023, and just some additional color there if you can, please. Thank you.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThis is Dave. Carter, this is Dave. Thank you for the question. Let me walk you through the guidance for this year from a vaccine perspective. As you well know, we had a guidance of $32 billion to begin with as we entered Q1, come out of Q1. There are really three moving parts as I think about our guidance for the year. One is we do have an incremental contract from the USG for 105 million doses this year, which is an uptick to that guidance. Secondly, we're experiencing headwinds from an FX perspective to the tune of $1 billion since Q1, but for the year, really $2 billion in that product alone.\nThird, as I just articulated, the cadence of deliveries in the back half is really skewed to Q4. With that, some ex-US deliveries could move from November into December of the calendar year. If that were to occur, given our one-month lag from a reporting perspective, those revenues would fall into Q1 of 2023. I do not know whether that's going to happen, but I'm planning that it might happen. Therefore, I've probably been conservative in my approach and my outlook to the revenue guide for that specific medicine.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nOkay. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotech Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and all the color on the call today. I guess mine is on PAXLOVID.\nMaybe you could talk a little bit about, I know while you said there's low rate in line with clinical trials for rebounding, maybe that's underreported, and you outlined your plan for new trials. What are you doing to potentially decrease that potential for rebounding in the new studies? Are you extending and doubling the dose? Maybe some trends, give us more color on some trends that you're seeing on PAXLOVID. I know you mentioned globally, we're hearing in some states it's more limited versus others. Maybe just give us more color there on trends you're seeing on access. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. William, why don't you speak a little bit about the program that we have and rebounding? Angela, you speak a little bit about the trend of the revenues and the uptake.\n\nWilliam Pao\n\nChief Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. Thanks, Albert. Thanks for the question.\nAs we reported earlier in the EPIC-HR study, we did see a single-digit percent of potential rebound, but we also saw it in the placebo arm with a very similar rate. Since then, we have seen other studies coming out, including from the Mayo Clinic, Case Western, Kaiser Permanente, and others showing data that's very consistent with ours in terms of single-digit percent of rebound. It's also been seen not only with placebo, but also with competitor antivirals. Internally, we also have data from real-world data as well as additional pharmacovigilance data showing, again, that it's a very similar low percentage rate of recurrence. That said, we are working with the FDA to finalize plans for a trial in which we would treat such patients. We're still deciding on the final outline of that.\nIn addition, as Mikael outlined, we'll be looking at other cohorts of patients, for example, immunocompromised patients who have a large unmet medical need. In that setting, we will be looking at, for example, 5, 10, and 15 days of dosing to determine the optimum dose regimen for those patients.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, William. I need to say that we are very serious about the PAXLOVID, and we are looking very diligently at all the anecdotal reports that are coming.\nAll the data, I repeat, all the data, our internal data that we are detecting rebounds by proactively checking viral loads, or the external data that have been reported through pharmacovigilance to us, or through studies that have been performed by third parties, very reputable third parties like Kaiser Permanente or Mayo Clinic, they are consistently that this is low single digit, actually less than 1% in the external studies. It was, as we repeated, around 2% in the methodology we used in ours, and very consistent with the numbers of the placebo. Although we try to see if there is a need to do something about it, seriously, we can't find any data set other than anecdotal reports. Also, I want to emphasize that even the anecdotal reports, they are all indicating that it is mild.\nWe do not have any rebound that is more serious, right? Clearly, we have not identified any single case that we have resistance to PAXLOVID. We are looking into it, and William said that we are going to run also some studies. We are discussing our protocols with FDA to see if retreatment of those cases could help. So far, our conclusion, although we are looking a lot, is it is a very small percentage, similar to COVID placebo or COVID other antivirals, and with very mild symptoms. Angela, what about the trends internationally and in the US, if you want?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nGroup President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group\n\nGlobally, I think that we are doing really well, and we are making excellent progress. We have made and manufactured 30 million doses, and we have delivered 23 and a half of those doses.\nI think that the contracting is going well, the demand and expectations for the need for PAXLOVID is definitely up there. Maybe let me use some US examples where we have a little bit more data and where things, I think, are going particularly well. The US actually contracted 10.8 million doses with us so far, and 7.4 million doses of all of those have already been allocated to all the states. I think that gives you a sense of how much demand is coming in from all of the states. Every single week, our utilization of PAXLOVID has also increased. In fact, most recently, we hit an all-time high of 389,000 doses of PAXLOVID that were used just in one week. That gives you a sense of sort of the increase and the momentum.\nWhat's really driving this is obviously the education, the familiarity, and the experience now of physicians as well as patients, but also the excellent work that is being done at the federal as well as the state level in terms of education and utilization. I want to call out in particular the Test to Treat program that I think has been particularly effective and very positive. To date, more than 41,000 pharmacies are now Test to Treat centers. That means that just gives access to a tremendous amount of the population to be able to access PAXLOVID. Also, recently, pharmacists are now able to prescribe PAXLOVID within certain limitations. Over and above whatever states and the federal government are doing, Pfizer is also aggressively and assertively supporting education. Actually, we have leveraged the entire Pfizer field force to provide education. We're running webinars.\nTo date, we've reached over 300,000 healthcare professionals, as well as 80,000 pharmacists, just to give you a sense of the extent and the breadth of reach that we have accomplished. All of that is also complemented by public service announcements about driving awareness of a treatment, but also the individual risk that each patient could carry and making them aware that they could be potential candidates for PAXLOVID. I think with all of these efforts that have gone on and that we're continuing, we feel really good about the momentum of PAXLOVID, the utilization of PAXLOVID, and the benefit that PAXLOVID can bring, particularly in a time when there are surges going on around the entire world.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Robyn. Next question, please, Chelsea.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question.\nI had a two-part one on your mRNA seasonal flu vaccine program. I was just wondering if you had any HAI titer data that you can share from the trial. We saw the CD, the T cell data, but again, wondering if there's any titer data you can share. Anything on the safety tolerability there, is it fair to assume that the profile is similar to COMIRNATY, or are there any particular differences you'd like to call out? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much, Terence. Mikael, why don't you take this question?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nYeah. We will share details in upcoming conference, but I can just give a little bit more color. As you know, the highest medical burden and hospitalization occurs in the 65-plus, where the A strains are the most dominant.\nWe had very strong titers against the A strains, exceeding what you would see with the current recommended vaccines. We are very bullish about our ability with mRNA to induce both strong antibody response and CD4 and CD8 T cells, which are not induced by current standard of care. This is the reason why we are sharing today that we're announcing two phase III studies.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Terence. Next question, please.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nTolerability, sorry. Tolerability of this 30mcg, sorry, Terence. I didn't note that first. Tolerability is, of course, supported by our billions of doses of the platform in COVID. On top of that, in older adults, the 30mcg has a very good acceptance, the main patient group. I believe it's going to be excellent and very similar to other available flu vaccines.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nMikael, you spoke about A; you didn't speak about the B strains in the immunogenicity results. They were similar to the current high dose of Quadrivalent.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I didn't mention the B strain. We noted, in general, a lower response to B strains with both standard of care, and we edged on the lower side with our vaccine. That's why I was so encouraged to see the unique T cell response against the B cell strain. The totality of that data makes us encouraged that we will have a strong product for both A and B.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThe thing how confident we feel it is that although the regulatory pathway, it is just to demonstrate non-inferiority in immunogenicity, we are going for an efficacy trial.\nThe trial that we announced yesterday is going to measure real efficacy in flu, which we believe that we expect, of course, science is unpredictable, but we expect to win with flying colors. Let's go to the next one.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question and a clarification. The question's on PAXLOVID. I know the Test to Treat program from the Biden administration has been a big driver of volumes. My question is, how would the demand dynamics change when we transition to a commercial purchasing model? Let's say the Test to Treat is still in place. Would there be any change or not?\nMy clarification is, Mikael, I think some comments you might have made at a recent non-transcripted meeting on the TL1A program and whether there's been a signal consistent across the phase II A and phase II B. Could you please clarify that? Thank you very much. I'm referring to the interim analysis that happened recently.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Angela, what do you think? If we go to open commercial market, do you think that we will be better or worse off with PAXLOVID?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nGroup President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group",
    "content2": "Yeah. I think that there are elements that we will be able to implement in the commercial market that currently we don't. For sure, you've just heard me share comments about the efforts that we've put into PAXLOVID already here in the US and ex-US, right?\nThe execution and the support of education, support of our entire field forces, support of retail, support of patients through education, again, and PSAs. All that will continue. I think what happens in a full commercial launch is that you will have multiple distributors and multiple points of distribution throughout the entire country. You will have stocking by every pharmacy and pharmacist, and various points of use. I think that in a commercial setting, actually, you'll be able to reach a much broader set of channels than we currently even do today. I think that's one difference. The second difference is that what you can do from a commercial perspective will also look different. Remember today, we're under an EUA. While we can do a lot of education, key things like sampling cannot be done in an EUA.\nThat's going to be an example of another difference that will happen post-EUA. I think finally, even if you think about consumer education, today, we have really limited ourselves to unbranded and sort of disease awareness education. Again, in a commercial setting, you could support through branded education and talk a lot more about the product. All of these are things that actually Pfizer does and the commercial organization of Pfizer does really well. This is our sweet spot. I think that we look forward to building on top of what the government has been doing, which has been really excellent, and building on top of that to do more, and to support greater initiatives across the country.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Angela. Well said. What about TL1A, Mikael?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nBriefly, this is our internally discovered antibody against TL1A, a member of the TNF superfamily that is associated with inflammatory diseases. Yes, we have consistent, robust efficacy for all common UC patients, and very strong efficacy consistent across the trial for a prospectively defined precision biomarker. Tolerability was very good. This is induction data. Later this year, we will have maintenance data. As we get those data set, we will decide about next step. Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nLet's go to the next call.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thank you for taking my question, and congrats on the early oral grip one data, especially for once daily. My question is, how much incremental data are we going to see in September from the one you presented today?\nHow soon can you move this agent into bigger trials? How do you see the biggest differentiation versus the oral semaglutide at this point? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nMikael may be also going to take that question.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nYeah. We are very excited about this new data set, 1532, that you will see at the EASD meeting in Stockholm in September. There will be additional data, and I think you will find HbA1c very encouraging, although this was a short study. I think compared to oral semaglutide, the differentiation is substantial. This is a true small molecule that can be given as a once-a-day. It's completely independent on fasting or meal concordance. I think you will be able to reach higher effects on both glucose, as well as on weight reduction.\nAs I reported now, we were almost at 100mg/dL reduction over four to six weeks and 5kg. We have not yet optimized the titration to even higher doses. We are very encouraged by what we see. We are going to share with regulators soon our next trial set and move swiftly to allow us to pick the winner and the regimen for a potential phase III study to come after the phase II B.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. Also, to add that this is for us clearly a high-priority project. We have a designation within the company, what we call the light speed project, a project of significant value to patients and, as a result, also significant economic value, where we give this designation and we move them with the speed of light, and we overinvest to make sure that we de-risk and we move fast.\nI review personally on a biweekly, on the bimonthly basis, the progress of this program. That is going to be one of them. Thank you very much. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. I would love for your perspective on the provision for Medicare to negotiate directly with manufacturers as part of the now coined Inflation Reduction Act. We have press reports reporting a deal between Manchin and Schumer. What's the potential long-term impact on your R&D and innovation? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. I'm disappointed with what I'm reading in the newspapers. Of course, we can't know exactly what will happen because we have seen that this situation is very volatile.\nEverything that they are reporting, they are going to implement a price setting. In reality, it is not a price negotiation because they are forcing their will by implementing a 95% tax according to previous guidance. That will cost the industry significantly. We estimate $270 billion over 10 years. There is a positive provision there, but they are reducing the out-of-pocket cost for the patients. That's a significant one, but it's too little and too late. They could do way more because that will cost them 10% of the $270 billion that they are going to collect. They are basically not doing that to alleviate patients' cost because they could give all the money and then make significant, significant difference to the patients. They're just giving a part of that, and they won't even start, if I understood well, from year 2025.\nAlthough the out-of-pocket is a very positive provision, the rest is a provision that I think will force the industry to reduce R&D if it goes the way that they are suggesting. Other than that, I don't have anything to add. We will wait to see what exactly in reality that means, and we'll go from there. Also, I want to say it is very disappointing that they are choosing to single out one industry. Everything in this bill, from what I understand, tax, all of that is affecting everyone, but then there are specific measures to affect only the pharma industry, particularly when we are out of a pandemic or this industry has proven the value that it brings to public health and to the global economy.\nWe would be in a very different point in this global economy if we didn't have the investments and the thriving life sciences sector. They are choosing to single out this industry. I think it's wrong, and I hope that reason will prevail when this discussion goes to Congress. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question here. Just curious if some of the setbacks that we've seen in the CD47 space change your view on the market opportunity for your Trillium assets. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Why don't we go to William?\n\nWilliam Pao\n\nChief Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Louise. We saw the news the other day.\nInternally, we remain confident in our program with Trillium, and we proceed with the programs that we are planning, and we'll let the data speak for itself when they come out.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with SVB Securities.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, SVB Securities\n\nYes. Thanks very much, and congratulations on the performance. I wanted to ask a little bit about VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX. The performance was below our and consensus expectations. If you could speak to that and also talk about the sequential prospects going forward, i.e., has the product peaked out in the US, and how should we think about future prospects relative to the sales that you booked? Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nNo, thank you, David. Angela, what do you think?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nGroup President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group\n\nWell, we continue to be really pleased with how VYNDAQEL is doing.\nIf you look at just from a diagnosis perspective, quarter over quarter, year over year, we continue to do a really great job of effectively finding and identifying who the ATTR-CM patients are, diagnosing them, and then bringing them onto therapies. In this quarter, we have reached an all-time high of a 40% diagnosis rate. I think that this is well beyond what we thought we would be able to do in the timeframe that we have had. We continue to believe in the growth that this product has. The real-world data that we have been generating now, and the overall survival benefits, are really compelling. The fact that we are the only product being able to demonstrate these benefits, I think, speaks well to how we'll continue to be able to build in this market despite competition that will arise.\nI think what you're referring to in terms of the impact and the expectations really is a one-time effect, and it was in Japan. This was a very specific price decrease that was planned and driven by regulation. When VYNDAQEL was launched in Japan, again, based on pricing regulation in the country that was specific to the country, it was a much higher price than any other country we had. By regulation, again, the 75% price decrease that we're seeing is a function of that. The underlying growth of VYNDAQEL in Japan is really strong. We had just in the first half of 2022, 69% volume growth. We had 32% year-over-year new patient starts.\nHopefully, this gives you a sense that the net revenue impacts you see are, in fact, not a reflection of the demand and the true underlying demand, whether it's in the US or ex-US.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Thank you, Angela. Thank you, David. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. A question on your RSV vaccine. There doesn't seem to be anything but a brief mention of the program in the press release or the slides, and really nothing in prepared remarks, but we have phase III data results coming out very soon. I'm wondering why. Really, my main question is why you recently changed the primary endpoint in the phase III trial, including downsizing of the trial, and that comes on top of the delay in readout as announced earlier this year.\nIf I can slip one in on your quadrivalent mRNA flu, when would we likely see results from your phase III that you're starting up?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. Both questions go to you. I think the first question, Tim, was for RSV, right? Yes. Or any others?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nYeah. We have made great progress in the RSV adult trial. As you know, we ran it through two different seasons in the northern and southern hemisphere to make sure we had good patient experience and cases. Things are looking good for a readout that will come soon. I remain very positive about RSV adult based on our phase II challenge data that was stellar and the role this particular antigen that we're targeting plays. As you know, we're the only one that is targeting the two forms of this prefusion. You also asked about mRNA flu.\nYes, as Albert mentioned, we are going big here with an efficacy study. We are inquiry about the data we're seeing. We think it's a unique data set, and we plan to soon embark on a phase III after proper dialogue with regulators. Of course, this is an event trial, but if the season is robust, which you can never know, we would expect the phase III to read out next year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nExactly. Also, I'm sorry if we gave the impression that RSV is not important to us. It's extremely important. There is no better good news. This is why we didn't mention it much, but it still remains the very good news that the previous studies were extremely strong and that the current studies are progressing very well.\nWe have very high confidence, absent a surprise, that we will launch next year a very robust product, both in adults and in maternal, the maternal version. Both studies are progressing very well. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just had a couple on PAXLOVID real quick. Can you give us an update on the number of countries you're in contract discussions with? I'm just thinking relative to the start of the year. Related, what's been the biggest contributor of supply expansion in Q2, and when do you think you guys will be fully, fully normalized? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nLet's go to Angela for the number of countries and where we are with that.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nGroup President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group\n\nYep.\nWe are in contract with a significant number of countries at this point. Maybe I can talk about it from a dose perspective. More than 35 million treatment courses have already been contracted with a number of countries. This is what we publicly disclose. There are additional doses that I can't talk about because either the country didn't want us to disclose them publicly, or we're in the middle of negotiations with them. I think to answer your question, since we last left off, we have made progress with our contracting. I think maybe what's more important to clarify is just that the approach that countries are taking to contract with us is just really different to where we were in COMIRNATY. In COMIRNATY, they were interested in securing large amounts of doses upfront, but that's, in fact, not the case here in PAXLOVID.\nThe reason being that, number one, they're being prudent with how they are ordering. They are able to do that because they know that we have the manufacturing capacity and that we can pivot as we need. The countries are also trying to manage inventory and not to have too much aged product lying around. I think that this is what's driving the more smaller, more frequent contracting rather than big, big contracts, like you saw in COMIRNATY. The other thing I will also say is, the reason why I'm talking in doses rather than specific countries is because we're also working with supranational organizations who are acting on behalf of multiple countries. Think Global Fund, think UNICEF. These are, in addition to the bilaterals, also important organizations who are helping us to supply and bring doses into the countries.\nI think all in all, great progress, and I think you should expect to see that this is one of these things that will just keep inching away because of how countries want to manage the inventory and the supply.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Angela. Also, because you had a question on supplier ramp-up, we have done tremendous, tremendous progress on that field. Actually, we have been able to reduce dramatically the lead time, so how much time is needed for manufacturing, and we have improved dramatically our yields. Supply is not an issue. Actually, we moved almost everything in-house now in terms of API and finished product. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nLet's go to the next question. Your next questions come from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just one follow-up on the PAXLOVID comments.\nAs we move, I guess, from some of these large government orders that we saw with the US, etc., earlier this year to maybe these more kind of on-demand, smaller contracts, how do we think about what the impact that has on pricing? I think you were giving some volume-based discounts before. Just help us, I guess, as we think about kind of 2023 and beyond, what pricing does for that business. The bigger question I had was just on IBRANCE dynamics. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks you're seeing signs of a recovery for your business there. I'm just interested in how you kind of see the balance of just overall market dynamics relative to the competitive landscape with, obviously, one of your competitors with an adjuvant indication. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much.\nChris, we do not provide, let's say, forward-looking projections on pricing. Particularly, every time I speak about pricing, it's becoming big news. I want to make sure that we respect that. I know what you are asking, and I can give a very high-level answer. Clearly, we are providing special pricing when we are contracting very, very big quantities with governments. That's also the incentive for the government to buy big quantities because the price is really, really very attractive. If we move to normal market, the prices would reflect, both in vaccines and in antivirals, the prices of similar value, similar technology products that are out there. Clearly, also when you move to private commercial markets, the complexities are getting way, way higher. We will need to go to single doses in the vaccines, so manufacturing complexities are very higher.\nWe need to have distribution to small distribution centers, including physician offices. All of that creates a very big complexity, but also could be taken into consideration as we price our products at that time. I want to emphasize that also those present significant opportunities for us because the open market is way more complex, way more diverse. You have millions of customers rather than one or two. This plays to our strengths in terms of having global presence, or within the US, dramatic presence in every single territory of the country with thousands of people that are calling physicians, hospitals, accounts, payers' accounts, etc., etc. It is something that if we see a turn into this market, also we will see us being able to compete more from a position of strength than now. As regards to IBRANCE, Angela. Sure.\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nGroup President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group\n\nWell, as you say, the metastatic breast cancer CDK4/6 market is incredibly competitive, yet I will emphasize that IBRANCE continues to be the leading CDK4/6 inhibitor. In fact, we have a 74% market share across all patients in first-line therapy. I think that this number has been pretty consistent because we talk about it every quarter. I think it demonstrates just the tremendous experience that physicians and patients have, and the confidence they have in IBRANCE despite new competition. The patient experience, the fact that we have real-world clinical evidence, all of this really adds to the confidence that we have in this brand. Even though IBRANCE is a mature brand, we do continue to see growth. Where the growth will come from are from the following places. You're going to see growth from the CDK class.\nYou're going to see growth from the recovery of new patient starts, which, as you know, has not recovered to the levels of prior to the pandemic, as well as stabilization of the PAP through time when economic conditions improve. I actually want to make a special point of this class growth because therein lies, I think, a tremendous opportunity for all of us. Today, well, last year this time, the CDK class was 48% in first-line metastatic breast cancer use. This quarter, it was 54%. Even though it's grown, it still means that the majority of the time, CDKs are not being used. I think all of us in this class really need to focus on this as the leading priority in helping to grow each of our brands, but also to grow the class to impact patient outcome.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Angela. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nManaging Director of Biotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much. First, a quick word of welcome and appreciation to Dave for your proactive commentary on the phasing of revenues. It really mirrors what your predecessor had often finally referred to as the rhythm of the numbers. Very helpful to get insights on near-term factors that are generating push-pulls on those numbers. My question is on business development, however, and I'm not sure that Aamir has joined us, but perhaps if you could update us on your latest thoughts, the team, in terms of how you're feeling about areas of focus, particularly in view of recent broader commentary, for instance, from the FTC, taking a look at competitive dynamics there.\nAs you reflect upon the overall ecosystem and the receptivity, given things like lowered, relatively speaking, biotech valuations, are you sensing any shifts or trends or changes in the mindset of potential targets, partners, acquirers? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. Aamir is here, and he will be happy to speak about it. Aamir.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief Business Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nChris, thank you for the question. Let me just start with your specific FTC point. I think we've demonstrated a very strong track record of shepherding our transactions to date through the regulatory process, and that's been largely built on having just a close, successful, constructive, and collaborative relationships with regulatory bodies globally. In addition, our business development focus, and I'll recap our priorities in a second, is focus on how do we use our unique abilities to translate emerging science into breakthrough medicine.\nMost of the deals that we do are pro-patient, and they're pro-innovation. We're confident that we can continue to advance our BD strategies in a successful way. We've been very clear that our goal is to add $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue by 2030. I think we are making very good progress against that. This year, you saw our transaction with ReViral and subsequently with Biohaven, which, respectively, we believe have the potential to add $1.5 billion and $6 billion in peak sales to our business. This was on the back of a very active 2021. Going forward, we're leaving very few stones unturned when we look at opportunities, and our focus is going to be consistent.\nIt's on scientific substrate that has the potential breakthrough for patients, deals that accelerate our top-line growth in the back half of the decade, and then opportunities where we can add substantial value, whether that's through our scientific chops and/or our commercial capabilities. We're going to be very open to deal structures. We've said before, we're also going to be agnostic to size. We've been clear about the fact that cost synergy-driven deals are not where our focus is going to be. We're going to be extremely disciplined. I think we're very excited about the opportunities that are ahead of us and the flexibility that our balance sheet gives us to pursue those. On your question on valuation fluctuations, those market valuation fluctuations are not going to drive our BD strategy. We're going to remain focused on fundamentals in the way that I described.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you.\nIt's very important when we are aiming very high to also be able, at the same time, to be disciplined. Discipline in valuing the science and paying the right price for the right science so that the capital that we will dispose will be maximized in producing value for patients and the shareholders. We go very big, $25 billion, but as we are proving, we are very, very disciplined in how we are allocating our capital, and we will continue doing that. With that, let's go to the next question. Thank you, Aamir.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next questions come from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Citi\n\nThank you. A two-part question, please. Your former head of vaccines is now in sconce at your competitor, GSK.\nWhen he top-lined the recent positive phase III data for the RSV vaccine candidate, which has aggravated observation he made, was he stressed the same level of efficacy in the older patient cohort than in the younger patient cohort? It's possible to imagine that this may be uniquely related to the adjuvant that they have, given the immunosenescence of the aging population's T cells. Given your vaccine does not have an adjuvant, I guess the background is out of concern, particularly over long years' follow-up. Second, just following up on the question on IBRANCE, could you talk to your Arvinas compound, ARV-471? We come up with market shares which are materially lower than yours. Whatever the number is, it's clearly reducing quite significantly as competition builds momentum in the market.\nHow are you thinking about, as you transition this drug into phase III, both what combinations you're going to run and what are you going to use as the control arm for the combination of a RSV plus a CDK4/6?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Andrew. Just to make a correction, it was not the head of our vaccines that joined. It was another member of the vaccines team, but by no means was the head. Let's move to Mikael.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I am very optimistic about our RSV vaccine construct. We have seen high immune titers that are critical for the vaccine across all ages. In fact, we are the only one that have showed cross-strain A and B for RSV, the very high titers, which differ between all the vaccines, including the one that you mentioned, because they mainly measure cross-reactivity from A to B strain.\nThat was supported also by our challenge data that looked formidable. While nobody can predict exactly the outcome of studies and compare one study to another, we remain very bullish that our bivalent vaccine should stand out in performance and in tolerability. Please note, some of the adjuvants, including the one that you referred to, are often associated with somewhat unpleasant side effects. That was one part of our differentiation to achieve with the bivalent, very high data this far, and with best-in-class tolerability. What about IBRANCE? The ARV-471, I can only speak about the science here that we see that drug being active in several lines as by itself best-in-class estrogen receptor protect. We are going to set up our studies in a patient population which contains many estrogen receptor mutants, which often are poorly managed by the current available fulvestrant or other SERDs.\nWe think this is a unique opportunity. Number two, the drug seemed to combine very well with our own CDK4/6 drugs. We think it could advance into early metastatic lines and possibly over time, even to early breast cancer, maybe there combined with our CDK4. We have very high hopes for that class of drugs, ARV-471, combined with our pipeline. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nAnything to add, William?\n\nWilliam Pao\n\nChief Development Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I would just add, as you mentioned, Mikael, the preclinical data shows that the AR degradation could be superior to selective estrogen receptor degraders. We are very excited about this potential to be superior to SERDs that are being developed.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. From your lips to God's ears. Also, I want to add on the RSV because it's the second question that came, and maybe it gave the impression that we are not very hot on it.\nWe are extremely hot on it. Clearly, a very important product for us, clearly a very important product for GSK. There will be a lot of speculation. Maybe the adjuvant will do that, or maybe the other thing will do this. I think data will speak on themselves. With the totality of data available so far that I have seen, we have high reasons to believe we are better. You never know before the end of the trials. Right now, all in all, it looks like we have a very, very strong profile with all the data that we have seen so far. We are waiting with a lot of excitement to unblind the data and see the realities. Of course, the best will win. Let's move now to Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you so much.\nI would just like to understand more deeply Pfizer's thinking on Factor XI. I could think of three possibilities. First, Pfizer believes there is simply no room to improve upon Eliquis. Second, Pfizer believes Factor XI could be very useful, but you haven't found the ideal candidate. Third, Pfizer is not sure, the jury's still out. Any thoughts?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nI think we have answered it before, and maybe Mikael also can give some color because it's a very, very good question. Bottom line is we are looking for science that could provide hope that we can have something better than Eliquis, and we haven't found yet. That's the reality. According to our opinion, there is not much maturity right now to overcome the very good profile of Eliquis. Mikael, anything to add? That simple as that.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident of Worldwide Research and Development in Medical, Pfizer\n\nI think you said it very well.\nIn the ATL field, platelet inhibitor and ASA are or are going to be genericized. Eliquis and rivaroxaban, great drugs. Eliquis being a market leader, Factor X inhibitor, are by the time Factor XI comes to market, close to or already genericized. The room for an expensive drug in an area with this many great treatments that requires tremendously high R&D expense, coming off the patients have gone through multiple other great drugs, for us, doesn't look like the best area to deploy capital. We always wish others good luck for the benefit of patients.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nYep. Thank you. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question will come from the line of Elliot Basco with UBS.\n\nElliot Basco\n\nCompany Representative, UBS\n\nHi. This is Elliot Basco from UBS on for Colin Bristow. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a few on PAXLOVID. You mentioned countries needing to manage older supply.\nDo you think that current PAXLOVID use trends will result in excess inventory versus what has been contractually purchased? Additionally, could you comment on the recent Codexis retainer arrangement and how we should think about that with regard to 2023 PAXLOVID demand? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nAngela?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nGroup President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group\n\nSure. No. I think that the way we are manufacturing PAXLOVID, with, of course, great knowledge from our prior experiences with COMIRNATY, but also in terms of our negotiations and discussions with countries, is actually allowing us to do supply planning very well. We are manufacturing as we need and according to the contracts and according to the demand that the countries are providing us. I think we're doing that in a very prudent and effective way. Your second question?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. What was the second question? I'm not sure.\n\nElliot Basco\n\nCompany Representative, UBS\n\nCodexis, the enzyme supplier for PAXLOVID.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. You want to, I did refer to it, but maybe also you can reiterate it, Dave.\n\nDave Denton\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. I think Albert indicated this earlier in his remarks, is that, in fact, over the last several quarters, we've improved our manufacturing process, reduced the cycle time, and, importantly, improved the yield from an output perspective. Therefore, we don't need as much raw materials and API to produce the same amount of finished goods. Finally, we've actually invested in our network to make sure that we can actually produce some API as well. We're in good shape.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nCEO, Pfizer\n\nWhat I said before, we are moving most of it now because we could, way faster than what we anticipated, move it inside. That created some cancellations of raw materials to some external suppliers. I'm sorry about that.\nI think that was the last question. Let me close with a few takeaways. The first one, as you see, we continue to deliver strong operational performance. We increased our full-year 2022 operational financial focus while maintaining a challenging foreign exchange environment. I think few companies likely will be able to do that. We believe we are well-positioned not only to maintain, but also to grow both our commercial and scientific leadership in the battle against COVID-19. It will be, for us, a very important focus. We believe that the medical need will be there for the years to come. That's why we are investing so heavily. We continue to focus on driving long-term shareholder returns by remaining very disciplined, both on our operations and our incremental capital deployment. You saw even in this quarter that even more we are squeezing our administrative expenses.\nOur SMA is going down, and we reinvest in R&D because we have programs that we are starting that we feel is a very good return on our investment. We continue to advance our internal scientific pipeline while executing against our previously announced plans to potentially add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues through business development opportunities to 2030 top line. I want very quickly to see that these results in R&D are yielding, this effort in R&D is yielding results. Just to mention a few of the potential approvals and launches that we are going to have in the next few months. See, CIBINQO, we expect to launch the adolescents next year. Of course, next year will be the real first year where we expect to have full access for this drug. We expect to launch next year RSV maternal.\nWe expect to launch next year ABRYSVO adults. We expect to launch next year PREVNAR 20 for pediatrics. We expect to launch next year elranatamab for triple-class refractory myeloma. We expect to launch next year ritlecitinib for alopecia areata. We expect to launch next year pentavalent meningococcal vaccine. We expect to launch next year TALZENNA for prostate cancer metastatic castration patients. We expect to launch or we did already MYFEMBREE for endometriosis. A little bit later, we expect maybe this in 2023 or beginning of 2024, DMD and flu mRNA. This is the organic. I'm not referring to the Biohaven Nurtec that is coming, and to other molecules. I'm referring mainly to the organically developed pipeline assets. I don't think that much of that has been a factor into what some of the analysts are projecting.\nThat's why I'm emphasizing them so that they can pay a little bit more attention. Those are very high probabilities of success, the ones that I mentioned. They are not in the pocket, clearly, all of them. Some clearly might not make it to the cross-line, but we believe they are seriously de-risked, all of that. With that in mind, I'm really looking forward to have a 6% CAGR by 2025 in our business, as we promised in 2019. In fact, year to date, we are at 6%, excluding BD and excluding COVID. I think we will do that by 2025. We will maintain this 6% CAGR, and we will do more by BD that we are right now implementing. I think we have a very good growth prospect, and we will maintain our leadership in COVID. Thank you very, very much for your interest.\nFor those that didn't have summer vacations yet, enjoy your summer vacations.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes PFIZER'S SECOND QUARTER 2022 EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Chris Stevo, Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChristopher J. Stevo\n\nSenior VP & Chief IR Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's first quarter earnings call. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our Chairman and CEO; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; and Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical. Joining us for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, Group President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group; Aamir Malik, our Chief Business and Innovation Officer; Doug Lankler, our General Counsel; and William Pao, our new Chief Development Officer.\nThe materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com.

With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Pfizer had what a solid start to the year. Revenues were up 82% operationally compared with the first quarter of 2021. Key growth drivers for the quarter included COMIRNATY, PAXLOVID, Eliquis, VYNDAQEL/VYNDAMAX globally, our Prevnar family of vaccines and our oncology biosimilars portfolio in the U.S. Overall, we reached an estimated 468 million patients around the world only in 1 quarter with our innovative medicines and vaccines, which represent a 140% increase from the prior year quarter, and it is a testament to our purpose, breakthroughs that change patients' lives.\nWe continue to supply the world with COMIRNATY, which remains a critical tool in helping prevent severe illness, hospitalization and deaths from COVID-19. Today, we have shipped nearly 3.4 billion doses of our vaccine to 179 countries. COMIRNATY is the most utilized mRNA vaccine in the markets in which we operate and (inaudible). Pfizer's cumulative share of doses administered in these markets has increased in fact from 52% that used to be on January 1, beginning of the year 2022, to 62% on May 1, 2022. Just a few months, 10 points. In developed markets, our share has increased from 59% to 67% over that same period of time.\nWe also have had a strong start to the year with regard to regulatory milestones, including the Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. FDA and Conditional Market Authorization from EMA for our 12- to 15-year old booster dose. We had an EUA from the FDA for a second booster (inaudible) in patients 50 years of age and older and 12 years of age and older who are immunocompromised. And we had an extension to a 12-month frozen shelf life label 12 months from both the FDA and the EMA. Our ambition is to eventually achieve a 24-month shelf life, which would help alleviate concerns that some governments may have about having expiring dose system.\nIn addition to the U.S. and the EU, we now have authorizations for the 5 to 11 age group in 44 other markets around the world. In addition, we have recently released new results from a Phase II/III clinical trial, demonstrating that the 10-microgram booster dose of our vaccine in healthy children 5 to 11 years of age increases geometric mean neutralizing antibody titer -- geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers, wild-type and Omicron variants. Based on this data, last week, we submitted an application to the FDA for an EUA of a 10-microgram booster dose for children in this age group, and we look forward to filing in other jurisdictions in the near future.\nWe also expect to share data on our ongoing study in children who are 6 months to under 5 years of age in the next few weeks. This study is looking at the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of the vaccine in this age group, and we hope to submit an application for an EUA soon, pending the results of the data readout, of course. Last, we stand ready to support boosting authorized populations today as well as in the fall ahead of the traditional flu season. Independent real-world evidence from several countries have demonstrated that our booster doses improve protection that may have waned from the primary vaccination or since the first booster.\nOur market reserves shows that greater than 96% of health care provider respondents in key markets like the U.S. and the EU5 largest markets, continue to recommend a third dose booster to their patients. We also have seen an upward trend in uptake of a third dose booster in various developed markets. In these same markets that I referred previously, 74% of people who have received the initial 2-dose regimen reported that they have all already received third dose booster. And the remaining 13% of the respondents said that they are very likely to receive a booster. We believe this is an encouraging leading indicator for the potential uptake of a fourth dose. We also continue to evaluate potential next-generation vaccines, including variant vaccines to provide broad coverage for the fall, and we look forward to evaluating and sharing these data in the coming months.\nWe are also delivering on our commitments for PAXLOVID, which is already having a profoundly positive impact on the lives of patients around the world. Through the end of March, we produced more than 6 million treatment courses, all of which have been shipped shortly after they were produced. Because the financial calendar quarter for international markets ends in February and the majority of these 6 million treatments were produced in March, only a small portion of these shipments were recorded in our first quarter revenues. In fact, as of today, we have shipped approximately 8 million treatment courses.\nOur manufacturing ramp-up is progressing as planned, and we are on track to produce 24 million courses in the second quarter for a total of 30 million in the first half of the year. All of these quantities have already been allocated to existing orders. In addition, we remain on track to produce 120 million courses for the full year, as previously stated. To date, PAXLOVID has received regulatory approvals for temporary authorization for use with certain populations in more than 60 countries. We continue to have discussions with governments and regulatory agencies around the world about bringing this potential breakthrough treatment to additional markets.\nSome countries that they have experienced recent outbreaks have come back to us to request additional treatment courses, which we are responding to with urgency. Others are taking steps to expand access. For example, the Italian government recently announced an expansion of prescribing into primary care. We believe this shift from having only specialists prescribe PAXLOVID will help ensure more patients get access at the right time.\nIn the U.K. PAXLOVID will now be included in the National Panoramic Study, which we expect will increase access and collect further data regarding how the therapy works in a market where the majority of the adult population is vaccinated. This is important because today, the U.K. has restricted PAXLOVID use to a very limited populace. And this study could lead to government to open up access to a much broader population closer to the authorized populations.\nIn Canada, we expect increasing supply and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions will enable greater access for patients across the country. Quebec and Ontario, which represent the 2 largest provinces and are home to more than 60% of Canada's population, have expanded distribution to eligible pharmacies, allowed pharmacists to prescribe and started a comprehensive direct-to-consumer and social media campaign to ensure all eligible patients are aware of the availability of PAXLOVID.\nHere in the U.S., we have seen PAXLOVID utilization grow nearly 10-fold in recent weeks. PAXLOVID was administered to more than 79,000 patients in the U.S. that weekend in April 27, up from approximately 8,000 patients for the weekend in February 25, 2022. We will continue to work with the U.S. government and health care providers to appropriately drive even higher utilization. And based on data from IQVIA Xponent, PAXLOVID market share relative to molnupiravir in the retail long-term care and mail order channels grew from 44% in the weekend in January 28, 2022, to almost 90% in the week ending April 22, 2022. Together, these channels represent an estimated 50% of PAXLOVID utilization in the U.S.\nThe number of locations in the U.S. with PAXLOVID supply continues to increase with more than 33,000 sites live as of today. This is more than a fourfold increase since late February, leading to easier patient access. The U.S. government declared its intention to double the size again in the coming weeks and making PAXLOVID available to any pharmacy who wishes to stock.\nIn addition, 77% of recent U.S. COVID-19 cases occurred within 5 miles of the closest retail point of care, which is up from only 23% since February. We expect this trend to continue to increase, driven by the U.S. government's Test to Treat initiative. For example, nearly 1,100 more Test to Treat locations have been added since the beginning of April on. Today, there are more than 2,200 locations of Test to Treat open. Overall, we expect the recent trends to expand access as well as inquiries received from governments as the virus mutates and cause spikes in infections around the world to result in increased orders in the coming months as governments continue to help protect their citizens who are at high risk of severe disease, hospitalization and death in response to emerging variants and continuing outbreaks.\nNow I will turn to our business development strategy. We leverage business development opportunities to advance our business strategies and objectives. We recently announced positive top line results from a year-long Phase III trial of etrasimod in moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. These results underscore Pfizer's ability to identify strong business development targets as this potentially best-in-class drug candidate came to us via our recent acquisition of Arena. We look forward to presenting this data and filing for approval later this year.\nFirst quarter, we discussed how the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows gives us the ability to pursue new business development opportunities that, if successful, could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top line expectations. Our planned acquisition of ReViral is the first deal to be counted towards this ambition. ReViral is a privately-held clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel antiviral therapeutics that target respiratory syncytial virus. Basically, they target RSV. We believe annual revenue from these programs, if successful, has the potential to reach or exceed $1.5 billion. This is peak revenues.\nWe also are excited about the prospect of adding several experienced virologists to our team. Building relationship within the growing biotech ecosystem remains a priority for Pfizer. We continue to pursue new creative ways of partnering with biotechs to increase our access to cutting-edge innovation and to bring our resources to help drive for patients. We believe our scientific expertise, our end-to-end development and manufacturing capabilities makes us an extremely attractive partner. I see, for example, through our relationship with BioNTech, and we are confident that we have the financial resources to support business development opportunities that will complement and enhance our internal R&D efforts and add capacity and flexibility to support our growing clinical portfolio.\nNext, I would like to discuss some of our recent ESG highlights. First, we announced in February the results of Pfizer's third annual pay equity study in which a recognized compensation expert confirmed equitable pay practices for employees at Pfizer. The results indicated that Pfizer compensates female colleagues at a level that it is greater than 99% of what male colleagues are paid across the globe. Additionally, in the U.S., minorities are paid at dollar-for-dollar parity of what non-minorities are paid.\nWhen you look at Pfizer's median pay for women globally, it is in high 102.3% for the median pay of males. However, when you look at the median pay for minorities in the U.S. workforce, it is 85.5% of the median pay for our non-minorities. This median rate pay gap is an area we are actively addressing and that we expect to narrow.\nSecond, I want to reiterate that Pfizer stands with a unified global community in opposition to Russia's invasion to Ukraine. While Pfizer is maintaining our supply of medicine to Russians, as we should, we will be donating all profits of our Russian subsidiary to causes that provide direct humanitarian support to the people of Ukraine. Additionally, we will no longer initiate new clinical trials in Russia and will stop recruiting new patients in our ongoing clinical trials in the country.\nPfizer will work with the FDA and other regulators to transition all ongoing clinical trials to alternative sites outside Russia. And consistent with our commitment to putting patients first, we will continue providing needed medicines to the patients already enrolled in clinical trials in Russia. Lastly, we are ceasing all future investments with local suppliers intended to build manufacturing capacity in Russia.\nThird, further demonstrating our commitment to equitable access, we have made the decision that for as long as the pandemic lasts, Pfizer will not profit from sales of our COVID-19 treatment to the world's poorest countries. In March, Pfizer announced an agreement with UNICEF to supply up to 4 million treatment courses of PAXLOVID to 95 low- and middle-income countries. Under the agreement, all low and lower middle-income countries will be offered the treatment courses at a not-for-profit price, while upper middle-income countries will pay a price defined in Pfizer's tier pricing approach.\nLastly, I'm pleased to share that Pfizer continues to be recognized as an ethical patient-focused company that calls itself in its employees and its business partners to high standards. In March, Pfizer was recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. And just last week, and we are so proud about it, for the first time ever, Pfizer ranked first among big pharma companies in the PatientView global survey in 2021. This ranking is based on feedback from more than 2,000 patient organizations and associations worldwide. As recently as 2018, we were ranked fifth, and we have steadily climbed in the rankings ever since but we are so proud that we are #1 right now.\nNow I would like to welcome 2 new members of Pfizer executive leadership team. Dr. William Pao joined us on March 21 as Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer. Throughout his 25-year career as an oncologist and scientist, William has amassed extensive clinical and deep scientific expertise that make him the ideal partner to continue our pursuit in breakthrough medicines and vaccines for the benefit of patients and society.\nJust yesterday, David Denton joined us as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. Dave brings with him more than 25 years of finance and operational expertise, including more than 20 years in the health care sector. As a result, he brings to Pfizer a unique perspective on the role of payers, the needs of patients and the rapidly evolving health care landscape. We are thrilled to welcome these 2 highly effective and visionary leaders at this critical time for our company in global health.\nAnd now before I hand it over to Mikael, I want to take a moment to thank Frank D'Amelio, my best friend in Pfizer, for his many contributions to Pfizer. In addition to helping ensure Pfizer's financial strength and discipline, Frank has been an incredible mentor to many of Pfizer's current leaders, helped save our long-term growth strategy and worked tirelessly to ensure Pfizer has the resources it needs to help improve the lives of patients around the world. Frank, on behalf of all Pfizer colleagues and I'm sure all the analysts on today's call and not only, I wish you continued good health and success.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on the R&D efforts. After Mikael, Frank will provide financial details on the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2022. Mikael?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nChief Scientific Officer and President of Worldwide Research, Development & Medical, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, Albert. I'd like to start by highlighting 2 recent external acknowledgment of Pfizer's R&D turnaround. Pfizer was ranked first for innovation in the 11th Annual Pharmaceutical Innovation and Invention Index and first for what Forbes termed Total R&D Productivity over 20 Years in a paper published in by Discovery today. This is a testament not only to the work of our scientists over the past year but our purposeful efforts to improve our R&D engine over the past 10 years.\nToday, I will share updates on COVID-19, inflammation and immunology, RSV, oncology, Lyme disease and hemophilia. In some cases, I may reference publicly available data on other agents so that you can understand our enthusiasm about what we're seeing in our development programs. Of course, head-to-head clinical trials would be necessary to support any comparative claims.\nWe continue to pursue a comprehensive and data-driven clinical strategy for COMIRNATY, focused on evaluating real-world vaccine effectiveness, demonstrating higher immunogenicity with boosters, expanding access to pediatric population and addressing emerging variants of concern. On the left, in the Phase II/III trial of COMIRNATY administered to children age 5 to 11, we have shown that the third 10-microgram dose demonstrated a sixfold boost in utilizing wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and a 36-fold boost neutralizing the Omicron variant. Last week, we submitted an EUA request to the FDA for a third-dose boost in this population.\nOn the right, we show that the third 30-microgram dose administered for adults in the landmark clinical trial effectively neutralized the Omicron sublineages, including BA.2 1 month after dose 3. We have also now received EUA for a second booster in people aged 50 and older and for individuals 12 years of age and older who have certain kinds of immunocompromise. This expanded authorization was based on data from Israel, generated while the Omicron variant was dominant, an approximately 11-fold increase in geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers against wild-type virus, Delta and Omicron variants, respectively, were reported at 2 weeks after the second booster as compared to 5 months after the first booster.\nHere, we show recently published real-world data from Israel that the fourth dose of COMIRNATY lowered rates of hospitalization, severe illness and death amidst the Omicron outbreak. A fourth dose is now recommended for certain high-risk populations in more than 15 countries. There's been a notable increase in the number of pediatric infections and hospitalizations in the last few weeks. And we recognize that the parents of younger children and health care providers have been waiting for an effective vaccine. We have been working with urgency to generate data.\nWe began the rolling submissions for EUA in children aged 6 months to 4 years in February, while continuing to evaluate the third 3-microgram dose, which maybe optimal to deliver high degree of protection against Omicron. We expect to analyze and submit the 3-dose data by late May, early June and anticipate both FDA and CDC Advisory Committees to meet soon after to consider the submission.\nTurning to PAXLOVID. Following EUA in December for both high-risk adults and high-risk children 12 and older weighing at least 40 kilograms, we expect to file soon and anticipate an FDA decision on the New Drug Application in these populations in the second half of '22. Recently, the WHO strongly recommended PAXLOVID for people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at the highest risk of hospitalization because they're unvaccinated, older or immunocompromised. We expect pivotal readouts of the standard risk study in the second half of '22 and reported top line results from the household contact prophylaxis study last week.\nIn March, we initiated a study in children and expect to have data in the second quarter of '23. We are first enrolling children aged 6 to 17 years and working to develop an age-appropriate formulation for children younger than 6. A new study in immunocompromised patients is planned to start in the second half of '22. Some immunocompromised patients were enrolled in the EPIC-HR study. However, given the high unmet need, we believe (inaudible) will allow us to further evaluate PAXLOVID's efficacy in this population and ensure the treatment duration is optimized, given their more limited natural immune response to help clear infection.\nWith the close of the Arena acquisition in March, I'd like to highlight the potential for etrasimod as a best-in-class oral medicine for ulcerative colitis and its strategic fit within our overall inflammation and immunology pipeline. First, etrasimod is differentiated. It's a once-daily pill with rapid onset, no anticipated required titration and a promising benefit-risk profile. In the Phase III ELEVATE studies, etrasimod demonstrated robust clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. In March, we reported that the ELEVATE UC 52 trial met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission at both weeks 12 and 52 and all key secondary endpoints.\nLooking at the totality of data across Phase II and Phase III studies, we see a 12-week remission rate of 25% to 30% compared to placebo at 6% to 15%. We are projecting a filing in ulcerative colitis in the second half of '22. This candidate also has broad potential beyond UC. The adaptive Phase II/III study in Crohn's disease is ongoing, and we expect to start Phase III in atopic dermatitis in the fourth quarter. The potential expansion into Crohn's and eosinophilic esophagitis strengthen our gastroenterology pipeline. Overall, given that immuno-inflammatory diseases have heterogenous disease drivers which require multiple options for effective treatment and the continuing significant unmet need of patients in achieving long-term remission, we are excited about the portfolio of diverse and promising candidates from Arena that nicely complement our existing I&I pipeline.\nRitlecitinib is our unique cytokine modulator. It's a potent family inhibitor which spares IL-10 protective cytokines and spares dominant activity of existing effective oral agents. We have seen promising Phase II efficacy demonstrated across alopecia, vitiligo and ulcerative colitis. The Phase II study in Crohn's disease is ongoing. Ritlecitinib received FDA Breakthrough Designation for alopecia and we expect to file in the second quarter. We are finalizing potential Phase III study protocols for vitiligo and exploring paths for ulcerative colitis.\nIn Phase IIb, ritlecitinib demonstrated robust efficacy in both facial and total Vitiligo Area Severity Indexes, or VASI. Here, we showed a facial VASI improvement. On the left, ritlecitinib demonstrated up to 66% improvement from baseline through week 48. Efficacy was observed across light and dark skin types. On the right, you see 2 visual representations for significant improvement in facial VASI at 48 weeks.\nLast month, we announced our intent to acquire ReViral and its respiratory syncytial virus therapeutic candidates. RSV remains a significant unmet need globally with no approved treatment, and the proposed acquisition will strengthen our capability in infectious disease R&D with a complementary strategy to help improve patient outcomes through treatment and prevent illness through vaccination. This mirrors our COVID-19 strategy, establishing leadership across vaccines and therapeutics for RSV to deliver potential breakthroughs.\nOur RSV candidate elicited high RSV A and B neutralizing titers in preclinical animal models and in Phase I/II clinical studies and has received FDA Breakthrough Designation for the maternal and adult programs. We anticipate total readouts of the maternal and adult studies in the second half of '22. ReViral's pipeline include a lead candidate, sisunatovir, which has received Fast Track Designation and the second program focused on the inhibition of RSV replication targeting the viral N protein.\nSisunatovir is an orally administered inhibitor designed to block fusion of the RSV virus to the host cell. In our Phase II health adult challenge study, sisunatovir significantly reduced viral load. The data are shown on the right. There's also an ongoing 3-part adaptive Phase II study in hospitalized infants. Successful completion of Part A was achieved in June '21 with favorable safety and pharmacokinetics. Part B is ongoing.\nWe now turn to oncology and encouraging data on the Phase III trial of LORBRENA. 3-year follow-up data presented at AACR confirmed prolonged progression-free survival in first-line ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients. There was a 73% reduction in risk of disease progression of test versus cristotinib. The 3-year PFS rate in the LORBRENA arm was 63.5%. 3-year rates for second-generation medicines are generally 20% points lower based on cross-trial assessment. No definitive conclusion can be drawn from cross-trial comparisons. There were no new safety signals and a low permanent discontinuation rate of 7.4% for patients on LORBRENA.\nHigh central nervous system activity is important for patients with and without brain metastasis. Between 25% and 40% of ALK-positive patients present with brain metastasis at diagnosis. And between 24% and 40% of patients develop them within 2 years of diagnosis. Brain metastasis are one of the most common causes of death in this patient population. Leveraging our expertise in developing brain penetrant oncology treatments, LORBRENA was specifically designed to meet this significant unmet need.\nWe have seen high activity in patients with or without baseline brain metastasis. Significant intracranial activity was observed with LORBRENA as evidenced not only by intracranial response rates but also by time to intracranial progression as shown here. At 3 years of follow-up, 92.3% of patients treated with LORBRENA were alive and free of intracranial events compared with 37.7% treated with cristotinib. In LORBRENA-treated patients without brain metastasis, only 1 out of 112 patients had evidence of intracranial progression, suggesting a potential protective effect against development of brain metastasis with LORBRENA treatment.\nHere, we show the first data from the pediatric cohort of the Phase II trial of our Lyme disease vaccine candidate, the only one of its kind in clinical development. Lyme disease affects all age groups, but children are considered the population most at risk due to their outdoor activities. We saw robust immunicity across all pediatric age groups and serotypes and the safety profile was similar to that previously reported in adults. The program has received FDA Fast Track designation, and we plan to include pediatric participants in the Phase III trial expected to start in the third quarter. As in adults, the immunicity and safety data support a 3-dose primary vaccination schedule in pediatric participants in the Phase III study.\nNow I'd like to highlight our robust portfolio of investigational therapies to potentially treat all people with hemophilia. We expect a number of clinical trials for our hemophilia portfolio to read out in '23. Marstacimab is our novel nonfactor treatment candidate with the potential to address a broad patient population. As a new subcutaneous prophylactic treatment for patients with hemophilia A or B, including those with inhibitors, we anticipate the pivotal readout in second quarter '23. Marstacimab has FDA Fast Track designation for heme A and B patients with inhibitors. If successful, we predict submitting for the non-inhibitor indication in both heme A and B in the third quarter of '23.\nTurning to our gene therapy candidates. Last year, at ASH, we presented updated Phase Ib/II data from the largest cohort of persons with hemophilia B, who have had at least 3 years of follow-up with AAV gene therapy. 93% of participants achieved Factor IX activity in the mild or normal range between 3 to 5.5 years of follow-up. We expect a pivotal readout in the first quarter of '23. In heme A, we also presented updated Phase Ib data at ASH. Factor VIII activity was 25% of normal after 2 years in the highest dose cohort. The FDA has lifted a clinical hold on our Phase III pivotal study, and we anticipate study resumption in the third quarter of this year with a pivotal readout estimated in the second half of '23.\nFinally, here are the top 25 key milestones achieved and anticipated for the rest of the year, 6 in the regulatory space, 12 pivot to readout and 7 early-stage readouts. I'd also note that last week, we announced the planned opening of the first U.S. sites in our Phase III trial evaluating our investigational mini-dystrophin gene therapy for ambulatory patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. The trial also has received regulatory approvals to restart in several other countries. Pending regulatory feedback, we anticipate that nearly all sites will open by the end of June.\nIn addition, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use granted Prime Designation for GBS6, our maternal vaccine candidate against streptococcal infection. It's currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase II study. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions. Now let me turn it over to Frank.\n\nFrank D'Amelio\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Business Operations\n\nThanks, Mikael. I know you've seen our release so let me provide a few brief highlights regarding the financials. Turning to the income statement. Revenue increased 82% operationally in the first quarter of 2022, driven by COVID-19 vaccine and PAXLOVID sales and strong performance for a number of our other key growth drivers. And looking at the revenue excluding the COVID-19 vaccine direct sales and alliance revenues and PAXLOVID contribution, it increased by 2% operationally. The effect of fewer selling days year-over-year decreased revenues by about 1%, and losses of exclusivity negatively impacted revenues by 2%. Operational growth would have been approximately 5% without these. Also, please remember that Q1 2021 grew 8% operationally, excluding COMIRNATY versus the prior year quarter, resulting in a very difficult comparable. This was broadly as expected and is embedded in our current guidance.\nThe adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 10 percentage points as compared to the first quarter of 2021, with 14 percentage points attributable to the impact of higher COVID-19 vaccine sales year-over-year, partially mitigated by an unfavorable product mix for other products, primarily driven by higher sales of PAXLOVID and higher alliance revenues.\nAdjusted SI&A expenses in the first quarter decreased primarily due to lower spending on corporate-enabling functions, partially offset by increased spending for COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID. The increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter was primarily driven by increased investments in multiple late-stage clinical programs as well as additional spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19. The growth rate for reported diluted EPS was 59% while adjusted diluted EPS grew 76% operationally for the quarter. Foreign exchange movements resulted in a negative 5% impact to revenue as well as a negative 4% impact or $0.04 to adjusted diluted EPS.\nNow let's move to our updated 2022 guidance. We expect total company revenue to be in a range of $98 billion to $102 billion, representing an operational growth rate of 27% at the midpoint. The revenue range absorbs an additional $2 billion of anticipated negative impact from changes in foreign exchange rates as the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against other currencies since we last updated our exchange rate assumptions.\nRegarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we continue to expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, unchanged compared to our prior guidance provided on February 8, despite the impact of $1 billion of incremental negative foreign exchange. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance unchanged despite an incremental $500 million headwind due to foreign exchange. This means that excluding the COVID-19-related revenues, we expect sales to be approximately $46 billion at the midpoint, representing operational growth of 5% and absorbing the increased negative impact of about $500 million for foreign exchange. While this is slightly below the 6% CAGR that we continue to expect between 2020 and 2025, we continue to be confident in our ability to achieve that 2025 target.\nNow let me give some detail on our cost and expense guidance. We slightly improved our guidance for adjusted cost of sales, reducing the entire range by 20 basis points, the new range being 32% to 34%. We've separated the former R&D line into 2, R&D and a new line for acquired IP R&D to isolate the IP R&D charges, which are driven by business development transactions.\nOur guidance includes $900 million of this expense for 2022 based on business development transactions which have either already closed or are already signed as of mid-April, of which only $100 million was previously assumed and our R&D guidance for adjusted results. We will not forecast acquired R&D for transactions which are not closed (inaudible). We've also increased our adjusted R&D expense guidance by $500 million to reflect incremental life cycle spending for COVID-19 vaccines and antivirals and investments in other projects.\nIn addition, as noted with fourth quarter results, we've made a decision to modify our adjusted results treatment of amortization of intangibles. Previously, we only excluded amortization related to large mergers and acquisitions, but we will now exclude all intangible asset amortization expense. This is anticipated to contribute $0.06 to our 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share and improves comparability with our peers. This $0.06 was previously included in our 2022 guidance.\nThese assumptions yield an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.25 to $6.45 or 61% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021. This updated EPS guidance includes a $0.10 operational improvement, offset by a negative $0.11 due to foreign exchange and another $0.11 due to IP R&D. Together, these impacts led out to an adjusted EPS range, which is $0.10 lower than our initial guidance. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March. Going forward, we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide.\nSo before I turn the call back to Chris to start the Q&A session, I wanted to make a personal comment. This conference call will mark my last as Pfizer's CFO, and I wish Dave and Pfizer all the success in the world. It has been my immense pleasure and privilege to serve as Pfizer's CFO for nearly 15 years. I've always enjoyed my interactions with you, our investors and our analysts and I will miss it. To my Pfizer colleagues, I am so proud of what we have accomplished together. I look forward to you achieving yet more success in the future. And as a large Pfizer shareholder, you can be sure that I'll be watching. With that, let me turn it over to Chris for Q&A.\n\nChristopher J. Stevo\n\nSenior VP & Chief IR Officer, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, Frank. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And as always, Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any questions you weren't able to ask. Operator, first question, please.",

Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Chris. Hello, everyone. 2021 was a watershed year for Pfizer, a year in which we set all-time highs in all major areas of focus for Pfizer. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion patients with our medicines and vaccines. That's more than one out of every six people on Earth. Never before has Pfizer's patient impact been so wide-reaching.\nWe improved our ranking from fourth to second among large biopharma companies in the Patient View Global Survey. According to Morning Consult, 61% of Americans have a favorable view of Pfizer, which is up 33 points since January 2020. Just last week, Fortune ranked us fourth on its annual world's most admired companies list, the highest ranking we have ever achieved. 95% of our colleagues said in an internal survey that they are proud to work for Pfizer, which ranks among the best in corporate America. We increased our investments in research and development from $8.9 billion in 2020 to $10.5 billion in 2021, and we initiated 13 pivotal clinical studies, the highest number ever for Pfizer. Last but not least, we grew revenues by 92% operationally to $81.3 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS by 92% operationally to $4.42.\nOur success in leading the fight against COVID-19 has not only made a positive difference in the world, I believe that has fundamentally changed our company and our culture forever. Colleagues across Pfizer are inspired by what we have achieved, and more determined than ever to be part of the next potentially game-changing breakthrough. To that end, we are applying the light speed principles developed for our COVID-19 work to our other therapeutic areas to make sure we continue to move at the speed of science for the benefits of all patients. As a result, we believe we can do even better with each of these metrics in 2022, each one of them. Our full-year 2022 financial guidance, for example, includes for the first time ever a forecasted revenue midpoint, but it is triple-digit, $100 billion, and an adjusted diluted EPS midpoint of $6.45.\nWhile COMIRNATY is having a significant positive impact on Pfizer's financial performance, it is the tremendous impact that COVID-19 vaccines have had on society that is most important. In the US alone, the COVID-19 vaccination program is estimated to have saved more than 1 million lives and prevented more than 10 million hospitalizations, according to a December 2021 Commonwealth Fund report. The economic impact is equally astounding. According to a December 2021 Heartland Forward report, the rapid deployment and wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the US created an estimated economic savings of $438 billion in 2021 alone, which amounted to US GDP being 2.3% higher than it otherwise would have been, 2.3 points. I'm proud to say that Pfizer contributed significantly to these benefits, given that approximately six out of 10 doses administered in the US as of 6 February 2022 were COMIRNATY.\nThis is the value of our science, what our culture has enabled, and what drives our people. I would like to speak to three factors that will help drive our growth going forward. The first is the long-term outlook for COVID-19 and why we believe we are well-positioned to continue to lead the battle against this disease. Second, our thoughtful capital allocation strategy and why we believe it can help drive our growth in the second part of the decade. Third, how our commitment to ESG principles is designed to create sustainable growth for Pfizer to deliver meaningful value to patients and society. Let me start with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our scientists continue to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 virus and believe it is unlikely that it will be fully eradicated in the foreseeable future. They believe this for several reasons.\nThe global distribution of the virus makes it difficult to contain. The virus has shown an ability to mutate often, making it difficult to stay ahead of it. The data appear to show that natural infections do not lead to the type of durable protection needed to prevent all transmissions and viral mutations. As a result, people can become reinfected by the same or different strains over time. That said, we now have the tools in the form of vaccines and treatments that we believe will help enable us to not only better manage the pandemic, but also help countries move into an endemic phase.\nIn other words, we believe these tools will help allow us to go back to normality and spend time with family and friends, travel, attend indoor dining and concerts, and enjoy many other activities while lowering the risk of overburdening hospitals and healthcare systems around the world. All of us at Pfizer are extremely proud of the role we have continued to play in bringing these tools to the world. Throughout 2021, we continued our efforts to bring our COVID-19 vaccine to more populations and to further ramp up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. As a result, the market share of our COMIRNATY vaccine has continued to grow, representing 70% of all doses distributed across the US and EU as of 5 February. When it comes to PAXLOVID, we expect to produce 6 million treatment courses during the first quarter of 2022.\nOverall, we expect to produce 30 million courses in the first half of 2022 and 120 million courses for the full year, of course, depending on the global need. Having recently received a conditional marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency, PAXLOVID has now received emergency or conditional authorization for use with certain populations in approximately 40 countries so far. We are in discussions with governments around the world and expect that as the number of authorizations increase, so will the number of contracts for this treatment, which could truly be a game changer. At Pfizer, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to continue to invest in R&D to maintain our leadership in providing these tools and other meaningful solutions to the world.\nThat's why we continue to develop and test different versions of our vaccine to potentially address variants of concern as they emerge, and why we are currently working on a new Omicron-based vaccine candidate and on a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It is also why, just two months after receiving emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for PAXLOVID, we are already working on a potential next-generation oral COVID-19 treatment. Going forward, we are confident in our ability to maintain this leadership position because of our significant investments in R&D, combined with our ability to move at the speed of science without compromising quality or safety, the strong credibility we have earned with governments, healthcare providers, and consumers, combined with our extensive global field presence, and our unparalleled capabilities for high-quality manufacturing at scale.\nThe second thing I wanted to touch on is how we think about our capital allocation and to repeat once more our strategy. We feel that the entirety of our business continues to demonstrate a robust top-line growth trajectory through 2025. Consensus estimates are beginning to slowly recognize this momentum. However, consensus estimates currently show our top line shrinking from 2025 to 2030. I want to repeat that this is inconsistent with our own plans. Our goal is to continue to be a growth company from 2025 to 2030, despite the impact of LOE's expected during that period. Our confidence in our ability to achieve that is underpinned by the momentum of our business, the durability of our COVID-19 offerings, which, as I just described, the underestimated strength of our internal pipeline, and, of course, by our ability to deploy capital into growth-focused business development to access external science.\nA few words about that. We leverage business development opportunities to advance our business strategies and objectives. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows allows us to pursue new business development opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top-line expectations. We expect to do this while still maintaining our growing dividend, as well as flexibility for other uses of our cash. The focus of our business development efforts will continue to be on compelling external science, in the form of both later-stage assets, as well as earlier medical innovations that have the potential to be breakthroughs for patients. Our focus will largely be in the therapeutic areas and platforms where we have the scientific skills and acumen to add substantial value, and select the most successful targets.\nIn addition, we feel that we have distinctive attributes such as world-class excellence in clinical development, and surpass manufacturing and commercial capabilities at scale that makes us a very attractive partner across a variety of deal arrangements. We believe the opportunities to deliver on this approach exist, and I will be personally focusing on this execution. I want to emphasize that despite our significant capital flexibility, we will never lower the scientific and financial standards we apply in our business development. As we pursue these opportunities, we will continue to be highly disciplined in our evaluation and prioritization processes. Since 2019, we have already invested almost $25 billion in business development transactions, adding more than $13 billion in consensus—I repeat, in consensus—2030 revenue.\nI would point out that the $13 billion of consensus currently includes nothing for the Trillium assets, the Biohaven collaboration, or the recently announced mRNA deals, all of which have substantial potential. I see this pace of business development accelerating going forward, and I'm confident it will be an important driver in ensuring Pfizer as a growth company in the back half of this decade. One highly visible example of our approach to business development is the recent investments we are making in mRNA technology and collaborations. mRNA has emerged as a versatile technology with potential application across many infectious diseases, cancer, rare genetic disorders, and even autoimmune diseases. Although mRNA is not the Holy Grail, we believe the technology has the potential to have a game-changing impact on global health, which is why we have developed a robust mRNA strategy and are aggressively building our platform.\nWhile the pandemic has demonstrated that it is not that easy to deliver mRNA vaccines at scale, Pfizer has emerged as a leader in this space. With decades of experience on our side, we have developed what is arguably the most efficient clinical development and vaccine manufacturing capabilities the world has ever seen. We also have rapidly scaled and built our new capabilities in record time by hiring nearly 2,400 new colleagues in these functions in a nine-month time frame. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest to capitalize on the leadership we have built in terms of both mRNA R&D, and manufacturing. In addition, of course, to these internal investments and improvements, we are also making external investments to build out our capabilities in this space. For example, Pfizer recently has entered into four important business development deals to help advance our mRNA strategy.\nWe are expanding our collaboration with BioNTech to use the existing platform to co-develop an mRNA vaccine candidate for herpes zoster virus to protect against shingles. Our agreement with Beam Therapeutics expands our mRNA efforts to another core therapeutic area for Pfizer, a rare disease, with a four-year research collaboration for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle, and central nervous system. We believe this will give us the potential to use mRNA to treat diseases, not just prevent them. Our agreement with Acuitas gives us the ability to collaborate with and license their proprietary lipid nanoparticle technology for up to 10 targets for mRNA vaccines and therapy. We believe this will give us greater independence in this space.\nWe have signed a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Codex DNA, a leader in the development of automated solutions for on-demand synthesis of genes and mRNA, potentially allowing enzymatic assembly of DNA at the front end of the mRNA production process. This could possibly reduce the time to produce a new vaccine from three months down to two months. If successful, this would be an important differentiator when developing a vaccine for the flu, for example, as it would allow us to select a strain much closer to the start of any flu season. These deals represent only four pieces of a much bigger strategic puzzle. As we continue executing on our mRNA strategy, you should expect to see more targeted activity in this area. Of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy.\nThis is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter. I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals. They are marked as new in this slide. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain, and in women's health, with Biohaven's groundbreaking oral CGRP receptor antagonist, the only one approved in the US for both acute and preventative treatment of migraine, to potentially bring a valuable new treatment option to patients living with this debilitating neurological disease outside the US.\nThrough the proposed acquisition of Arena, we plan to leverage Pfizer's leading research and global development capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of Etrasimod with patients with immunoinflammatory diseases. Now, I would like to share some details about Pfizer's enhanced ESG strategy. The strategy is focused on six areas where we—may we change the slide, please?—where we see opportunities to create a meaningful and measurable impact over the next decade: product innovation. I'm sorry, I have been asked to pause for a technical problem. Testing, testing. I apologize. You are back. I apologize for the technical issue. I will repeat my script for this last slide, and then we go forward. Of course, our business development activity in the last quarter went beyond executing on our mRNA strategy.\nThis is an update of the slide I showed you last quarter, and I would like to highlight a few of the other recent deals. You can see them with the indication new. The acquisition of Trillium builds on our strong track record of leadership in oncology, enhancing our hematology portfolio as we strive to improve outcomes for people living with blood cancers around the globe. Our strategic collaboration with Biohaven leverages our leading commercial capabilities in pain and women's health, with Biohaven's groundbreaking oral CGRP receptor antagonist, the only one approved in the US for both acute and preventative treatment of migraine, so that we can potentially bring a valuable new treatment option to patients living with this debilitating neurological disease outside the US.\nThrough our proposed acquisition of Arena, we plan to leverage Pfizer's leading research and global development capabilities to accelerate the clinical development of Etrasimod for patients with immunoinflammatory diseases. Now, I would like to share some details about Pfizer's enhanced ESG strategy. The strategy is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful and measurable impact over the next decade: product innovation, equitable access and pricing, product quality and safety, diversity, equity, and inclusion, climate change, and business ethics. Each quarter going forward, I will provide examples of how we are embedding ESG into all core areas of our business. This quarter, I would highlight our efforts to improve clinical trial diversity, to improve diversity within our colleagues' base, and help ensure equitable access to our COVID-19 vaccine and treatment.\nLast year, Pfizer published an industry-first retrospective analysis of demographic data of US participants in 213 of our interventional clinical trials that initiated enrollment from 2011 through 2020. The analysis demonstrated that overall trial participation of Black or African-American individuals was at the US census level, 14.3% versus 13.4%. Participation of Hispanic or Latino individuals was below US census, 15.9% versus 18.5%. Female participation was at US census, 51.1% versus 50.8%. We published this analysis to be transparent, and for it to serve as the baseline as we measure progress in this area. We believe that diversity in trials is a matter of equity and good science, and are taking decisive steps designed to improve diversity in our trials. Our goal is to achieve racially and ethnically diverse participation at or above US census or disease prevalence levels, as appropriate, in all our trials.\nThe second item I want to highlight is the significant progress we are making in diversifying our colleague base, particularly at more senior-level positions. In the last three years, for example, we have increased the percentage of women at the Vice President level and above globally from 32% to 42. Over the same time frame, we have increased the percentage of minorities at the Vice President level and above in the US from 19% to 25. The third item I wanted to highlight is the progress we are making to help ensure our COVID-19 vaccine and oral treatment are accessible by everyone, everywhere.\nI am thrilled to say that we remain on track to meet or exceed our goal of delivering at least 2 billion doses of our vaccine to low and middle-income countries by the end of 2022, having just met our goal of delivering the first 1 billion by the end of 2021. I also want to highlight two data points about our 2 billion dose commitment. 1 billion of these doses are being provided to the poorest countries completely free of charge. Thanks to our agreement with the US government, Pfizer is providing these doses to the US government at a not-for-profit price, and the government is then providing them to the poorest countries for free. The 1 billion doses we delivered in 2021 represented 37% of all doses we delivered this last year.\nIn terms of our oral COVID-19 treatment, we have signed a Voluntary License Agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool, which we hope will lead to expanded access pending country regulatory authorization or approval in 95 low and middle-income countries that account for approximately 53% of the world's population. Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that the compensation committee of our board of directors has been reviewing methods to link executive compensation with ESG performance, which we expect to begin this year. For details regarding the impact our ESG strategy had on our business in 2021, please keep an eye out for Pfizer's 2021 ESG report, which will be published online in mid-March. In summary, 2021 was an outstanding year for Pfizer, and we look forward to continuing to apply the lessons learned from COVID-19 to deliver breakthroughs for patients across all our therapeutic areas.\nWe remain focused on being nimble, investing in our R&D organization, and exploring dynamic partnerships that will enable us to fully realize the power of our science. None of this is possible without the contributions of our amazingly purpose-driven colleagues who continue to rise to the challenge of addressing the world's most devastating diseases. In 2021, our colleagues exceeded expectations. Therefore, we will once again use part of the bonus pool that the board approved for bonus-eligible colleagues and executives to provide a one-time special COVID-19 circumstances bonus to our non-bonus-eligible colleagues across the board, to reward them for their hard work, and to help them cover personal, family, and living expenses incurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that, I will turn it over to Mikael to update you on our R&D efforts. After, Mikael Frank will provide financial details on the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2022.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Albert. I'm delighted to share updates from this quarter as we continue to deliver first-in-class science. Today, I will share updates from our COVID-19 programs and select other assets in our pipeline. Let's start with PAXLOVID. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to burden public health, we have advanced the science on our novel oral antiviral therapeutic. Importantly, we see consistent, potent antiviral activity in vitro against all current variants of concern, including both Delta and Omicron. This would be expected from how the compound was designed. On the left, you can see a crystal structure showing how tightly Nirmatrelvir binds to the active site of the Omicron variant. History has told us from the HIV protease field that the closer the therapeutic is designed to mimic the substrate, the harder it is for resistance to emerge.\nThat combined with the essential nature of the protease, the short duration of treatment, and the co-dosing with Ritonavir to drug exposures that are over five to six times the amount of compound needed to kill the virus in an in vitro assay suggests there's reduced risk for resistance. External data support our findings. In this slide, the lower values, the stronger potency, illustrated by Nirmatrelvir being on the lower end of the Y-axis on the left, having the most potent activity. Nirmatrelvir maintains in vitro potency in the low nanomolar range. As you can see in these graphs that include other authorized or approved therapeutics, on the left is in vitro data from a study done with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Pfizer. Nirmatrelvir demonstrated potent antiviral activity as measured by IC50, a measure of drug efficacy indicating the concentration needed to inhibit infection by half.\nThis is consistent with findings from the Rega Institute at KU Leuven in Belgium, shown on the right. We anticipate a new drug application decision by the FDA in the high-risk population in the second half of 2022, pivotal readouts of our household contact and standard risk studies in the second quarter and second half of 2022, respectively, and a study starting in children six to 18 years old in the first quarter of 2022. In the standard risk study, we're expanding enrollment by 750 non-hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19, and vaccinated standard risk patients may also be eligible, provided a last SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was received at least 12 months prior to screening. This expansion will allow us to further evaluate the secondary endpoint seen in the interim analysis, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization and no deaths in the treated compared to placebo.\nWe also are advancing work on our potential next-generation SARS-CoV antiviral with the aim of achieving similar high clinical efficacy in planned coronavirus design properties that maintain activity with a favorable safety profile and counter potential viral resistance, but without the need for Ritonavir boosting. A first-in-human study is expected in the second half of 2022. We also continue to advance vaccine development and have achieved emergency use authorization for use in children as young as age five. Effectiveness data for three doses of the vaccine for people 12 years and older, and early laboratory data observed with Delta and other variants of concern, including Omicron, suggest that people vaccinated with three doses may have a higher degree of protection against both symptomatic and severe outcomes compared to two primary doses.\nInformed by this data, in addition to the immuno bridging data, we are evaluating a third 3-microgram dose in our study of children 6 months through 4 years of age, with the belief that the third dose may be optimal for this age group. However, as pediatric cases and hospitalization are at an all-time high, FDA urged us to start the rolling EUA authorization submission with the two-dose efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety data we have accumulated thus far, while we continue to collect data, including from third-dose administration. We plan to submit third-dose data once available. In the meantime, FDA has scheduled an advisory committee meeting for 15 February to consider the two-dose pediatric data collected today.\nIf emergency use authorization of two doses is granted and the CDC recommends usage, parents will have the opportunity to begin a COVID-19 vaccination series for the children between 6 months and 4 years of age while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose. Turning to the adult population, in the wake of surging Omicron cases, in January, we completed a lab analysis of the effect of a third-dose boost of COMIRNATY on live virus neutralization. Encouragingly, there was a more than 25-fold increase in Omicron live virus neutralization titers observed between the day of dose 3 and one month post dose 3. We observed a moderate four-month post-dose 3 antibody decay for wild type and Omicron variant. Between one month and four months post dose 3, neutralizing titers were 1.6 and 2-fold lower for wild type and the Omicron variant, respectively.\nWe're now starting to see effects of a third-dose boost in maintaining a high level of protection against Omicron in the real world. These data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California show Omicron-related emergency department visits without-hospitalization on top, and hospitalization on the bottom. Three doses of COMIRNATY provided better vaccine effectiveness against Omicron than two doses, and there was high vaccine effectiveness of three doses against Omicron-related hospitalization, similar to Delta-related hospitalization. We did see some waning of effectiveness against emergency department admissions due to Omicron three months or more after third dose, which suggests the potential need for another boost of the current vaccine or an Omicron-based vaccine. We have started an Omicron-based vaccine candidate trial in adults 18 to 55 years of age. This study will evaluate more than 1,400 participants across three cohorts.\nThose who have already received two doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one or two doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. Those who have already received three doses of the current vaccine 90 to 180 days prior to enrollment will receive one dose of the current vaccine or the Omicron-based vaccine. Those who are vaccine naive will receive three doses of the Omicron-based vaccine. This study is part of our science-based approach to develop a variant-based vaccine that we hope achieves a similar level of protection against Omicron as the current vaccine has with both wild type and early variants, but with potentially longer duration of protection. Now, let's turn to our next-generation CDK inhibitors for cancer. Most patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer eventually develop resistance to both endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy despite their transformative efficacy.\nInhibition of CDK2 delivered with a CDK-selective active drug or a triple-active CDK2/4/6 agent may prevent, delay, or reverse resistance and prolong survival. These are data from a subset in the CDK2/4/6 inhibitor phase one dose escalation and anti-tumor activity study of heavily pretreated patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. The most improvement in terms of tumor size reduction was seen in patients treated with monotherapy or in combination with fulvestrant. We observed three confirmed partial responses in three patients with stable disease for more than 12 months. One patient has been receiving ongoing treatment for more than 28 months. There's been an acceptable safety profile at the recommended phase two dose, which is 25mg twice daily. We plan to conduct the phase one dose expansion expected to complete it in the fourth quarter of this year.\nSelective CDK2 inhibition with a CDK2 only inhibitor may allow dose titration and has the potential to be used in combination with approved CDK inhibitors such as Palbociclib or other next-generation CDK selective inhibitors. There were two confirmed partial responses in the phase one study of our selective CDK2 inhibitor in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor HER2 negative breast cancer who had received progress on prior CDK4/6 inhibition and endocrine therapy. One patient had a maximum tumor shrinkage of 54% following CDK2 inhibitor treatment for approximately eight months, and the second had 100% shrinkage of all target lesions following treatment per RECIST in nine months. We are showing scans of the first patient at baseline and eight weeks. There was an acceptable safety profile as a monotherapy, and we're currently exploring combination. We expect the phase one two study to be completed in the second quarter of 2023.\nNow, let's turn to our six-valent Lyme disease vaccine candidate, which we are developing in partnership with Valneva. We have received further positive data from our phase II proof of concept study and expect to start phase 3 in the third quarter of this year with a dosing regimen of zero, two, and six months to prime, followed by routine boosters before the start of a Lyme season. Our phase II study is continuing and includes the pediatric population ages 5 to 17 years. Since Lyme disease is seasonal, our goal is to establish a regimen that results in high antibodies at the beginning of each season. We therefore looked at the boost one year after the primary series.\nWe saw substantial boost antibody response in phase two to all six serotypes present in North America and Europe, followed the three-dose primary series vaccination schedule, with a 14 to 31-fold rise in season one and a 51 to 69-fold rise in season two. The vaccine candidate was generally well tolerated at all those levels tested, and we are excited about further development and the potential to help prevent this debilitating disease. Last quarter, we told you that we saw robust dystrophin expression out to one year in our Duchenne Dystrophy Gene Therapy phase I-B study. I will show you encouraging functional motor data in a moment. We recently shared some very sad news that the DMD patients with advanced disease in the non-ambulatory cohort of the phase 1B trial passed away after presenting with hypovolemia and cardiogenic shock.\nThe patients were 16 years old and the first in the non-ambulatory cohort treated with RAPAMUNE along with steroids as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. RAPAMUNE is not used in the phase three ambulatory study. Like most non-ambulatory DMD patients, he had more advanced disease with underlying cardiac dysfunction. There is evidence of an active viral infection, and we're investigating how this may have contributed to the outcome. Additional assessment will be required to define next steps to restart the phase one B study in non-ambulatory patients who are more progressed in the disease. I will now share data from this study. The ambulatory cohort, sorry, I had one more sentence to say here. Nineteen patients were enrolled in this study, 16 of whom received a dose selective for our phase three program, and three of whom received a previously studied lower dose.\nAt one year post-treatment, there was a 5.6-point improvement in ambulatory function as measured by North Star ambulatory assessment compared to an external control match for age and baseline function. This is particularly encouraging given that patients at this age and stage of disease typically experience a considerable decline in ambulatory function, as illustrated by the external control. On the right, we show a timing study with six participants nearing or more than three years in treatment. The ambulatory cohort in phase I-B is similar but slightly older on average to the population in the phase III CRO trial. Considering the favorable benefit to risk profile in this study and observed in the ambulatory patient population, and in consultation with the data monitoring committee, we believe the safety profile of our DMD gene therapy is manageable in this patient group.\nAdditional mitigation is being added to our study in consultation with DMC and other medical experts. Pending regulatory feedback, we anticipate phase III study sites to begin reopening in the next few months, with the potential to report top-line results and, subject to clinical trial success, submit the delay by the end of 2023. Turning now to internal medicine and Ponsegromab, our candidate for cachexia due to cancer. It targets GDF15. GDF15 is frequently elevated in cancer patients, drives reduction of appetite and body weight loss, and is associated with poor outcomes. There may also be potential to treat cachexia associated with other chronic diseases such as heart failure and COPD. We have encouraging phase I-b data, which I will show next.\nPonsegromab was evaluated in 10 cancer patients who are undergoing anti-tumor treatment and had more than 5% body weight loss in the last six months or more than 2% body weight loss with a body mass index of less than 20kg/m² or diagnosed sarcopenia. Ponsegromab administration was found to suppress circulating GDF15 levels in cancer cachexia patients below the level observed in healthy subjects. Preliminary data from the phase 1b trial showed Ponsegromab treatment resulted in significant body weight gain compared to historical placebo. You can see the nice trend in body weight increase remained even after the dosing was stopped at week 12. The gray dotted line indicates the historical cutoff associated with improved survival.\nWe are co-developing a companion diagnostic with Roche Diagnostics designed to enable precision medicine, and we expect to start the phase II study in cancer cachexia in the fourth quarter of this year. Injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists offer potent lowering of glucose and weight in diabetic and obese patients, with proven cardiovascular benefits, but this drug class is underutilized due to its injectable administration route. Our small molecule oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, danuglipron, could potentially offer a convenient oral alternative to injectables and is being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and NASH. It has been developed in our internal medicine research group, with a vision to expand the use of this potent, easily administered GLP-1 drug class to a primary care setting. Here are data from the phase two study in type 2 diabetes.\nWe recorded strong dose-dependent reduction in both HbA1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels, and body weight compared to the marginal effect noted with placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment with a 200mg twice daily dose, HbA1c decreased by almost 1.6% and body weight decreased by 5.4kg. The safety and tolerability profile is consistent with the GLP-1 class, and the most frequent adverse event rates were GI-related. We expect to start a phase 2B titration optimization study mid 2022 with doses up to 200mg twice a day and complete the phase 2B study in non-diabetic subjects with obesity in the first quarter of next year. Finally, here are select recent and upcoming milestones from across the pipeline. The solid blue dots represent milestones achieved, and the open blue dots represent anticipated milestones. Programs involved are major anticipated events.\nSome of the programs on the right have already been designated as light speed, meaning they have accelerated development timelines or are being considered for light speed designation. Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank Maurice Zauderer, our outgoing Chief Scientific Officer of the Internal Medicine Research Unit, for his immense contribution over the last seven years, and welcome Will Sessa, who joins us from Yale School of Medicine following a decades-long career in academia, including service as Vice Chair of Pharmacology, Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Vascular Biology and Therapeutics program at Yale. Will is an eminent lead in the field, a groundbreaking scientist, and a celebrated innovator, and I know he will bring his tremendous vision and insights to our investigation of cardiovascular metabolic diseases. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions.\nNow, let me turn it over to Frank.\n\nFrank D'Amelio\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nThanks. Thanks, Mikael. I know you've seen our release, so let me provide a few highlights regarding the financials. The COVID-19 vaccine once again had a positive impact on our quarterly results, and Albert and Mikael have already addressed key points on the COVID-19 landscape. Turning to the income statement, revenue increased 106% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by COVID-19 vaccine sales and strong performance from a number of early key growth drivers. Looking at the revenue, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine direct sales and alliance revenues and PAXLOVID contribution, the fourth quarter was slower than the first nine months of the year, declining by 2% operationally. As we discussed during our third quarter call, there was a 4% negative impact, or approximately $500 million, from fewer selling days in the US and international.\nExcluding that impact, operational growth would have been 2%, which is still lower than the mid to high single-digit growth we had experienced during the rest of the year. This was factored into our forecast for the year, but let me briefly walk you through this. In our Biopharma Business, you will remember that the fourth quarter of 2021 faced a tough comp from the fourth quarter of 2020 for Prevnar, as pneumococcal vaccinations were strong ahead of COVID-19 vaccine availability. Excluding vaccines from the current and comparable period, we would have had 5 percentage points to the growth. Adjusting for the unusual comp period differences related to vaccines and selling days, our revenue growth would have been approximately 7%, which is similar to what we've been delivering lately. For the year, operational revenue growth was 92%.\nExcluding COMIRNATY, direct sales and alliance revenues, and PAXLOVID, 2021 operational revenue growth was 6%. This is consistent with our projected revenue CAGR of at least 6% from 2020 through the end of 2025. Of course, there will be some variability in quarterly and annual growth rates due to a variety of factors, but we continue to expect at least a 6% CAGR through 2025. The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 16 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which is almost entirely driven by the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the fourth quarter increased primarily due to increased product-level spending, including COMIRNATY, and higher healthcare reform sales-based fees.\nThe increase in adjusted R&D expense this quarter was primarily driven by increased investments in late-stage pipeline projects, including additional spending related to our oral COVID-19 treatment.\n\nOperator\n\nHe's back in now.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSVP and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nFrank, I think you were disconnected.\n\nFrank D'Amelio\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nChris?\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSVP and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes, we can hear you, Frank. Go ahead.\n\nFrank D'Amelio\n\nCFO, Pfizer",
    "content2": "Okay. I'm not sure I left off, but I think what I'll do is start with the 2022 financial guidance. We've again provided total company guidance, which includes the business with the COVID-19 vaccine. We will continue to provide insight into our expected revenues for COMIRNATY, and now for the first time, we'll also provide some color on our expected revenues for PAXLOVID. However, note that we'll no longer be providing EPS guidance for the business excluding COMIRNATY. Similarly, we won't provide EPS guidance for PAXLOVID. Our revenue guidance represents a record for Pfizer, and we expect total company revenue to be in a range of $98 to 102 billion, representing an operational growth rate of 24% midpoint.\nPlease consider that this revenue range reflects approximately $1.1 billion of anticipated negative impact from changes in foreign currencies, and also the impact of the loss of Meridian sales of approximately $300 million, both of which your models may not take into account. Regarding our COVID-related revenues, we now expect the COVID-19 vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $32 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion compared to our prior guidance provided on 17 December. For PAXLOVID, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion. This means that, excluding the COVID-related revenues, we expect sales to be $46 billion at the midpoint, representing operational growth of 5%. While this is slightly below the 6% CAGR that we continue to expect between 2020 and 2025, I would remind you that there will be volatility along the way. Let me give you some detail on our cost and expense guidance.\nFor adjusted cost of sales, we are expecting a range of 32.2% to 34.2. Given that we are now more than 12 months past the launch of COMIRNATY, we expect its negative impact on our cost of sales margins to be less than it was in 2021, assuming a similar level of revenues. Further, PAXLOVID is expected to have a very positive impact on cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2022. On adjusted SI&A, we expect $12.5 to 13.5 billion, an increase of $900 million at the midpoint. We expect our adjusted R&D guidance range to be $10.5 to 11.5 billion at the midpoint, that is about $500 million higher than last year. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the year is somewhat higher than 2021 at approximately 16%.\nThese assumptions yield an adjusted GLP-1 EPS range of $6.35 to 6.55, or 47% operational growth at the midpoint compared to 2021, excluding an expected $0.06 negative impact from foreign exchange. I'd like to point out some additional information which may be helpful for your models. You will note that our guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 5.8 billion, which represents an increase of approximately 100 million shares over 2021. This accounts for the number of shares that we normally issue for employee compensation annually. The increase of 100 million shares over 2021 decreases our EPS by about $0.10 at the midpoint. I noticed that most of your models instead assume a flat share count for 2022 as compared to 2021. From the first quarter of 2022 and going forward, we've made a decision to modify our adjusted financials treatment of amortization of intangibles.\nPreviously, we only excluded amortization related to large mergers and acquisitions. Now exclude all intangible asset amortization expense. This is anticipated to contribute $0.06 to our 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share, and helps improve comparability with our peers. 2022 guidance once again assumes no share repurchases. We will note that Pfizer did not repurchase shares in either 2020 or 2021. While we continue to have outstanding unused authorization to repurchase another $5.3 billion of stock, it can be opportunistic. Given the potentially value-enhancing business development opportunities which are available to us, we do not expect to repurchase shares in 2022. Our word on our 32% stake in the consumer joint venture with GSK. As you know, GSK has announced its intention to engage in a demerger transaction for at least 80% of its 68% stake in the JV in the summer of 2022.\nWe talked about our stake as a non-core asset whose value we will seek to realize over time. While we have determined neither the manner nor timing of how we will do so, there are a number of possible alternatives, and we will attempt to monetize this asset in the manner which will create the most value for our shareholders. We receive approximately $600 million in pre-tax income from the JV annually, and this will not change as a result of the demerger transaction, and our guidance assumes that this will continue throughout 2022 with no change to our 32% stake. Let me quickly remind you of some assumptions and context on the projected COVID-19 vaccine contribution and our collaboration agreement. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine collaboration construct is a 50/50 gross profit split.\nPfizer books the vast majority of the global collaboration revenue, except for Germany and Turkey, where we receive a profit share from BioNTech, and we do not participate in the China region. We continue to expect that we can manufacture 4 billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The $1 billion increase in expected COVID vaccine revenues to approximately $32 billion in 2022 primarily represents the impact of contracts signed since mid-December, which is the cutoff for our prior guidance. While we cannot predict what may be needed due to Omicron or other variants, I would also caution you that there is less potential upside to this guidance through the year compared to the situation we faced in 2021, when the vaccine was newly available and few people had received any doses of the vaccine.\nAs you will remember, our cost of sales for the COVID-19 vaccine revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs, applicable royalty expenses, and a payment to BioNTech representing 50% gross profit split. We expect that the adjusted income before tax margin for the COVID-19 vaccine contribution to be slightly higher than the high 20s as a percentage of revenue that we had in 2021. Unlike the situation for COMIRNATY, demand for PAXLOVID should have upside from these levels depending on the outcomes of discussions with certain governments, and potential purchases for stockpiling against future coronavirus pandemics. If we remove the projected COVID-19 vaccine and PAXLOVID contribution from both periods, you will see that we expect the 2022 revenue range to be $45 to 47 billion, representing approximately 5% operational revenue growth at the midpoint.\nPlease remember our guidance excludes the former revenue contribution of approximately $300 million for Meridian, and all 2021 quarters have been recast to exclude Meridian's discontinued operations accounting for its divestiture. Going forward, we will not give earnings guidance excluding the estimated income from our commodity direct sales, alliance revenues, and PAXLOVID. However, to help you with your forecasting, a couple of minutes ago, I gave you my view on 2022 COMIRNATY pre-tax margins. For PAXLOVID, I would think about its margins as being typical for a small molecule drug, and unlike COMIRNATY, it is expected not to be dilutive to pre-tax earnings. To help you further, several years ago before COVID-19 existed, I spoke about our business being on a path to a 40% plus pre-tax margin level in 2022 for the business, excluding COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID.\nGoing forward, we will continue to be prudent in our capital allocation activities, with the opportunities for deployment shown here on this slide. In summary, exceptionally strong quarter and year based on continued strong performance for our growth drivers. During the year, we raised guidance, and for the year, we met or exceeded our guidance in all key metrics. Our pipeline continues to advance, and we have invested record amounts to support that advance. Last week, Arena shareholders voted to approve Pfizer's acquisition of the company. We look forward to a targeted closing of the Arena acquisition as soon as the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, including antitrust approvals. We continue to expect to be active in regards to business development throughout 2022, as we continue to get access to the best external science and bring breakthroughs to patients in 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&A session.\n\nChris Stevo\n\nSVP and Chief Investor Relations Officer, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Frank. Apologies everyone for those technical difficulties. I just want to remind you we do have the prepared remarks posted to the website, so if there's anything you missed because of difficulties, please refer to the prepared remarks. Given the technical difficulties, we're going to try to let the Q&A session run a little longer to answer people's questions. Sylvia, first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Securities.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to add to the first one on PAXLOVID guidance, I know you guys are factoring in only signed agreements, but could you give us a general sense as to agreements or doses perhaps that are under discussion, and is that dependent on supply ramping? The second question, on external BD Albert, I understand the strategy. I think the uncertainty is really the ability to scale some of the products that you've brought in. If COVID is less of a long-term contributor than you assume, what's the appetite to do higher impact, larger deals? You clearly have the capacity. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Angela, you want to take a little bit of PAXLOVID?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nPresident Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, Pfizer\n\nSure. Currently, we are in active discussions with over 100 countries and governments around the world. I'd say that the discussions are going really well. In terms of where we are with the contracting, as you say, we've included some of the contracts that we already have. Of course, this number changes every day, and contracts are being secured and distribution agreements being secured literally on a day-to-day basis. I think that this is a number to watch out for, and we do continue to expect movement. I think that there is a tremendous amount of interest for our product, and certainly as the clinical program continues to develop and emerge. As you know, we only have the high-risk study right now. We still have the standard risk and the prophylaxis that's coming up.\nI think that the full clinical program will also be another point of impetus for contracting and ordering. I think it's going just really well, and more to come on this front.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Aamir, maybe some comments on the BD.\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief Business and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. Thanks for the question, Geoff. I think in terms of the top line, we're going to be incredibly flexible. We have said repeatedly that we are most interested in compounds that have potential to be real breakthroughs. This can take the form of later-stage clinical development as well as earlier-stage medical innovation. We're going to bias to the TAs, oncology, INI, rare vaccines, internal medicine, and hospital, where we've got the scientific chops to make good choices and add real value. We're going to be flexible on the deal types. Acquisitions are obviously very much in the cards, but strategic partnerships and alliances are as well. In fact, some of our best successes have come from some capital-light collaborations.\nIf we see a larger opportunity that's strategic, creates value, and meets the criteria that I just described, we've obviously got the balance sheet to utilize to do that. We certainly will look at those. We're going to talk about and focus on the priorities that I described more so than synergy-driven deals per se.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Aamir. Just to add to both points, because I'm sure that both will be asked a lot. On PAXLOVID, clearly, numbers could become way bigger than what we have right now, but this is not something that we have done in the past, and we don't plan to do right now to give based on what could be the potential as a guidance. We are giving guidance based on what it is more or less secure, either signed deals or already agreed but not signed yet, deals but agreed prices and volumes, I mean. Clearly, if you remember when we started with the vaccine, in the beginning, we had a guidance of, I think, $15 billion in the first quarter, something like that. Eventually, we made $36 billion. Here, we started even stronger in our first projections with PAXLOVID.\nThat's why we manufacture and we move ahead with our plans. Already, we are at 120 million treatments, and we have the ability to go higher if the discussions that we are having all materialize. In terms of also the business development, I just want to emphasize that because I'm getting a lot of this question on the size. We are agnostic to size. Where we are biased, it is deals that in order to justify the premium, we will have to do significant cost synergies. These could be very profitable deals for other, let's say, periods of the history of the company, not now.\nRight now, the company is having a manufacturing machine, but it is performing at its best, an R&D machine, but it's performing at its best, a commercial machine that keeps being the leader in the industry in terms of their ability to execute and deliver. The last thing I want to do is to do a deal, but in order to justify the premium to the shareholders of the other company, we will have to shut down manufacturing sites and consolidate research sites and consolidate field forces so that we can justify, so we can generate, the cost synergies. This is not the time to disrupt the momentum of the company. This is the time to bring into this manufacturing machine, the research machine, the commercial machine, more substrate in addition to what we produce organically ourselves. This is why the business development is aiming in these areas.\nLet's go to the next one.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I'm going to go back to PAXLOVID. There have been some news reports talking about logistics and access issues for PAXLOVID, and I understand that supply is tight for now. I would love to get your thoughts on how you're working on improving the logistics when the supply is no longer an issue, especially in a world where home testing would become a norm and one needs to take this drug within five days of diagnostics. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nI wouldn't say that we have logistical issues of supply, but Angela, would you like to take that, please?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nPresident Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, Pfizer\n\nSure. First of all, again, our deliveries and our allocations for the doses have gone extremely well here in the US. Just to give you some context, 265,000 doses have been allocated by the US government since the EUA was approved. Of that 265,000, 85% of all the doses have been ordered. We see a range of ordering patterns from the states. Some states are ordering 100% of the allocation. Others are at 80%, 70%, so on and so forth. There is really only a handful that have not really ordered up to their allocation, but I would say for the most part, the weekly orders are going up and increasing week by week, and there is a very strong placement of orders. I would say that the drawdown of the doses and the utilization is going really well.\nIt differs by state what the allocations are and how that's going. As Albert said, I don't know that we have logistical, there are not logistical issues. I think initially, what was difficult was that it was not clear where the doses were being located because every state had a different system for where to actually distribute PAXLOVID from. There are a number of tools now that have gone up online, both at the state level, as well as on Pfizer's website. We've taken the state government tool and also loaded it on our website, so that both HCPs and patients can see where PAXLOVID is being, where it's available, and where the orders, as well as prescriptions, can be placed. I think in that regard, that's all been ironed out.\nI think looking forward into the future, I mean, clearly, having a seamless sort of end-to-end from diagnosis, positive results to then being able to prescribe quickly and having the patient be able to acquire the drug quickly is our goal. I think on all of those fronts, we're working with a number of partners, both from a testing and a diagnostics perspective, but also from a telemedicine perspective, and from a pharmacy perspective, to ensure that we have as fast and as efficient, I can say, a patient journey, right, from diagnosis right until treatment. All of that is in place, and you'll hear more, you'll continue to hear more about that as the launch and as the utilization increases.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nTo punctuate and give a little bit of context to what Angela said, the 85% that has already been ordered from the quantities that we are making available to the government is a very, very high number. For example, the same number in the first month for vaccines, if you remember well, if you remember from that time, was dramatically lower than that because it takes time for the states to get their act together. It is really variable state by state. There are states right now that, once the quantities are made available to them, are ordering immediately. There are states that take their time until they get their act together for the distribution. In general, way, way, way more efficient than what used to be in the first month of the vaccine.\nAlso, what is extremely important is that every week, there is constant replenishment, which, although we do not have right now data for scripts because it's too early, what we do have is that the quantities that the states are accumulating, they are disappearing, and then immediately they are placing orders. I would say we are pretty happy with the way that the first month, the collaboration with the US government went in terms of allocating doses. There is dramatically also improvement in the tools, as Angela described.\nThe bigger improvement will come from the fact that the second month will make available way more quantities, and the third month, way more quantities, because the issues right now for people trying to find it, it is that it is in few places in the state because you can't expand the network of places that it is available when you have smaller quantities. That will be very, very different this month. Basically, all over the place, I think in the third month, significant quantities will be delivered. Okay. I think let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide an update on the FTC review process for the Arena deal. If I'm not mistaken, there was a recent procedural move where you and Pfizer withdrew and refiled the HSR Act filing essentially to allow the FTC an additional 30 days for review. I'd also love for you to walk me through your assumptions on how you forecast $13 billion in revenue from BD transactions. That would imply that you have specific targets and a combination of targets in mind. Any color here that you could provide would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, thank you very much. On the last one, just to make sure that this is not our assumption. Our assumption is way higher of the $13 billion. What I just gave you, it is what is the consensus of the deals that we have signed so far. On the FTC review, I would like to ask Doug to provide maybe a review on that. Doug Lankler, our General Counsel.\n\nDoug Lankler\n\nEVP and Chief Legal Officer, Pfizer\n\nYes. As you pointed out, we did request to refile, which is not unusual. The deal is, of course, subject to customary closing conditions, typical antitrust clearance, and shareholder approval, which, as you know, we've received. We don't expect a significant break in time from our proposed sense that the deal will close in the first half of this year. We still expect it to close in the first half of this year.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Aamir, although I did explain that this is consensus numbers, not our numbers, you want to make any other comment on the $13 billion of 2030 revenues that consensus forecasts for the deals that we have signed?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief Business and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add is we feel very good about the progression of all of the substrate in the deal since 2019 that Albert outlined. We've seen a significant number of approvals and EUAs in that group, submissions, as well as quite a few phase three starts. We think that that substrate is progressing well. The $13 billion is the consensus number. Our expectations of what's there are materially higher. There are a number of transactions. We spoke to Trillium, Biohaven, and even some of the recent things that we've done in mRNA that are not yet factored in the consensus forecast on those transactions.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Omar Rafat from Evercore ISI.\n\nOmar Rafat\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Perhaps two on vaccines today, if I may. First, on the flu vaccine, I know you've had a trial ongoing on your mod RNA since September. I noticed you just initiated a new trial of a self-amplifying mRNA for flu. I wonder if the decision to progress a second mRNA program in flu was triggered by any emerging data from your first-gen flu phase one that's been ongoing. Secondly, on Omicron-specific booster, perhaps in light of some of the emerging data on immunogenicity differences or lack thereof versus regular COVID vaccine, I guess my question is, what's your confidence on ability to show superiority of an Omicron-specific booster versus regular, and what would be the regulatory criteria? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. I think Mikael can take the question. On the flu vaccine, just to make sure that I clarify, the plan was always to initiate an assay mRNA for flu and run the two programs in parallel. It's not that we saw data that forced us to do assay and A. It was always the plan. We are advancing new forms of mRNA technology, and assay is one of the most promising next generation of RNA technologies. Mikael, any comments on that and on the Omicron-specific, our confidence for superiority?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Yes, we are accumulating, first of all, from our mod mRNA data trial, data on various regimens and on multivalent constructs. We remain of the view that we aspire to develop a flu vaccine. Currently, the most aggressive timelines are focused on the mod mRNA. Our plan is to develop something that has differentiation versus the current quadrivalent standard of care. I know other companies have spoken about being similar, while at this moment, we still see opportunities to possibly differentiate with an mRNA based on mod mRNA. As Albert alluded to, we are actually filing the IND for the self-amplified. I think the protocol may have gone up already on clinicaltrials.gov, but dosing is going to be within the next couple of months or so.\nIt's entirely based on us aiming to develop that platform, which has particular relevance for combinations vaccine, given that possibly we expect to have much lower mRNA burden and can, over time, build a vaccine combination of several different pathogens. We'll keep you updated on progress with the mod mRNA flu, and we certainly see data that suggests that this is a feasible path, and we are working to refine our approach to aim for a differentiated vaccine.\n\nOmar Rafat\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nWhat about Omicron and how confident we are about the superiority?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nYeah. The regulatory path is that we expect to have a successful Omicron boost, which will show higher neutralizing antibodies for Omicron versus a similar boost by the wild-type vaccine, and acceptable titers to the other previously available strains to provide preserved broad protection, but possibly with higher Omicron. I really think we should let the science play out here. We are talking about a number of weeks before we get data. As I alluded to, it has three different arms on top of three doses: Omicron versus a wild-type, or that was on top of three previous doses, on top of two previous vaccine doses, one or two Omicron. That will be a very interesting data set. Then Omicron on naive. I think it's a really interesting trial, and we'll extract a lot of data, and we'll report whether we can get that superiority.\nIn any case, I would just want to punctuate that our current vaccine is active after three doses and raised relevant neutralizing antibodies. The T cell responses that we see are likely the ones that contribute in real-world evidence to provide effective protection of the current vaccine against hospitalization and death. Omicron vaccine is an interesting opportunity that we'll learn more about. Our science is progressing against several dimensions on how to further improve over time mRNA vaccines, although there are pretty good ones. You should expect Pfizer to continue to be a leader in this field through multiple approaches, together with BioNTech.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question for you is, what are the key pushes and pulls to your underlying business, excluding COVID? What gives you confidence that you can still meet that top-line sales guidance that you gave through 2025, despite some of the volatility that we're seeing right now? I just wanted to ask you on your TL1A antibody and where you are with development of that product and the reporting of data. Have you changed any of the timelines for when you'll report data? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you very much. On the 6%, what gives us confidence? It is that we keep meeting the goal. As I said, we set the goal in 2019 for a 6% all the way CAGR. We had the year to date, we are at 6% right now. The year, particularly, it is at 5% for the underlying business. There is a little bit of volatility. We knew that this would be a year that we are losing some of the revenues of Chantix compared to the previous year, which affects quite significantly this deal, which, as we are launching new products, they are coming up. Maybe I will ask Angela to give a little bit more details on the inputs and how this is progressing. Also, Mikael on the antibody question. Angela?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nPresident Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Luis. I think the 6% confidence is really driven by two things. First of all, the launches that will take place between now and 2025, which will continue to drive growth for us. Also, importantly, in our inline portfolio, Luis, every single one of our products still has opportunities to grow. They can grow from a number of different ways, right? There are still underdiagnosed patients. From new diagnoses, you can continue to drive a tremendous amount of growth in ELIQUIS and in Vyndaqel. In many of our products, we still have class growth. I mean, think about the CDK4/6s, think about XTANDI, think about BRAFTOVI, MEKTOVI. These are all therapies that are still, I think, underutilized from a class perspective. There is growth there.\nFor all of them, there's the opportunity to grow in terms of market share, just given just the strong clinical profile and strong lifecycle support that we have for all of our products. I think we see a tremendous amount of growth still. We just have not tapped out of growth in our core inline brands. You add on top of that the launch brands. This is where we're going to get our growth from.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Angela. On the TL1A, as you remember, at the previous earnings call, we showed some really strong data in the range of 34% endoscopic improvement, and with a biomarker of 48% in patients, way above expected standard of care. That trial has enrolled very fast. It's fully enrolled. Full trial readout will be Q4. We are obviously considering, based on the encouraging data in the previous trials, the opportunity for interim analysis that pending data could allow us to accelerate the development of the program towards potential pivotal studies. All in, it's moving very well and very fast.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Just to be absolutely clear, I understand that Pfizer wants to be conservative on PAXLOVID, but it seems that Pfizer has merely scratched the surface on its 2022 potential, and that scratching of the surface is what's in 2022 PAXLOVID guidance. Please just tell me if you disagree with that statement. Secondly, just to be clear once again, do you not see growth for Pfizer overall in 2025 through 2030 without business development? Lastly, on Danuglipron, slide 39 shows some very good data. I'm curious, what was the discontinuation rate in the study? Can the dose be increased further? Does Pfizer expect additional weight loss beyond 12 weeks? Thank you very much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Let me take the first two questions, and then Mikael can take the research one. Look, it's not that we are giving conservative guidance. What we do, we have principles that we follow because otherwise you can be lost. The principles that we are following are that we are only giving guidance for contracts that have been signed or are very close to being signed because we have agreed on critical terms, predominantly, right? This is what you have heard about PAXLOVID. Clearly, this is only a very small fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture. It is a small fraction of things that we are discussing right now with different governments. We are not taking, for example, an approach where we take all the discussions that we are having with the different governments.\nWe risk adjust them to see how many things can go part through, and then we give a guidance. This is not what we do. We only give, and this is the same with the vaccines, things that have been signed or are really agreed by the time in a specific deadline. I think Frank said it was last week, I think, this deadline. Clearly, there is a lot of potential, but it is not that we are putting a little bit of our own conservatism in the numbers. We are following a principle so that we can always be clear with what we say and why we say. That's the thing. What about the study dose and the 12-week delay, Mikael?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nOn the Danuglipron, I'm pleased that you were happy and impressed with our data. Indeed, I would say the glucose loading through HbA1c and the body weight reduction are probably among the best in such a short treatment period. Tolerability and discontinuation rates improved versus previous study because we extended the dose titration from a week to two weeks. Overall, safety adverse events, I think, are very much in line with what you see, comparable titration approaches with injectable. Given that we see that we can improve tolerability and discontinuations with this medium titration rate, we have the next studies coming up will be a further slow dose titration, maybe up to a month or so. We think that may even bring readouts of efficacy further above this. We're very pleased with the profile.\nI think the next study will nail down for us those regimens and will help us to move with a strong profile into a potential pivotal study.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nAll right. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. A few questions. The RSV vaccine data previously said early 2022. Now you're saying first half 2022. Does that imply there's been some slippage? Because early, to me, I always felt that meant January, February, something like that. mRNA flu, second question, what's a realistic time frame for a potential regulatory filing of a product like that, assuming you find success in your trials? Last question, Ibrance, you say it's due to patient assistance programs. We haven't seen that impact other CDK4/6s, and I haven't generally heard about those programs impacting other brands, either at Pfizer or other companies. I'm wondering what else may be putting pressure on Ibrance. Are you having to cut price to maintain access?\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. What was your question on flu, team?\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nA realistic time frame for filing for approval of an mRNA flu vaccine.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Thank you. Thank you. Why don't we go, Mikael? What about RSV? You can speak about both. We have both now, adult and maternal, and then the mRNA. Angela, you speak about Ibrance.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nYeah. On the RSV, we have enrolled very well maternal and adult and are basically, I would say, fully enrolled. It is entirely to ensure we have the number of events that we were looking for. We expect both trials to read out whether it's somewhere between Q1, Q2, or at the later part of Q2. We'll just see as events accumulate. It is going very well. I feel very optimistic with RSV study to conclude, and we're looking forward to that data. mRNA flu, we are right now accumulating immunogenicity from several different types of dose regimens. If we are able to conclude with an optimal dose regimen using the mod mRNA, a potential phase II, phase III study could certainly be initiated this year. Of course, it's a little bit early to speculate before you have identified the right phase 2, 3 dose regimen.\nIf we would embark on such a study this year, we expect it can conclude very fast given our experience to run very large trials in this sector and this population of adults. We're talking about possible conclusion then within next year. I would say, one step at a time. We'll keep you informed. We are encouraged so far, and we'll go from there.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. What about Angela on the Ibrance?\n\nAngela Hwang\n\nPresident Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group, Pfizer\n\nI can confirm that the patient assistance program is indeed the primary reason for the decline in volume that you've seen on Ibrance. Just to give you some perspective, in Q4 2021, our PEP prescriptions were up 32% compared to where it was in Q4 2020. All of this is 53% more than what it was pre-COVID. This is really what has cost us a tremendous amount of paid prescriptions, and that's really the primary reason. We also saw, throughout the year, and this has been something that we've been watching quarter over quarter, just some slowdown in new patient starts. We've seen this sort of phenomenon across multiple products in our portfolio. There's a small contribution from that, but the largest contribution by far is truly this phenomenon we're seeing here in terms of PEP.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Angela. Before we move to the next question, I realized that I didn't answer one of the questions that Steve made, Steve Scala, about if we believe that we need business development to grow in the period 2025 to 2030. Clearly, this is not the belief right now. We think that we have a clear LOE number. We estimate around $17 billion. We have a pipeline that delivers more than the LOEs. Only organically, with what we have right now, in our calculations, we are on a positive growth trajectory. The $25 billion I just mentioned needs to be on top of everything, the balance between LOEs and internal environment like DAS, everything new that will be invented in the meantime, and, of course, the COVID trajectory through 2030. We don't need right now business development at all to grow.\nWhat we need business development is to maintain a high level of 6% growth top line all the way to 2030, for example. Let's go now to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nGlobal Head of Healthcare Research, Citi\n\nThank you. Couple of questions. First, what are your expectations that you'll need two shots of Omicron as opposed to one? The reason I ask is recently published animal models suggest that one Omicron mRNA vaccine actually generates lower levels of neutralizing antibody against Omicron than the ancestral spike variant, presumably due to antigenic thin. It obviously has implications for both revenues in terms of two shots, but also compliance. Second, perhaps you could comment on the outlook for CD47 and talk to the differences between your molecule and Gilead's, which obviously has run into some safety issues with trial suspension. Many thanks.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. I will take the first one very quickly so that I can give time to Mikael to speak about the second one. Look, we have to wait to see the results. I don't think all mRNA vaccines are the same. I don't think we should extrapolate preclinical data for one effort to what will be the clinical, let's say, results of the other effort. We are testing both. One shot, we are testing two shots. We are testing pretty soon hybrid vaccines. Everything that we have seen so far gives us confidence that we will have a very strong reaction and immunogenicity of an Omicron against Omicron. Of course, that's based on preclinical. We need to wait to see the first clinical data so that this assumption can be validated. With that, Mikael, what about the Gilead?\nYeah.\nBy the way, also, Andrew, you said what about your expectations? Our expectations are not based on one shot or two shots or five shots. Our expectations, as I said, it is contract signed as for last week with COMIRNATY. What we'll sign further on will be in addition to whatever we have given so far. Mikael on the Gilead.\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nYeah. The interest in our product from Trillium was triggered by its unique design. It is what we call a receptor fusion blocker protein in contrast to Magrolimab that you referred to, that's on hold, the Gilead antibody. It binds with a lower affinity to the target. That was by purpose to allow it particularly to accumulate on high-expressing cancer cells and less accumulate on red blood cells to cause not to cause anemia or hemolytic anemia. Indeed, in our studies that have generated proof of concept, we have seen single-agent activity in blood cancers with basically negligible effect on red blood cells. This is playing well out. We do not know why Magrolimab is on clinical hold. Of course, this differentiation that we have in our molecule may be one example of why our molecule has been doing so well this far.\nWhile we initially focus on lymphoid malignancies of the basal type, we think we also may become increasingly interested in going to the myeloid space where Magrolimab has been, AML and MDS, particularly if our profile now may be superior. We're waiting readout from such studies also. For us, the Trillium deal is delivering on all what we expected and may actually have upside due to its more unique profile.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Maybe just to start with on just some clarifications around guidance. I know you're not giving a lot of details around core versus COVID-related earnings this year, but there's a lot of questions on that front. If I just take the low end of your sales range at $45 billion, apply a 40% margin, tax adjust that, I think I'm getting a number somewhere around $2.60 per share at the low end. Is there any issues with that math I'm doing, or am I in the right ballpark there if I just want to think about a low end of core guidance for this year? My second question was on PAXLOVID. You're referencing here typical small molecule, I guess, gross margins for this one. Just help us frame that a bit more.\nI guess is something in the mid-80s a reasonable level to think about for gross margins for this product, or is it substantially higher or lower? I'm just trying to better understand profitability as we maybe think about some of these contracts coming forward this year and maybe that PAXLOVID number moving. Just the final one just to wrap up. I'm still trying to get my hands around the BD side of the business and kind of the approach. I guess, should we be thinking about a significantly different approach to business development for Pfizer today versus what the company was doing two or three years ago prior to the COVID upside? Is this more just a continuation of, I guess, the focus and what you were looking at if we're thinking back to 2019 as an example? Thanks so much.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. I'll take very quickly the third one, and then Frank can take the first two questions. I would say it is a continuation, but with a way more accelerated pace. I don't think we are changing what we were saying since 2019. We are going into the science, as Aamir said. We are going into areas that we think will make fewer mistakes in selecting the right targets. We will be more successful, so we will be able to meet at least the success rates of the industry. Our aim is to exceed them as we're selecting assets. We prefer to go to areas that we can add value, and there are significant areas that we can add value by becoming the preferred partner of several biotechs.\nWe have seen, as Aamir said, that some of the best deals we have done were not the most capital-intensive deals, right? All of that, we are learning. We are not going to relax the discipline that we are having in selecting, but we are going to intensify a lot our activity in that area because, of course, we think that now is the time, science is at the stage that we can find enough targets to be able to add value and create value. That's on the BD side. Now, Frank, a lot of financial questions for margins, guidance, etc.\n\nFrank D'Amelio\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nSure. Chris, on the walkthrough you did on the, I'll call it the business excluding COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID, I would use the midpoint on the revenue. You used, I think, a 40% income before tax margin. You got to tax affect that. I didn't hear you say tax affected. If you do the math, you do the walkthrough, and then you tax affected, obviously, dividing that by shares outstanding, that'll give you, I think, a number that's in the ballpark. On PAXLOVID gross margin, let me answer the question this way. One, because we don't give margin information by individual product, right? It's something that, for many reasons, we don't do. The way to think about it is, one, that the income before tax margin on that, the margin profile, is similar to our other solid oral dose products.\nRemember, when you look at the gross margin, there's going to be SI and A investment in PAXLOVID this year because we're launching that product. There's additional R&D investment product that year because we're continuing, obviously, to evolve that product. All of that, obviously, is captured in the income before tax margin on that business, which is similar to our other solid oral dose products. It's all factored in our guidance. The one place where you can really see the impact, and hopefully, this is helpful, you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue last year, for the full year, 37.7%. You look at our guidance this year, 32.2% to 34.2. The midpoint is 33.2%. That's down at the midpoint 4.5%, most of which is being driven by the PAXLOVID revenue this year.\nMaybe that's a way to help you in terms of just how to work the numbers.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Frank. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nManaging Director in Global Investment Research Division, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much. Two questions. One, just to make sure I understand clearly, the thinking about what underpins the intermediate growth expectation through 2025. I believe when that was originally issued back in 2019, that did not assume contribution from business development to achieve that CAGR of 6% to 2025. Is that still the case? That would be the first question. The second question relates to PAXLOVID. We have the standard risk study that you've modified, expanding. Can you talk about what kind of result we would need to see in order to influence the kinds of decisions and discussions that Angela is having with governments?\nIn particular, the primary endpoint, which just missed statistical significance on the alleviation of symptoms, do you need to hit that, or are the discussions being guided around the ability to meet the secondary endpoint, which was the decreased risk of hospitalizations and severe disease from that standard risk study? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Maybe I can take both in the interest of time. I can confirm that our guidance for 6% was excluding BD. That was from 2019 all the way to 2025, 6% CAGR from the things that we had at the time. As regards the standard risk primary endpoint, I think most of the governments, if not all, are focusing right now all their purchases and their discussions that we are having on the ability to reduce hospitalizations. By the way, most of the, I mean, FDA, for example, has already approved vaccinated and unvaccinated, which is included. That means that includes also people that were in the standard risk population because the high-risk population were all unvaccinated.\nIf we go, the standard risk, I think, will contribute, but I think everybody is moving with the assumption that we give it to all people to prevent hospitalization. That's the main, and deaths. That's the main thing that everybody is looking. Now, the in-house contact, it is very different. That can change very much the landscape. There are no discussions around that right now. If it comes positive, clearly that could be used also in preventing infections in high-risk populations when someone in the household or in the senior house or in other, let's say, business, in other, let's say, settings that people are living together, one is getting infected. This is something that will come on top of any discussions that we're having right now if it is positive. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHi, Greg. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'll stick with the same theme around PAXLOVID and business development. First on PAXLOVID, just to make sure we're all starting on the same page, I guess, can you comment on exactly how many doses are included in the guidance that you're giving right now? You mentioned the release to 20 million to the US, I think 2.75 million to the UK. There's obviously been some other contracts that have been signed. I don't know if you can give us a number or a range just so we have a sense of kind of what's included right now. On business development, I just thought one thing was sort of interesting when you were talking about slide 13, Albert.\nYou mentioned the strength that you're going to achieve in cash flows allow you to pursue new BD opportunities going forward that could add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to 2030. I'm just curious, that $25 billion is sort of a specific number. I'm wondering, and obviously, this is in your prepared remarks, so I'm sure it was all thought out. I'm just curious what sort of drove that, because obviously, the number could be much smaller or probably a lot bigger depending on what you do over the next few years. Maybe you can just provide some clarity on why you worded that the way you did. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nWhy we selected 25 to speak about 25, you mean?\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities",
    "content3": "Yeah, saying at least $25 billion in adjusted revenues.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah, I got it. I got it. Frank, would you like to take the PAXLOVID and the doses?\n\nFrank D'Amelio\n\nCFO, Pfizer\n\nSure. Of course. Vamil, on the PAXLOVID guidance, you heard Angela mention before, we're very active right now, 100-plus negotiations with different governments. We don't want to put any information out there that could, I'll call it, lead to misleading assumptions, and those assumptions being detrimental to those contract negotiations. You mentioned a couple of contracts that have been announced publicly and where the dose information was included. You mentioned the US 20 million, the UK 2.75 million. If you look at everything we've announced publicly, give or take, it's around about 30 million treatments. That 30 million treatments is clearly included in the guidance that we provided in the $22 billion of revenue.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThank you. Aamir, why you selected $25 billion?\n\nAamir Malik\n\nChief Business and Innovation Officer, Pfizer\n\nSure. Vamil, a couple of thoughts. One, we obviously, between the strength of our balance sheet and the cash flows, we have the ability to deploy significant capital. Going beyond our growing dividend, we think that those cash flows deployed into business development are going to give us an attractive return. That's one piece of it. The second is we think that this is, frankly, a great time for scientific advancement in our industry. As you look across academia, venture, biotech, big, small, there's no shortage of external substrates that we think can complement what we're doing internally. We're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about the science that we want to pursue. The combination of those two things, combined with the capabilities that we have, we think that there is significant growth that we can add to our business through business development going forward.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYeah. It is very important also to understand, Vamil, that we believe that once you put a target, you better execute way better when you have a target in front of you. I actually believe that the target needs to be public because it's a public company and we don't have a problem to do it. We went into to analyze the substrate and the opportunity. As always, we are providing at least 25 because, as always, we like to have targets that we are putting out there and we are beating them. We believe that with the current, all our analytics that we have done, this is a very reasonable target to achieve without, let's say, utilizing all of our far power right now. That will allow us to do dividend and other uses of capital and still do that.\nWe are confident to put it out there so that people can start measuring against it. Thank you very much. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Kerry Holford from Berenberg.\n\nKerry Holford\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Berenberg\n\nThank you. Firstly, just on the oral GLP-1, I wonder if you can confirm the number of pills per day that you'll be using in your phase 2b study up to that maximum dose of 200mg twice a day. Was that pill burden for the highest dose? Also, on obesity, you've not discussed that today, but do you have the phase 2a data in-house? I note too that you've started, sorry, you've moved another oral GLP-1 molecule into the clinic. I'm just interested to know how that asset may differ from the initial Danuglipron. Lastly, just on the guidance, if I'm thinking about the $4 billion range on your sales guidance, given you've given us the point estimates, there or thereabouts for the vaccine and the antiviral, should I assume the majority of the flex remaining relates to the base business?\nCan you help me understand the key moving parts within that element of the business? Which drugs may be the driver of that flex? Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nNo, thank you very much. Let me take very quickly, in the interest of time, the last one. No, the flex is spread around everything. You should assume, for example, in the 31 of, in the 32 that we gave for 33, right, on the vaccines, the $500 up, $500 down, that's $1 billion. On the PAXLOVID, $500 up, $500, that's another $1 billion. Then on the business, as always, we gave $1 billion up and down. Whatever you think is the midpoint, $1 billion up, $1 billion up, which is consistent with what we were doing all these years for that level of business. Mikael, on the oral, GLP-1?\n\nMikael Dolsten\n\nPresident Worldwide Research Development and Medicine, Pfizer\n\nYeah. Danuglipron is a BID drug, and pill burden will be relatively low. You also asked for the additional GLP-1 drug we have in clinical development. That's a once-a-day drug. As we have now, I think, really defined what will be soon optimal titration for an oral GLP-1, and we were, of course, pioneering that. There isn't really a date on it. We may actually consider to take the once daily in the same study as Danuglipron, given that we have now this unique opportunity to look through what seems to be two great drugs. Currently, I believe Danuglipron has all what it takes to go forward to a potential pivotal study based on this study that we shared with you. It's, of course, a unique situation to have more than one molecule.\nIt gives us the very best option for going into phase 3 quite rapidly after concluding that phase 2B, pending, of course, expected outcome.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nThank you, Mikael. The last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst in US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll keep it to one. Thanks for it at the end. At the risk of not getting an answer on OUS pricing for PAXLOVID, I understand the underlying aspects driving sort of your pricing strategy between GDP and volume-based discounts. In practice, how consistent has the pricing been across geographies? Any color at a high level would be helpful. As we think about potentially the standard risk data, the Prophy data kind of playing out over the course of the year, should we anticipate that pricing will be relatively consistent per course in the second half relative to the first half? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nAlbert Bourla\n\nChairman and CEO, Pfizer\n\nYes. Our pricing for PAXLOVID is a tier pricing. There is a tier for high-income countries, and that is more or less in line with what you have seen published for Merck's, for example, product, and we have seen published ourselves. The only exception was the US; they got a very special price because of higher orders. The rest are more or less consistent. There is, of course, a second tier for middle-income countries. For the low-income countries, we are going to provide it at cost. Also, for the low-income countries, in addition to our own providing at cost, we have initiated a process that a very big number of generic companies will start manufacturing for the low-income countries, which will be 53% of the global population.\nNow, if the price will remain consistent, clearly, this is nothing to comment here. We will not, let's say, comment on how prices may or may not evolve in the future. Thank you very much. Now, some closing comments very quickly. We have generated strong results, of course, for both patient impact and financial performance, and we look forward to continue that in 2022. I want to speak a little bit about a few changes in people that we are doing. Speaking about that, we continue to attract visionary, purpose-driven leaders with a track record of delivering breakthrough results for patients. Case in point, last week, we announced that Dr. William Pao will join Pfizer as Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer, effective 21 March. Dr. Pao brings more than 25 years of experience as an oncologist and scientist.\nHe joins us from Roche, where he most recently served as the head of pharma research and early development. He oversaw the discovery and early development of a portfolio of new molecular entities to treat diseases related to cancer, neuroscience, ophthalmology, rare diseases, and can go on and on and on. Of course, cancer is a very big part of his portfolio. Clearly, I want to mention that Dr. Pao succeeds Rod MacKenzie, a legendary leader in Pfizer, who recently announced his intent to retire after 35 years of Pfizer. I want to thank Rod, his incredible contributions to Pfizer, including the outstanding leadership in helping bring COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID to the world so quick. Of course, also, I want to touch base on something that everybody has in mind.\nI want to take a moment to recognize my trusted colleague and friend, Frank D'Amelio, who also has announced his intention to retire from Pfizer after an incredibly impactful decade and a half with the company as CFO. Frank is one of the smartest, most respected, and most effective leaders I have ever had the good fortune to work with. The positive impact he has had on Pfizer and our stakeholders is immeasurable. Frank isn't going anywhere yet, just to clarify, as he has agreed to stay on board as we search for his successor and also to serve in a consulting role through the transition. That said, I wanted to take the opportunity to thank him publicly for all he has meant to Pfizer and to me personally.\nFrank, on behalf of our 80,000 colleagues around the world, I wish you good health, every happiness as you begin and you stop there when this time comes, because it's not yet. Wherever life's journey takes you, I'm sure it will be directionally correct. That will bring an end to our call. Thank you for joining us. Have a great rest of your day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now all disconnect."

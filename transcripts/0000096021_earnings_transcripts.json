As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKevin J.

To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to 1 question. If you have a follow-up, please, we ask that you reenter the queue.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. I'm pleased to report that Sysco delivered a strong financial quarter to start fiscal 2026 with solid performance on the top and bottom line. Most importantly, we have inflected positive in our U.S. Broadline local business, and we are building momentum in our local business across the board.\nDuring our call today, we will share insights into the progress that we are making and highlight key growth initiatives that are fueling our performance improvement. After my update on our business progress, Kenny will highlight our financial results, and he will communicate why we are confident that we will deliver our full year financial guidance. In fiscal 2026, we plan to deliver profitable growth across USFS, International and our SYGMA segments, even in a macro backdrop that is less than compelling. So let's get started with our financial results on Slide 4. In Q1, we exceeded our financial plan and delivered our second consecutive beat relative to consensus expectations. For the quarter, our strong performance was driven by volume improvement, coupled with expanded gross margins and solid expense control. Most importantly, in the quarter, our local volumes improved sequentially every month of the period.\nDuring the quarter, our rate of local volume improvement was more than 2x the overall industry traffic rate of improvement. The positive inflection versus industry traffic was the strongest in September, Once again conveying the progress that we made throughout the quarter. Our Q1 results were driven by sales growth of 3.2% on a reported basis and up 3.8% to last year when excluding the divestiture of Mexico. Gross profit grew 3.9% and adjusted EPS grew 5.5%. Our financial outcomes were anchored by another compelling performance from our International segment, excellent work by our merchandising teams on gross profit expansion, strong productivity improvement from our supply chain and a sales organization that is increasing their stride in growing our local business. Momentum is building at Sysco across the board, and we are confident we will accelerate that momentum throughout 2026.\nGiven the importance of our local street business, I would like to go a bit deeper on our performance as main on Slide #8. The chart displays our meaningful sequential progress in U.S. local over the past 3 quarters. Our Sysco Broadline local business inflected positive in the quarter, delivering volume growth of 0.4%. The U.S. BO performance was 130 basis points stronger than our Q4 results which significantly outpaced the improvement in restaurant traffic during the quarter. Per Black Box restaurant traffic in Q1 improved by 60 basis points. As a result, Sysco improved more than 2x the overall injury in the quarter. We are pleased that industry traffic improved, and it is even better to see Sysco improving at a faster clip. As I mentioned earlier, September was the strongest month of the quarter for Sysco and the strongest month of positive variance versus the industry. Importantly, Sysco has continued to make progress in October.\nGiven the strong start to Q2, we anticipate that we will improve our total U.S. local by at least an additional 100 basis points in Q2 versus Q1, continuing our positive momentum. In Q1, our USFS total local business posted a negative 0.2% case volume result in the period. A friendly reminder that our U.S. foodservice volume reporting includes an ongoing negative impact from an intentional business exit within our FreshPoint business, as previously communicated on our Q4 call. In Q1, the FreshPoint business negatively impacted our total local performance by over 50 basis points. When excluding this headwind from this quarter, our USFS total local business grew 0.3%.\nTurning from local to our international segment. We are extremely pleased with the performance being delivered by our international team. We delivered outsized sales growth of 4.5% on a reported basis and up 7.9% when excluding the divestiture of Mexico. International continues to deliver positive customer mix benefits, growing the local segment much faster than our total book of business. In fact, our international business posted local case volume growth of approximately 5% for the quarter. The customer mix shift to local helped drive adjusted operating income growth of 13.1% and representing the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit profit growth. The P&L strength was delivered from every single region and our international portfolio. Sysco's international portfolio is delivering strong top and bottom line growth within every major market we operate. Sysco's international business is a strong stand out in the overall food away-from-home industry, and will be a tailwind for Sysco for many years to come.\nIt is equally important to note, as Kenny has said previously, over the past 3 years, we have doubled the profit margin rate of our international business and we will continue to work to increase international profitability while simultaneously taking share and growing the top line. We call this performing for today while transforming for tomorrow. Sysco's international team is doing a great job of embodying that ethos. Before I segue into a brief update on our growth initiatives, I would like to do a quick shout out to our entire supply chain organization. Year-to-date, in 2026, we have greatly improved our customer service levels, on time and in full. And we have improved our health and safety performance by reducing accidents in our warehouses and on the road. Additionally, our operators have reduced product strength and they have increased colleague productivity across the board. In my 6 years at Sysco, this is the strongest quarter our supply chain has delivered from a service and cost perspective. I think our entire supply chain for the great job they are doing.\nI have full confidence that the strong results will continue throughout 2026. Doing so will help us win new business and increase the retention of the customers we serve today. I would like to now transition into a brief update on select growth initiatives that highlight the progress that we are making as a company. Let's start with our colleague population. In our first quarter, sales consultant retention improved meaningfully versus 2025 and versus our exit velocity of Q4. We have fully stabilized our sales colleague population, and we expect the overall productivity of our sales force to improve throughout 2026. As outlined in our recent proxy, our colleague engagement scores have strongly improved. Our colleagues are expressing positive sentiment in regards to overall engagement, team inclusion and working in a rewarding and motivating culture with a compelling compensation program. These engagement drivers improved strongly year-over-year. We are bullish about our ability to continue our local progress momentum given the stability of our sales force.\nOur sales organization is stable,and many talented industry sales professionals are becoming increasingly interested in working at Sysco. During our recent quarter, we introduced AI 360, our AI-empowered sales tool, and we are very pleased with the initial impact in colleague receptivity. Approximately 90% of our SEs are actively using the tool on a daily, weekly basis. While it remains early days, our outcomes data suggests that there is a strong correlation between high colleague engagement with the tool and improved volume and selling performance by those same colleagues. The work our sales teams do every day is hard. Each sales consultants serve dozens of customers, and the day of an SE is very dynamic. Throughout an average day, SEs answer questions, provide consultative services to restaurants, solve problems for their customers and they actively sell. AI 360 helps balance these activities and improve overall customer service levels while simultaneously increasing time for selling activities. The customer could ask if there are good and free options for their menu. They could ask for advice on seasonally relevant proteins for their upcoming menu change or they could ask for cost savings ideas and suggestions given the overall inflation in the food basket.\nOur best SEs are seasoned at answering these types of questions while proactively selling. AI360 helps all sales colleagues manage these conversations productively reducing administrative barriers and increasing the amount of time that they can spend actively prospecting and selling. Another important initiative is our customer loyalty program, Perks 2.0. Perks targets our local street customers that buy the most, by the most often and deserve the absolute best from Sysco. Over the past quarter, we have enrolled all eligible customers into the new Perks program. introduced the benefits to our customers and have greatly increased our colleague visit frequency to these accounts. We have improved supply chain service levels to purchase accounts and our 24/7 help desk is resolving Perk's questions the first time 98% of the time. In Q1, we experienced an improvement in customer retention with Perks customers versus our broader book of business.\nOver time, we are very confident that Perks will be a differentiator for these customers. And as such, we will improve customer retention rates and perks will help us penetrate these customers with additional lines. In Q1, we can see the green shoots of positive impact of these initiatives on our local business. During the quarter, we increased the number of new accounts opened versus prior year and we simultaneously decreased the number of lost accounts versus prior year. That performance enabled an increased spread between new and lost of more than 220 basis points versus the prior year. The new loss positive spread was an incremental improvement of 40 basis points versus Q4 with September being the strongest period of the quarter. Our improved retention colleagues is also helping us drive increased penetration of lines with existing customers. From Q4 to Q1, our penetration with existing customers improved by 90 basis points. This can be directly attributed to the increased selling skills of our team and the assistance they are receiving from technology tools.\nAs I wrap up my prepared remarks, I submit we are very pleased with our Q1 results. We are building momentum across sales, merchandising and operations. Our team is increasing their pace month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter. We expect this progress to accelerate even further throughout 2026. While the external market is important, the improvement we are delivering at Sysco is being driven by growth initiatives within our control. Sysco Your Way is 3 years live in the market and continues to drive success. Total team selling is now 2 years in market and is continuing to accelerate progress in market share. We expect our new initiatives of AI360, Perks 2.0 and pricing agility to build upon the success of Sysco Your Way in total team selling and therefore, fuel continued positive momentum in our local business.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken. Ken, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter was strong, representing a continuation of the improved operational momentum we established last quarter. In Q1, results included sales growth of 3.2% and adjusted EPS growth of 5.5%, reflecting continued momentum across customer segments and geographies. This diverse customer and geographic mix is a competitive advantage for Sysco in a leading factor in why our company has grown annual sales in 54 of the past 57 years. Our strong performance highlights the powerful combination of Sysco's portfolio breadth and the ability to drive operational execution necessary to deliver compounding rates of improvement. Our Q1 beat and the momentum with volume growth and margin management gives us confidence to deliver our FY '26 guidance. Our adjusted EPS growth in Q1 included benefits from our disciplined strategic sourcing efforts leading in the delivery of 3.9% growth in gross profit, translating to 13 basis points of gross margin expansion year-over-year. The increase in both dollar and rates reflects structural improvements that we expect to carry over into upcoming quarters. .\nAdditionally, we continue to see returns from our investments in sales head count and capacity expansion alongside benefits from ongoing efforts to optimize cost and prudent tax planning. This ultimately rendered outsized profit growth with adjusted EPS growth of 5.5%, coming in ahead of our expectations. This beat to consensus included higher sales and adjusted operating income as well as net benefit from below-the-line items, of which the majority was driven by a lower effective tax rate. Results this quarter highlights the power of our organization's collective effort to delivering profitable growth, allowing us to weather volatility in the current macro backdrop. Furthermore, our stabilized retention rates, paired with important Sysco-specific initiatives, generated business momentum that accelerated throughout the quarter and are expected to add to compounding improvements over time. The success generated by our International segment is a great example of the power behind the Sysco playbook.\nThe positive momentum over the past few years continued in Q1 with sales growth of 4.5%, gross profit growth of 6.7% and adjusted operating income growth of 13.1%. The our strategy and driving results across all geographies, underscoring the significant operational advantages enabled by our size and scale. We also recently expanded our specialty capabilities with the successful acquisition of Fairfax Meadow in early October, one of the U.K.'s leading center of plate protein suppliers. This addition follows last year acquisition of Campbell's Prime meat and favorably positions our team in Great Britain to unlock incremental growth by leveraging center of plate and specialty capabilities through total team selling in the North and South regions. We expect our positive momentum in international to continue this year as we leverage our investments to unlock future growth.\nNow let's discuss our performance and the financial drivers for the quarter, starting on Slide 12. For the first quarter, our enterprise sales grew 3.2% on on an as-reported basis, driven by U.S. foodservice, International and SYGMA. Excluding the impact of our divested Mexico business, sales grew 3.8%. The Total U.S. food service volumes increased 0.1% and local volume decreased 0.2% in the quarter. U.S. Broadline volumes increased 0.6%. These results were sequential improvements as compared to Q4. For our U.S. FS local business, this represents a sequential volume improvement of 120 basis points, outpacing the industry's 60 basis points traffic improvement for the quarter. It remains early in our fiscal second quarter, but I am encouraged to share that we are seeing continued year-over-year momentum in volume growth rates during the month of October.\nAs Kevin highlighted, the benefits of our stabilized colleague population are fueling this performance alongside our newest sales professional, making meaningful contributions as they leverage training and tools to work up the productivity curve. These factors are roughly contributed to an acceleration in new account growth for the quarter. In fact, this was the highest rate of new account growth over the past 12 months. helping drive continued improvement in new loss spread. Again, another reason for our confidence in delivering our FY '26 guidance. These sequential volume improvements also benefit our U.S. FS segment results. Stable gross profit performance also included continued investment in our U.S. FS segment. The year-over-year trends are an improvement versus FY '25 results, and we expect to deliver improving financial results and 2026 and beyond. Before moving along, I want to discuss a minor but important upgrade to our case volume reporting.\nAs shown on Slide 14, we are updating our reported case growth figure to now also include volumes related to our center of play Buckhead, Newport meat and seafood specialty platform. Our reported results for this quarter and the prior year period includes the update. Historically, these volumes were measured in pounds sold and therefore, not able to be reflected in our reported case growth figures. The change is relatively minor. And as you can see on the slide, it accounts for an approximate 0 to 10 basis points impact on average over the last 5 quarters. This change enhances our reporting to be more holistically reflective of our entire portfolio with the inclusion of this important growth engine. Important growth projects like total team selling have the opportunity to ship cases from Broadline into specialty channel and this upgraded volume reporting will provide more external visibility to contributions from this program.\nThe reporting it matches the agility of one Sysco world-class service to a customer across our portfolio. Additionally, SYGMA results this quarter were outsized. This included 4% sales growth and 39% operating income growth. While we expect more moderate results for the remainder of the year, segment growth for FY '26 will be driven by operating efficiencies. Sysco produced $3.9 million in gross profit, up 3.9% and gross margin expansion of 13 basis points to 18.5% and improved gross profit per case performance. This notable margin improvement reflects effective management of product cost inflation and a mentality of continual improvement with cost savings driven by our strategic sourcing initiatives. Inflation rates in USPL were approximately 2.6%. International inflation on a constant currency basis was slightly higher for the quarter at 4.5%. We Overall, adjusted operating expense were $3 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of sales, a 14 basis point increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by planned investments in higher growth areas of the business with fleet, building expansion and self head count along with lapping $10 million in incentive compensation from the first quarter of the prior year, which negatively impacted adjusted operating expense growth by approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EPS growth by approximately 150 basis points.\nCorporate adjusted expenses were up 1% from the prior year, reflecting continued investments, lapping incentive compensation from last year and other costs. This was balanced with accretive productivity cost out and corporate efficiencies, including improved insurance costs. Overall, adjusted operating income grew to $898 million for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in our International and SYGMA segments. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion was up 0.1% versus the prior year. Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our investment-grade balance sheet remains robust and reflects a healthy financial profile. Our $3.5 billion in total liquidity remains well above our minimum threshold and offers flexibility and optionality. We ended the quarter at a 2.9x net debt leverage ratio. Turning to our cash flow. We generated approximately $86 million in operating cash flow, up 62% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting working capital optimization. Our free cash flow in the quarter was a negative $15 million, reflecting typical seasonality and the timing of CapEx.\nNow I would like to share with you our expectation for FY '26 as seen on Slide 19. During FY '26, we remain on target with key guidance metrics. This includes reported net sales growth of approximately 3% to 5% to approximately $84 billion to $85 billion. These assumptions include inflation of approximately 2%, which we are seeing now, volume growth and contributions from M&A. We continue to expect full year 2026 adjusted EPS of [ $4.50 to $4.60 ], representing growth of 1% to 3%, which includes an approximate $100 million headwind from lapping lower incentive compensation in fiscal 2025, an impact of roughly $0.16 per share. Similar to last year, we are providing full visibility to the carryover impact from incentive compensation for the year and by quarter as outlined on Slide 20. In Q1, this carryover impact included a $10 million headwind, which equates to approximately $0.02 per share to adjusted EPS. These headwinds impact year-over-year comparability for expenses in FY '26.\nThat being said, we are pleased that our compensation system is a pay-for-performance program and that our structure is in place will properly motivate behavior and drive positive performance in the business and fiscal year 2026. Excluding the negative impact of the incentive compensation on 2026 our outlook for the adjusted EPS growth will deliver approximately 5% to 7%, with the midpoint in line with our long-term growth algorithm. To help with phasing for Q2, based on the current environment, we expect EPS growth of approximately 4% to 6%, with the midpoint in line with the current consensus EPS of approximately $0.98. This includes positive total and local U.S. FS volume performance. As Kevin highlighted, we currently expect our U.S. FS local volume improvement to improve at least 100 basis points sequentially quarter-over-quarter in Q2 of 2026. As previously disclosed, Q2 reported sales growth rates will also be impacted by the divestiture of Romesco JV, which we fully lapped in December this year. This financial guidance assumes improvements to be driven by our Sysco specific initiatives with industry foot traffic and macro environment similar to what we have seen over the past couple of quarters.\nWe are proud of our strong track record of dividend growth and dividend aristocrat status. For FY '26, we remain on target for shareholders' return to approximately $1 billion in dividends and approximately $1 billion in share repurchase plan for the year. This is all based on our current expectations and economic conditions [indiscernible] based on M&A activity for the year. Specific to our dividend, our expected payout for FY '26 equates to a 6% year-over-year increase on a per share basis. In terms of leverage, we continue to target a net leverage ratio of 2.5 to 2.75x and maintain our investment-grade balance sheet. Now turning to a few other modeling items. For FY '26, we expect a tax rate of approximately 23.5% to 24% and adjusted depreciation and amortization now to be approximately $850 million, reflecting a now relatively longer useful life of our fleet assets balanced against underlying D&A related to continued capacity expansion domestically this year as well as international markets over the coming years. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $700 million, while other expense is now expected to be approximately $65 million. is expected to be approximately $700 million, representing less than approximately 1% of sales. This includes growth in maintenance CapEx as we grow into our investments we've made over the past few years while also maintaining an eye towards driving ROIC by optimizing spend levels across the enterprise. Looking ahead, we are confident in our position and remain focused on leveraging our strength as the industry leader to drive customer growth while continuing to create value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kenny. We are pleased with the strong performance we delivered in Q1 and more importantly, the significant progress we are making as a company across sales, merchandising and operations. We posted a strong exit velocity in the quarter, and that momentum has continued into October. Our leadership team places tremendous focus on improving our local business. strengthening our gross profit through strategic sourcing and tightly managing our expenses through strong supply chain productivity improvement. The team stepped up and delivered a beat across all 3 areas. The strong performance from sales merchandising and operations enabled a compelling adjusted EPS growth year-over-year. I'm proud of the team for their performance and the momentum that we are building. As we look toward the remainder of 2026, we expect to build upon the Q1 momentum and deliver against our targets. Our top line results will further strengthen based upon sequential improvement in our local business throughout 2026.\nWe have a diversified business with #1 market share in the noncommercial sectors of food-away-from-home-Noncommercial continues to grow year-over-year, and this segment is much more resilient in a challenging economic cycle. Our strong international segment performance gives us another form of diversification. Food-away-from-home is a good business. It takes share from the grocery channel every year. And as I've said before, the pie is getting bigger and Sysco intends to take a bigger slice of that expanding pie. We are confident shareholders are positioned to benefit from our industry-leading dividend, compelling ROIC, intentional share buybacks and improving financial results. Our performance in Q1 displayed strong progress in the early innings of improving our local business. The momentum will continue throughout 2026. I'm thankful for our leadership team and our entire 75,000 colleague population for the strong efforts to start the year. The collective team's hard work is poised to have positive impact in 2026.\nWith that, operator, we're now ready for questions."

Please stand by, your program is about to begin. Welcome to Sysco's 4th Quarter Fiscal Year. 2025 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin.\n\nVice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's fourth quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call.\n\nOn today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our chair of the board and CEO, and Kenny Cheung, our CFO.\n\nBefore we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations, or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Security Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner.

If you have a follow-up question, we ask that you re-enter the queue.\n\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Harkin. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining our call this morning. Today, we will recap our fourth quarter performance, highlight our four-year 2025 outcomes, provide an update on key initiatives that will drive our momentum in the new fiscal year, and finally, Kenny will share our view on our guidance for fiscal year 2026. Let's get started with a highlight of our fourth quarter financial outcomes. We are pleased to report that our fourth quarter adjusted results exceeded our expectations. Traffic to restaurants improved throughout the quarter, and Sysco-specific initiatives delivered improved financial outcomes, top to bottom.\n\nThe progress accelerated throughout the quarter and has continued into July for Sysco. All considered, Q4 was a relatively steady quarter from the perspective of restaurant foot traffic. On a monthly basis, April traffic trends for the industry were down 1.5 percent, May was down 1 percent, and June was down approximately 0.9 percent. The quarter overall was down 1.1%, which represented approximately 190 basis points of improvement versus Q3's traffic level of down three. It is good to see the industry stabilizing after a rocky start to the calendar year.\n\nI'll now pivot to Sysco's results for the quarter. As you can see on slide four, we delivered sales results of $21.1 billion, up 2.8% on a reported basis, and up 3.7% to last year when excluding the divestiture of our Mexican business. We delivered adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, up 1.1% to last year, and adjusted EPS growth of $1.48, up 6.5% relative to last year. Importantly, we made solid progress on our 100 million profit improvement target with a strong contribution in Q4 from our strategic sourcing. Our international segment posted another compelling quarter, with 3.6% top-line growth on a reported basis and up 8.3% to last year when excluding the divestiture of Mexico.\n\nInternational posted strong local case growth of plus 4% in the quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 20.1%, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit profit. Strength was delivered from across all international geographies with notable strong performances from Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, and Latin America. We expect a continuation of strong international financial performance in fiscal 2026. Within USFS, our national sales business delivered 1.3% volume growth for the quarter. Unpacking those results further, our non-commercial, national business continues to perform at a very high level, with strength in food service management, education, and travel and leisure. Most importantly, gross profit within national sales grew almost three times faster than volume due to the excellent efforts by the team to improve profitability of the national business.\n\nThe strong profit improvement was delivered through customer optimization and the creation of win-win provisions in our contracts that motivate customers to partner with Sysco to optimize efficiency. Our Sigma segment delivered sales growth of 5.9% for the quarter, driven by strong customer wins versus prior year. For the year, Sigma grew top line 8.3% and bottom line 12.5%. It was a record year for our Sigma business from top and a bottom line perspective. It is important to note that the SGMA top line growth rates will begin to moderate in the coming year as we begin to lap large customer wins earned in 2025.\n\nOn the local side of our business, we delivered negative 1.5% case volume within our U.S. Food Service segment during the quarter. As shown on slide 8, this was a meaningful 200 basis point step up versus our Q3 outcome.\n\nU.S. Food Service volume reporting included impact from exiting a business within Freshpoint that did not meet our profit threshold. which negatively impacted our total local performance by over 50 bases. When excluding this intentional business exit, our USFS local business performed at a negative 1% rate, again, a meaningful step up versus Q3, and a strong improvement relative to our four-year results. More importantly, as I mentioned, we had a strong exit velocity in the quarter, with June performance being the highlight of the quarter. It is important to call out that the positive momentum has carried into July, as Sysco's specific initiatives to improve our local performance are taking root.\n\nI'll discuss these efforts in more detail in a moment.\n\nNow that we have reviewed our business results for the quarter, I'd like to discuss the key initiatives that are going to drive our performance and local case volume growth for fiscal 2026. Let's start with our international segment. We are very pleased with our international business and have strong confidence that the compelling top and bottom line results will continue into fiscal 2026. We are advancing selling initiatives like Sysco Your Way across the globe. Additionally, we have improved our customer and colleague facing technology in the international segment, making it easier to do business with Sysco. We are adding incremental local sales resources in key international geographies, primarily metro areas like Toronto, Dublin and London, to drive new customer wins and improve customer engagement.\n\nLastly, our international supply chain capacity expansion efforts continue, with our newest facility outside of London on track to open later this calendar year.\n\nNational. Our national sales business continues to perform well with exceptionally high customer retention rates and continued new wins on the selling circuit. We expect Sysco's national sales growth in 2026 will be driven by our food service management sector, travel and leisure, and increases in our health care business. To further unlock growth, we are allocating our national sales resources to the highest potential segments of the business and are making technology investments to deepen our connectivity with our largest customers.\n\nLastly, total game selling is beginning to gain traction amongst our largest customers, with an increasing percentage of national customers purchasing from at least one of our specialty platforms. Lastly, I'd like to discuss our improvement efforts and strategic growth drivers for our local business. Let me start by saying that we are very confident that we will deliver profitable local volume growth in 2026 within every country we operate, especially in the United States. We have addressed the key challenge of 2025 head-on and we have growth activation initiatives launching this summer. First off, I want to start by discussing our sales colleague population.\n\nWe have fully stabilized our sales colleague retention and are now fully focused on improving sales colleague training, productivity, and effectiveness. The stabilized colleague retention is important because it will drive significantly improved customer retention in 2026. As we enter 2026, we will be lapping last year's excessive colleague turnover and will replace that condition with strong in-year retention. A headwind in 2025 will be converted into a tailwind in 2026. We are seeing the beginning positive impact of this equation in our July results. That positive impact will grow throughout 2026. As I mentioned a moment ago, now that we have stabilized retention, our leadership focus turns to driving improved productivity of the sales force through training and upscaling of our sales colleagues.\n\nAdditionally, our initial cohorts of sales consultant hires from calendar 2024 are beginning to eclipse their 12 to 18 month anniversary with Sysco. As Kenny has said many times, this time horizon is important as it is when the productivity of a sales consultant significantly improves. As each quarter progresses, an increased number of our sales consultants will eclipse their 12 to 18 month mark, increasing their positive impact on Sysco's results. As sales colleague tenure improves, our results improve. Lower turnover in 2026 means higher customer retention, and higher retention means more productive colleagues. These two factors will be powerful drivers of improved outcomes for Sysco in 2026.\n\nTo complement the strength and productivity of our sales professionals and further improve our business results, we are launching select growth initiatives this summer and fall. First up is a rewiring of our Perks Customer Loyalty Program. Perks will evolve from a marketing and rewards platform into a hard-hitting, exceptional customer service program targeting our most important customers. The why is clear, these customers buy the most, buy the most often, and they deserve the absolute best from Sysco. We've trained our operations, inventory, merchandising, and sales teams on the key tenants of Perks 2.0, and we are ready to launch this summer.\n\nThe program will improve customer attention and will improve penetration of business with existing customers.\n\nNext up is an AI-empowered sales tool to help improve the productivity of our sales colleagues. As you know, we leverage a CRM platform to guide the work of our sales team. Our technology teams have been hard at work to supercharge our CRM capabilities by leveraging AI to help our sales consultants succeed. The enhanced capabilities will reside in the palm of the colleague's hand on their smartphone. The features of the tool will help our team to drive increased levels of selling effectiveness, increase close rates on sales suggestions, and deliver higher rates of customer satisfaction. To say that we are excited about this capability would be an understatement.\n\nOur newer sales colleagues will benefit the most from the powerful capabilities of our AI-powered CRM.\n\nLast up is Price Agility. As we have previously communicated, we are piloting improvements to our pricing architecture that improve sales colleague engagement with customers by providing the sales force the ability to be more agile in responding to pricing requests. Our sales reps will be enabled to make decisions in the moment, leveraging the science of our pricing software. In July, we are expanding our pilot to additional geographies to learn more about the change management process required for a national rollout.\n\nAs I wrap up my prepared remarks, we are pleased with our strong performance in Q4 and the progress that we are making in local volume. Most importantly, we are excited about the exit velocity of the quarter and that the momentum has carried into July. We are confident that improved sales consultant retention, increased sales consultant tenure, and the three growth programs I just covered will drive profitable and positive case growth for Sysco in fiscal 2026. We expect that positive local case growth will, in turn, support our financial targets.\n\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Kenny. Kenny, over to you. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I plan to start with high-level thoughts on our performance, detail our financials, and then introduce our full year 2026 guidance. As we outlined before, business plans don't always materialize the exact way you draw them up on paper. This year was no different. However, our teams remained both nimble and focused as we leveraged our leadership position within the industry to successfully apply the Sysco playbook. The operational rigor of our organization provides us a high degree of confidence for delivering our 2026 guidance across the P&L and our Capital Allocation Committee.\n\nTo start, financial results this quarter included sales growth of 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of 6.5%, representing strong year-over-year performance and noteworthy sequential improvements compared to the prior quarter. This sequential acceleration is visible across sales, including both national and local volume performance, but also across gross margins, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS. This is an important proof point as we enter FY22. Q4 Adjusted EPS Growth included benefits from our disciplined strategic sourcing efforts aiding in the delivery of 3.9% growth in gross profit, translating to 19 basis points of gross margin expansion. These results include an increase in both dollars and rates of performance and reflect structural improvements that we expect to carry into the next fiscal year.\n\nOur investments and sales tech count and capacity expansion continue this quarter alongside benefits from ongoing efforts to optimize cost and prudent tax planning. This ultimately rendered outsized profit growth with adjusted EPS growth of 6.5 percent, accounting for the strongest rate of growth for the year. During Sysco 2025, we remain committed to rewarding our shareholders by repurchasing $1.3 billion in shares and paying out $1 billion in dividends.\n\nNow, let's discuss our performance and financial drivers for the quarter, starting on slide 12. For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 2.8% on an as-reported basis, driven by U.S. Food Service, International, and Sigma. excluding the impact of our divested Mexico business, sales grew 3.7%. Volumes across the enterprise sequentially improve, with total U.S. food service volumes decreasing 0.3% and local volume decreasing 1.5% in the quarter. This represents a 200 basis points improvement in local case performance and 170 basis points improvement in total food service on a sequential basis quarter over quarter. The sequential improvement was consistent with the industry traffic for the quarter, but importantly, our performance accelerated in the quarter with a strong June exit.\n\nWe are seeing stronger contributions from newer sales professionals as they work up the productivity curve and the benefits from the stabilization of colleague retention. These factors directly contributed to an acceleration in new account growth for the quarter. We expect an acceleration in sales productivity to continue in FY26. These sequential volume improvements also benefited our USFS segment results. Top and bottom line results for the quarter represent a sequential improvement, and we expect our investment actions in 2025 to deliver financial tailwinds for 2026 and beyond. International segment results included continued top-line momentum and double-digit operating income growth.\n\nThis was across all markets and marked our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit operating income growth, adding to our impressive multi-year track record. These results reflect ongoing success as we apply the Sysco playbook to generate local volume growth of 4% and broad-based operating income growth across our international portfolio. Sysco produced $4 billion in gross profit of 3.9% and gross margins of 18.9% with improved gross profit per case performance. This notable margin improvement includes a mentality of continual improvement with cost savings driven by our strategic sourcing initiative. Inflation rates and USBL were approximately 2.4%. International inflation was slightly higher for the quarter at 3.4%.\n\nOverall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.9 billion for the quarter, or 13.7% of sales, a 28 basis points increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by planned investments in higher growth areas of the business with fleet, building expansion, and sales headcount. Corporate adjusted expenses were up 9.8% from the prior year, driven by insurance, investments, and other costs, partially offset by accretive productivity costs out. For the full year, corporate adjusted expense were down 6%, reflecting solid progress on our existing cost savings program. Overall, adjusted operating income grew to $1.1 billion for the quarter, reflecting continued strong growth in our international segment, SIGMA, and more stable results in our USFS segment.\n\nFor the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion was up 1.8% versus the prior year.\n\nFourth quarter results also include a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $92 million related to our guests' worldwide business, as reflected in our other segments.\n\nLet's now turn to balance sheet and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains robust and reflects a healthy financial profile. This includes flexibility and optionality from approximately three point eight billion dollars in total liquidity, well above our minimum threshold. We ended the year at a 2.85 times net debt leverage ratio with plans to return to our target ratio at FY26. Turning to our cash flow, we generated approximately $2.5 billion in operating cash flow and $1.8 billion in free cash flow. Free cash flow, compared to the prior year, was impacted by higher cash taxes, interest, and working capital timing.\n\nNow, I would like to share with you our expectations for FY26 as seen on slide 22. During FY26, we expect reported net sales growth of approximately 3% to 5% to approximately $84 billion to $85 billion. These assumptions include inflation of approximately 2%, which we are seeing now, volume growth, and contributions from M&A. We expect full year 2026 adjusted EPS of $4.50 to $4.60, representing growth of 1% to 3%, which includes an approximate $100 million of headwind from lapping lower incentive compensation in FY25, an impact of roughly $0.16 per share. With FY25 behind us, we wanted to provide full visibility to the carryover impact from Incentive Comp for the year and by quarter as outlined on slide 23.\n\nThis impacts year-over-year comparability for expense. Our compensation structure rewards for business performance. As such, this carryover impact reflects challenges this past year in 2025. Importantly, our incentive comp structure is focused on core business drivers and aligned with long-term interests of our shareholders. Excluding this impact, our outlook reflects adjusted EPS growth of approximately 5% to 7% with the midpoint in line with a long-term growth algorithm. To help with phasing for Q1, we expect to grow our adjusted EPS consistent with the annual growth rate of 1% to 3%, driven by part of carryover benefit from strategic sourcing to gross margins and the impact from lapping incentive compensation.\n\nQ1 and Q2 sales growth rates will be impacted by the divestiture of a Mexico JV in December 2021. who plan to provide additional modeling updates as the year progresses. This financial guidance assumes improvements to be driven by our Sysco-specific initiatives with industry foot traffic and macroenvironment similar to current conditions. It also includes care over impact related to sourcing benefits from our $100 million cost savings program. As mentioned on prior calls, this muscle memory is built across the organization, leveraging a stronger operating model that positions us to grow shared profit. We remain on target for shareholder returns through approximately $1 billion in dividends and approximately $1 billion in share repurchases planned for FY26.\n\nThis is all based on our current expectations and economic conditions and could flex based on M&A activity for the year. Specific to our dividend, our expected payout for FY26 equates to a 6% year-over-year increase on a per-year basis, highlighting our commitment to our standing as a dividend aristocrat. In terms of leverage, we expect to end the year within our stated target of 2.5 to 2.75 times net leverage ratio and maintain our investment grade balance. Now turning to a few other modeling items. For FY26, we expect a tax rate of approximately 23.5% to 24% and adjust the depreciation and amortization of approximately $870 million.\n\nInterest expense is now expected to be approximately $700 million, while other expense is expected to be approximately $45 million. The elevated DNA levels will be driven by continued capacity expansion such as the expansion outside of London this coming year, as Kevin highlighted. CapEx is expected to be approximately $700 million, representing less than 1% of sales. This includes growth and maintenance CapEx and an eye towards optimizing spend levels across the enterprise as the organization further sharpens our collective efforts around driving ROI. Looking ahead, we like our position, and we remain focused on leveraging our position as the industry leader to support the growth of our customer while also continuing to unlock value for our shareholders.\n\nWith that, we'll turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks. Thank you, Kenny. We are pleased with the strong performance in Q4, and more importantly, the strong exit velocity of the Our leadership team placed tremendous focus on improving our local business, strengthening our gross profit through strategic sourcing, and tightly managing our expenses through productivity improvement. The team stepped up and delivered a beat performance versus what we expected 90 days ago, and I'm proud of their effort.\n\nAs we look toward 2026, we expect to build upon the Q4 momentum and deliver improved financial results for Sysco and our investors. Our top-line results will strengthen based on the sequential improvement of our local business throughout 2026. The improvement starts and ends with our colleague population. We have stabilized colleague retention. As a result, our customer loss rate will improve greatly in 26 verse 25. Stabilizing colleague retention also will enable us to improve colleague productivity in 2026. We will measure our improvement through the continued expansion of our gap between new customer wins and reducing customer loss.\n\nThe spread between new customer wins and customer losses improved greatly in our Q4. In fact, the gap between new and loss doubled in Q4 versus the year-to-date results in Q1 through Q3. We see the positive spread between new and lost expanding further in 2026 through the growth initiatives that I covered on today's call.\n\nOur future is bright at Sysco, and we are excited for the year ahead. We head into this next fiscal year with positive momentum, and we are well-positioned for continued improvements. We plan to leverage our competitive advantages as the industry leader. This includes strong diversification across our diverse customer types, our wide product assortment, and our geographic diversity as the only global player in the food-away-from-home landscape. Food away from home is a good business. It takes share from the grocery channel every year. As I've said before, the pie is getting bigger, and Sysco intends to take a bigger slice of that expanding pie.\n\nWe are confident shareholders are positioned to benefit from our industry-leading dividend, compelling ROIC, intentional share buybacks, and improving financial results. Keyboard displays the beginning of improving our local business and the momentum will accelerate throughout 2020. I am thankful for our leadership team and our entire 75,000 colleague population for the strong efforts in 2025. The team leaned into some stiff challenges in the macro and at Sysco specifically. The hard work of the past year is poised to have a positive impact in 2026.\n\nWith that, operator, we're now ready for questions. At this time, if you'd like to ask a question... Keep in mind, you can't remove yourself. at any time by pressing star.\n\nYou again ask that you limit yourself to one question."

Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Q3 was a difficult quarter for the industry that began with wildfires in California, which significantly impacted our important Southern California region and included historic winter storms throughout the country in January and February. We had these events as having an approximately 150 basis points negative impact on sales trends for food distributors in the quarter. Foot traffic to restaurants during the quarter reflected these challenges. With January down 1.3%, February down 5.7% and March down 2.3%. The court overall was down 3.1%, which represented a 150 basis point deceleration versus traffic level of down 1.6%.\nIn addition to the effects of adverse weather in the quarter, tumor confidence has been shaken by the recent trade policy and tariff negotiations. As you are aware, to closely follow Michigan consumer confidence survey recently highlighted that consumers are expressing one of the lowest levels of confidence in approximately 20 years. The decline in confidence levels gives us concern for the full year ahead.\nI'll speak more about tariffs and their impact on the industry in a few moments. As a reminder, Kenny and I communicated on our Q2 call, that we had anticipated nominal improvement in the business macro environment going from the first half into the second half of our fiscal year. Unfortunately, at this time, we've experienced the opposite macro effect and Sysco's business performance for Q3 reflects the industry traffic deceleration. We are disappointed with the quarter, but it is important to note 2 things. Sysco's USFS volume trends for the quarter trended in line with the industry traffic deceleration. And more importantly, business performance in March strengthened over the course of the month. And while it is unusual for us to comment about the first month of a quarter, given the uncertainties in the macro backdrop and given our softer than expected Q3, we felt it was important to highlight our April performance was stronger than March.\nFor the month of April, industry traffic adjusted for calendar shifts has trended slightly better than March. The Easter shift in the period complicates year-over-year comparisons. However, even when adjusting for the Easter calendar shift, April has produced stronger volume growth rates versus March and versus Q3. We are pleased to see the relatively stronger start toward Q4, but we are cautiously planning our business for the remainder of 2025, given the aforementioned tariff uncertainties in consumer confidence data.\nGiven that macro backdrop, I will now pivot to Cisco's results for the quarter, where, as you can see on Slide #4, we delivered sales results of $19.6 billion, up 1.1% on a reported basis, and up 1.8% to last year when excluding the divestiture of Mexico. We delivered adjusted operating income of $773 million, down 3.3% to last year and adjusted EPS of $0.96, flat to last year. We converted negative 3.1% foot traffic to restaurants into positive sales by winning new business and successfully passing through approximately 2.1% inflation for the quarter. Importantly, we are making solid progress on our $100 million profit improvement efforts that Kenny discussed last quarter, with a positive contribution in the period from our strategic sourcing and inbound logistics efficiency improvements. Those efforts will have an increased positive impact on our Q4.\nOur International segment posted another compelling quarter with profit growth of double digits. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit profit growth from our international segment. Within USFS, our national sales business delivered flat volume growth for the quarter and sales growth of 2.3%. Both figures were below our expectations, driven by softness in the national restaurant sector. Within national sales, our noncommercial business continues to perform with strength in food service management, education and travel and leisure. Our local business delivered negative 3.5% volume growth for the quarter. This was a step down versus our 2 performance, but the step down was consistent with the traffic change to the history on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\nLastly, our -- segment delivered sales growth of 9.5% for the quarter, driven by strong customer wins versus prior year. The sales and volume growth in SYGMA will begin to reduce in coming quarters as we begin to lap large customer wins within the last year. SYGMA has been a very strong year, growing top line 9% and bottom line 17% year-to-date.\nWe are disappointed with the overall financial performance in the quarter as we had expected a stronger macro backdrop. With that said, important initiatives to improve our local business are beginning to deliver results. It is unfortunate that our self-help improvement is coming at the same time that the industry backdrop softened. However, we remain 100% focused on accelerating our progress. We anticipate that we'll increase our progress on these important initiatives in the coming quarters.\nNow that I have covered the general backdrop of the industry in Sysco's sales, volume and profit performance, I would like to provide an update on specific initiatives we are driving to improve our performance results. First, I'd like to discuss the state of our sales consultant workforce. I am pleased to report that our 25 hiring cohorts are progressing up their productivity curve. Each of our hiring classes are on target to achieve their sales and volume targets. Importantly, I can also report today that our sales consultant retention has significantly improved versus the first half of the year. FC turnover was a headwind for Sysco in the first half of fiscal 2025, and we expect it will become a tailwind in 2026 as we lap those colleague departures and our new hires increase their productivity.\nRegarding colleague retention, we just completed our annual employment engagement survey, and our sales colleague job satisfaction was up solidly year-over-year. Colleague engagement drives retention and colleague retention drives positive customer engagement. Given questions we have received on recent investor calls, I would like to explain the net-net impact of colleague turnover in a bit more detail so that you have clarity on what we are experiencing.\nDuring the first half of 2025, we experienced elevated calling over that peaked in September. The negative act of SC departures is immediate as we need to reassign customer locations to other Sysco colleagues. During that customer realignment, select customer attrition occurs. As such, a departing colleague has an immediate negative headwind impact on our business, and that headwind can persist for a full 12 months until -- the customer departure. In contrast to the -- impact of a departure, a colleague hiring has the opposite time horizon. New colleague hiring has a so and gradual positive impact on the business. New colleagues start with a small book of business and grow that business over time as they expand their territory. The length of time to become active for a new sales consultant is approximately 12 to 18 months, on average, as it can be quicker or slower depending upon the sales experience of the new hire. Putting it all together, as a result of these 2 factors, fiscal 2025 has experienced a net headwind from our colleague population. Given that we have stabilized our retention figures and that our new hires are performing, we expect the scales of this equation to dip from negative to positive as we enter fiscal 2026.\nThe second local topic I would like to highlight today is colleague compensation performance management. Our sales consultants are embracing our compensation model. They are driving the right selling behaviors are, on average, making more money than prior year. These actions are most notable in the winning of new business where we have opened more new accounts in March than any prior period outside of COVID snapback. We have work to do in order to improve customer retention as industry churn across distributors is currently above the historical average. As a result, we have a company-wide effort on improving local customer retention to complement the success we are having with new account wins. The hyper focus on service and retention will be a stronger positive vector in fiscal 2026 versus 2025.\nThe third topic for today is our fulfillment capacity expansion. We previously spoke to opening a new facility in Allentown PA earlier this year. That new DC is focused on winning new business in the population dense Northeast corridor. I recently visited our next new site, just outside Tampa that will support the growing Florida market. The new facility in Tampa will open this summer and will increase our ability to win net new business in the Florida region by expanding our storage and throughput capacity, especially to support the peak winter months.\nInternationally, we are on track to open new facilities in Sweden and Ireland in the summer. Each of these projects will support expanded storage and throughput capacity that we believe will enable us to profitably grow our business in target-rich international geographies.\nLastly, I would like to speak to our work to improve our pricing agility. At the CAGNY conference in February, Cisco introduced a new local sales initiative that is currently in pilot mode in select regions. As I said at CAGNY, we are pleased with our margin discipline and overall price competitiveness utilizing our current pricing system and architecture. With that, it is a competitive marketplace. Competition will occasionally offer our customer savings on select items. Today, our sales reps need to seek approval in order to match a given competitor price on a given item. The time delay of that approval process can sometimes result in a lost sale or even a lost customer. We're working to speed up this process and provide our frontline colleagues with decision-making authority, leveraging our pricing tools. Our sales professionals will be able to respond to the customer at spot moment, enabling incremental opportunities to potentially save -- all while maintaining strong margin discipline. This in speed to action will improve case volume and customer return. Most importantly, our underlying pricing technology will be leveraged to underpin the agility press. We will roll out the new model once the pilot results are matching our intended outcomes. And as we prepare and train our colleagues new and experienced to sell in this model.\nAs I wrap up the update on local sales, I want to congratulate our international team for another outstanding quarter. International local volume increased 4.5% even more impressively, adjusted operating income increased 17.4%. Particular strength was delivered from our Canada, Great Britain and Ireland businesses. We expect the completion of these strong results from our international -- in Q4 and into fiscal 2026.\nAs I wrap up the business review section of my prepared remarks, I would like to make a few comments on some additional important topics. First off, I would like to address what we are seeing with tariffs and the potential impact on the food distributor landscape. It is important to note that Cisco purchases greater than 90% of our products within country in each country that we operate. Food is inherently local, and our sourcing teams greatly leverage local food suppliers. As a result, our tariff exposure is much less than most industries. For those products that we cannot source locally, like avocados for Mexico, we are working efficiently to understand the impact of tariffs on our costs. At this time, produce from Mexico and Canada is exempt through USMCA. With that said, we recently learned that tomatoes will in fact be taxed and tariffed when imported.\nTo manage these complexities, we have stood up a tariff management task force that meets daily. The focus of the task force work is the following: number one, ensure we have products in stock and available for our customers. Number two, defend against price increases from suppliers and do everything possible to minimize their impact on potential cost increases for our customers; number three, find alternative sources of product if and when a cost increase is excessive. Number four, work with our customers to find menu alternatives and product choice alternatives that can reduce the potential negative cost increase impact.\nAll told, Sysco is in a better position than anyone in the food service distribution space to units this dynamic situation in our size, scale and global procurement division. Our global leadership gives us a strategic advantage to understand the supplier community in hundreds of countries and have the ability to leverage that knowledge and those relationships in our procurement efforts.\nAs you have heard from other company CEOs, our main concern with tariffs is not product cost inflation. Our main concern is the negative impact that took noise and volatility is clearly having on end consumer confidence intimate. The Michigan confidence survey data I referenced earlier presents a clear reflection of that concern. We are hopeful that the uncertainty and volatility stabilizes and that the economy doesn't dip into arise. With that said, we are making preparations for a more challenging environment, and we will be appropriately cautious in our outlook.\nTo help offset softness that may be created by the macro economy, Kenny and our entire leadership team are focused on disciplined cost management and contingency planning. Sysco's initiating balance sheet is a major source of strength in times like these, as we are able to continue investing in our business when others will need to pull back. This can take the form of winning new customers, building inventory to support new business and even pursuing M&A if we find the right target opportunity at the right price. Sysco is in a position of strength in times of uncertainty.\nMy last topic for today is the introduction of a pilot program at Sysco, whereby we will open 2 Cash & Carry store locations within the Houston community. As you can see on Slide 7, the store concept is called Sysco To Go. We are interested in Cash & Carry for the following reasons. It is the fastest-growing part of the food away from home, in a business where we have 0% marketer today. Cash & Carry customers are looking for: a, value; b, convenience and; c oftentimes the ability to pay cash. This is a customer that Sysco is not adequately serving today through our delivery model. By having the customer pick up the product themselves at our store location, we eliminate the most expensive part of the supply chain, Final Mile delivery. That cost elimination enable Sysco to offer our world-class products at lower prices than when we deliver to the restaurant. This enables us to meet of the value-seeking customer more effectively.\nI want to be very clear, this is a 2-store pilot. The future of the initiative will be determined by the outcomes we produce in these test locations. It is important to note that these 2 stores are supported from Sysco's existing supply chain, leveraging our own product government. As a result, we have a strong command of projected costs to run the stores. Levering our existing supply chain is a major set of the format, given both stores are in close proximity to our Eastern D.C. We are excited to open the 2 stores in Houston soon and welcome value-seeking restaurant customers into this compelling shopping environment.\nI'll now turn it to Kenny who will provide a detailed review of Q3 performance in select fiscal year 2025 guidance commentary. Kenny, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I plan to start with high-level thoughts on our performance, detailed Q3 financials. And then dive into full year 2025 guidance.\nTo start, financial results this quarter included sales growth with stable adjusted EPS performance. In the context of all of the challenging macro headlines over the past few months, growing sales as the industry leader while retaining best-in-class product margin and rewarding our shareholders with our balance capital allocation is noteworthy. However, this quarter missed expectations. As Kevin highlighted, the challenging macro and continuation of negative industry traffic impacted results. In this dynamic backdrop, we will remain agile in our management of the -- also tighten our focus on the controllable.\nOur strong business fundamentals, industry-leading balance sheet and strong cash flow generation are competitive advantages, especially in a challenging macro environment. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we remain positioned to generate robust free cash flow that enables us to both invest in long-term growth while also rewarding our shareholders. Specific to this last point, we have repurchased $700 million in shares and paid out $752 million in dividends year-to-date, including repurchasing $400 million in shares this quarter. Further, we recently increased our planned quarterly cash dividend by $0.03 to $0.54 per share. This represents a 6% increase year-over-year in -- FY '26 to be our 56th year of delivering dividend growth. Looking ahead, we expect our dividend to continue growing commensurate for adjusted EPS growth.\nNow let's discuss our performance and financial driver for the quarter starting on Slide 11. For the third quarter, our enterprise sales grew 1.1% on an as-reported basis, driven by U.S. Foodservice in SYGMA. Excluding the impact of our now divested Mexico business, sales grew 1.8%. With respect to volume, stable volumes across the enterprise included total U.S. food service volume decreasing 2% and local volume decreasing 3.5%. Our national business remains stable, highlighting the strength of the recession -- sectors in which we operate, such as food service management, travel and leisure and education. The local volume performance compares to down 1.9% in Q2 2025, the sequential deceleration was consistent with the industry traffic deceleration, but also included headwinds from the carryover impact of sales colleague turnover from earlier in the year. Going forward, we expect stronger contributions from nearest sales professionals that continue to work up the productivity curve and benefit from the stabilization of colleague retention that Kevin mentioned earlier.\nInternational segment results, including Mexico, this quarter demonstrated steady top momentum and double-digit operating income growth. This reflects continued momentum from successfully applying the Sysco playbook. The ongoing success is highlighted by local volumes growing 4.5% and broad-based operating income across our international portfolio. We produced $3.6 billion in gross profit, down 0.8% and gross margin of 18.3% with improved gross profit per case performance. The decline in gross profit dollars for the quarter was primarily driven by negative volumes as well as mix. Volume was impacted by the macro and negative traffic, partially offset by continued growth in our more recession-resilient businesses. Second, mix remained pressured from the continued impact of our NAS business outpacing our local performance as well as negative mix from lower Sysco brand penetration rates. In addition, the industry challenging traffic backdrop of delays as compared to our expected time lines, which resulted in fewer than expected strategic sourcing deals being finalized this quarter. That said, we remain confident around the overarching opportunity in our line of sight on benefits to Q4 from recently completed deals. Going forward, we expect improving gross margins driven by incremental benefits from strategic sourcing initiatives as part of our cost savings program and an improvement from mix.\nProduct inflation came in at 2.1% for the total enterprise, consistent with our expectations. This is the average across all of our major product categories with our teams regularly managing through pockets of fluctuation. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.3% of sales, a 17 basis point improvement from the prior year. We continue to experience improved retention rates and productivity with our supply chain colleagues. This is resulting in strong NPS anchor by our highest service levels of the year for on-time deliveries, helping offset elevated supply chain labor rates and funding long-term growth consistent with our ROIC framework. This includes investment in higher growth areas of the business with fleet, building expansion and sales headcount, lower annual bonus -- compensation in our USFS segment and Global Support Center also impacted expenses for Q3. We remain disciplined with our corporate expenses down 16.8% from the prior year on an adjusted basis, which also included accretive productivity, cost out, along with efficiency work that we deployed in FY '24. These benefits are included in our $100 million cost savings program.\nBuilding off Kevin's point around tariffs, we are focused on leveraging our size and scale advantages by buying better to sell better. Our customer mix is a strategic advantage. We have efficient pass-through with national customers and spot pricing from existing and growing local customer base. Our inventory turnover of approximately 14x per year also enables us to work through inflation and deflation quickly relative to other industries. Overall, adjusted operating income was $773 million for the quarter, reflecting strong growth in our International segment and expense management and Global Support Center offset by declines in our USFS segment. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $969 million was down 0.8% versus the prior year. Let's now turn to our balance sheet and cash flow, a compelling competitive advantage.\nAs I have explained before, our balance sheet affords us the financial tools and flexibility to make the right position both for the short and long term as we seek to grow our business while driving industry-leading returns on invested capital. Our balance sheet remains robust and reflects a healthy financial profile. This includes flexibility and optionality from approximately $4.4 billion in total liquidity, well above our minimum threshold. We ended the quarter at a 2.8x net debt leverage ratio.\nTurning to our cash flow. We generated approximately $1.3 billion in operating cash flow and $954 million in free cash flow year-to-date. Free cash flow was driven by strong quality of earnings and prudent management of working capital. This quarter marked our strongest conversion rate of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect strong conversion rates from adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow at approximately 70% and free cash flow at approximately 50%. As noted earlier, our strong financial position enabled us to return approximately $649 million to shareholders this quarter.\nNow I would like to share with you our updated expectations for Q4 and FY '25. Given the uncertain environment and general concerns regarding consumer confidence, we are lowering our full year guidance for FY '25 as seen on Slide 17. During FY '25, we now expect reported net sales growth of approximately 3%, slightly down from the prior target of 4% to 5%. This is largely driven by lower-than-expected volume growth driven by the market. Our assumptions for inflation of approximately 2% and contributions from M&A remain unchanged. We now expect full year 2025 adjusted EPS growth of at least 1% for Q4. This implies adjusted EPS to be at least flat. The revision to guidance reflects the current uncertain macro environment and its outsized impact to the second half of the year, which historically is more profitable.\nThis updating quarter also includes our planned strategic investments related to refreshing our fleet and building capacity coming online. This updated guidance assumes no further degradation of the restaurant trapping environment and a slight improvement to our volume performance. Importantly, we believe this guide is achievable based on a strong exit velocity for March and continued momentum into April in Q4, including higher contributions from cost out. We remain confident in delivering our run rate cost save target of approximately $100 million which we expect to benefit Q4 in the first half of 2026, helping offset the current macro environment.\nWe plan to remain focused on operational discipline, tightening the belt as necessary. With over $1 billion in dividends and $1.25 billion in share repurchases, this assumes fourth quarter share repurchase of $550 million and dividends of $250 million. For the year, we expect to operate within our stated target of 2.5x. The 2.5x net leverage ratio and maintain our investment-grade balance sheet.\nNow turning to a few other mulling items. For Q4, we expect a tax rate of approximately 24% and adjusted depreciation and amortization of approximately $200 million. Interest expense is now expected at approximately [ $107 million ]. Looking ahead and as we have proven over time, we will leverage our position as the market leader to drive disciplined growth as we remain focused on unlocking value that will be -- for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kenny. Q3 lived up to our expectations on the top or bottom line. The macro softness directly impacted our volume trends within the important local and national restaurant business sectors. Our trade down in volume during the quarter is directly linear with the widely communicated traffic decline experienced by the industry over the same period. With that said, we can see progress that we are making on activities within our local business. Colleague retention has stabilized. New customer win rate is accelerating. As I mentioned, we are still working through the headwind of prior quarter's colleague resignations, but that impact will reduce in magnitude each quarter.\nAs we head into fiscal 2026, the net neck of colleague retention and new colleague hiring will become a tailwind. Why? Our new hire is performing and they are responding to the updated compensation model. They are opening new business. They are in their sales targets. Additionally, our new distribution centers will increase our ability to win profitable new business in important geographies, both domestically and globally.\nThe most compelling proof point to highlight the self-help progress we are making in our local business is the percentage of new business we are opening weekly. March was a very strong month for opening new business, and the progress has continued into April. Combined with our efforts -- in customer retention through pricing agility and improved service levels from our supply chain. We are confident we can grow our customer count in 2026.\nFrom a business perspective, March local volume improved 270 basis points versus February and local volume during the first weeks of April improved further versus March. We are pleased to see the stronger April, and we are cautiously planning our coming months due to the tariff uncertainty. I am confident Sysco will make progress on our improvement initiatives in the coming periods. The external environment -- in the year ago, and we are prepared to -- balance sheet and fiscal responsibility will be strength points as we navigate this volatile environment. I am confident in our ability to win versus the overall marketplace in challenging conditions, just like we successfully grew our business during the COVID disruptions. At times like these are higher than industry profit margins and strong balance sheet cannot be overstated. We also expect our International division, which has been less impacted by the volatility to continue to be a strong point for the company, having the diversified business will be a strength point ahead.\nWith that, operator, we're now ready for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nDivisional VP of IR, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.

Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time to one question. If you have a follow-up question, we ask that you reenter the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our financial results this quarter delivered improved performance and positive momentum with stronger top and bottom line year-over-year growth rates as it compared to our first quarter. Sysco is delivering value over the short term with disciplined P&L management and remains well positioned to advance our business strategy while delivering upon our financial commitments presented at our recent Investor Day. .\nImportantly, we expect the positive momentum from our Q1 into Q2 to accelerate in the second half of the year as we benefit from sales and operations improvement initiatives, investments in our business, and the potential for stronger foot traffic to restaurants as we begin to lap last year's negative 4% in late spring. Our leadership team is 100% focused upon executing with excellence with a strong plan in place to deliver our full year 2025 guidance.\nTurning to Sysco's performance during the quarter on Slide #5. I'm pleased to report that Sysco delivered over $20 billion of total revenue. a growth of 4.5% versus fiscal 2024 and a sequential improvement from Q1 growth rates. The revenue growth was driven by U.S. Foodservice volume growth of 1.4% and moderate inflation of 2.1%. From a volume perspective, we generated 4.3% national volume growth, 3% volume growth in our International segment and a decline of 0.9% in our USFS local case business.\nOur national sales business continues to perform at an exceptionally high level with strong customer retention, and we continue to onboard high-quality net new national business. Our International segment posted very compelling results with adjusted operating income up 26.5%. The strong profit growth was generated in part by local case growth of plus 4.7% year-over-year. We continue to advance the Sysco playbook in our international geographies, expanding our assortments, introducing Sysco-branded products and increasing boots on the street sales head count to win new local business. I will discuss our international business in more detail in a few moments.\nIn the U.S. FS business, we are making solid progress on our top priorities across our multiple business units. Local case performance this quarter, excluding the impact of our DAM business, was down 1.9%. It was a choppy quarter with hurricane impacts at the beginning of the quarter and holiday shifts that negatively impacted the end of the quarter. The year-over-year comparison was also impacted by strong growth rates from the prior year. Specific to our local business, we are seeing progress in our internal measures of success, and we remain confident that our efforts will help deliver improvements in the second half of fiscal 2025. More on this in a few moments.\nLastly, our top line growth included strong contributions from SYGMA where sales were up 10.6%. Now that we have summarized Sysco's top line performance, let's briefly discuss the external market. Food traffic to restaurants in the U.S. was down approximately 2% for the second quarter, which represents a moderate improvement from Q1. We expect to see continued improvement in traffic trends as we head into the second half of the year. Inflation for the industry has maintained at approximately 2%, which is within the normal range when we look at cost of goods sold inflation over the course of decades.\nFrom a bottom line perspective, Sysco delivered adjusted EPS of $0.93, a growth rate of 4.5% versus prior year, consistent with our expectations. The EPS growth was driven in part by the aforementioned volume growth, disciplined margin management and an organization-wide focus around efficiency improvement. Margin management will remain a point of strength for the full year. As we stated on our Q1 call, we anticipate that our strategic sourcing efforts will pick up momentum as the year progresses. As a result, we expect the positive momentum in gross profit from Q1 to Q2 to step up in the second half of the year as we have a direct line of sight to the actions that will deliver our full year margin performance.\nOn the expense side of the ledger, we anticipate continued improvements in our supply chain efficiency, driven by improving colleague retention statistics and improved transportation route optimization. These routing efforts will reduce miles driven, lowering our cost, while simultaneously improving our ability to deliver on time and in full to our customers, a win-win. Now I'd like to provide a brief update on our main business units, starting with international, where we grew our top line 3.6% for the quarter, and we grew adjusted operating income by an impressive 26.5%.\nOur strong profit growth is being driven by continued operational improvements increased procurement synergies and a strong customer mix. Local case growth in our International segment is up 4.7% year-over-year. Adding to our international success is a strong strategic sourcing program that is expanding globally and the successful growth of our Sysco Urawa local sales program. Lastly, we are deploying enterprise technology that is improving efficiency.\nIn short, our International segment is running the Sysco playbook. It's working, and we expect the positive momentum with international to continue into the second half of the year. Our national sales business continues to deliver compelling top and bottom line results. For the quarter, national volume was up 4.3% as our supply chain solutions domestically and internationally resonate with our largest customers. Sysco has the assortment breadth supply chain footprint and technology solutions to be a one-stop shop for large customers. We make it easy to do business with Sysco with dedicated account teams that help enable customer growth, support their business expansion and oftentimes support the customers' international expansion. The success we are having in national sales is flowing through from top to the bottom line as these customers help improve our route density, cover our fixed costs, increase our procurement synergies with key suppliers.\nWe expect our national sales business to continue to deliver strong results due to high customer retention and continued new customer wins. Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on our local business. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we expect an improvement in our local performance in the second half of the year. We are making progress with our sales team hiring and training, and our sales compensation program is motivating the right behaviors. We see clear signs of progress on important drivers of the business. As an example, our new customer win rate has ramped up significantly over the last quarter.\nThe increased new customer win rate is attributed to our new compensation program and the increased sales professional head count we are onboarding. New customers typically start by providing a portion of their business to Sysco. And as we work to, what we call sell around the room and penetrate additional product categories with these newer customers, the positive contribution from them will grow over time. The new customers we are winning today are going to be the strong, mature penetration customers of tomorrow. We expect our customer win rate progress to carry into our second half and into fiscal 2026.\nA second proof point is the progress that we are making with sales colleague headcount. Our sales consultant retention has substantially improved from Q1 to Q2 as the change management associated with our new compensation model has taken root and colleagues are experiencing the benefits of the new program. Additionally, we are making solid progress against our 2025 hiring goals with quality hires from the industry. Another proof point within our local segment is the improvement that we are making with our service proposition. Over the past quarter, we improved our service offering to our customers with increased customer-facing fill rates and improved on-time delivery performance. Our supply chain continues to make strong progress month-over-month, and that is evidenced by our Net Promoter Score, which improved solidly on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis.\nWe expect continued improvement in service levels in our second half of fiscal 2025. Historically, NPS improvement has a strong correlation to business growth in future quarters. The sales and volume growth comes from increased customer retention and by winning new lines from existing customers.\nLastly, we increased our distribution capacity over the past quarter with new and expanded facilities to support our business. I am most bullish on our Italian platform expansion. Over the past 6 months, we have entered new geographies with our Greco Italian platform, and we will continue to expand to new geographies in the coming calendar year.\nThe winning formula is clear. have the right Italian products at the right price sold by colleagues at our full-time Italian cuisine experts. Our success has been replicated in each new Gecko market we have entered. I expect compelling results from the Italian platform in the second half of fiscal 2025 and for years to come as we advance our Greco expansion efforts. We have substantial white space to be filled in the coming years.\nAs I wrap up my comments this morning, I will summarize with the following. We made progress from Q1 to Q2 in top and bottom line results. We delivered upon our financial expectations for the quarter and we have posted progress on important strategic initiatives. The progress on key initiatives like sales professional hiring and increasing our new customer win rate will fuel our improvement in the second half of fiscal 2025. When combined with the very compelling business performance, we are already delivering from national sales business, our International segment and our SYGMA segment, we have the confidence to reiterate our full year financial guidance. I am pleased with the progress that we are making in our supply chain from a service and cost perspective and our merchandising ranks from a gross margin management perspective and with our sales team from a skills development perspective.\nThe combination of the progress across the 3 vectors will build over time. I want to personally thank Sysco's 76,000 plus colleagues and our entire leadership team for their continued focus in energy. We have the best team in the industry, and I'm proud to work with them every day serving Sysco's global customers. I also want to thank our supplier partners who have helped Sysco improve service levels to our customers over the past quarter.\nI'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a detailed review of Q2 performance and select fiscal year 2025 guidance commentary. Kenny, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As Kevin highlighted, our results for the quarter were driven by improvements across the core financial drivers. Sales, gross profit and operating expense. Our success in Q2 was broad-based across business segments in our product portfolio. We generated positive operating leverage and sequential improvements to gross profit, while continued operating expense management rendered adjusted operating margin expansion.\nHere at Sysco, we have levers across our P&L and our actions are driving structural improvements to the business. We believe the table is set for continued improvement in the second half of our fiscal year. For example, this was on full display in our International segment this quarter. The positive momentum over the past few years continued into Q2 with sales growth of 4%, gross profit growth of 7% and adjusted operating income growth of 26.5%. The Sysco playbook is delivering across all geographies, driven primarily by our size and scale advantages in these markets along with M&A contributions from the recent specialty additions to the portfolio, which are performing well.\nWe expect our positive momentum in International to step up further in the second half of the year. In addition to improved P&L results this quarter, I would be remiss if I did not highlight the compelling competitive advantage that our strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generation provides. On that note, I am pleased to announce the upsizing of our share repurchase plan.\nFor this fiscal year, we now expect to buy back $1.25 billion of shares, up from our prior plan of $1 billion. The full year amount has the potential to flex up further depending on M&A activity for the remainder of the year. Further, we take both our role as a dividend aristocrat and our track record of dividend growth seriously as we are one of only 4 consumer staples company that have grown dividends for the past 25-plus years.\nThis year, we expect to distribute to shareholders $1 billion in dividend payments. In total, we are now on target to return over $2.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends in FY '25. Our balance sheet affords us the financial tools and flexibility to make the right decisions, both for the short term and long term, as we seek to grow our business while driving industry-leading returns on invested capital and generating a double-digit TSR for our investors.\nNow turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the second quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.5%, in line with our guidance in the financial algorithm we shared during Investor Day. Our sales results were driven by U.S. foodservice growing 4.1%, International growing 3.6% and SYGMA growing 10.6%. With respect to volume, total U.S. food service volume increased 1.4% and local volume decreased 0.9%. [indiscernible] positively impacted U.S. foodservice volumes by 1.6% and local volumes by 1%.\nNational volume growth in the quarter also included margin expansion. Local results were lapping the highest rates of growth in the prior year as well as headwinds from weather disruptions and unfavorable holiday timing impact on a year-over-year basis this year. We produced $3.7 billion in gross profit, up 3.9% and gross margin of 18.1%. On a dollar basis, we are encouraged by the expanding gross profit dollar per case trend and continued opportunities around our strategic sourcing efforts.\nLooking to the second half, we expect to execute on secured actions to expand the depth and breadth of our strategic sourcing to buy better, to sell better. This includes working with existing suppliers, looking for incremental win-win opportunities, often adding items to existing contracts and scoping out work with new suppliers. Additionally, continual improvements in sourcing will come, allowing us to lever the scale of our North America presence, which includes our $6 billion canadian business.\nAs I mentioned earlier, strategic sourcing is one example of structural improvements we expect to enhance gross profit in the second half of our fiscal year. Our gross profit dollar growth reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which came in at 2.1% for the total enterprise, consistent with our expectations. This is the average across all of our major product categories with our teams regularly managing through pocket of fluctuations. We are doing an excellent job managing our corporate expenses with continued progress year-over-year. We have been extremely disciplined and reduced corporate expenses by 1.3% from the prior year on an adjusted basis, driven by efficiency work that we deployed in FY '24 and incremental actions during the quarter.\nWe are making continued progress with our financial algorithm target of lowering corporate expenses to 1% of sales. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.9 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of sales, a 13 basis point improvement from the prior year, reflecting supply chain and corporate expense efficiencies. Our supply chain operations remain fully staffed. We continue to improve colleague retention year-over-year, and we are building on productivity gains with piece per labor hour improvements compared to the prior year. Our outbound fill rates to our customers also improved during the quarter, which will help drive increased NPS and sales in the coming quarters.\nTurning to fuel expenses. We remained disciplined around the pacing of our sales professional hires, and we'll continue to focus on the quality of return on investments of our new hires as a continued decline of the productivity curve. These deliberate investments are well levered with this year's hires expected to start driving financial contributions next year and thereafter.\nOverall, adjusted operating income was $783 million for the quarter. Positive momentum continued in our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 26.5% during the quarter. Our teams are successfully applying the Sysco playbook to drive continued growth and margin expansion.\nAdjusted operating income growth also benefited from SYGMA contributing 11.8% profit growth as our focus on operational excellence resulted in improved profits from higher productivity alongside growth of new customers. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $969 million or up 4.4%. Our balance sheet remains robust and reflects the organization's healthy financial profile.\nWe ended the quarter at a 2.76x net debt leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with $11.8 billion in net debt and approximately $3.1 billion in total liquidity, which is substantially above our minimum threshold. Turning to our cash flow, we generated approximately $498 million in operating cash flow and $331 million in free cash flow for the first half with the year-over-year variance driven by timing related to working capital which also includes the opportunistic purchase of inventory with solid economics.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect strong conversion rates from adjusted EBITDA, operating cash flow at approximately 70% and free cash flow at approximately 50%. Our strong financial position enabled us to return approximately $444 million to shareholders this quarter. We remain confident in growing both top line and bottom line results in FY '25, in line with our financial algorithm. Importantly, we are reiterating our 2025 guidance metrics as seen on Slide 20.\nDuring FY '25, we expect net sales growth of 4% to 5%. Net sales growth includes continued inflation of approximately 2%, positive volume growth of low single digits and contributions from M&A during the year. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7% in line with our financial algorithm range. We continue to believe the second half will improve from investments in the sales professionals and other growth initiatives. Additionally, we expect margin benefits as we leverage our unique scale advantages to expand strategic sourcing efforts to include a wider basket of categories, more efficiently harness our global buying power and improve in [indiscernible] freight logistics to minimize touch points across our networks.\nCombined with recent actions around our organizational optimization at our GSE we expect over $100 million of annualized savings to benefit gross profit dollars and operating expenses starting in the second half. This figure highlights our ability to be disciplined with expenses and offset macro industry environment headwinds in the first half and fund business investments this year. This is consistent with our focus on driving continual business improvements, and we plan to explore additional actions going forward.\nIn addition to these self-help initiatives, which we expect to drive the majority of our second half lift, we continue to expect a stronger macro and modest industry traffic improvements. All in, we expect a stronger rate of adjusted EPS growth in the second half of the year, growing at a positive high single-digit growth rate with similar rates of growth across Q3 and Q4. Consistent with our ROIC focus, we divested our joint venture in Mexico in mid-December. This is expected to impact international sales by approximately $500 million on an annualized basis and be immaterial from a profit standpoint.\nFrom a modeling perspective, international top line results will be negatively impacted from an as-reported perspective for the next year as Mexico will be out of the number starting next quarter, but accretive to international margins. We do not plan to recast prior year numbers. However, we do plan to provide additional context to aid in modeling this segment until we lap its sale at the end of this calendar year.\nIn the upcoming quarters, we will provide growth comparisons with and without Mexico in an effort to add clarity around operating trends and enhance year-over-year comparability. Further, we plan to continue our practice rewarding our shareholders through the distribution of essentially all of our annual free cash flow with over $1 billion in dividends. And as outlined earlier, $1.25 billion in share repurchases. This is another signal of continued confidence in our business. Specific to share repurchase, we note that this figure can flex up depending on M&A activity.\nFor the year, we expect to operate within our stated target of 2.5 to 2.75x net leverage and maintain our investment-grade balance sheet. The adjusted tax rate for FY '25 is now expected to range from 24.5% to 25%, slightly lower than our initial view. Adjusted depreciation and amortization remains unchanged at approximately $800 million for the year.\nIn closing, I'm confident in our FY '25 guidance and our ability to deliver on our long-term financial algorithm with levers across the business. We believe we are taking the right steps for long-term benefit of the business and unlocking value that we reward our shareholders. I look forward to our progress ahead as Sysco is positioned to win.\nWith that, I will turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kenny. I appreciate all you are doing for Sysco. The disciplined leadership that you and your team display are a real strength for our company. Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate the following key points. We are extremely pleased with our national sales, international and SYGMA business results. We believe these businesses are positioned to continue delivering compelling performance in the quarters and years to come. .\nOur local business is in the midst of a business improvement phase. We have the right actions in place, and we are showing clear signs of progress by increasing our new customer win rate and improving Net Promoter Scores. That improvement trend has given us the confidence to reiterate our full year guidance and to equally iterate our overarching financial algorithm. Our solid balance sheet affords us the opportunity to return value to our shareholders while we are profitably growing our business. The announcement today of raising our share repurchase target for the year is just one example of the discipline we will deploy to ensure that our shareholders benefit along our journey. More to come as we have additional announcements in the future. Our future is bright as we expand our competitive moats, leveraging our size, our scale and our talented people.\nWith that, operator, we're now ready for questions."

[Operator Instructions] |At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During our call this morning, we will cover the following key topics: food-away-from-home buying trends, including foot traffic to restaurants; Sysco's performance for the quarter and the year relative to the overall market; and status updates on key topics of interest, including inflation, local case growth, supply chain productivity. And finally, Kenny will cover the financial details of our Q4 2024 as well as provide our fiscal 2025 guidance.\nLet's get started with key highlights of the business on Slide #5. I'm pleased to report that Sysco delivered $79 billion of top line revenue for the year a growth of 3.3% versus fiscal 2023. The revenue growth was driven by USFS volume growth of 3.1% and USFS inflation of 0.5%. Sysco profitably took market share in fiscal 2024. I will speak more to this in a moment.\nImportantly, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.39 for the quarter and $4.31 for the year. The full year performance was $0.01 higher than the midpoint of the guidance that we provided at the beginning of fiscal 2024. Kenny calls this our safe due ratio and I'm pleased that we delivered above the midpoint of our initial guide for the year despite a softer economic environment in the second half of the fiscal year.\nDuring our Q4, our team, once again, displayed agility and accountability, enabling a strong financial performance despite negative year-over-year foot traffic to restaurants. As I said in my intro, I would like to start by providing an update on the health of the food-away-from-home industry. Traffic to restaurants was down approximately 3% year-over-year for the quarter. This is consistent with what you have heard from many restaurant names over the past couple of days and weeks. Sysco was successfully able to grow our volume 3.5% for the quarter despite the declining year-over-year for traffic. We did this by taking market share versus the overall market. In fact, for the full year, we grew our business more than 1.75x the market. That performance was above our stated goal for the year of 1.5x market growth.\nSysco's performance versus the market is calibrated via multiple external sources and the performances versus the total industry overall. The strong 1.75x growth was a result of several important factors as seen on Slides 6 and 7. The largest distributors in the industry are taking share versus the overall foodservice market. Sysco specifically is winning with our specialty platforms, including FreshPoint and our specialty meat businesses as well as our recent acquisitions like Greco and Edward Don. The combination of our industry-leading Broadline business where our expanding specialty portfolio is winning in the marketplace. Lastly, our national sales business is winning versus the total market with notable wins in the foodservice management space and hospitality.\nWe are pleased with our overall performance versus the total market. And with that said, we are not satisfied with our growth in the important local segment. As we covered at our Investor Day, we are confident that we can improve our local case performance in fiscal 2025. I'll speak more to those plans in a moment. For the fourth quarter, Sysco delivered the following performance: Continuing compelling profitable case growth within national accounts local case growth of positive 0.7% to last year. Importantly, our local cases international grew 5% for the period.\nSYGMA cases grew 5% from Q3 to Q4 with a June exit velocity of positive year-over-year growth. This is a reversal of recent negative volume trends within SYGMA as we have last week 52 of a customer exit, and we have signed new profitable business that had started ship dates during our fourth quarter. We expect SYGMA to be a volume and profit growth business in fiscal 2025.\nSysco has a well-balanced business with strong market share in the non-restaurant space. Many of the non-restaurant sectors like health care and foodservice management are less impacted by consumer confidence in restaurant foot traffic. At times like these, our well-balanced business portfolio is a strong asset for Sysco, including our international segment.\nOur gross profit rate for the quarter was strong, with GP growing 4.2% year-over-year and GP per case growing 1.3% versus prior year. Our merchant team continues to do an excellent job with strategic sourcing and product innovation. Overall expense management continues to improve year-over-year with operating expenses increasing slower than our top line. Most notably, our corporate expenses were down 10% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The corporate expense reduction was a result of the efficiency work that we deployed in Q3 of this year. Benefits from those expense reductions will continue into 2025, and Kenny will speak to that in more detail. All told, these factors resulted in a 6.4% increase in our operating income year-over-year, enabling us to exceed the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance.\nNow that I've highlighted our financial performance for the quarter, I would like to continue the theme of our Investor Day and provide you a bit more color on two of the biggest levers within our P&L: Local volume growth and supply chain productivity improvements.\nLet's get started with volume growth. Specifically, I'll highlight progress we are making on the actions to deliver increased profitable local case volume in fiscal 2025 on Slide #9. First, let me start with hiring status. In full year fiscal 2024, we successfully hired 450 net incremental sales professionals. The [ colleague ] hiring ramped throughout the year with many of them being hired in the second half. The new colleague cohorts hired in 2024 will begin positively impacting our P&L throughout fiscal 2025 as they grow their new territories and become more knowledgeable about our product offerings.\nAs we mentioned on our Investor Day, we plan to hire an additional net 450 sales professionals in fiscal 2025, with those new cohorts expected to positively impact our fiscal 2026 results. We are confident in our ability to hire and train these new colleagues. In fact, we are supplementing our industry-leading training program by hiring more sales trainers in sales and administrative staff. One of our top priorities as a company is to ensure that these new colleagues get the training that they deserve and ramp up the productivity curve in an efficient manner. Our executive leadership team is taking personal ownership to ensure we track the new trainees cohort-by-cohort to ensure that they are maturing on schedule and that they are provided to support and resources they need to be successful.\nOur strong supplier community will be assisting in the ever-important product training that goes along with new colleague hiring. We greatly appreciate our supplier community for their support. On the first day of our new fiscal year, we introduced a new compensation program for our U.S. Broadline sales colleagues. We have remixed the base pay to incentive ratios within our compensation program. In the process of doing so, we have increased the earnings potential of our sales staff and the incentives put in place to motivate the specific behaviors that will help advance Sysco's P&L.\nThe communication and change management of the new compensation program is well underway, and we are confident that this program will be good for our colleagues, our customers and our P&L. Benefits of this new program will be felt as the year progresses, but I don't anticipate any major movement in Q1. Our Total Team Selling program continues to advance with our sales consultant generalists partnering better than ever with our produce and protein specialists. At our Investor Day in May, Greg Bertrand, our global COO, covered the compelling growth opportunity via our Total Team Selling program. As he presented in May, a customer that buys from Sysco Broadline plus one of our specialty businesses spend 3x more per week than a Broadline only customer winning with Specialty as a $10 billion-plus opportunity for Sysco as we work to earn our fair share of the specialty market.\nSysco Specialty is a compelling moat versus the overall industry as it has taken more than 20 years for us to assemble our specialty assets, integrating the systems, supply chains, volume compensation programs and the important go-to-market selling strategy between Specialty and Broadline, this was a very large work effort. In the coming years, we will continue to expand our specialty capabilities, both domestically and internationally through a combination of M&A and greenfield activities. For example, we are adding our Asian Foods business to our recently opened Allentown, Pennsylvania distribution center. This addition will greatly improve our ability to serve the large and growing Asian market in the Northeast.\nLastly, our International business delivered compelling local case growth of 5% for the quarter. We are running the Sysco play internationally with programs like Sysco Your Way and Perks beginning to positively impact our outcomes. We are also bringing improved technology and Sysco brand products to these important geographies. All told, the strong local case growth enabled our International segment to deliver a compelling 13.1% profit growth in the quarter. We expect international continue to be a top and bottom line tailwind for Sysco in fiscal 2025.\nNow that we have covered our local case growth performance, let's turn to the status and health of our supply chain. As I've said many times, the key to success in this business is being the distributor that can consistently ship on time and in full to our customers. Over the past quarter, we have continued to make progress in improving our service levels to our customers. We improved and advanced our on-time rates with a dedicated focus on routing excellence. I'm proud of our operations team for the hard work and for the improvement that they are making in on-time delivery. You can see the impact on our NPS scores as satisfaction with delivery is up versus prior year.\nIn addition to the good work with delivery service levels, our merchandising and inventory teams continue to work collaboratively to improve our first-time [indiscernible] rate. Progress is being made on core in-stock guidance as well as improving our agility when a supply chain disruption occurs at one of our suppliers. We improved versus prior year in both aspects, and we'll make additional progress in 2025. We have increased the importance of fill rates in our leadership performance evaluation metrics for 2025. Fill rates are a strength point historically, and we are working to further advance that advantage through these efforts.\nAs I've mentioned many times, the number one lever to improve our supply chain cost performance is to increase colleague retention. Retention rates improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter throughout the year, and they more than doubled compared to the prior year in the fourth quarter. The improved retention is showing up in improved safety metrics, reduced product shrink and increased productivity of our colleagues. Many of these items like [indiscernible] liability have a long tail. So the improvement we are driving now will reflect positively in our P&L in fiscal '25 and '26.\n[indiscernible] in our supply chain update is the progress that we are making to expand our throughput capacity. During our Q4, we opened our first DC fold out in more than 10 years in Allentown, Pennsylvania. This facility will help Sysco better serve the population dense Northeast corridor by increasing service levels and lowering our cost to serve.\nAs I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to thank the entire Sysco team for a strong year. We grew our business more than 1.75x the overall market at industry-leading profitability metrics, and we exceeded the midpoint of our EPS guide for the year. Importantly, we have continued to advance our business strategy, making progress in important areas like improved technology and customer programs like Sysco Your Way and Perks. Lastly, we are focused upon the most important things to ensure success for fiscal 2025 and beyond, and we are positioned well to deliver against the guidance that Kenny will share in a moment.\nSo with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kenny, who's going to highlight the fiscal details of the quarter and our year as well as TFR guidance for fiscal 2025. Kenny, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start off by thanking our customers, colleagues, shareholders and partners. This quarter's results further demonstrates our ability to deliver solid financial performance in a relatively softer macro environment. Our focus on core performance drivers, enhance operational discipline. As we have said before, business plans don't always materialize the exact same way you draw them up on paper.\nThis past year was no different. We focus on operational discipline and tighten the belt to deliver on our initial profit guidance. I'm confident these choices, however, difficult at the time, create long-term structural returns. There is muscle memory across the organization, helping develop a stronger operating model that positions us to grow share profitably as we look ahead.\nQ4 financials reflect positive sales and volume growth as well as our seventh consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, with gross profit growing faster than operating expenses and operating income growing faster than sales. Altogether, these rendered growth across adjusted operating income and EPS for the full year coming in $0.01 higher than the midpoint of the guidance range. Given the multiple levers across our business, we improved efficiency, both on gross profit and operating expenses.\nGP dollar growth of over 4% was driven by optimal pricing and sourcing improvements. Operating expense included record levels of supply chain productivity improvements, coupled with our continued focus on managing corporate expense, which were down 10% year-over-year. These efforts help us deliver our profit growth, reinvest back into the business and returned over $2.2 billion back to shareholders in FY'24.\nNow turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.2%, driven by U.S. foodservice growing 4.9%; international growing 3.8%; and SYGMA growing 2%. With respect to volume, total U.S. foodservice volume increased 3.5% and local volume increased 0.7%. Don positively impacted U.S. foodservice volumes by 2.7% and local volumes by 1.6%. We produced $3.8 billion in gross profit, up 4.2% and gross margins of 18.7% was approximately flat to the prior year due to mix.\nOur gross profit dollar improvement reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which came in at 1.6% for the total enterprise, consistent with our expectations. The improvement in gross profit was also driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts in our U.S. and international segments. Specific to Sysco brand, penetration rates decreased by 51 bps to 36.6% in U.S. Broadline and 37 bps to 47.1% in U.S. local results. We continue to improve with local customers with single units [indiscernible] from local businesses with multiple units. We have a strong history of growing Sysco brand penetration and we have trade management actions to improve the mix over the course of the year.\nAdjusted operating expense were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 13.4% of sales, a 12 bps improvement from the prior year, reflecting supply chain and corporate expense efficiencies. Adjusted operating income was $1.1 billion for the quarter, improving to 5.3% margins. For the year, adjusted operating income grew [ 8.4% ] as we expanded margins both on a dollar and rate basis. Most noteworthy, our International segment continued to deliver substantial growth, demonstrating positive operating leverage and margin expansion. This included a 13.1% increase in adjusted operating income with our teams successfully growing share and executing the Sysco playbook with best practices. This segment remains a growth driver for the company.\nAdjusted OI growth also benefited from SYGMA contributing 44.4% profit growth after continued to focus on profit enhancements and growth from new customers. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.3 billion or up 5.4%. I am also pleased with the health of our balance sheet, which further strengthened this quarter. We ended the year at 2.7x net debt leverage ratio, which is within our target. We ended the year with $11.3 billion in net debt and approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity, which is a substantial headroom above our minimum threshold. Our debt is well laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY'27.\nTurning to our cash flow on Slide 23. We generated approximately $3 billion in operating cash flow and over $2.2 billion in free cash flow, which was a new record. Our conversion rate from adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow was over 70% and free cash flow conversion was over 50%, showing the company's robust earnings power. Our strong financial position enabled us to return over $2.2 billion to shareholders this year. This was done through $1.2 billion of share repurchases and $1 billion of dividends.\nDespite the current macroeconomic landscape, we are poised to grow both top line and bottom line results in FY'25, in line with the financial algorithm range. As a refresher from our Investor Day back in May, our 3-year growth algorithm cost for sales growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% per year. We continue to be confident as we believe this algorithm is achievable and one we can deliver on a consistent basis.\nLet's go a bit deeper on 2025 guidance as seen on Slide 25. During FY'25, we expect net sales growth of 4% to 5%. Net sales growth includes inflation of approximately 2%, which we are seeing now and positive volume growth of low single digits for the year. We also anticipate a slight benefit from M&A during the year. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 7%, in line with the financial algorithm range.\nAs we highlighted at the Investor Day, 2025 EPS growth will be impacted by nonoperational below-the-line items with a higher tax rate and interest expense. We are confident these targets are achievable. Regarding phasing for the year, we expect similar traffic trends from this last quarter to continue into Q1 with modest industry traffic improvements in the back half of FY'25.\nWe also expect benefits from our investments in sales professionals and other growth initiatives as the year progresses. Consistent with our ROIC focus, our investments with sales professional hiring will yield meaningful returns over the long term. As Kevin stated earlier, we remain focused on improving local case performance in FY '25. For example, the sales consultant comp structure will shift to more bonus, less [indiscernible] performance-driven incentives and ensuring operating expenses will correspond more closely with sell results. We will be disciplined in adding self headcount in high-growth areas, and we will be focused on profitable local sales growth.\nTurning to expenses. We expect further improvements in operating leverage based on a continuation of the process improvement from this past year across our supply chain and corporate expenses. We ended FY'24 with strong cash flow conversion rate, highlighting the importance of cash generation. For FY '25, we expect a continuation of strong conversion rates in working capital management. We expect to distribute essentially all of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2025, depending on the volume of M&A activity as we did in 2024.\nReturning cash back to shareholders is an important part of our capital allocation strategy as we value our dividend aristocrat status as we expect to pay over $1 billion related to dividends in FY'25. Additionally, we are targeting approximately $1 billion of share repurchases with fluctuations dependent on M&A plans. We also expect to operate within our stated target of 2.5 to 2.75x net leverage for the year. We wanted to provide guidance on several other important modeling elements. The tax rate for FY'25 is expected to step up to approximately 25%. The increase is driven by global minimum tax rate.\nInterest expense is expected to step up to $650 million. Other expense is expected to be approximately $50 million and adjusted D&A is expected to be approximately $800 million for the year. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1% of sales. We will look at each investment through the lens of driving both growth and ROIC. As a company, ROIC will dynamically guide our operating and investment decisions, which will accrete shareholder value over time as we continue the focus on both margin dollars and rate growth.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance as we have tremendous opportunities ahead. I'm continually impressed by the size of scale advantages at Sysco. We are the industry leader in a growing industry. The stronger operating model I mentioned before allows us to continually enhance our competitive advantages in this highly fragmented market. Consistent performance combined with Cisco's focus on the long game, is a winning formula to create compounding benefits for our shareholders.\nOur scale advantages are reflected in our industry-leading margins. Sysco's diversification as the industry leader across customer types with 2/3 in restaurants and 1/3 in recession-resistant categories, such as education and health care is also a structural advantage. Our robust industry-leading operating cash flow and strong investment-grade balance sheet gives us access the capital at attractive rates so we're able to take advantage of high ROIC growth opportunities as they present themselves.\nAnd as you can see in our performance results, our international segment is proving to be a benefit, contributing higher rates of growth than our U.S. business. We believe international can continue to be a profitable growth engine for Sysco. As we embark on a new fiscal year, I look forward to our progress ahead. We are positioned to win. Thank you for your time today. With that, we are now ready for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will now begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nDivisional VP of IR, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. On today's call, we have Kevin Harkin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kenny Chung, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2023, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are included in the comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nBefore I begin our call today, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge an extraordinary event that happened during our third quarter. As you may have seen on Friday, March 1, a Sysco truck was involved in an accident on the Clark Memorial Bridge in Louisville, Kentucky. After the accident, the Sysco truck was hanging precariously over the Ohio River. A Sysco colleague was inside that truck, staring down at the river, not knowing if for truck would fall into the river before she was rescued.\nI bring this topic up to take a moment and recognize the Louisville Fire Department for their heroic efforts. I especially want to thank Bryce Carton, the fire fighter that risked his life to rescue our colleague from her truck that day.\nThe heroes of the Louisville Fire Department acted with efficiency, skill and courage to rescue a Sysco family member. We are thankful for their successful efforts and for all that first responders do every day to protect our communities. I want to be very clear, business results matter. But the fact that the Louisville Fire Department saved the life member of our family deserves praise and pause.\nNow onto matters of business results and outcomes. I'd like to start with restaurant foot traffic data. Much has been written over the past few weeks as select restaurant names and select food service suppliers have announced their performance results. As you have heard in those communications and observed through credit card transaction data, foot traffic to restaurants is down year-over-year.\nAs we have previously indicated, January restaurant traffic came out of the gate with a slow start, down high single digits to prior year due to a host of factors. February and March foot traffic improved to down low single digits, but still posted a headwind for distributor case volume growth. While the trend of the quarter was 1 of sequential improvement, we had expected a stronger recovery throughout the quarter.\nIt is our belief that restaurant menu prices have impacted foot traffic, and this is something that needs to be addressed more broadly by the industry. The industry needs to take actions to improve affordability for end consumers.\nAt Sysco, we will be focused on helping our local restaurant customers by taking the following actions: securing the best possible costs from our suppliers in sharing in those savings with our end customers; introducing new and improved Sysco brand alternatives to save restaurants time and money; introducing menu alternatives that bring lower-cost food options to restaurant operators so that they can provide value offerings to their end consumers; and lastly, providing restaurant operators with even more ready now and precut offerings to help them lower their labor costs.\nWhile food costs have moderated year-over-year, restaurants are still facing significantly elevated labor costs. So with restaurant foot traffic data as context, I will segue into Sysco's specific business outcomes with a brief highlight of the quarter on Slide 5.\nWe were able to convert negative foot traffic for the quarter into positive 2.7% enterprise sales growth with USFS volumes growing 2.9%. Both of these figures were greater than the food-away-from-home industry, which declined year-over-year in case volumes. Sysco's 2.9% case growth, enabled a profitable market share increase for the quarter in the U.S.\nAs I have stated previously, larger broadline players are winning in the market due to size and scale advantages and Sysco's specialty platform is delivering outsized growth versus the specialty channel. Our local case growth was 0.4% for the quarter, stronger than the overall market. However, it is an area that must improve. We are focused on making the necessary progress. I'll pick more to this topic in a moment.\nFor the quarter, we increased adjusted operating income by 8.4% and adjusted EPS by 6.7%. Both figures were consistent with our expectations for the quarter and are well above the S&P 500 average profit growth for the quarter. As we have said many times, we have levers we can pull in our P&L if and when volume is softer than expected.\nI am proud of our team for taking strong actions in the quarter to manage expenses and deliver strong gross profit margins. The agility and accountability of the leadership team enabled us to deliver our profit objectives for the quarter despite softer sales and case volumes.\nI'd like to pivot now to give you a brief update on our 2 biggest areas of focus: local case growth and overall expense management with supply chain productivity. Starting with local case growth. Earlier this year, I highlighted 4 actions we are taking to improve our performance as seen on Slide 8.\nI cautioned at the time that these actions would take time to impact the business, but that we are confident in their impact. First, sales force hiring. We plan to hire a net increase of approximately 400 sales professionals by the end of this year, and we are meaningfully on track to hit that hiring target.\nThe quality of the new hires to date has been strong, and we are actively focused on skills development training for the new cohort. We believe this new sales staff will positively impact our 2025 growth trends. Second focus area: performance management. Our sales consultants have responded to the sales of leadership coaching and have increased their visit frequency to Sysco customers. For the remainder of fiscal 2024 and entering fiscal 2025, we are increasing the focus of our sales staff on prospecting net new customers. In a slower traffic environment, we need to increase the number of customers that we service.\nThird focus area, sales compensation. We are 2 quarters live with an updated compensation model and the feedback from our SEs has been positive. Our top performers are seeing their earnings growth, and our extended team has ample opportunities to increase their earnings. Importantly, retention data for our SEs is at or above historical high watermark levels. Our updated compensation program better aligns the incentives of our sales teams with the P&L of Sysco.\nFourth focus area, total team selling. When a Sysco customer buys from Broadline plus one or more of our specialty businesses, Sysco wins. And the customer wins too. Why? We removed 1 or more competitors from the account, and we are able to get more cases on a Sysco truck. As a result, we can increase delivery frequency, increase sales college coverage, and invest in the customer from a buy more, save more perspective.\nSysco's extensive produce, protein and now equipment and supply specialty businesses are unmatched in the industry. We intend to better leverage this competitive differentiation in years to come domestically and internationally. In summary, we are confident in our ability to profitably grow our local business, and we are working on the right things to deliver that growth consistently. This work is a top priority and will receive the necessary focus and attention from our entire team.\nLet's transition to our supply chain and overall expense management at Sysco as seen on Slide 9. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making on both fronts. Retention is greatly improving, especially within our driver population. This is resulting in better productivity, fewer accidents, reduced product shrink and improved customer service outcomes.\nLabor productivity is improving within our warehouse and driver populations.\nBoth departments delivered the highest productivity rates of the past few years in March. Lastly, our transportation metrics are improving as we have increased pieces per truck optimized our routing metrics and improved on-time arrival rates. All told, these supply chain improvements are helping us lower our cost to serve and increase our Net Promoter Scores.\nEven more impressive is the work we are doing in our global support center to reduce our SG&A expenses as we delivered a year-over-year 5.5% reduction in SG&A in the quarter. We displayed strong discipline and management agility by leading through a softer-than-anticipated customer environment. We plan to stay very focused on expense management and gross profit delivery in the quarters and years to come.\nIt is important to note that while we are very focused on expense management, we continue to invest where it matters. Our supply chain capacity expansion projects remain on track and the investments and improvement in our customer-facing technology tools continue to advance.\nInternational continues to be a bright spot for Sysco. I recently returned from a trip to Europe, and I'm very pleased with the performance of our International business segment and leadership team. Our newly formed global operating model is having an impact. International top line grew 4.5% and adjusted operating income grew 63.4% in the quarter.\nBoth figures are better and higher than our U.S. business. As I have said, International will be a top and bottom line growth catalyst for years to come at Sysco. More importantly, there are no structural impediments internationally that prevent Sysco from delivering higher EBIT as a percentage of sales in each international country.\nGreg Bertrand, our global COO, has identified many examples of best practices that are being shared across the globe to help each country accelerate profit improvement progress. The proof is in the strong profit improvement results that we are delivering.\nAt Sysco, we take a long-term view in running our business. focused upon profitable and disciplined business returns. Despite the softer traffic start to calendar 2024, food-away-from-home is a growth industry as seen on Slide #10, taking share from the grocery channel for 17 of the past 20 years. We believe that is a macro trend that will have staying power for years and decades to come.\nInternationally, the food-away-from-home trend is following a similar pattern to the U.S. business. However, it is many years behind from a penetration percentage. This fact will be a tailwind as Europe follows the food-away-from-home percentage growth trajectory, growing sales across all 3 dayparts.\nFood-away-from-home is a good business, a stable business, and Sysco has a diversified range of customer types that help us navigate individual segment choppiness, including a strong business in health care, hospitality, education and business and industry.\nAs I wrap up my prepared remarks, I will echo something I have said previously, I'm very optimistic about the future of Sysco. We are confident in the strategic plan we are executing against, and we have a strong leadership team. Business plans don't always materialize the exact way you draw them up on paper. This past quarter, volume was softer than we anticipated and planned.\nI am proud of our team for acting with agility and delivering strong bottom line growth for the period despite the lower restaurant traffic. Additionally, we are committed to making progress in local case growth and operations efficiency. These efforts will enable us to deliver solid financial outcomes.\nBefore I turn it over to Kenny, I welcome you to join us in New York City on May 22 for our next Investor Day. We will go deeper into each component of our business strategy, and Kenny will present a financial algorithm for Sysco to deliver against for the next 3 years. We look forward to seeing many of you in New York. And with that said, Kenny, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by building upon Kevin's commentary regarding the quarter. This quarter delivered strong earnings growth in a dynamic volume environment, as our teams took appropriate proactive steps and delivered adjusted operating income growth of 8.4%. After the soft January start, we delivered sequential volume improvements each month during the quarter.\nOur team is focused on improving local case volume growth with several factors that provide confidence in improving results for the remainder of FY '24 and into FY '25.\nTurning to margin management, continued execution across our operating levers resulted in improvements to both gross profit dollars and margins and lower structural and variable operating costs. This included continued progress with supply chain retention and productivity, ending the quarter with our highest monthly productivity rate for the year for both delivery partners and selectors.\nWe are also excited today to announce that we are raising our cost out target for FY '24. We now expect to generate more than $120 million of cost out in FY '24 based on incremental actions during the third quarter. This is especially important to offset the softer than expected near-term consumer backdrop, while continuing our investments for growth.\nIn addition to the structural cost out, our plan this year also include executing on synergies from our acquisitions this year. For example, with the closing of the Edward Don transaction earlier in the fiscal year, we are already realizing early post-acquisition synergies that are in line with our expectations with more to come.\nIn total, our actions resulted in positive leverage with gross profit growing at a faster rate than operating expenses for the sixth consecutive quarter as we delivered sequential improvement in cost per piece throughout the quarter. Despite the current macro environment, we are confident in our ability to efficiently flex operating expense, the volume performance and achieve bottom line results.\nOur continued balanced and consistent approach with capital allocation priorities also resulted in $753 million returned back the shareholders via repurchases and dividends. Our Q3 profit performance combined disciplined use of our operational levers. We remain focused on the long term, along with more consistent and normalized demand in future periods.\nAs we navigate through transitory industry trends, our size and scale advantages and operating discipline, deliver strong bottom line results this quarter while we continue to gain market share. As the market normalizes, we will be able to use the power of our P&L to continue to deliver accretive results. As we look to finish the year strong, we remain focused on delivering our annual EPS guidance while also executing on planned share repurchases and dividends in Q4.\nNow turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. For the third quarter, our enterprise sales grew 2.7% and driven by U.S. foodservice growing 3.4% and international growing 4.5%, partially offset by SYGMA decreasing 3.5%. Enterprise inflation was 1.9%.\nAdditionally, U.S. Broadline inflation was 1.2%, and our International segment was up 4%. We expect this normal rate of inflation in line with historical averages going forward, which bodes well for the industry. The total U.S. foodservice volume increased 2.9% and and local volume increased 0.4%. Additionally, international local volumes were up over 4%, adding to our outsized international growth.\nAs previously outlined, we have plans in place to drive more positive, consistent local volume performance. Please note, volume reporting now includes, following its first full quarter under Sysco's leadership. Don positive impacted U.S. foodservice volumes by 2.7% and local volumes by 1.6%. We deliver expansion in both GB dollars and margins as we produced $3.6 billion in gross profit, up 5.2% and gross margin improved to 18.6%, an increase of 44 bps.\nThis improvement during the third quarter reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuation through tight margin management, driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts disciplined and rational pricing, increased mix of specialty as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco Brand products within Local, which increased 3 bps to 46.5%.\nThe Sysco brand continues to offer superior customer value, and we expect positive momentum going forward. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.5% of sales. Expenses during the quarter included benefits from continued improvements with retention and productivity Kevin mentioned earlier, in addition to our benefits from our variable labor planning tool and cost-out commitments.\nBased on incremental actions during Q3, we now expect to generate over $120 million of savings in FY '24. We recently reduced 500 roles to reduce expenses and fund incremental headcount and higher growth areas like specialty. The residual savings were also used to offset a softer current macro backdrop, which is a proof point of the agility of our business and dynamic levers across the P&L.\nThese Q3 actions position us well to enter FY '25 if we're delivering incremental cost outs and operating leverage for future years. We continue to be encouraged with the progress of our international segment with adjusted operating income growing 63.4% for the third quarter.\nThis is a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in this segment over the past 3 years. Q3 adjusted operating income grew 8.4% to $799 million for the enterprise. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $977 million, up 8.5%.\nTurning to the balance sheet on Slide 17. We ended the quarter at a 2.81x net debt leverage ratio and we are confident we will end the year within our target range. We ended the quarter with $11.6 billion in net debt and approximately $3.1 billion in total liquidity and -- approximately 96% of our debt is fixed with the floating component offset our cash reserves. Our debt is well ladder and our strong investment-grade credit rating is a competitive advantage for us.\nTurning to our cash flow on Slide 18. Year-to-date, we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $864 million in free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow year-to-date was driven by timing of working capital and the Easter calendar impact along with a planned step-up in cash taxes. Our cash flow is driven by continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating cash and free cash flow. And importantly, we remain on track to grow free cash flow for the full year FY '24. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $753 million to shareholders this quarter via share repurchases and dividends.\nTurning to FY '24 guidance. We are reiterating adjusted EPS of $4.20 to $4.40. Our guidance at the midpoint assumes approximately 7% EPS growth on a year-over-year basis. Factoring in the softer overall marketplace, we also expect to end the year with net sales to be approximately $79 billion. Additionally, we remain confident in delivering increased free cash flow by year-end after a record performance last year.\nWe also plan to remain diligent with operating discipline for the fiscal year and beyond. For the year, we also remain on target to return over $2.25 billion back to shareholders. Looking ahead to the future fiscal years, we also wanted to highlight and anticipate a step-up in our FY '25 tax rate due to the global minimum tax rate rule changes. More details will be shared in our Q4 earnings call.\nFurthermore, we want you to be aware that interest expense will step up from FY '24 to fund our capital allocation priorities while continuing to operate within our leverage ratio of 2.5x and to 2.75x. Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, our focus on high ROIC investments back into the business will be balanced and disciplined, supporting our industry-leading margin profile.\nThis includes operational discipline with cost out delivery and margin management. This is in addition to our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet. Our size and scale advantages are meaningful positions of strength for the long term. We have successfully demonstrated our performance in a variety of operating environments in our company's long history. That remains true today as we expect to win market share profitably and continue to generate cash with strong conversion rates, ultimately beating our plans to grow and reward our shareholders on the forward.\nBefore I conclude the call, I echo Kevin's invitation to join us for Sysco's Investor Day on May 22. If you are interested in attending, please reach out to Kevin Kim and our Investor Relations team. Please note, this meeting will also be webcast. We hope you can join either in person or virtually. Thank you for your time today. I'll now pass the call back to Kevin. SP365612955 Thank you, Kenny.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nI'd like to turn to 1 more important matter before we move to our question and end this morning. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced that Ed Shirley has stepped down as Cisco's Chairman of the Board for personal health reasons. As a result of Ed's decision effective immediately, I will serve as Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. I am honored by this appointment, and I look forward to serving our shareholders, our customers and our colleagues in this expanded responsibility. I want to thank the full Board for their continued support and guidance.\nMore importantly, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and thank Ed Shirley for his tremendous impact on Sysco over his 8 years of exceptional service on our Board. When I joined the company in February of 2020, Ed was our Executive Chair. Ed and I spent countless hours together building what became our Recipe for Growth strategy, and of course, navigating the early and significant impacts of COVID on the food-away-from-home sector. Ed's wisdom, guidance and substantial business experience were invaluable to me in those early innings at the company.\nRoughly a year later, Ed transitioned into the independent chair of the Board leadership position. He continued to provide substantial and helpful feedback and guidance to me, the Board and the entire management team from that leadership position. We are a better and more resilient company due to Ed's impact and leadership. On behalf of the entire Board, I want to thank Ed for his friendship, His mentorship and for his dedication to our company. He will be greatly missed. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nDivisional VP of IR, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\n[Audio Gap], we have Kevin Hercon, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kenny Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation refer, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 1, 2023, subsequent SEC filings and the news release issued earlier this morning.\nA copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com.

Additionally, we want to make the audience aware of Sysco's participation at the CAGNY Investor Conference on February 20 and our Investor Day on May 22 in New York. We hope you can join these events in person or virtually.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I'm very pleased with Sysco's performance for the quarter. Our company is the market leader in a growing industry or size and scale matter. This past quarter, we demonstrated that important position of strength by delivering another quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth.\nSysco delivered bottom line growth through a combination of volume growth, disciplined margin management and expense control. Our positive momentum from the first half of our fiscal year is expected to continue into the second half, and we remain confident in our full year growth expectations for sales and EPS. This includes 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 7% at the midpoint of our guidance range.\nSysco has improved how we leverage our scale through the Recipe for Growth strategy, and we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability metrics as well as leverage our industry-leading strong balance sheet. Our confidence in the year has enabled us to increase our capital allocation to shareholders for the year. We are announcing today an increase of our stock buyback target for fiscal year 2024.\nWe now expect to buy back approximately $1.25 billion of our stock this year up from our previously communicated $750 million. With the increased stock buyback and our industry-leading dividend yield, we will contribute more than $2.25 billion directly to our shareholders. Sysco's strong balance sheet and free cash flow enable us to make these types of shareholder-friendly decisions while providing ample liquidity to fund the long-term growth of our business.\nWe are, as we say, play from a position of strength. So let's get started with a brief highlight of the quarter on Slide #5. Beginning with the top line, we delivered sales growth of 3.7%, a sequential improvement from Q1, driven by a combination of positive case volume growth and positive product cost inflation. Importantly, this included a sequential improvement in local case volume growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. We will share more on that later.\nTurning to the bottom line, we posted over 11% growth in adjusted EPS, generating strong operating leverage. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage and the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Kenny will provide more details in his financial section.\nToday, I would like to update you on two topics I highlighted as priorities on our Q1 earnings call: Local case volume and supply chain productivity. During the quarter, we sequentially increased our case volume performance, growing our U.S. foodservice segment 3.4% and and delivering local case volume growth of 2.9%. We grew our market share profitably through our improvement efforts.\nNotably, this growth comes with the industry-leading profit margin rates you can expect from Cisco. The rate of volume growth does not include the benefit of Edward Don, which closed in late November, and we remain solidly on track to deliver our growth ambition versus the market this year. Importantly, the initiatives we outlined to drive local case performance earlier this year began to bear fruit this past quarter.\nWe are focused on improving sales execution. Our efforts are centered around properly serving our local customers in improving our local sales growth. A reminder of our local sales focus areas for fiscal '24. First, we started adding incremental sales headcount in the second quarter and expect to continue hiring in the second half of fiscal year '24 and in the coming years. The incremental headcount is targeted to optimize territory sizes and enhanced sales consultant effectiveness, demonstrating focused actions to deliver higher returns.\nThe benefits from increasing our local salesforce will accrue over time as new colleagues complete their training, move up the productivity curve and settle into their territories. As previously indeed, we continue to expect to see the vast majority of the positive impact from our fiscal year '24 hires impact fiscal year '25 performance.\nSecond, we recently refined our compensation model to further motivate our sales consultants on win, win, win behaviors for Sysco, our customers and our salesforce. We can already see the impact of the compensation change, and we expect the impact of these recent changes to grow over time. We will continue to optimize our compensation program over time to ensure we are properly rewarding and motivating our sales team.\nThird, our focus on performance management continues with a hyper focus on customer visit frequency and sales consultant visit quality. These efforts are improving outcomes of our sales visits and can be closely tracked in our CRM tool. Leveraging technology to maximize the effectiveness of each customer visit remains a top priority and I am pleased with the impact of our sales leadership team in the past quarter.\nLastly, total team selling continues to gain traction. Our sales teams across Broadline and Specialty are working more collaboratively and we are leveraging our data to maximize the time allocation of our selling specialists in produce, protein and ethnic cuisine segments like Italian. All told, these interconnected actions increased our local case performance from Q1 to Q2 by 300 basis points. Importantly, the exit velocity of the quarter was even stronger as our performance improved each month of the quarter. We are confident in our ability to continue to grow local sales while maintaining the positive momentum we have displayed in national sales.\nNext, I would like to provide an update on the progress we've been making within our supply chain. We continue to improve the performance of our supply chain by focusing on operational excellence. Chart 9 displays our year-over-year operating profit improvement, driven by positive operating leverage, with gross profits growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our supply chain employees continue to move up the productivity curve due to improved colleague training and significantly improved levels of retention, especially within the driver position with improved retention comes improved outputs across the supply chain, lowering hiring expenses, lower training expenses, improved productivity, lower levels of product shrink, improved safety metrics and improved service levels to our customers.\nEach of these elements positively impact our P&L and the improvement drops straight to the bottom line. We are extremely focused on continuing to improve colleague retention and productivity within our supply chain. Lastly, we continue to improve the rigor and discipline in our colleague staffing efforts. This includes better matching our hours worked to the volume of cases shipped and the difficult work of flexing down our staffing during lower volume periods. We will continue to refine our engineered labor standards that drive our staffing models, and we will increase the agility with which we match our staffing to our volume.\nOur Q2 results display a continuation of quarter-over-quarter progress in productivity gains, and we remain disciplined and focused on continuing that rate of improvement. These efforts will benefit the P&L in fiscal '24 and will carry into 2025 and beyond. We are bullish on our ability to continue to lower our cost to serve while simultaneously improving customer service levels. As I lift up from these two topics, improving sales effectiveness and improving our supply chain productivity, I would also like to communicate that we remain on track with our Recipe for Growth business transformation.\nOur digital efforts continue to advance. Our merchant teams continue to improve our product assortment, especially in Sysco brand. We are excited about the integration with Edward Don and how we can profitably grow our equipment and supplies business. We remain very pleased with the performance of our Greco Italian platform, and I am proud of our international business leaders for the compelling performance produced year-to-date from our International segment. At our Investor Day in May, we will dive deeper into each of our Recipe for Growth pillars.\nFoodservice distribution is a space for size and scale matters, logistics scale, cold storage scale in both warehousing and transportation, technology scale and sales force expertise and scale. We believe that no one is better positioned than Sysco to leverage global scale advantages in order to better serve customers and profitably grow the business. I am very pleased that fiscal '24 is off to a strong start, as we are profitably growing our market share and continuing a track record of delivering compelling top and bottom line growth.\nFor the remainder of fiscal '24, we remain hyper focused on the execution elements I highlighted today as well as advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. We are confident that these efforts will enable Sysco to deliver our financial plan. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. Kenny, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to build upon Kevin's commentary with a couple of points. First, we have positive momentum as Q2 marked another milestone with record top line and bottom line performance. Future results included sales and volume growth, along with strong cost of goods sold performance, resulting in adjusted gross profit dollar growth and margin expansion. Positive operating leverage was also driven by gross profit growing at a faster rate than operating expenses, demonstrating our disciplined margin management, which rendered adjusted EPS growth of over 11%.\nSecond, we are excited about our first half performance and confidence in our positive momentum for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we are increasing our share repurchases expectations from $750 million to $1.25 billion for FY'24 versus the prior guidance. This will increase expected total shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases to approximately $2.25 billion for FY'24.\nThis is in addition to our continued reinvestment into the business, including M&A, such as the addition of BIX and Edward Don earlier this year. Capital allocation is a competitive advantage for Cisco as the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and reward our shareholders at the same time.\nNow turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. For the second quarter, our enterprise sales grew 3.7%, with U.S. foodservice growing 3.2%, International growing 9.6% and SYGMA decreasing 1% driven by planned exit of customers that did not meet our disciplined profit thresholds. This planned exit along with strong supply chain productivity improvement, helped more than double our SYGMA profits this quarter, another prime example of our ROIC focus in action.\nEnterprise inflation was 1.1%. Additionally, U.S. Broadline inflation was slightly positive and our International segment was up 6.6%, all aligned with our expectations. Total U.S. foodservice volume increased 3.4% and local volume was up 2.9%, a 300 bps sequential improvement from Q1. Please note, volume reporting includes slight benefits from the acquisition of BIX Produce. Our volume reporting does not include our Edward Don or specialty meats business based on their unique product attributes.\nWe produced $3.5 billion in gross profit, up 4.9%. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.2%, an increase of 21 bps. Our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuations driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts and disciplined pricing. Penetration rates of Sysco brand products increased 22 bps to 46.9% in U.S. local and was essentially flat at 36.8% in U.S. Broadline.\nOverall, adjusted operating expense were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.4% of sales as we achieved another quarter of positive operating leverage. The strong management of expenses during the quarter was due to the positive impact of the variable labor planning tool and supply chain efficiencies that Kevin mentioned, and benefits from our previously announced $100 million of cost-out commitments. We are on track to achieve this commitment for FY'24 and the planning process for delivering incremental costs for future periods has already begun.\nAdditionally, with the successful closure of our BIX and Edward Don acquisition, we are on pace to realize both top and bottom line synergies. Adjusted operating income growth of 7.6% in USFS, coupled with outsized profit contributions from our international and SYGMA segments, contributed to bottom line performance. Positive momentum continued in our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 30.1% during the quarter.\nOur international results are a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in this segment over the past 3 years. The Recipe for Growth playbook is yielding dividends in the U.S. and internationally. In total, Q2 adjusted operating income was $745 million, up 9.2% and adjusted EBITDA was $927 million, up 11.6%.\nTurning to the balance sheet, which remains strong. We ended the quarter at 2.75x net debt leverage ratio. This is in line with our target range of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt leverage ratio. Our planned increase to the share repurchase program is already in action with an accelerated share repurchase program that was executed in early January. We ended the quarter with $11.2 billion in net debt that is well laddered and over $3.4 billion in total liquidity.\nApproximately 96% of our debt is fixed with the floating component offset by our cash reserves. Our strong investment-grade credit rating is a competitive advantage as evidenced by our team successfully issuing approximately $1 billion of new debt in November. We are committed to our capital allocation strategy as seen on Slide 19, which includes a balanced approach with 3 elements: First, investing in the business for profitable and consistent growth; second, maintaining our investment-grade credit rating; and third, returning cash to shareholders, dividends and share repurchases.\nTurning to our first half cash flow. We generated $856 million in operating cash flow and $527 million in free cash flow, growing 70% and 141%, respectively. This growth includes continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating cash and free cash flow, and we remain on track to grow free cash flow for full year FY'24. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $353 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends this quarter.\nLooking forward to fiscal year 2024 guidance, we are reiterating net sales growth of mid-single digits to approximately $80 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow to $4.20 to $4.40. This represents a 7% growth at the midpoint. Additionally, we expect positive operating leverage with gross profit growing at a faster rate than OpEx for the year.\nWe continue to expect slightly positive rates of industry volume growth and inflation. This includes Sysco's U.S. Broadline remaining inflationary in the second half of the fiscal year. Our planned top line also includes benefits from M&A activity consistent with previous disclosures for an average annual contribution of 50 to 100 basis points of growth. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate accretive acquisitions, but the remainder of FY'24 will focus on integration efforts capturing synergies for accretive acquisitions like Don and returning excess cash back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nFor the second half and over the long term, we expect to win market share, profitably and consistently. Our efforts will also focus on strong cash generation with conversion rates, ultimately feeding our plans to grow and reward our shareholders. Thank you for your time today. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nDivisional VP of IR, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and CEO; and Kenny Cheung, our CFO.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Our prepared remarks will cover the following themes: confidence in reiterating fiscal year '24 guidance, another record quarter of disciplined financial performance with a focus on profitable growth, disciplined ROIC and balanced capital allocation priorities. These themes all confirm Sysco's strength as the market leader. During our call today, I plan to cover 2 topics: first, a summary of our Q1 results; and second, a spotlight on our Recipe for Growth strategy and how we continue to build capabilities for profitable growth at Sysco. So let's get started on Slide #5.\nOur positive momentum from last year continued with top and bottom line growth in Q1 to kick off the new fiscal year. Beginning with the top line, we delivered sales growth of 2.6%, driven by a combination of positive case volume growth and effective management of product cost deflation in the U.S. Turning to the bottom line, we posted double-digit growth in both adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS with an adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. We delivered this double-digit bottom line growth in a slowing top line macro and deflationary COGS pressure within the U.S. Our ability to post strong results in Q1, considering those factors, is a proof point that Sysco is positioned to be successful in fiscal '24.\nWe believe the breadth and quality of our product assortment across both Broadline and Specialty, combined with the expertise of our commercial selling organization and the strength of our supply chain and balance sheet position Sysco to produce compelling results in the near term and even stronger results over the longer term. Digging a bit deeper into the quarter. We grew volumes in our U.S. Foodservice segment with Q1 total case volume growth of 1.6% and local case volume essentially flat year-over-year. We successfully grew share as the industry was roughly flat for the quarter. Our national sales team posted an outstanding quarter, winning substantial new business in the health care, restaurant and hospitality sectors. As I have stated before, we are winning these multiyear contracts with strong profit profiles versus historical averages.\nOur success is a testament to the improvements we have made and how we serve large national customers. We have made it easier for national customers to do business with Sysco by improving our technology integration with our customers' systems and by providing large customers with more dedicated and accountable support. Additionally, our national and international fulfillment scale is very attractive to large concepts. We are able to provide them with supply chain that can scale with them wherever they operate. We expect our national sales segment to continue to outpace the industry due to these capabilities. Our local performance continues to outpace the overall industry, building on a positive multiyear trend. The local market has slowed quarter-over-quarter, and Sysco is not reacting by leading with price to win share. Instead, we are focused on profitable growth, properly serving our local customers and improving our local sales execution.\nLocal volume, as I said, was essentially flat, and that is something we intend to improve upon in our year-to-go periods. We are taking the following actions to drive increased growth in local volumes. First, we will invest in incremental sales headcount as we have grown our local business faster than the overall industry for each of the past 3 years. Our territory sizes for the sales teams have increased as well. We are actively hiring more sales resources, which will allow us to optimize territory sizes and enhance sales consultant effectiveness. The benefits from increasing our local sales force will accrue over time as new colleagues complete training and settle into their territories. We expect to see the majority of the positive impact from this action in fiscal year '25.\nSecond, we recently enhanced the compensation model for our sales consultants to incentivize our colleagues to focus on profitably growing their and Sysco's business. This change was implemented recently during our fiscal Q2 and the positive effects will be felt in future quarters of this fiscal year. The change to our compensation model better aligns the incentives of our sales team to the key priorities of Sysco. Third, we recently ramped up our focus on what we call visit frequency and visit quality expectations. Through our robust CRM, we are able to track the activity and outcomes from our sales team. Our sales leadership team is focused on colleague coaching to improve outcomes on both fronts.\nLastly, total team selling, which was recently expanded coast-to-coast will improve cross-selling opportunities, combining the relationship strength of our sales consultants with the product expertise of our specialty businesses. All told, we are confident we can increase local sales volume growth while maintaining momentum with strong margin management. We will drive that improvement through healthy long-term decisions and by remaining disciplined in our pricing decisions. Next, I would like to provide a brief summary of select Recipe for Growth enhancements from our recent quarter. We recently implemented a global operating model for our leadership structure. It is important to note that our International segment posted another strong performance in Q1, solidly growing top line and bottom line faster than the U.S. business.\nThe change to a global operating model will help further accelerate our progress internationally. We will move faster in adopting best practices, delivery of new capabilities and leveraging new tools across Sysco's global footprint. An example will be taking the Sysco Your Way concept and bringing it to life globally. To have this new operating model, we named Greg Bertrand, our Global Chief Operating Officer. In his expanded role, Greg will be accountable for managing Sysco global operations, driving profitable growth in local sales and operations. I'm extremely confident, and Greg as a leader, and I'm bullish on the impact that he will have on his expanded geographic territory. We continue to make progress in improving the performance of our supply chain.\nChart displays our year-over-year operating profit improvement, driven by positive operating leverage, with gross profits growing at a faster rate than operating expenses. Our supply chain operation remains fully staffed, and we continue to improve employee retention, and we are building on productivity gains. We recently implemented a new and improved labor scheduling tool that has increased our flexibility in matching our staffing to the variable work nature of our business. As a result, we are becoming more flexible in how we manage our cost structure to match business volume seasonality. The end result of that improvement is a lower cost structure. In addition to our focus on improving current day supply chain performance, we are expanding our supply chain capacity to increase our ability to serve rapidly growing markets.\nFor example, we recently celebrated the groundbreaking for a net new Sysco fold out site in Mesa, Arizona. Each new fulfillment center at Sysco undergoes a vigorous ROIC review and a project prioritization test. Each of the investments will increase our capacity, in feed future Sysco growth in already successful high-growth geographies. We are excited to have the first of these net new buildings in Allentown, Pennsylvania, opening later this fiscal year. The Allentown facility will enable us to better serve the highly dense Northeast corridor and support the eventual expansion of our specialty platforms in that geography.\nOn October 11, we announced an exciting addition to the Sysco family through our planned acquisition of Edward Don, a leading distributor of food service equipment and supplies based out of Chicago. Founded in 1921, and led by Steve Don, the business generates approximately $1.3 billion in annual revenue and services a broad range of customers across the U.S. We believe the acquisition will be a great addition to the Sysco family, further demonstrating our Recipe for Growth strategy focusing on building strategic specialty platforms that help us support restaurant and hospitality customers.\nEvery Sysco customer needs restaurant equipment to manage their business Don's compelling product offering and robust supply chain capabilities will improve how we serve those customers. After deal closing, Steve Don will continue to lead the business and we will partner together to profitably grow the segment. Most compelling is the following: Sysco sells to hundreds of thousands of customers who are not currently buying restaurant equipment and supplies from either Don or from Sysco. Post deal approval and closure, we have a great opportunity to introduce the Don assortment to Sysco's customers and have a 1 plus 1 equals 3 equation through this accretive acquisition. I look forward to working closely with Steve and his capable leadership team to bring that ambition to life for many years to come.\nAs I wrap up my remarks this morning, I will summarize with the following. We grew our top and bottom line within the quarter and achieved positive operating leverage, with gross profit dollars outpacing operating expenses. The result was more than 10% growth in adjusted EPS. This double-digit growth is on top of a strong year in 2023. We are being very prudent in how we manage the business in fiscal '24. We are closely monitoring the macro environment for signals on customer traffic in the rate of expected inflation this year. We are prepared to take actions to ensure we are successful in the operating conditions presented to our industry. For the full year, we believe Sysco is positioned to succeed growing top line faster than the market and delivering robust bottom line growth. We have 3 more quarters to go, and we are focused on delivering our plan.\nI'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide a detailed review of Q1 performance in select fiscal year '24 guidance commentary. Kenny, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to build upon Kevin's commentary with a few additional points. First, we are reiterating our annual guidance for fiscal year '24. We have momentum, and we're off to a solid start for the year. Q1 was the highest operating income quarter in Sysco's history, marking the sixth consecutive period of record quarterly profits. We effectively manage deflation in the U.S. Q1 results included sales and volume growth, adjusted gross profit dollar and margin expansion and disciplined operating leverage all flowing down to adjusted EPS growth of over 10%.\nSecond, our Recipe for Growth strategy is delivering accretive margin value across the U.S. and International segments. For example, we've continued to expand and enhance Sysco Your Way neighborhoods globally. In addition, we successfully closed on our BIX acquisition, a leading produce distributor our recently announced plans to acquire Edward Don, which will provide further penetration opportunities. Our strong balance sheet enables options to add acquisitions at opportunistic times while simultaneously returning cash back to shareholders.\nLastly, we are the market leader in a growing industry with leading profit margins. We have diversity across geographies, a broad customer mix and brands, in particular, the depth of our Sysco product brand, which sets us apart from the competition and is a position of strength. For example, we were hedged from a deflation in the U.S. as international inflation rates remain positive. Another example of our strong positioning would be local case performance. While we were essentially flat in the U.S., Canada, local volumes were up over 6%, adding to our outside international growth. These ingredients and fundamental building blocks are unlocking long-term profitable growth and positioning Sysco to win market share in a growing, highly fragmented industry.\nNow turning to a summary of our reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the first quarter, our enterprise sales grew 2.6% with U.S. Foodservice growing 0.9%, International growing 12.2% and SYGMA decreasing 1.4% as we recently exited business that did not meet our disciplined profit threshold. This planned exit helped double our SYGMA profits this quarter, another prime example of ROIC in action. Enterprise inflation was 1.7% and positive throughout the quarter. U.S. Broadline inflation was negative 0.4% and our International segment was up double digits, in line with our expectations for the first quarter. Total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 1.6% and local volume was essentially flat. We produced $3.6 billion in gross profit, up 4.6% versus the prior year.\nAdjusted gross margin improved to 18.6%, an increase of 36 bps compared to last year. As mentioned earlier, our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement during the first quarter reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost fluctuations. The improvement in gross profit was driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts, disciplined pricing as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco brand products which increased 6 bps to 37.2% in U.S. Broadline and 53 bps to 47.5% in U.S. local results. Overall, adjusted operating expense were $2.8 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of sales.\nThe strong management of expenses during the quarter was due to the positive impact of the variable labor planning tool Kevin mentioned and benefits from our previously announced $100 million of cost out commitments which commenced at the start of the year. For example, we are expanding the use of shared services in Canada, which are expected to drive improved operational efficiencies. These actions items enable Sysco to reduce Q1 adjusted SG&A at the Global Support Center by approximately 7% year-over-year. All 4 operating segments continue to show increases in quarterly profitability, including substantial growth in the International and SYGMA segment.\nAs seen on Slide 18, Q1 adjusted operating income of $854 million for the enterprise grew 10.6% year-over-year, delivering another record quarter. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion, up 11.7%. We continue to be encouraged by the progress of our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 8.7% for the first quarter. This is a continuation of the robust growth and positive momentum in this segment over the past 3 years. On an enterprise basis, Sysco's quarterly performance in the current macro environment provides another proof point of the company's ability to grow top line and bottom line under any environment while continuing to achieve positive operating leverage. I'm also particularly pleased with the health of our balance sheet. We ended the quarter at a 2.6x net debt leverage ratio. This is within our target of 2.5 to 2.75x, a substantial improvement from 5.2x just over 2 years ago.\nWe ended the quarter with $10.3 billion in net debt and over $3.1 billion in total liquidity. Approximately 96% of our debt is fixed with the floating component offset by our cash reserves. Our debt is well laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY '27. Our strong investment-grade credit rating is a competitive advantage against the current macro backdrop. The strength of our balance sheet and history of delivering consistent cash flows provides us with robust options related to capital allocation. We will be excited to add another accretive acquisition upon the planned closing of Edward Don, which is in addition to our acquisition of BIX earlier in August as we continue to invest in the business.\nEven with the substantial M&A actions, we remain committed to returning cash back to shareholders planning $750 million in share repurchases and approximately $1 million in dividend payout for FY '24. Depending on the volume of M&A activity for the remainder of the year, we could increase share repurchases further while remaining within our stated leverage target of 2.5 to 2.75x. Turning now to free cash flow. We generated $87 million in operating cash flow and negative $73 million in free cash flow for the quarter. Our first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter of the year due to seasonality, and this year was impacted by timing of working capital as well as our continued investment for growth related to capital expenditures. We remain confident that we will grow free cash flow year-over-year in FY '24. This growth is expected to be driven by continued strong conversion rates from EBITDA to operating and free cash flow.\nOur strong financial position enabled us to return $353 million to shareholders this quarter. This was done through $100 million of share repurchases and $253 million of dividends. Even with a softer overall marketplace growth, we believe we are positioned to grow both top line and bottom line results in FY '24. Looking forward to fiscal year 2024 guidance, we are reiterating net sales growth of mid-single digits to approximately $80 billion and adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 10% to $4.20 to $4.40. We continue to expect slightly positive rates of industry volume growth and inflation. Regarding inflation in U.S. Broadline, we expect a step-up to slightly positive inflation beginning in Q2 ahead of our prior expectations, which had a positive inflection point in Q3. This slightly positive inflation rate is expected to continue into the second half of the fiscal year, consistent with prior expectations.\nFor the year, we remain on target for enterprise inflation to be slightly positive. Our planned top line also includes benefits from M&A activity, consistent with previous disclosures for an average annual contribution of 50 to 100 basis points of growth. Additionally, we expect positive operating leverage, with gross profit growing at a faster rate than OpEx translating to bottom line growing faster than top line. Our Q1 operating margin improvement reflected this leverage as we applied our commercial and operational initiatives which will also have the benefit of driving long-term profitable growth. We remain on target for an effective annual tax rate of approximately 24.5%. Interest expense is expected to step up by approximately $50 million year-over-year of $20 million from prior guidance, driven by higher debt associated with our planned acquisition of Don.\nWe plan to reward our shareholders with our industry-leading dividend yield and consistent share repurchase activity, all while remaining within our leverage target of 2.5 to 2.75x for the year. For the remainder of the year and over the long term, we expect to win market share profitably and continue to generate cash with strong conversion rates, ultimately beating our plans to grow and reward our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kenny. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide #23. We are the market leader in a growing industry. We are the largest in a space where scale matters. We're investing to create additional fulfillment capacity to support profitable growth to further leverage that scale advantage. We are investing in technology to support our customers and remove friction in the purchasing experience. We are expanding our product range to become even more of a one-stop solution for restaurants and strengthening our selling process with improved training, compensation and digital tools to improve the close rate of product introductions to our customers. These efforts are combined with an increase in the size of our sales force in order to reduce territory size enabling our sales team to provide more dedicated service to our customers. All combined, these capabilities are making it easier for Foodservice operators to focus on what they do best, serving great food for their customers.\nSysco has a strong record of generating consistent results. In fact, Sysco has consistently grown annual sales over our more than 50-year history. In addition to compelling top line growth, Sysco is the industry leader from an adjusted operating profit margin perspective. We have the strongest balance sheet, and we are the only food service distributor with an investment-grade credit rating. Additionally, we remain the only distributor paying a strong dividend yield. We plan to build on that position of strength for years to come. As our recent proxy statement highlighted, we increased the weighting of financial metrics in our annual incentive program and added return on invested capital as a measurement and our long-term equity plan. These changes are well received by our management team, and we are very focused on delivering the guided results.\nWe are confident in the long-term health and growth trends of the Foodservice industry in total. Our $350 billion total addressable market will continue to grow over time. As food away from home has taken share from the grocery channel for '24 of the past 25 years. Scale matters in this industry and Sysco is playing the long game to strengthen our scale advantages. These factors, coupled with our dividend and share buyback programs will set investors up to be rewarded over time. I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. There is no other place that I'd rather be than at Sysco, right here, right now. As always, I want to thank our 72,000-plus Sysco colleagues for their commitment to our customers and our shareholders. Operator, you can now open the line for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nDivisional VP of IR, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. On today's call, we have Kevin Hourican, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Russell, our Chief Administrative Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 2, 2022, subsequent SEC filings and the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can also be found in the Investors section of our website. During the discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior year. To ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to 1 question and 1 follow-up.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I would like to cover 3 topics during my section of our call. First, I'll provide a summary of our Q4 results and our full year performance. Second, I'll convey an update on our Recipe for Growth strategy. And lastly, I'll provide some commentary on the macro conditions which we have modeled for fiscal '24 and how Sysco intends to operate within that environment. Kenny will provide much more detailed components of guidance during his section. So let's get started.\nWe are pleased with the strong finish to the fiscal year. Sysco posted record top line and bottom line results during the fourth quarter. Top line results as seen on Slide 5, were up 4.1% compared to last year delivering $19.7 billion in sales. The strong quarter generated a full year sales result of $76.3 billion, a record at Sysco. We grew annual sales by 12.5% or $8.6 billion on a constant currency basis. That sales growth is the equivalent of creating a net new Fortune 500 company within Sysco.\nTurning to volumes. Q4 case volume grew 2.3% and local case volume grew 0.8% across our U.S. Foodservice business, successfully growing our market share and furthering our #1 position in food service distribution. We are pleased with our share gains for the quarter and the year which build on meaningful gains delivered within fiscal year '22. Importantly, these gains are profitable share gains. We are not growing for the sake of growing as we have consistently pursued profitable sales growth vectors domestically and internationally.\nMoving to gross profit. Our sales and merchandising teams delivered a strong quarter from a GP growth perspective. We grew gross margin rates and GP dollars per case, which is not easy to do in a disinflationary environment. Our teams are doing excellent work in strategic sourcing to reduce COGS and further penetrating Sysco brand cases with our customers. Advancing Sysco brand helps gross profit and leads to increased customer retention. Lastly, we are growing our higher margin specialty business, which strengthens our overall margin profile.\nNext in the P&L is operating expense. I am most proud of the quarter from the perspective of the progress that we are making in reducing our expenses. We have been clear with investors that our first half of the year in fiscal '23 had elevated expenses. This was driven by 2 factors: investments in our business and a supply chain struggling with new colleague productivity. In the second half of fiscal '23, we made major progress on our expense ratios in greatly accelerated productivity improvement within our supply chain. Retention of colleagues has improved, productivity of our colleagues has improved, and our supply chain initiatives are bearing fruit. All told, we delivered an operating leverage of 370 basis points in Q4, growing GP dollars meaningfully more than expenses.\nSlide 7 highlights the sequential improvement with OpEx over the course of the last fiscal year. We began the year in our U.S. Foodservice segment with quarterly operating expense growing over 22%, but ended the year with a growth rate of 0.5%. Our focused effort to deliver supply chain efficiencies and broad-based cost reductions drove the sequential improvement across the year.\nWe expect to make further operating expense progress in 2024. We will be [indiscernible] focused on ensuring our supply chain is properly staffed, properly trained and working safely and productively. We have the leadership expertise, supply chain tools and supply chain infrastructure to lead the industry in this regard, which is 1 reason why Sysco operates at an EBIT margin over 1.5x higher than our industry distributor average.\nRecord top line and record bottom line performance in Q4 is a direct result of our recipe for growth and our focus on excellence in execution and operations. The improvement from first half to second half within fiscal '23 was notable, enabling Sysco to grow EPS more than 23% for the full year. In addition to delivering a strong P&L in Q4, we achieved record free cash flow, and we returned approximately $1.5 billion back to shareholders during the year. We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the quarter despite rapid disinflation and slower overall industry market volume growth. We believe our success in spite of those conditions, positions the business to be successful in 2024, which I will speak to more in a moment.\nAs is my custom, I would like to provide a brief summary of select Recipe for Growth elements of our strategy from our recent quarter. I will start within our supply chain initiative. Our work on strengthening engineered labor standards across our supply chain is paying dividends. As I mentioned a moment ago, we made significant headway in improving our supply chain efficiency. We have recently strengthened our work method standards training within transportation roles, enabling our colleagues to work safely and work more productively. Additionally, we have increased retention rates within our workforce through our improved training programs. The driver academy is national, and the impact of this program is a better trained workforce.\nNow I would like to highlight the progress that we have made on the food sales and marketing side of our Recipe for Growth. Last month, we announced an agreement to purchase BIX Produce. BIX Produce is a leading produce specialty distributor based in Minnesota. The acquisition is expected to provide a strategic opportunity for FreshPoint to expand its geographic footprint in an area of the country where it does not currently have operations. BIX has a strong assortment offering, including fresh-cut produce, grab-and-go sandwiches and value-added production capabilities.\nIn addition to our good work in expanding specialty, we also upgraded our digital shopping platform during the quarter. Our Shop digital platform is now available in Spanish and we have deployed more than 100 new feature enhancements. Some of these enhancements include a new homepage, new category and cuisine pages, improved search and navigation and lastly, a new deals for you page. These enhancements have driven an increase in product page visits, adding incremental volume through add to cart purchasing.\nThere is no finish line in our digital improvement journey. We will continue to improve our digital tools over time, enabling us to reduce friction in the purchase experience and inspire our customers to buy more from Sysco.\nOur centralized pricing tool has given us the ability to be what we call right on price at the region, customer and item level. During the first half of '23, we experienced rapid inflation and in the second half of '23, we experienced rapid disinflation and even deflation towards the end of Q4 within our core [ USBL ] business. Our merchants have been biting to secure best possible cost and our pricing tool ensures that the real-time cost fluctuations are built into our pricing strategies.\nManaging pricing across hundreds of thousands of customers, tens of thousands of products, in approximately 7,500 sales reps has never been stronger. This is evidenced by our consistently strong performance in GP dollars growth and adjusted gross margin rate growth of 28 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We want our sales reps focused on customer engagement, relationship building, consultative selling and solving problems for our customers. Our pricing tool enables our [ SCs ] to spend more time on those value-added activities.\nLastly, Sysco Your War is now live in over 400 neighborhoods across 5 countries and our loyalty program, Perks is active with over 12,000 customers. Both programs are continuing to deliver compelling top and bottom line growth. The past year has been a heavy lift as we work to get these programs off the ground. In 2024, we can focus on maximizing the impact of these compelling programs with less effort and investment required than in 2023.\nIn summary, our Recipe for Growth is working, enabling Sysco to profitably grow our business and differentiate versus others in our space. Both compelling is that food away from home is a growth sector as seen on Slides 10 and 11. Sysco has been profitably growing faster than the overall market, delivering record top and bottom line results. We expect to continue to win market share profitably in the years to come, introduce so in a fiscally responsible way.\nI'd like to wrap up my time this morning with some comments about the operating environment we expect for fiscal '24 and Sysco's positioning within that environment. My main message is that scale matters in this industry and that strong operators are best positioned to succeed regardless of the environmental conditions. Sysco is a very strong operator with meaningful scale advantages. With that said, in fiscal '24, we expect the market to grow at a lower rate than '23. We also expect the rate of inflation for the year to be below historical standards.\nIn the second half of fiscal '23, we experienced rapid disinflation, followed by deflation within our core U.S. Broadline business towards the end of the fourth quarter. We expect that deflation will continue within U.S. Broadline for the first half of fiscal '24, followed by muted U.S. Broadline product inflation in the second half. We expect that our International segment will remain inflationary during the coming fiscal year given unique marketplace conditions in those geographies.\nNet-net, for Sysco, we expect an inflation rate that is slightly positive throughout fiscal 2024 below our historical average. We believe the Q4 environment, we just exited is largely reflective of the operating environment for the coming year. Importantly, we grew our top and bottom line within that quarter. We are being very prudent in fiscal '24 in managing our expenses given the volume and inflation components that I just conveyed. Despite these conditions, Sysco is positioned to succeed, grow faster than the market and deliver bottom line growth.\nOur confidence is also based on our structural competitive advantages. First, our International business, which is approximately 18% of sales, continues to outperform, providing a natural hedge as international inflation rates remain elevated and are expected to stay higher than the U.S. Second, our purchasing scale is the largest in the industry, and our strategic sourcing efforts will enable Sysco to secure improved pricing in a deflationary environment. Third, Sysco, as a diversified business with strong sales across 12 major product categories to help buffer the impact of inflation or deflation in any 1 category. Additionally, our strategic pricing software will enable Sysco to be extremely purposeful on how we manage the impact of disinflation and deflation.\nLastly, further advancing Sysco brand penetration, domestically and internationally, is another lever to pull to deliver GP dollar growth when the environment is deflationary.\nThe exit velocity of fiscal '23 gives us confidence in delivering strong results in 2024. In summary, here is what we expect for '24. Lower rates of overall market volume growth versus '23, continued market share gains and profitable growth at Sysco, deflation in the U.S. for at least the first half of the year and muted overall company-wide inflation for the full year. Disciplined expense management, Kenny and I have directed an effort to reduce structural expenses by approximately $100 million. Extremely disciplined return on invested capital or ROIC focus, continued progress in advancing Sysco brand penetration and growth within specialty.\nIn total, given all these interworking variables, we are modeling an adjusted EPS range of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full year. The midpoint of that guide would generate approximately 7% EPS growth versus fiscal '23.\nNow in our third year of Recipe for Growth, we are positioned to press the accelerator on certain proven initiatives. For example, we can optimize our performance and launch Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, which takes less effort than starting up a neighborhood. Our digital tools are becoming more and more pervasive with our customers, and we can optimize the personalization of these interactions to increase yield through each transaction. We have always said that the Recipe for Growth is a wheel where each initiative fuels the next.\nFiscal '24 is a year of optimizing what we have launched versus kicking off net new efforts. This will enable Sysco to be laser focused on what matters most, executing with excellence against launched programs. This also means we will be able to grow our business with less investment. This was always our plan within the Recipe for Growth, and it is coming to reality in fiscal '24. In addition, our expanded geography of specialty businesses, like the recently announced BIX acquisition will increase the impact of our higher growth specialty segment.\nIn fiscal '24, we are committed to both profitably growing our top line, meaningfully reducing OpEx and generating a higher rate of return on key initiatives. Given the confidence that we have in our long-range road map, we are happy to announce that we have reintroduced ROIC as a long-term compensation metric for our leadership team. In addition, we have increased the weighting of financial metrics within our short-term annual bonus program. As I have said many times before, the best companies in the world are growth companies, and we expect that Sysco will continue to profitably grow faster than the overall market.\nI'm thrilled to have Kenny as my partner on these objectives. We are committed to maximizing every dollar invested in producing the greatest shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide additional financial details. Kenny, over to you.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start off by thanking our customers, colleagues and partners around the world for helping us deliver another record quarter. Sysco operates a high-volume business and I'm proud of our efficient response in servicing and delighting our customers.\nWe closed out the fiscal year strong, delivering improvement across the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow. Q4 financials reflect positive sales and volume growth and operating expense leverage. Altogether, these rendered a record quarter of operating income, net income and adjusted EPS. Our results also reflect improvements in operational efficiency through productivity and resource optimization. This elevated performance will enable us to reinvest back into the business and return excess cash back to shareholders, an important theme we expect for FY '24 and beyond. Our unique value proposition with the Recipe for Growth at the forefront is what differentiates us as a growth company. As Kevin stated earlier, we will continue to focus on accelerating programs that have high returns, which is a key priority in my role here at Sysco.\nNow turning to a summary of the reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.1% in with U.S. Foodservice growing 2.5%, International growing 12.2% and [ Sigma ] growing 1.4%. With respect to volume, Total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 2.3% and local volume increased 0.8%. We produced $3.7 billion in gross profit up 7% versus prior year. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.7%, a sequential increase from the prior quarter and an increase of 28 bps compared to last year.\nOur gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement during the fourth quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which moderated to 2.1% for the total enterprise consistent with our expectations. The improvement in gross profit was driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco brands products which increased by 11 bps to 37.2% in U.S. Broadline and 64 bps to 47.3% in U.S. local results. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 13.5% of sales, a 29 bps improvement from the prior year.\nAll 4 operating segments continue to show increases in quarterly profitability, including substantial growth in the International and Sigma segments. As seen on Slide 22 and 23, Q4 adjusted operating income of $1 billion for the enterprise showed a strong exit rate, growing 25% compared to FY '19. This is the highest adjusted operating income quarter in Sysco's history and is now the fourth consecutive period of record quarterly operating income. For the year, adjusted operating income increased to $3.2 billion, growing 17.3% compared to our prior FY '19 record, an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco.\nFor the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.2 billion, growing 14.4%. We are thrilled with the progress of our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 58% for the fourth quarter. As stated earlier, our International business continues to deliver robust growth with positive momentum.\nI am also particularly pleased with the health of our balance sheet, which further strengthened this quarter. We delivered on our target leverage ratio, another important milestone as we ended the year at 2.5x net debt leverage ratio. This is within our target of 2.5x to 2.75x, a substantial improvement from 5.1x just over 2 years ago. We ended the year with $9.7 billion in net debt with total liquidity of $3.7 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our debt is well laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY '27.\nTurning to our cash flow. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $2.1 billion in free cash flow, which was a new record. Our conversion rate from adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow was 55% and operating cash flow conversion of 75% shows the company's robust earnings power. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $1.5 billion to shareholders. This was done through $500 million of share repurchases and $996 million of dividends.\nDespite the changing macroeconomic landscape, we are positioned to grow both top line and bottom line results in FY '24 and the long term. The guidance we are providing is reflective of the traction, our Recipe for Growth initiatives are gaining in addition to moderate industry growth rates. Furthermore, we believe our Q4 performance provides significant proof of our ability to drive shareholder value as several of these macroeconomic and industry dynamics are expected to continue into FY '24.\nAs Kevin highlighted on Slide 7, we began the year with elevated levels of operating expense growth. As a result, operating expenses were an area of focus for our supply chain teams throughout the year, and we were able to reduce sequential improvements. We ended the year with significant operating expense leverage, allowing us to improve margins. This is important progress, and we expect continued improvement going into FY '24.\nLet's now turn to look forward. During FY '24, a we expect top line growth of mid-single digits and positive volume growth, which will move Sysco to approximately $80 billion in annual sales. This will be another record for Sysco. Importantly, we expect inflation to be slightly positive on an enterprise basis for the full year. Based on our analysis and the exit rate from the fourth quarter, we believe that first half globally will be slightly positive and the second half will step up. This includes continued deflation in U.S. Broadline during the first half of the fiscal year with an expected rebound in the second half of the fiscal year. Based on our structural advantages, Sysco is well positioned to manage our COGS effectively and continue to pass along pricing without impacting demand. It is all about better buying and better selling.\nTurning to expenses. We expect further improvements in operating expense leverage based on a continuation of the process improvement from this past year. One month into the new year, we've already executed actions to support $100 million of cost out where it has been factored into the guidance. We will continue finding incremental opportunities to enhance operational efficiency and adapt swiftly to the constant evolving business environment in which we function. We will manage our business with discipline and agility.\nWe have bottled out frontline operations wage growth to be approximately 4.5% to 5%. This is higher than our historical average but much lower than select other industry news due to the fact that in many instances, our supply chain colleagues are paid above market and our drivers can earn as much as $100,000 per year. We also expect free cash flow to grow further in FY '24 on top of a record performance in FY '23.\nWe wanted to also provide guidance on several other important modeling elements. The tax rate for FY '24 is expected to step up to approximately 24.5% compared to 23% in FY '23. The increase is driven by geographical mix related to strong international growth and increases in state tax rates. We plan to remain in line with our net debt leverage ratio for the year, related interest expense is expected to step up by about [ $13 million ] for the year due to cash uses for growth investments, dividend payments, share repurchases and anticipated M&A activity. Other expenses is expected to be approximately $30 million for the year, driven primarily by pension expense. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS for FY '24 and at $4.20 to $4.40. This reflects adjusted EPS growth of approximately 5% to 10%.\nOur capital allocation strategy will continue to focus on investing in the business. Examples include M&A, maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating and continuing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. CapEx should be consistent with the prior year at approximately 1% of sales.\nReturning cash back to shareholders is important, as is our dividend aristocrat status. And we plan to step up these efforts in the coming year. In FY '24, we will have a $0.04 dividend increase, and we expect to complete approximately $750 million of share repurchases as we start the fiscal year with $4 billion in remaining authorization. Depending on the volume of M&A done in FY '24, we could increase share repurchases further while continuing to operate within our stated goal of 2.5x to 2.75x leverage.\nWe will look at each investment through the lens of driving growth and ROIC, and I am pleased to state that our ROIC for FY '24 is expected to surpass our pre-COVID levels through sales growth, margin expansion and prudent management of the balance sheet. As a company, ROIC will dynamically guide our operating and investment decisions which will accrete shareholder value over time as we continue to focus on both margin dollars and percentage growth.\nNow in my role for a few months, I'm constantly impressed by the size and scale advantages at Sysco. This is a high-volume business that runs fast, and any micro adjustments around operational efficiencies are felt quickly. Our scale advantages are also reflected in our industry-leading margins. Our diversification as the industry leader across customer types with 2/3 in restaurants and 1/3 in recession-resistant category, such as education and health care is also a structural advantage. Our robust industry-leading operating cash flow and strong investment-grade rated balance sheet, gives us access to capital at attractive rates. So we're able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.\nAs you can see in our performance results, our International segment is proving to be an advantage, contributing higher rates of growth than our mature U.S. business and the inflation dynamics in other geographies are helping create a bit of a natural hedge across our business portfolio. We believe that International continues to be a profitable growth engine for Sysco.\nI am even more excited 90 days into this role than I was on day 1, and I look forward to our progress ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kenny. As we conclude, I would like to provide a brief summary on Slide 28.\nSysco has a strong record of generating consistent results. In fact, Sysco has grown annual sales in 51 years out of our 54-year history. We expect our positive momentum to continue in 2024. In addition to compelling top line growth, Sysco is the industry leader from an adjusted EBITDA margin perspective with the strongest balance sheet. We plan to build on that position of strength in fiscal year 2024.\nWe ended our fiscal year 2023 with strong sales volume and share growth, growing volumes across both our chain and independent business. The result was a 23% adjusted EPS growth for the year with record top and bottom line contribution. We have momentum going into the year as our Recipe for Growth transformation now in its third year is further building upon and enhancing our competitive scale advantages. Importantly, we have demonstrated our third consecutive quarter of operating leverage with gross profits outpacing operating expense growth.\nFor fiscal year '24, our dual focus on core efficiency measures and optimization from proven growth opportunities will deliver another year of top and bottom line growth. There are bright days ahead for the food away from home industry and more specifically, Sysco. I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey and as always, I want to thank our 72,000-plus Sysco colleagues for their commitment to our customers and our shareholders.\nOperator, you can now open the line for questions."

Welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nDivisional VP of IR, Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. On today's call, we have Kevin Harkin, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kenny Cheung, our Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Russell, our Chief Administrative Officer.\nBefore we begin, please note that statements made during this presentation that state the company's or management's intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, and actual results could differ in a material manner. Additional information about factors that could cause results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings. This includes, but is not limited to, risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 2, 2022, subsequent SEC filings and in the news release issued earlier this morning. A copy of these materials can be found in the Investors section at sysco.com. Non-GAAP financial measures are included in our comments today and in our presentation slides. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website.\nTo ensure we have sufficient time to answer all questions, we'd like to ask each participant to limit their time today to one question. If you have a follow-up questions, we ask that you please reenter the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We will start today with a brief review of our financial performance. We will then highlight how we continue to grow share profitably. And as is our custom, we will provide a brief update on select elements of our Recipe for Growth strategy.\nI will then introduce Kenny Cheung, who joined the team a couple of weeks ago as our Chief Financial Officer. Kenny will share a few thoughts about what attracted into Sysco in his initial observations. Neil Russell, now on the Chief Administrative Officer role, will provide a detailed update on our third quarter financial results our balanced approach to capital allocation. And lastly, he will provide additional commentary around guidance.\nOur Q3 results, as displayed on Slide #6 show continued double-digit top and bottom line growth. We grew faster than the overall market profitably, driving case volume growth of 6.1% across our U.S. foodservice business and total sales growth of 11.7%. Our positive momentum was aided by strong performance from our International division, with segment profits nearly doubling year-over-year. Our total company adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS to approximately 27%, resulting in the highest ever third quarter profit in company history.\nImportantly, sequential improvements in our supply chain operating expenses resulted in solid operating leverage. I am pleased with the progress that we are making in supply chain productivity and overall expense control. We delivered strong sales growth throughout the quarter despite some industry softness beginning in March. Core traffic to our customers moderated in March, negatively impacting the sales volume in the most important month of the quarter. Third-party data indicates that the overall market volume decelerated through slight growth in March softer than had been expected within the restaurant segment. Additionally, the rate of inflation year-over-year declined at an accelerated rate during the quarter. This pattern of lower volume and lower inflation put pressure on total sales and gross profit for the quarter.\nA lowering of the overall inflation rate is a good thing for the industry for the long term, but we need to carefully navigate through the reduction period. These 2 factors, lower traffic and lower inflation are now expected to continue throughout our fourth quarter. Offsetting these near-term headwinds, we expect our progress with supply chain productivity and overall expense control to also continue into our fourth quarter. Putting all of these factors together, we now expect to end the year near the bottom of our adjusted EPS fiscal 2023 guidance range of $4 to $4.15.\nRecall that last quarter, we outlined that the low-end guidance scenario considered softer macroeconomic and industry performance, which is exactly what we experienced in March. On that call, we also outlined our focus on driving fundamental improvements in our cost structure. By improving supply chain productivity and driving up costs across the entire company. Our objective was to deliver gross profit growth greater than expense growth, enabling operating leverage expansion. We delivered on that objective in the third quarter, delivering our highest ever Q3 profit at Sysco. We remain very focused on productivity improvement, and we expect our efficiency actions to accelerate into the fourth quarter.\nAt Sysco, we are playing the long game, and we are investing to win through our Recipe for Growth strategy. We are increasing our fulfillment footprint of distribution centers. We are improving our digital tools. we are enhancing our selling process and technology. These efforts are building momentum, and we remain on track to deliver our growth target for fiscal '23 of growing 1.35x the market.\nDespite what has become a more challenging macro environment, we are confident in our ability to differentiate versus others in the marketplace and create preference with our customers. We are also prepared to handle the challenges at a slowing macro and lower inflation rates will present to our P&L. We are hyper focused on what we can control. This means executing our sales playbook of driving profitable growth and improving our logistics expenses. I am pleased to report that in the most recent quarter, we made meaningful progress in our supply chain productivity.\nAs you can see on Slide #8, we delivered improved retention, improved labor productivity and improved overall expenses. While our operating expenses remain elevated compared to historical standards, Q3 marked a major step forward in sequential improvements. We continue to have healthy staffing levels, and we are increasing our fill rates to our customers. These factors are helping Sysco improve our Net Promoter Scores. We will continue to make progress in operating efficiency and improving customer service into our fourth quarter.\nWe profitably grew our volume and sales this quarter with U.S. foodservice volumes up 6.1% and local case volumes up 4.2%. Sysco continues to succeed versus the overall market. And as I stated a moment ago, we are on track to deliver our stated growth target for the year. We delivered compelling business performance in our specialty businesses this past quarter with notable gains in our Italian platform, and we continue to see very strong performance from our FreshPoint produce business. Winning in the specialty space is a priority in Sysco as our market share is below our fair share in these fast-growing and higher profit margin segments.\nSysco brand continues to succeed with increased penetration year-over-year of 29 basis points in U.S. Broadline and importantly, growing over 100 basis points in the U.S. local segment. This progress creates a mix benefit. As each additional Sysco brand case adds to our profit rate due to the higher margin and positively impacts customer retention due to the unique value proposition of Sysco Brand products. Additionally, I am pleased to report that our sales consultant retention remains at record high levels as our sales reps have adapted well to our improved sales enablement technology, pricing platforms, and our compensation program.\nAnd speaking of our compensation program, we plan to implement changes to the program at the beginning of the coming fiscal year. These changes will provide even more incentive for our industry-leading sales reps to grow their business profitably. The updated program is being tested currently in a U.S. region, and the early indications are positive. The modifications to our program came directly from feedback from our sales force.\nTurning to the Recipe for Growth on Slides 9 and 10. Our key initiatives are winning in the marketplace and fortifying our leading position in foodservice. We continue to drive compelling profitable growth as we expand the [co -- your ] way neighborhoods across the U.S. and internationally. As we highlighted at our recent CAGNY conference presentation, we are now live in over 300-plus neighborhoods across 5 countries. We will expand the program further in the coming quarters. The results from this customer-focused program continued to exceed our expectations, delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth.\nAdditionally, we continue to gain momentum with Sysco Perks. We have now enrolled more than 11,000 customers into the exclusive loyalty program. Sysco Perks is our invitational loyalty club, providing members with white glove service. Membership benefits include deliveries up to 6 days a week, exclusive access to rewards and industry-leading restaurant solutions to help our customers grow their business. When our customers succeed, we succeed, and we believe Sysco Your Way and perks are 2 outstanding programs to help our customers be successful and differentiate Sysco from our competition.\nLastly, we continue to make excellent progress with enhancing our digital tools. In the most recent quarter, we launched critical enhancements to our Sysco ordering platform called SHOP, and we further enhanced our sales consultant CRM tool, making it even more clear to our sales consultants the key priorities for each customer visit. The improvements to shop in our CRM will drive increased penetration with existing customers.\nTurning to our next topic. We are excited to welcome Kenny Cheung to the Sysco family as our CFO. We conducted an exhaustive global search for our next CFO, partnering with industry experts in talent placement and talent assessment. I'm thrilled that we have the opportunity to find and hire Kenny. Kenny joined Sysco with nearly 20 years of financial and operational executive experience, most recently having served as the CFO at Hertz. Prior to Hertz, Kenny had operational and financial roles at Nielsen, and he started his career with GE. Kenny has extensive financial, operations and international experience. When coupled with his learning agility and financial acumen, we are confident that he will help Sysco profitably grow our business. Kenny leads with a hands-on approach as a team player, and we believe he will be a strong cultural fit for Sysco, something that was essential to me in the search process.\nI want to publicly acknowledge Neil for his great work over the past few months as our interim CFO and congratulate him on his expanded new position at Sysco. I'm excited that Neil is in the newly created position of Chief Administrative Officer. In that capacity, Neil will help us ensure that our strategic initiatives are on track, including program governance for our expansive Recipe for Growth strategy. He is a trusted partner, and I greatly appreciate his leadership impact. With that, I'll now turn it over to Kenny.\n\nKenny K. Cheung\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled and honored to serve as the CFO of the world's largest foodservice distribution company. So why Sysco? I am excited to join the company at such an opportunistic and transformational time. Notwithstanding recent market dynamics, the food away from home industry is healthy and growing, currently a $350 billion industry with continued long-term growth tailwinds. Furthermore, one of the most attractive parts of joining this exceptional leadership team is a robust opportunity to build on our leadership position across the global markets we serve, size and scale matter in this industry and I believe in the bold transformation that is already yielding dividends for our business.\nSysco has a long history of generating robust operating cash flows and engaging in prudent M&A while maintaining a strong history of returning cash back to shareholders. It all starts with our purpose, which is to connect the world to share food and care for one another. Combining our purpose with our unwavering culture for operational excellence and compelling investments around technology, products and solutions and supply chain productivity are important actions. We believe these and other actions render structural accretive value, which will compound with our scale and continue our profitable market share growth.\nIn this role, I plan to leverage my background of adding value for large global companies that are customer service centric. My experience also includes driving field labor productivity profitably growing both contracted and short-cycle business and innovating to create value for our customers. Delivering consistent results will come from our industry-leading people, products and solutions. Remaining disciplined with supply chain inventory management and capital allocation will be critical to my role as it is all about maximizing return on invested capital and sustainable growth.\nLastly, I understand and appreciate the importance of driving environmental sustainability initiatives with Sysco already on a great path under Neil's leadership. While only here for a few weeks, I am impressed with the bench strength of the financial organization and the passion that my fellow colleagues have for the industry and the company. I look forward to working hand-in-hand with the wider team as we celebrate our Recipe for Growth strategy and further our #1 position. The future is extremely bright. We have a unique opportunity to build on our leader position and to define the future path for the food service and supply chain ecosystem. I look forward to working with you all.\nI will now turn it over to Neil, who will provide additional financial details.\n\nNeil A. Russell\n\nSenior Vice President-Corporate Affairs, Veritiv Corp.\n\nWelcome, Kenny, and hello, everyone. I will start today with a review of our third quarter financial performance and then discuss our expectations for the full year to go.\nDuring my discussion today, unless otherwise stated, all results are compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. As highlighted in our news release issued earlier this morning, and on Slide 14, which is posted on our website, we delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in both top and bottom line results. And we continued our balanced approach to capita allocation. all in the midst of an evolving macro backdrop.\nLet me begin with a summary of our third quarter results. Sales grew 11.7%, with U.S. Foodservice growing at 10.4% and continued positive momentum in our International segment, which grew at 18%. Volumes grew year-over-year and also improved sequentially. The U.S. Foodservice segment, which includes our Broadline, FreshPoint, Italian and other specialty businesses grew 6.1% and local case volumes increased 4.2%. Adjusted gross profit for the third quarter increased 12.8% to $3.4 billion with adjusted gross margin improving 18 basis points to 18.2%. Gross profit dollars per case grew in all 4 segments, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of such growth.\nOur gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement during the third quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which moderated to 4.9% for the total enterprise, down sequentially from 8.3% during the second quarter of this fiscal year. The improvement in gross profit was also driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco Brand products.\nOverall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.3% of sales, a 32 basis point improvement from the prior year. This quarter included transformation investments of $60 million. Excess overtime costs, otherwise known as productivity costs were reduced all the way down to 0 during the third quarter. As we improve our cost performance, we have now eliminated both snapback and these productivity costs. All 4 operating segments again showed increases in profitability year-over-year including substantial growth in the International and Sigma segments.\nAs seen on Slide 18, adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 27.8% and to $736 million. This is the highest adjusted operating income results for the third quarter in Sysco's history and is now the third consecutive quarter of record quarterly operating income an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco via a recipe for growth. This quarter continued to show gross profit dollar growth outpacing operating expense growth another important illustration of our financial improvement.\nFor the quarter, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 19% to $900 million. Regarding the balance sheet, our solid investment-grade rated balance sheet, strong cash position and healthy liquidity remains a competitive advantage. We ended the quarter at a 2.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and year-to-date, we have now repurchased 4.6 million shares. We are now at nearly $400 million of share repurchases for the year, nearing our goal of up to $500 million.\nInclusive of our dividend payments, Sysco has returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders thus far in fiscal year 2023. Of note, the Board approved last week another annual increase in Sysco's dividend, continuing the long-standing tradition of regular increases in solidifying our position as a dividend aristocrat. As a reminder, we remain well positioned in the current rising interest rate environment, with approximately 95% of Sysco's debt being fixed at attractive rates. Lastly, we are well positioned with our debt laddering schedule with staggered maturity dates over time.\nLet's turn to cash. As shown on Slide 19, year-to-date, cash flow from operations was strong at $1.4 billion, a $680 million improvement over the prior year. Net CapEx increased to $446 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe for Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution facilities. This includes 3 expansion sites and 7 new facilities in the next few years as we deliver new capacity in high potential markets and high-growth cuisine segments. Our investments are driving positive returns, and we plan to remain prudent with capital allocation with a focus on ROIC maximization.\nFree cash flow was very strong during the third quarter, increasing to $980 million year-to-date. This improvement was driven by disciplined inventory management and a positive change in working capital during the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash on hand and over $3 billion in total liquidity. As seen on Slide 22, our ESG or sustainability efforts advanced with the unveiling of our first electric vehicle hub in Riverside, California last month for Earth Day. This is the world's first electric vehicle hub of its kind, consisting of electric tractors and electric trailers fueled by renewable solar energy. These trucks are rolling, serving our customers as we speak with more on the way.\nOur industry-leading climate goals also include a commitment to work with suppliers representing 67% of our Scope 3 emissions to set their own science-based targets by 2026. Importantly, our focus on sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion is not only the right thing to do, we believe it will be good for business in the long term.\nLastly, looking ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond, we now expect diluted adjusted earnings per share near the bottom of the previously disclosed range of $4 to $4.15 per share. While Sysco continues to outperform the market due to the success of our Recipe for Growth strategy, the recent market softness is creating incremental business pressures impacting case growth and lower inflation. These macroeconomic headwinds are impacting traffic levels for some of our customers, resulting in slower traffic levels across the restaurant industry. To offset this, we are actively managing our portfolio and continue to expect further improvements in cost-out activities and supply chain efficiency for the remainder of the year.\nAdditionally, inflation remains on target for a low single-digit rate in Q4 of this fiscal year. As a result, we expect the fourth quarter to reflect a similar positive trend of gross profit dollar growth outpacing operating expense growth. Specific to share repurchases, we remain on target to repurchase approximately $500 million in shares this fiscal year.\nWith that, I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Neil. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide #24. Our Q3 financial performance reflects another record quarter, delivering adjusted operating income growth of over 27% to $736 million. Our profit leverage improved in the third quarter with gross profit growth outpacing operating expense growth. We expect that performance to continue in the fourth quarter.\nIndustry macro volume trends softened in March, which we expect to continue into Q4. We are also experiencing lower rates of inflation, a trend we expect to continue through Q4. These 2 factors are partially offset by significantly improving supply chain productivity performance. No one is better prepared to manage a choppy macro landscape than Sysco. Why Scale matters in this industry. purchasing scale, logistics route efficiency scale, inventory optimization scale. But even more importantly, customer diversification scale.\nAt Sysco, we serve restaurants up and down the price point spectrum. And also have a large nonrestaurant customer base. Many of our sectors are recession proof, for instance, education and health care. Other segments are still in recovery, travel hospitality and business and industry. Within our restaurant segment, given that we serve all restaurant types, we retain case volume if and when customers trade up or down within restaurant customer segments. At Sysco, we are steadfastly focused on what we can control. We are focused on winning new business and in penetrating additional cases with existing customers. As importantly, we are focused on improving our supply chain efficiency. Food away from home is a healthy long-term market, and we are prepared to be successful regardless of the short-term macro environmental conditions.\nLastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong and stable balance sheet, disciplined capital allocation and delivering continued returns to our shareholders. Our status as a dividend aristocrat remains a priority and we are proud to carry that distinction going into our 54th year. Sysco is a resilient and diversified company with scale advantages. We are increasing our scale advantages through our Recipe for Growth strategy. We are confident that our work product will deliver strong profit growth and compelling returns for our shareholders. Operator, you can now open the line for questions."

If you have a follow-up question, we ask that you reenter the queue.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nHello, everyone. Thank you for joining our call this morning. Our reported Q2 results, as displayed on Slide #6, include positive case volume growth, continued share gains, strong double-digit sales and earnings growth year-over-year. This included operating income growth across each of our segments, including SYGMA and International.\nImportantly, gross profit growth this quarter outpaced operating expense, an important milestone that we expect to continue into the remainder of the year as we make progress in further improving our supply chain productivity. In addition, we continue to advance forward our Recipe for Growth strategy with continued progress in our digital tools, supply chain investments, in sales and merchandising initiatives. The progress that we are making will enable Sysco to better serve our customers and grow profitably for years to come.\nAs you can see on Chart #7, we continue to succeed versus the overall industry growing 1.35x the market in the first half of 2023. I'll break down the sales momentum versus the market further in a moment. Strong top and bottom line growth was delivered for the quarter with adjusted EPS in Q2 of $0.80.\nI'd like to provide you with some details on select items that impacted our results for the quarter. The first call out is within case volumes. We leveraged a third party to help with macro forecast of the industry's growth. For the second quarter, the projection was that the industry, in total, would realize nearly 5% case growth year-over-year.\nIn Q2, the actual industry case growth rate was only 1%, excluding Sysco. This 400 basis points of case volume variance was significant, especially within the local segment. A contributor to the softer volume result was the reality that the Omicron overlap did not lift the market growth rate in November and December as had been anticipated. With that said, it is important to note that we are seeing stronger volume growth in January.\nAdditionally, a labor dispute that impacted three of our operating sites in the second quarter negatively impacted sales and case volumes during the October and November time frame. To be clear, the overall market growth rate is an industry-wide issue, while the labor dispute was a Sysco-specific challenge. The latter of the two issues is now firmly in the rearview mirror.\nWe will monitor the second half of the year case volume trends very closely, and we are taking specific actions to accelerate new customer acquisition in the Local segment for the second half of this fiscal year given the softer overall market. In addition to explaining the case volume dynamic, I would like to provide an update on operating expenses. As I mentioned, we are making solid progress with improving operating efficiency, and we grew GP at a faster rate than expenses in the quarter, a sign of progress and a trend we expect to continue.\nWe are making progress on improving supply chain productivity, and I will discuss that further in a few minutes. With that said, the aforementioned labor dispute had a meaningful impact on our Q2 expenses. During this disruption, we prioritized deliveries for essential customers, especially in the health care and education segments. As a result, we took the actions required to ensure that we could continue operations in these 3 sites, including leveraging third-party resources when necessary. These customer service measures pressured our expenses for the quarter, negatively impacting operating income. Again, this challenge is in the rearview mirror.\nOn the positive side of the ledger, our contract bid business is exceeding plan on the top and bottom line for the year. Our sales teams are doing an excellent job with customer retention, customer acquisition and profitability management within bid contracts. In addition, for our total business, our gross profit per case was strong for the quarter.\nOur sales and merchandising teams are doing a solid job with inflation management and strategic sourcing. Additionally, our Sysco brand merchandising team continues to do good work as we increased Sysco brand case penetration by 65 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year. As you know, each additional Sysco case adds to our profit rate and also positively impacts customer retention.\nFrom a sales and margin perspective, we continue to succeed by introducing higher-margin specialty products to our customers, and we are winning new business in the higher-growth produce segment. The success that we are having in GP per case is expected to continue into the second half of the year, and that progress will help offset portions of the market volume softness.\nLastly, we are doing a good job of managing expenses at our Global Support Center or corporate expenses, putting measures into place mid-Q2 to lower spending in these GSC cost centers. Those measures will stay in place for the remainder of the fiscal year to offset the lower marketplace growth and to mitigate a potential future recession.\nTurning to the second half, we remain resolute on continuing to drive profitable share gains and drive supply chain operations efficiency improvements. On the operating side of the business, we are making progress on improving our productivity. We are delivering improved retention rates, and as a result, lower hiring rates. By hiring fewer people, we have been able to lower recruitment expenses, lower training expenses, and we are seeing increased productivity across warehouse and transportation roles.\nThese improvements will accelerate into the second half of the year. We are fully staffed, domestically and internationally, and we have detailed work in place to ensure our staffing levels match our daily, weekly and monthly volumes. Q3 is typically the softest volume quarter of the year and we are improving our flexibility in managing staff levels to lower volume periods, all while preparing for the highest volume quarter of the year, Q4.\nThese staffing planning efforts are built into our year-to-go forecast. There are four factors that influence our full year guidance: Number one, softer than originally budgeted market volumes in the local segment, partially offset by Sysco growing 1.35x faster than the market in total; number two, higher than originally planned operating expenses, while steadily improving; number three, favorable GP per case and strong margin management; number four, favorable GSC or corporate expenses.\nGiven that we are now at the midpoint of the year and based upon the factors I just covered, we are adjusting our full year guidance. The full year is now guided to be a $0.15 range from $4 to $4.15, which represents year-over-year growth of approximately 23% to 28%, lapping the 126% growth from fiscal 2022. The midpoint of 407 represents a 15% growth rate versus 2019 levels. As is my custom on these calls, I plan to share a bit more color on a few key Sysco initiatives that are driving performance.\nFirst, let me start with sales growth. For the first half of the year, Sysco grew 1.35x the industry, and we are on track to deliver our sales growth goal for the year. Our Recipe for Growth strategy is winning in the marketplace. We are seeing solid growth in national restaurants, health care and our education segments. At the local level, we are winning business through our specialty programs: Produce, protein and Italian and through our customer growth initiatives, Sysco Your Way and Perks. Altogether, these sales wins are delivering compelling share gains.\nIn the most recent quarter, we advanced dozens of additional Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, introduced Sysco Perks to thousands of customers and began the integration of our latest Italian acquisition in Southern California. The Italian distributor we acquired in Los Angeles, Concord Foods, will be converted to the Greco business model shortly. We are planning for compelling sales and profit growth from that acquisition located in the second largest Italian market in the country. We will continue to expand the Greco platform across the country through a combination of both organic and inorganic activities.\nTopic two for today. I'd like to discuss the state of our supply chain and highlight the status of some important work.\nI'll start by discussing our core operations environment, and then I will highlight some of our strategic initiatives. During the first quarter of 2023, we achieved fully staffed status across our network. During the second quarter, we were able to focus on calling training, productivity and retention. I am pleased to report, and shown on Chart 9, that we are making progress on retention. And as a result, we will need to hire far fewer colleagues in the second half of this year.\nWe are seeing the green shoots of progress that come from the reality of less hiring, like lower recruitment costs, lower hiring costs, lower training expenses and lower overtime percentages. We are also experiencing improved levels of productivity from our colleagues as they become more skilled in their roles. Our colleague workforce is still inexperienced versus our historical standards, and therefore, productivity is still below historical standards. However, we are making solid progress.\nWe expect to make even more progress in the second half, enabling better flow-through from the top to the bottom line. Importantly, we grew gross profit dollars in Q2 at a faster rate than our expenses grew, creating a favorable leverage ratio. We expect to make even more progress in the second half of the fiscal year. From a supply chain strategic initiatives perspective, we continued on our journey to enable profitable sales growth, improved service levels to customers and to be the most efficient distributor within the food service industry.\nOur omnichannel initiative is now live in our first test region. We are able to share inventory across two Sysco houses, and we have enabled the ability to proactively leverage stocking strategies to improve service levels while lowering our overall level of working capital within the region. As I have mentioned previously, this project will help us lower transportation expenses by ensuring that the last mile distribution to a customer comes from the most proximate D.C. location agnostic of where the inventory is staged or warehoused.\nEqually importantly, we continue to make progress with 6-day deliveries. We have moved meaningful business through Saturday delivery, enabling effective day balancing, increased flexibility and increased capacity utilization across each of our now 6 full shipping days. The progress of this initiative will position us well for the upcoming peak fourth quarter shipping volume and will enable us to continue winning net new business at the national and local levels.\nWe are pleased to have the implementation in the rearview mirror, and we are now focused on efficiency leverage and customer acquisition. These two projects are perfect examples of how Sysco is transforming supply chain management within food service distribution. Our supply chain will enable us to grow profitably for years to come.\nI'll now turn it over to Neil, who will provide additional financial details.\n\nNeil A. Russell\n\nInterim CFO, Senior VP of Corporate Affairs & Chief Communications Officer, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and hello, everyone. It's good to be with all of you, and I look forward to our ongoing discussions while I'm in this interim role.\nDuring the second quarter, we delivered solid growth in both top and bottom line results and continued our balanced approach to capital allocation. All important elements of our Recipe for Growth as we further enhance competitive advantages for Sysco.\nI'll start with a summary of our second quarter results. Sales grew 13.9% with U.S. Foodservice growing at 13.7% and continued positive momentum for our International segment, which grew at 17%. Volumes for the U.S. Foodservice segment, which includes our Broadline, FreshPoint U.S. Produce, U.S. Italian and other specialty businesses, grew 5.2% and local case volumes increased 3.2%.\nGross profit for the second quarter increased 15.9% to $3.3 billion versus last year, with gross margin improving 29 basis points to 18%. Gross profit dollars per case grew in all four segments versus prior year, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of such growth. Our gross profit and margin improvement during the second quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which moderated to 8.3%, down sequentially from 9.7% during the first quarter at the total enterprise level.\nThe improvement in gross profit per case was also driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as we continue to partner with our suppliers. Overall adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.3% of sales, a 33 basis point improvement as a percentage of sales over the same quarter in the prior year. This quarter included transformation investments of $55 million and new colleague-related productivity costs of $22 million. This is an improvement compared to $63 million of transformational investments and $41 million of productivity costs in the first quarter.\nSnapback costs were reduced all the way down to 0 during the second quarter. We are pleased with the sequential improvement we experienced in both snapback and productivity during the quarter. All four operating segments, again, showed increases in profitability year-over-year during our second quarter.\nAs seen on Slide 15, adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 37.6% versus last year to $682 million. This is the highest adjusted operating income result for the second quarter in Sysco's history. Just a few years ago, our operating income was about 1/3 of the amount we achieved this year, an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco via our Recipe for Growth.\nIt is worth noting that adjusted operating income for the quarter was generally in line with external expectations. Importantly, as Kevin shared in his introduction, this quarter marked an important milestone as gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth, illustrating the beginning of the anticipated leverage with more progress expected going forward.\nFor the quarter, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 23.9% to $831 million. We are pleased with the continued top line growth in the second quarter. Gross profit dollar growth outpaced operating expense growth, and each of our segments generated substantial operating income growth. Our results, this quarter, were also impacted by three items, including: One, the impact of the labor dispute during the quarter at Sysco. We estimate this impacted our results by approximately $26 million during the second quarter.\nSecond, as just mentioned, a continuation of productivity costs of $22 million directly related to the higher volume of new colleagues we hired over the past couple of quarters. The first two items are included in adjusted operating income. The third item was below the operating income line in other income and expense, which showed adjusted expenses up $26 million over the prior year. This increase in expense was primarily due to increased pension expenses, which were a result of higher interest rates.\nRegarding pension, we also completed a transfer of a portion of our pension liabilities in the second quarter, decreasing Sysco's plan size, risk and overall administrative costs while protecting retirees as they will now be in the hands of an A-rated insurance company. This transaction resulted in a noncash charge in the second quarter of $315 million.\nIn regard to the balance sheet, our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet remains a competitive advantage for Sysco, and we ended the quarter at 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. In the first half of the year, we returned $268 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and paid our increased quarterly dividend. In total, returning $766 million to shareholders.\nAs a reminder, specific to our debt, we remain well positioned in the current rising interest rate environment, with approximately 95% of Sysco's debt being fixed rate at attractive rates.\nLet's turn to cash. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $503 million, a $126 million improvement over the prior year. Net CapEx increased to $284 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe for Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution facilities. Free cash flow increased to $219 million for the quarter. Working capital was a modest use of cash. We continue to monitor our inventory balances as well as our accounts receivable given the economic environment. We ended the quarter with approximately $500 million in cash on hand and over $3 billion in total liquidity.\nLastly, looking ahead to the remainder of the year and beyond, as Kevin mentioned earlier, we are adjusting our full year EPS guidance range to $4 to $4.15 per share for fiscal year '23.\nThe midpoint of this range reflects our current business plan, including the three items I described earlier. The low end represents a further macroeconomic softness and potential subsequent reduction in food-away-from-home volume demand. The high end of the range represents an improved macro environment or outside Sysco performance.\nAs we look toward the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect further improvements in productivity costs as the prior wave of new hires continues to ramp up in their roles. We also expect the second half of fiscal '23 to reflect a similar trend of gross profit dollar growth outpacing operating expense growth.\nNow I would like to provide a brief update on the status of our sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion work at Sysco. We issued our 2022 sustainability report and our DEI report in November. Sustainability is a key ingredient to our Recipe for Growth strategy to help ensure that we are growing responsibly and purposefully while leading our industry toward a more sustainable future.\nWe are proud of the actions we continue to take to build a more sustainable future for Sysco and for our industry. It is through these actions that during the second quarter, our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded from BBB to A in their latest ratings assessment. This is a reflection of our ongoing work in sustainability across Sysco's three pillars of ESG: People, product and planet.\nFurthermore, Sysco aspires to create a global culture that is decidedly diverse, equitable and inclusive, one where we foster belonging as we care for one another and connect the world through food and trusted partnerships. Our recently issued DEI report takes a deeper look into our strategic approach to diversity, equity and inclusion at Sysco and our commitment to caring for people.\nSince accelerating our DEI efforts in early 2020, we've developed a 3-year road map to guide our DEI journey, as we embed our strategic priorities throughout the business and achieve our DEI goals. Importantly, we recently achieved our current 2025 workforce representation goal and have now established a cross-functional task force to develop new workforce representation goals as we move forward.\nAll of these efforts are consistent with our purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for one another. Both of these reports can be found on sysco.com. The focus on sustainability and DEI is not only the right thing to do, it will also be good for business in the long term.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Neil. I appreciate all that you're doing for Sysco. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide 20. The following are our key takeaways from today's call: Our first half financial performance with a 15% increase in sales and a 26% increase in adjusted EPS displays the progress Sysco is making to win in the marketplace while we are transforming our business for the future.\nOur profit leverage improved in the second quarter, and we expect that ratio to improve further in the second half of this fiscal year. We communicated today several factors that impacted Q2 profit results. Importantly, the labor dispute is behind us, and we are making solid progress on improving our operating expenses. On the sales and volume side of the ledger, our core growth initiatives are working as designed, and we will focus on winning more new local customers in the second half of the year.\nSysco has proven that we can win share when we make it a priority for our sales teams. Encouragingly, January volume growth is off to a strong start. Lastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong and stable balance sheet, disciplined capital allocation and delivering continued returns to our shareholders. Our status as a dividend aristocrat remains a priority and we are proud to carry that distinction going into our 54th year.\nWe look forward to keeping you posted on our progress as a company and look forward to highlighting more about our longer-term initiatives at the CAGNY conference in a few short weeks.\nLastly, I'd like to provide a brief update on the status of our CFO search. We are making solid progress. The interest level from highly qualified candidates has been very strong. We have a very compelling pool of talent to choose from, and we are progressing along in the evaluation and selection process. I would like to thank Neil for the outstanding job he is doing as our interim CFO. He is a trusted partner, and I greatly appreciate his leadership.\nOperator, you can now open the line for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nVP of IR, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Sysco's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call.

If you have any follow-up questions, we ask that you reenter into the queue.\nAt this time, we'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Our Q1 results reflected continued positive momentum in our business to start the fiscal year. Our share gains continued this quarter as we posted sales growth of more than 1.4x the industry. We delivered double-digit growth in the top line and bottom line of our business.\nBeginning with the top line. We delivered sales growth of 16.2%, driven by a combination of effectively managing inflation and delivering case volume growth. Our U.S. Foodservice volumes and local case volumes continued to grow this quarter.\nTurning to the bottom line, double-digit growth across operating income and net income resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.97, which was in line with our expectations. The strong start to the year gives us confidence in reaffirming our full year guidance.\nI will highlight 2 topics during our call today. First, I will put into context Sysco's sales and volume growth for the quarter by highlighting some of the drivers of our strength. Second, I will detail our progress within our supply chain and our efforts to improve service levels and operations cost efficiency.\nSo let's get started with our unique position of strength in a growing industry displayed on Slide 7. Beginning with the Foodservice industry, the total addressable market is approximately $350 billion. Sysco grew 17% and the rest of the market grew 12% in the quarter, a strong start to the fiscal year.\nRestaurants continued to be resilient and our travel hospitality, plus our business and industry segments of our business posted year-on-year improvements. We see continued strength coming as tailwinds in the noncommercial sector should continue. We are closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions for signs of a business slowdown. At this time, we are not seeing recession concerns negatively impacting our business outcomes.\nWith that said, we are prepared to take additional cost reduction actions if or when the recession does begin to impact our P&L. In the backdrop of what has been a strengthening overall market, Sysco continues to outperform. Our sales teams continue to win market share, with Q1 being 1 of our strongest quarters of net new customer wins. Our national sales team posted an outstanding quarter, winning substantial new business in the education, health care and restaurant sectors. These wins are on top of the more than $2 billion of net new national sales wins delivered over the past 2 years.\nIt is important to note that we are winning this business at strong profit profiles versus historical averages and these are multiyear contracts.\nIn addition to our success with national sales, our Recipe for Growth is delivering results persist at the local level. Local case volume for the quarter grew 5.4% versus Q1 of 2022, successfully lapping a 26.7% increase from the prior year. Our strong start to the year in national and local sales has us gaining market share overall as we grew more than 1.4x the market for the period. As a result, we are on track to deliver our stated growth objective for the year.\nAs seen on Slide 8, our Recipe For Growth includes 5 pillars, focused on building new capabilities that will further enable our leadership position in supply chain and food sales and marketing. As is customary for our quarterly updates, I would like to highlight a couple of our growth drivers.\nToday, I will highlight progress that we are making in the products and solutions pillar with our Sysco Your Way program, and I will also provide an update on select future horizons work.\nWithin our Products and Solutions growth pillar, we meaningfully advanced our Sysco Your Way program over the past quarter. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is our service and delivery model for what we call restaurant dense neighborhoods. Think a large number of restaurants and a few block radius. We provide these neighborhoods with a next level of service from Sysco. Examples of that service include a late in the evening order cut off, daily delivery service, dedicated sales and delivery partner representation and additional white glove culinary and marketing services.\nThe constructs of the Sysco Your Way program were developed in partnership with our customers. And as a result, customers are responding favorably. The top and bottom line results from the program are exceeding our expectations. We are winning substantial new customers within these neighborhoods and existing customers are buying more product on a weekly basis.\nOver the past quarter, we ramped up our implementation efforts, and we will continue to roll out the program to applicable neighborhoods in the coming quarters. We are also bringing the program to international cities with recent implementations in Toronto and Dublin.\nThe scale of Sysco Your Way's impact on our overall results will grow each quarter as we add net new neighborhoods.\nFrom our future horizons growth pillar, we are pleased to announce that we have closed on 2 independent Italian distributor acquisitions over the past quarter. These acquisitions will give us access to premium Italian products in areas that were previously geographic [white] spaces for Sysco. We have plans to meaningfully scale these businesses by bringing the Greco go-to-market Italian selling strategy to these geographies. We are very pleased with the status of our work to expand Sysco's Italian specialty platform nationally.\nIn addition to these 2 examples highlighted today, we are advancing our Recipe For Growth within our International segment as well. Canada, our largest international business is also making good progress with these initiatives. This year in Canada, we will be upgrading our digital platforms, implementing a modern pricing tool, enhancing our team-based selling capabilities and launching Sysco Your Way.\nCanada is already a large and profitable market for Sysco that generated over $5 billion of sales last year, while posting #1 market share at 17%. The Recipe for Growth strategy will enable our Canadian business to further enhance our competitive advantages and better serve our customers. I'm very excited for the progress that we will be making in Canada to deliver profitable sales growth.\nThese are just a few examples of the good work that is happening, and I look forward to keeping you posted on our domestic and international progress across the 5 pillars in future quarterly calls.\nTopic 2 for today. I'd like to discuss the state of our supply chain improvement and highlight the status of some important work. Our global supply chain work continues to progress. We are simultaneously building on our long-term strategic initiatives like omnichannel while improving productivity levels and cost performance within our supply chain. Our strategic initiatives continue to move forward with 6-day deliveries, improving the driver experience, implementing best-in-class associate training and omnichannel fulfillment, all advancing forward in the quarter, and we can see the early signs of progress that these initiatives are delivering.\nAs they progress, they will enable profitable sales growth and improve our supply chain cost efficiency. Our supply chain is a strategic differentiator and the strategic work we are doing will widen that competitive moat in the coming quarters and years. Simply put, no one is doing more than Sysco to improve service levels to customers and to improve cost efficiencies within the Foodservice supply chain.\nIn addition to advancing our strategic initiatives, our teams have remained relentlessly focused on improving productivity in the near term. We made progress over the past quarter in improving associate retention. Retention improvement will enable us to improve associate productivity, and therefore, lower our operating costs in future quarters.\nIt is important to understand that Sysco's staffing levels remain healthy across our sites. We are staffed properly to support our current business and also to enable future profitable growth. Given our overall staffing health, we are meaningfully focused on associate retention and best-in-class training of our newer associates to improve productivity levels.\nWe are also teaching our supervisors how to leverage our engineered labor standards to deliver performance-based coaching. As our staffing levels have improved in recent quarters, we have been able to spend more of our leadership time and communication muscle on training to our work methods and standards. And this is where the intersection between our future strategy and our current improvement efforts intersect. A driver academy is graduating cohorts of trainees that are now hitting the streets. These drivers are already showing strong service, safety and productivity standards.\nAs importantly, we are tracking retention by training class, and we can see meaningfully higher retention rates of associates trained by Sysco versus hired from the external market. Over time, the percentage of associates trained from within Sysco will grow, and this ratio of growth will improve retention and productivity.\nCost of turnover is high in this industry, and improving associate retention is imperative. I'm confident that our training academies will give Sysco a meaningful advantage in the industry. We believe the advancements we are making in our physical capabilities and the investments we are making in improved training will provide improved service levels to our customers and strengthen Sysco's ability to profitably win market share in the coming quarters and years.\nI'll now turn it over to Neil, who will provide an update on our sustainability efforts. Neil, over to you.\n\nNeil A. Russell\n\nSenior VP of Corporate Affairs & Chief Communications Officer, Sysco Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin, and hello, everyone. Today, I would like to provide a brief update on the status of our sustainability work at Sysco. As we have mentioned, our efforts are anchored around 3 pillars: people, products and planet. We are proud that Sysco was a partner organization at the recent White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. At the conference, Sysco's sustainability efforts were recognized for our previously communicated $500 million commitment to global good in our communities by 2025. This includes a donation of 200 million meals to fight hunger, cash donations to food banks and volunteer hours associated with our colleagues actively participating in the communities we serve.\nEarlier this year, our Board also approved plans to include ESG and DEI metrics in our annual incentive plan, an important best practice. Every leader at Sysco is now held accountable to making tangible progress on both DEI and climate change efforts for the company, directly impacting our own compensation. These efforts are consistent with our purpose of connecting the world to share food and care for 1 another. This focus is not only the right thing to do, it will be good for business in the long term.\nAs I have explained recently to investors, the majority of Sysco's greenhouse gas emissions are the Scope 3 emissions of our customers. Many of our largest customers have set forth their own climate commitments and Sysco's improvement will help enable those partners to achieve their goals.\nI will now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and Neil, and good morning. the Sysco team delivered another quarter of progress with our Recipe for Growth, resulting in growth across volume, sales and profit giving us many reasons to be upbeat about our business while being appropriately cautious given the complex operating environment.\nTurning to a summary of our Q1 reported results. Q1 was the highest sales quarter at Sysco ever. We achieved 16.2% sales growth at Sysco for the quarter, with U.S. Foodservice growing at 17.2% and international growing at 13.4%. Reflecting our focus on serving our local and independent customers through both our Broadline and specialty businesses, we are expanding our disclosure of total and local case volumes to, in aggregate, include our FreshPoint U.S. produce, U.S. Italian and other specialty businesses in the metrics. For clarity, our specialty meats business is not yet in this metric as it measures volume in pounds.\nWith respect to volume, total U.S. food service volume increased 7.3% compared to last year. All in, our inclusive local case volumes grew by 5.4% in Q1 2023 over the prior year's comparable period in the U.S. You can see the history of this metric on Slide 18 compared to our year-end 2019 levels. We banked $3.5 billion in adjusted gross profit for the quarter, up 17.3% versus last year. Adjusted gross margin improved 17 basis points to 18.2% for the first quarter. GP per case grew in all 4 segments versus prior year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of such growth.\nOur gross profit and margin improvement reflected our ability to continue to manage product inflation, which was at 9.7% at the total enterprise level, consistent with our guidance as well as incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as we continue to partner with our suppliers.\nU.S. Broadline inflation was 12% in the quarter. Our inflation metric is in dollars, so the enterprise metric was reduced by the local currency declines against the dollar.\nOverall adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 14.2% of our sales, a 30 basis point increase as a percentage of sales over the same quarter in the prior year. Cost this quarter increased in workers' compensation, pension expense, health care and some operational elements like shrink, all of which are being addressed. We have more to do in this area but believe that our supply chain and North American teams has Sysco on the path to improving our operating expense profile.\nAdditionally, this quarter included progress against capturing cost out which represents incremental efforts on top of the more than $750 million of cumulative cost out. Recall that last quarter, we outlined expectations for operating costs to be more heavily weighted in the first half based on the need to work through operating cost inflation, operating productivity challenges and our planned investments in the business.\nConsistent with that, this quarter included transformation investments of $63 million and new associate related productivity costs of $41 million and an improvement in snapback costs, which are becoming immaterial. All 4 segments showed increases in profitability year-over-year with SYGMA returning to profitability from the prior year's modest loss in Q1.\nAdditionally, adjusted operating income in our International segment grew over the prior year also exceeding pre-COVID 2019 levels. Adjusted operating income for the enterprise increased by 12.4% versus last year to $770 million. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.5% to $917 million. We often refer to exceeding fiscal '19 adjusted EPS levels as part of our long-term guidance. It is worth noting that in the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased by 16.9% over prior year and for the first time since the onset of COVID exceeded adjusted EPS from the same quarter in fiscal '19 by $0.06.\nApplying a macro financial lens, I will point out 2 financial factors that had an impact on profitability this quarter different from recent years. First, the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar in our international operations. Second, an increase in pension expense tied to the rapid rise in interest rates. In total, those 2 externalities had a $0.03 negative impact on GAAP and adjusted EPS.\nOn the pension point, to be clear, our largely frozen pension plan remains fully funded and the above reflects the noncash impact of pension accounting that is a result of extreme movements in the global capital markets. You may have noticed an 8-K about a pension liability transfer exercise in October, subsequent to the end of our first quarter.\nThat transaction decreases Sysco's plan size, risk and overall administrative costs while protecting retirees as they will be in the hands of an A-rated insurance company. This transaction will result in a noncash charge in Q2 of $250 million to $300 million, which we expect to be a certain item. Other than the certain items, we expect the income statement impact of the transaction to be largely immaterial to our year.\nIn regards to the balance sheet, our strong investment-grade rated balance sheet remains a competitive advantage for us and we ended the quarter at 3.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We returned $258 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and paid our increased quarterly dividend, returned $517 million in total to shareholders this past quarter. Had we not executed the early share repurchase, our leverage ratio would have been 3x.\nGiven the focus on interest rates lately, I want to remind listeners that approximately 95% of Sysco's debt is fixed rate.\nLet's turn to cash. Recall that the first quarter is typically the quarter in which we have the lowest in-quarter cash flow generation. This year, for the first quarter, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $158.6 million, a $48 million improvement over the prior year. However, net CapEx almost doubled in Q1 of fiscal '23 to $145 million as we continue to invest in our Recipe For Growth, particularly with respect to our planned investments in fleet and distribution notes. As a result, free cash flow was $14 million for the quarter.\nWorking capital was a use of cash, though we are watching our inventory balances closely as part of our supply chain transformation and are monitoring our accounts receivable closely given the economic environment. We ended the quarter with approximately $438 million in cash on hand.\nLet's return to the look forward. As I said at the start of my remarks, we are upbeat about our business while remaining appropriately cautious given the operating environment. While we have work to do on our expense structure, as Kevin called out, Sysco has not yet seen any broad impact on our business from concerns around the risk of recession impacting consumer behavior. As a result, we are sticking with our full year guidance for fiscal year 2023 for adjusted EPS of $4.09 to $4.39.\nAs Kevin mentioned earlier, we are well positioned and prepared to operate through another dynamic year. We have a plan, and our team is executing against it with the benefit of all the learnings that our company and our industry have worked through in the last couple of years.\nLastly, I hope you noticed that we are reporting Q1 a week early. As part of our transformation efforts, we have worked to accelerate our financial close process, increasing the speed of finding data to faster decisions and looking forward, not back. We plan to report earnings faster than our historical cadence for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Aaron. As we conclude, I'd like to provide everyone with a brief summary on Slide 20. We plan to build on our position of strength in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Our key takeaways from today reflect 3 points. We advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy, and we are on target to grow more than 1.35x the market in a growing U.S. market.\nOur financial results this quarter reflected double-digit top and bottom line growth in the backdrop of a large industry that has proven resilient during very challenging macro conditions. Sysco is taking share profitably in a growing industry.\nLastly, Sysco remains deeply committed to our strong investment-grade credit rating, a strong and stable balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation. We are committed to our long-term financial outlook, and we have reiterated today our full year guidance for fiscal year '23. Just as we have done with COVID and the related disruptions over the past few years, we are prepared to navigate the potentially choppy macroeconomic waters in coming quarters.\nOur strong financial foundation gives Sysco the opportunity to continue to advance our strategy during potentially challenging environments. This reality will enable Sysco to win for the longer term as our capabilities improve and our initiatives progress. As always, I'd like to thank our 71,000 associates for their commitment to our purpose and for their dedication in serving our customers.\nOperator, you can now open the line for questions."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. We will begin with opening remarks and introductions.\nI would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kim, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin J. Kim\n\nVP of IR, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to Sysco's Third Quarter Fiscal '22 Earnings Call.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures is included at the end of the presentation slides and can be found in the Investors section of our website. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Our financial performance this quarter exceeded our internal expectations, driven by strong top line performance, accelerating market share gains, solid gross margin management and improvement in our operations expenses. Earlier today, we raised our full year guidance, and Aaron will walk you through the details in just a few moments.\nOur strong performance for the quarter demonstrates our focus on the customer and the advancement of our Recipe for Growth strategy. Simply put, we are winning in the marketplace. The best measure of this success is the continued market share gains that we are delivering. Our performance versus the market accelerated in the quarter, and we solidly exceeded our fiscal 2022 goal of growing 1.2x the market.\nI will highlight 3 topics during our call today: first, I will touch on our financial results; second, I'll discuss the state of the current operating environment; and finally, I will highlight progress from our Recipe for Growth transformation. I'll then turn it over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail. So let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide #4.\nOur third quarter results were fueled by strong top line performance across the U.S. and international segments and progress made in lowering operating expenses as a percentage of sales. As a result, our profit results were ahead of our internal expectations this quarter. While our operational expenses remain elevated versus our historical standards, we've begun making progress in improving our productivity. We will continue to make progress in the coming quarters.\nKey headlines this quarter include market share gains that significantly exceeded our 1.2x the market growth target, significant volume improvements with U.S. Broadline volume up approximately 19% versus the same period in fiscal year 2021 and our USFS business delivering volume growth versus 2019 in total. This also included another quarter of profitable growth coming from our international segment.\nOur expense structure is improving. As I mentioned, we still have work to do in order to return to our standard of excellence but we have begun making progress. Importantly, our snapback investments were reduced by more than 50% versus the prior quarter. Our strong sales results and continued progress in improving operating expenses drove solid profit growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 for the quarter. We achieved these results while meaningfully advancing our Recipe for Growth strategy. This included successfully closing on The Coastal Companies transaction during the quarter, further expanding our industry-leading produce business that is high growth at attractive margins.\nTopic 2 for today, an update on the current environment. The third quarter started with COVID-related disruptions from the Omicron variant. Recall that the negative impact from Omicron started in late November and the effects were felt through February. Sysco delivered a strong quarter of growth despite the headwind from Omicron. Two factors played to our favor: a strong market rebound in late February and into March and Sysco winning market share throughout the entire quarter. Combined, these factors enabled both our U.S. and international businesses to deliver volumes greater than our internal forecast for the period. As I mentioned a moment ago, volume in our U.S. Foodservice Operations exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels for the quarter. The positive momentum was strong across geographies as well as across different customer types. With that said, we expect additional momentum over time from improved international volume as the recovery in the food-away-from-home market strengthens internationally.\nAt Sysco, we have 2 business sectors that remain heavily impacted by COVID, business and industry, which includes customers such as office cafeterias and travel and hospitality, which is heavily impacted by conferences and large group catering events. We anticipate both segments making progress this summer and into the fall. For example, many major employers have begun returning to the office, and recent reports from airline and hotel CEOs have cited steadily improving bookings for this summer.\nAn advantage of Sysco is that we are fully diversified across the food-away-from-home business. While high cost of fuel is being felt by our customers, we have not experienced a reduction of consumer demand. The fact that we cover all restaurant types up and down the price point spectrum provides us some protection in an unpredictable economy. Additionally, the pricing relationship between food at home and food away from home is favorable to Sysco versus historical relationships, as you can see on Slide 6 in our presentation. With that said, we remain concerned about the long-term effect of elevated inflation, and we are taking strong actions to manage the situation.\nWe are actively working to improve cost of goods sold inbound to Sysco so that we can pass along value to our customers. We are aggressively pursuing Sysco brand penetration opportunities as we know that Sysco products save our customers' money. We are also working aggressively with our customers to help them with their menu design, and therefore, helping these customers find alternatives to step around highly inflationary items in subcategories. We are also helping them to have confidence in their menu pricing strategies. This work helps us go earn trust and respect with our large customer base.\nIn regards to our supply chain, I'd like to report that conditions are improving. Applicant flow to open positions has increased, and our talent acquisition team has helped us make progress in improving our staffing health. As a result, we have been able to reduce associate overtime and improve our service levels to our customers over the past quarter. Our NPS, or Net Promoter Score, results this quarter improved and continue to lead versus the market. It is still a very dynamic environment, but the size and scale advantages of Sysco are enabling us to succeed in a turbulent environment.\nTopic 3 for today, I'll provide select highlights of our Recipe for Growth progress. Last quarter, I provided an update on 2 of our growth initiatives: Sysco Your Way and our Italian cuisine platform. These 2 initiatives continue to progress well, driving profitable growth for the company. We expanded Sysco Your Way to additional neighborhoods in the quarter, and the recently added locations are performing consistent with the strong results from our pilot locations.\nToday, I'd like to provide an update on 2 additional topics: Our supply chain transformation and progress that we are making in consultative sales. As I mentioned, our supply chain health has improved over the past quarter as applicant flow to our open jobs has improved, and we're beginning to make progress in operations productivity. Improving the efficiency of our supply chain is a top priority for our entire leadership team.\nTo ensure that we succeed at a higher level in the future, we are making substantial commitments to improve our associate experience within operations. A great example is our Driver Academy, which is now up and running in full swing. We've graduated our first class of drivers, and we have opened additional academy locations. We expect to be nationwide with this capability by the end of the calendar year. The Driver Academy will enable us to provide upward career path mobility for our warehouse associates and improve associate retention in this critical driver role. Our graduates are able to increase their career earnings potential by upskilling and becoming certified drivers. At Sysco, we pay a leading and competitive driver wage, and we are making the certification process easier, removing the barriers and costs of becoming certified. This action will open the door for more of our associates to advance their careers. The Driver Academy is a win-win-win for our associates, for Sysco and for our customers.\nAdditionally, over the past quarter, we have converted our operations from an industry traditional 5-day workweek to a full 6-day delivery model. This might sound like a small endeavor, but the reality is quite the opposite. We made the change to a full 6-day model for the following reasons. The change is better for our associates. Why? We have converted our associates from a standard 5-day schedule to a more work-life-friendly 4-day workweek. This will improve associate retention over time. The 6-day workweek increases the efficiency of our operations by further utilizing our physical assets, enabling us to better sweat the assets of our trucks and buildings. The model increases our weekly throughput and also provides us more flex capacity on each and every day, enabling us to better handle fluctuations of demand. These changes to our supply chain will help make Sysco an even more preferred employer, and that will enable us to serve our customers.\nAs important as having an efficient and flexible supply chain, we are continuing to advance the capabilities of our industry-leading sales teams. Our sales associates have the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry, and we want to increase that competitive advantage. We have worked hard over the past year to bring stronger digital tools to the selling process to enable the success of our sales teams. I want to be very clear that these digital tools do not reduce the importance or quantity of our sales staff. These tools are intended to assist our sales teams with their consultative selling process.\nOur technology team has built a system that provides each sales rep with a next best action to be presented to our customers. For some customers, this may be a conversion from a national brand product to a Sysco brand item, saving them money. For other customers, this may be the introduction of a promotional offer for a category perhaps they've not traditionally purchased from Sysco, like produce. For others still, the tool can identify items that our customer used to buy but are no longer placing in their shopping basket with Sysco. Our sales consultants are then prompted with offers and suggestions through specifically enabled success against those use cases. The goal of this work is to increase the productivity of the customer visit. This work positively impacted our performance versus the market in Q3, which was our strongest volume growth quarter versus the market for the year. Slide 7 in our presentation makes a clear case of our progress in becoming a growth company.\nLastly, our working commitments in corporate social responsibility, or CSR, were recently recognized by Sustainalytics and JUST Capital. This recognition is due in no small part to our recent announcement of a science-based climate goal that is aligned with SBTi. As the leader in our industry, we are proud to be the first and only U.S. foodservice distributor with a science-based climate goal. Research from the World Economic Forum suggests that companies who make progress in these important areas drive improved CSR over time compared to their peers. To ensure that we walk the walk, our Board is prepared to incorporate ESG as a part of our executive compensation program beginning next year. The work we are doing is the right thing to do, and we strongly believe that it is also good for our business and our investors.\nTurning to Slide 8. In summary for the quarter, Sysco is winning, leading the industry and accelerating growth. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our supply chain is performing better than the industry at large, and we are driving strategic initiatives to further increase that strength advantage. Our continued transformation investments are enhancing our commercial selling capabilities, and we are investing in our associates. The improved profitability in the quarter is encouraging, but there is more work to be done as our team is focused on our Recipe for Growth strategy and improving operations productivity.\nI'll now turn it over to Aaron, who will provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning. We are upbeat on our business, and we have several notable headlines for our third quarter, as seen on Slide 10. Sales growth of almost 43% compared to the prior year, which is also up more than 15% versus 2019, reflecting resilient demand and sequential improvements month-over-month. We recorded more than $3 billion of gross profit, the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any quarter at Sysco ever as we continue significant efforts to optimize our assortment in COGS while effectively managing our product cost inflation.\nOur investments in snapback operating costs dropped in the quarter by more than half from $73 million in Q2 to $35 million in Q3. As promised, the impact of our workforce transition on productivity improved. Incremental training and overtime is estimated to have cost us approximately $30 million in the third quarter, down from approximately $40 million in the second quarter, and we expect further improvements as we head into Q4. As an aside, I would note that the actions we're taking around productivity are actually serving to accelerate our supply chain transformation as part of the Recipe for Growth.\nWe invested $48 million of operating expense against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities. All in, adjusted operating income more than doubled and adjusted EBITDA increased almost 73% compared to last year. With those headlines on the table, I'm going to provide some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook.\nThird quarter sales were $16.9 billion, an increase of 42.9% for fiscal 2021 and a 15.3% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, were up dramatically by 43.6% versus fiscal 2021 and up 18.8% versus fiscal 2019. Local case volume within the U.S. Broadline Operations, a subset of U.S. Foodservice, increased 14.1%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 18.8% compared to last year.\nSYGMA sales were up 13.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 16.8% versus fiscal 2019. International sales were up 64.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends accelerated nicely in our international segment with lower Omicron cases and as government-related restrictions on our customers eased in the quarter. Foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.7% on Sysco's sales results.\nLet me pause here and call out one point of progress for the year-to-date period. We are really pleased with the profit contribution and improvements coming from international. In the last 9 months, the business has delivered an adjusted operating income swing of $265 million year-over-year.\nInflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 16% in our U.S. Broadline business. We have been able to actively manage the impact of product inflation and those efforts will continue. Gross profit for the enterprise was above $3 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 42% versus fiscal 2021, an increase of 9.4% versus fiscal 2019. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019 increases in GP dollars per case across all segments as we successfully managed to increase costs from our product suppliers and acted to optimize our business processes and performance. Of note, the enterprise and U.S. Foodservice both reached all-time highs for Q3 gross profit dollars.\nGross margin rate was 17.8% or 18% on an adjusted basis during the quarter with the adjusted margin rate moving upward as the math was still impacted by inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that counts in an inflationary environment, and gross profit per case increased in all 4 segments. We are focused on price relevancy, being right on price and are doing the right things to cover our costs while also supporting our customers.\nTurning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense for the quarter came in at $2.5 billion as we delivered progress on our multiyear cost-out program and improved snapback costs. As we touched on earlier and as you can see on Slide 15, operating costs this quarter were impacted by variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes, more than $35 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, $48 million of purposeful investments to further accelerate our Recipe for Growth initiatives, and lastly, the still present but improving expense challenges associated with new hire productivity. Despite the dynamic operating environment, we expect additional improvements for snapback costs and productivity expenses during the fourth quarter as we balance cost reduction initiatives with continued transformation investments.\nTogether, the snapback investments and the productivity-related costs totaled approximately $65 million of operating expenses this quarter. That's important because the simple math would say that these transitory expenses had a downward impact to our adjusted EPS of approximately $0.10, further proving our point that there is further opportunity for profit improvement in the future for Sysco as Q3 adjusted EPS without these expenses would have already exceeded 2019 levels. All in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.6%, which was flat through fiscal 2019 and an improvement of 119 basis points for the same quarter in fiscal 2021.\nFinally, for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $319 million from last year to $575 million. This was primarily driven by a 43% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and continued progress on profitability from international. As Kevin called out, adjusted earnings per share increased an impressive $0.49 to $0.71 for the third quarter.\nNow let's turn to a discussion of year-to-date cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $746 million on a year-to-date basis. Our company continues to transition from a period when sales, profit and working capital were all down during COVID to a period of high growth, growing profit and a focus on making the investments necessary to win the long game. A year ago at this time, we commented that we had a strategy and the balance sheet to invest in the business and support our Recipe for Growth, and that is exactly what we are doing.\nFree cash flow year-to-date was $434 million. EBITDA as the primary source of cash is up $900 million year-over-year in the year-to-date period as our sales increased, but we've not yet quite recovered to fiscal '19 levels. The rising sales and profitability were enabled by tactical investments and higher inventory levels this year, both in absolute cases on hand as we lap the purposeful inventory declines from the management of the COVID period and in dollar value, given inflation. And with our rapidly growing sales comes a higher balance in healthy accounts receivable, also a use of cash year-to-date, which our team continues to manage well, offset, in part, by higher accounts payable.\nIn the year-to-date, we have also paid higher interest expense from COVID debt and refinancings; paid higher cash taxes, partly due to prior year refunds and deferrals; and invested more in CapEx in support of the Recipe for Growth. This year is effectively a transition year from a free cash flow perspective, and we expect that future years will continue to reinforce the significant cash flow generated by Sysco as sales and profit grow and investments in working capital normalize.\nLet me emphasize, we are playing to win the long game and are leveraging our balance sheet and cash flow in support of the long-term growth of Sysco. Along those same lines, recall that we began the year with high cash balances, and we end the quarter with almost $900 million of cash on hand. Year-to-date, we've used that cash to invest in the business, spending $312 million on CapEx and paid for acquisitions such as Coastal with cash on hand.\nOur balance sheet is a key differentiator compared to our competition, and we are prepared -- we are better prepared than anyone else in the industry entering a rising interest rate environment. Why? Because we have strong cash generation, a strong investment-grade rating and a manageable debt profile, including some of the lowest rates ever achieved by Sysco in a 30-year tenure issued in December. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade rating and achieving a net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio of 2.5x to 2.75x.\nAs previously announced, we expect to further reduce indebtedness by paying off the $450 million of debt coming due in June. And reflecting the world in which we all live, we also now have further liquidity and risk protection if we need it. Last week, Sysco announced that we successfully increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion with improved terms.\nReturn of capital to shareholders is also part of our capital allocation framework. In May of 2021, our Board approved a 4% increase to our quarterly dividend, reflecting an $0.08 increase annually. And 2 weeks ago, Sysco's Board did it again, effectively announcing another $0.08 annual increase, reinforcing our status as a dividend aristocrat. What we want you to take away from this is that we are serious about all 3 parts of our capital allocation strategy: we are investing in the future growth of the business, we are maintaining a strong balance sheet, and we are returning surplus capital to shareholders.\nOn this last point, our track record goes back decades. But as you can see on Slide 18, over the last 7 years, cumulatively, we've returned over $13 billion of cash to shareholders. We will remain disciplined with our balanced approach to capital allocation and rewarding our shareholders.\nNow before I turn to our positive update to guidance, I should address one set of questions we've been getting upfront. The impact of the invasion of Ukraine on our business. As a reminder, Europe represents only about 10% of our net sales. Our European portfolio is geographically distant from Ukraine and focused on Ireland, the U.K., France and Sweden. In the past, our exposure to Russian products was minimal. With respect to product inflation in Europe, while we are seeing costs rise more consistently with what we've seen in the U.S. in the last couple of quarters, we were prepared and have many of the same tools we developed in the U.S. to address the impact of product cost increases in Europe. Oil and the impact of rising gas prices have also been topics of interest. We benefit from having hedged 80% of our forecasted bulk fuel volume through fiscal 2023 in the U.S. and Europe.\nLet's now turn to look forward. We are upbeat about our business. We have witnessed the resiliency of our business as it has responded to the impact of 3 significant COVID-19 variants, significant inflation, the invasion of Ukraine, and now, rising interest rates. We have made great progress in Q3, and we anticipate further progress in Q4, which is why we are upbeat about our business. We are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS in the second half by $0.16 to be from $1.76 to $1.86. Having delivered $0.71 of adjusted EPS in Q3, this means that we expect Q4 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15. On a full year basis, this will equate to adjusted EPS of $3.16 to $3.26.\nDuring our last earnings call, we highlighted that we expected a big Q4, and that's not changed with the results of our resilient Q3 results. Our continued optimism for Q4 includes a continued market recovery, continued market share gains, continued pass-through of inflation costs, improved operating expenses as a percentage of sales from lower snapback and productivity-related costs, all is partially offset by continued investments in our transformation and working through the workforce transition. Lastly, recall that Q4 of last year included 1 extra week, which will impact the profitability.\nWith that, let me turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Aaron. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary on Slide 20. Sysco already is the industry leader from an EBITDA margin perspective. You've heard me say this before, but we are now taking that robust foundation as the market leader in creating a growth company. Our financial performance this quarter reflects 3 key points: first, our volume grew 18.8% in U.S. Broadline compared to last year, and we significantly exceeded our market share target; second, we improved operations expenses, reducing snapback costs by more than 50% while continuing our transformation efforts; and third, we generated strong profit performance despite a dynamic operating environment.\nTurning to Slide 21. These recent results are also consistent with our long-term plans. We are generating substantial top line momentum and accelerating market share gains. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term and further build on our competitive scale advantages. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment while also rewarding our long-term shareholders with disciplined dividend growth and share repurchases. Lastly, we are committed to both our long-term financial outlook, which includes significant sales and EPS growth and returning value to shareholders along the way.\nThere are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey. As always, I'd like to thank all of our Sysco associates for the dedication they display to our customers each and every day.\nOperator, you can now turn over the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. I will highlight 4 topics today during our call. First, our financial results for the quarter. Second, I will provide some color on the current state of our business and the COVID environment. Third, I will detail our continued share gains despite a difficult macro environment. And finally, I will outline our approach to the long game with some highlights of our recipe for growth transformation. I'll then turn it over to Aaron to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nSo let's get started with our financial results displayed on Slide 4. Earlier this morning, Sysco reported fiscal second quarter results that were fueled by substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of market share gains. Our sales and volume performance success is a testament to our supply chain strength in the advancement of our Recipe for Growth.\nOur operating expenses for the period were elevated due to the effects of COVID on our business. And as a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations this quarter. Key headlines for the quarter include strong sales results and market share gains. We delivered growth of more than 1.2x the market, which exceeded our expectations for the period. We delivered sales growth of 10.5% versus 2019 and sequential volume improvements throughout the quarter until the Omicron variant impacted our December performance. More on Omicron in a moment.\nAs I mentioned, operational expenses within our supply chain were above expectations due to the challenges that COVID is presenting to our labor environment and our transportation costs. I will detail this complex operating environment in a moment. But we remain confident these incremental expenses driven by labor costs are near-term challenges that will improve over time.\nOur strong sales results and elevated operating expenses resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 for the quarter. We further advanced our Recipe for Growth strategy, which we believe will uniquely position Sysco to win in the marketplace for the long term. Sysco's strength of income statement and balance sheet have enabled us to continue advancing our strategy during a difficult operating environment. That strategic and economic reality will enable Sysco to outperform the market for quarters and years to come.\nTopic 2 for today, an update on the state of the business. As I mentioned a moment ago, COVID continues to negatively impact supply chains across the globe and the effect was elevated in Q2 relative to our first quarter. The impact is being felt in product availability shortages from our suppliers and higher-than-anticipated labor and transportation costs. I would like to further explain some of the labor cost pressures that we are addressing.\nAt Sysco, we have hired thousands of new associates over the past quarter to support the recovery of our industry, which is coming faster and stronger than had been anticipated. We are also winning market share across our business sectors, which adds to our hiring needs. As a result of our hiring and an industry-wide higher rate of associate turnover, we have a higher ratio of new associates in our labor population than we had originally planned. A higher population of less experienced associates has a direct negative impact on our supply chain productivity. The punchline is that our tenured associates perform at a much higher rate of productivity than new associates. With that said, we are confident that we can and will move our newer associates up the productivity curve over time.\nWe have also incurred higher-than-planned expenses as COVID-related illnesses accelerated in the quarter and have come into January. To provide a sense of the magnitude of this disruption, nearly 10% of our U.S. workforce tested positive for COVID during the month of January and were out for a minimum of several days. To cover these absences, we invested in overtime and supplemental third-party resources to ensure that we properly supported our customers. At Sysco, we cannot let our health care, education, hospitality and important restaurant partners go without food because of these labor challenges caused by COVID.\nOur customer-centric approach to ensure that we can ship on time and in full will benefit our relationship with our customers for the long term, positively impacting retention and growth. We are confident that our service performance is stronger than the industry as measured by our Net Promoter Score. In fact, our NPS performance versus the market expanded in the quarter.\nLastly, as I mentioned, Omicron negatively impacted our top line performance, starting the weekend after Thanksgiving. Our business in Europe was impacted first with the reintroduction of major restrictions on our customers. Our sales and volume performances in December were impacted by those restrictions, most notably in the U.K., France and Canada. For example, restaurants in the majority of Canada began closing for on-premise dining at the end of the second quarter, with restrictions slowly starting to ease in February. These types of restrictions impact our customers' performance and ordering patterns. As a result, we expect the top line impact from Omicron to continue into the third quarter. The speed of the return to pre-Omicron levels is uncertain, but we are seeing signs of progress in Europe as restrictions have begun easing. I would like to highlight again that Sysco's sequentially improved sales and volume performance every month compared to 2019 levels until the impact of Omicron began being felt Thanksgiving weekend, and we are confident that we will get back to that growth pattern as Omicron receives.\nTopic 3, let's turn to our market share performance highlighted on Slide 5. Despite the challenges presented by Omicron at the end of the quarter, as you can see on Slide 5, Sysco delivered exceptional growth versus the market in the second quarter. As a result, we are now confident we will exceed our 1.2x the market growth target for the full fiscal year. Our performance versus the market expanded this quarter. Furthermore, looking back over the last 3 quarters, we are beginning to pull ahead of the industry.\nThe next slide from NPD shows how over the last 2 years, we have consistently increased the percentage of customers that purchased exclusively from Sysco. This compares to the dotted line that shows the percentage of customers not yet buying from Sysco. You can see that the dotted line is steadily declining. These slides are just 2 more proof points that our team is winning in the marketplace and that our strategy is working.\nLastly, Topic 4, I will highlight examples in our business transformation and how that progress will enable consistent profitable growth. Today, I will give an update on 2 of our growth initiatives. Sysco Your Way and our Italian cuisine program. As a reminder, Sysco Your Way is a new service model that we are piloting to better serve what we call restaurant dense neighborhoods. Through this program, we are providing our customers with enhanced levels of service and sales support. We are very pleased with the success of the pilot locations, and we will be expanding the program to net new neighborhoods in the spring of 2022.\nIn addition to Sysco Your Way, I would like to provide an update on our Italian cuisine platform work. As a reminder, Italian is one of the largest squeezing segments and Sysco historically underpenetrated with this important customer segment. We did not have an optimal assortment, and we lap the go-to-market selling strategy to win. Our Greco acquisition has changed that capability in a meaningful way. First off, Greco is off to a great start and is exceeding our Year 1 top and bottom line expectations. We are really pleased with the Greco business and the great work that they are doing. As importantly, we are leveraging the Greco product assortment and selling prowess and bringing the best-selling items to Sysco houses across the country. More on that in due course. Winning in the specialty sectors like Italian is a priority for our Recipe for Growth strategy.\nTurning to Slide 7. In summary, for the quarter, we are winning as a company in the marketplace. We are growing our business with new and existing customers. Our year-to-date growth is exceeding our 1.2x the industry target for the year and is being driven by our supply chain strength and our Recipe for Growth strategy. We also returned over $650 million of cash to our shareholders during the quarter. We are confident that the impact of our initiatives will grow over time, enabling us to consistently outperform the market at large.\nAs I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to thank all of our associates at Sysco. These past 2 years have been challenging. We continue to lead the industry from a service perspective and make deliveries to our customers regardless of the COVID conditions. I am proud of our sales, operations and global support center teams for their persistence and customer focus that they have displayed. I really want to thank them for their tenacity and I'll use another word, endurance. I am honored to serve these associates and work by their side.\nI would also like to welcome the recently appointed members of our Board of Directors: Ali Dibadj, Jill Golder and Alison Kenney Paul. Together, they bring deep industry experience a modern skills inventory, including finance, consumer and digital and strategy capabilities. Our 3 new Board members will be extremely valuable to Sysco in our transformation for years to come.\nI'll now turn it over to Aaron who will provide additional financial details before we open it up for questions.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning. Here are our second quarter fiscal 2022 financial headlines, as seen on Slide 9. Sales growth of 41.2% compared to last year, also up 10.5% versus fiscal 2019, leading to our highest Q2 sales ever. Good management of our product cost inflation, recording the highest gross profit in absolute dollar terms for any Q2 at Sysco. A doubling of adjusted operating income and a 62.9% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year, notwithstanding a cost environment, which worsened during the quarter. Continued investment against our long-term recipe for growth with $44 million of operating expense investments against our strategic investments, creating momentum with our commercial capabilities.\nProactive action on the COVID generated labor and safety environments in which we are operating, with $73 million in transitory snapback operating investments such as recruiting costs, hiring marketing, vaccination promotion, contract labor and sign-on and retention bonuses in the quarter. And while the magnitude was greater than we could foresee last quarter, we experienced productivity challenges and much higher overtime costs in the quarter, resulting from the pandemic-related workforce transition and our prioritization of customer service.\nWith respect to our capital allocation, we refinanced elements of our long-term debt during the quarter, and we returned $657 million of cash to shareholders. With those headlines on the table, let's turn to some details on the financials for the quarter and some thoughts on our outlook.\nSecond quarter sales were $16.3 billion, an increase of 41.2% from fiscal 2021, and a 10.5% increase from fiscal 2019. In the United States, sales in our largest segment, U.S. Foodservice, showed excellent progress, up 45.1% versus fiscal 2021 and up 14% versus fiscal 2019, reflecting the pre-Thanksgiving and pre-Omicron resurgence in volumes and sales. Local case volume within the subset of USFS, our U.S. Broadline operations, increased 17.6%, while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations increased 22.5%. SYGMA sales were up 16.5% versus fiscal 2021 and up 15.3% and versus fiscal 2019, even with the large customer rationalization we disclosed earlier, which we expect will be complete on a comparable basis following Q3.\nInternational sales were up 43% versus fiscal 2021 and down approximately 3% versus fiscal 2019. Sales trends were accelerating nicely in our International segment before the onset of Omicron and restrictions in our key international markets such as the U.K. and we are watching post lockdown trends carefully. Foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 0.3% on Sysco's sales results. We continue to monitor the impact on our customers and on our business as international restrictions are starting to ease, including in Ireland and the U.K... Inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 14.6% in our U.S. Broadline business.\nGross profit for the enterprise was approximately $3 billion in the second quarter, increasing 37.8% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 4%. The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal '21 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in gross profit dollars per case across all 4 of our reporting segments as we successfully managed increased costs for our product suppliers while addressing some, but not all, of our increased operating costs. Gross margin rate was 17.7% during the quarter with the margin rate math impacted by product inflation. Of course, it is gross profit dollars that count in an inflationary environment.\nTurning back to the enterprise. Adjusted operating expense came in at $2.4 billion with a combination of planned and unexpected expense increases from the prior year, really driven by 4 things. First, the increased variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes. Second, as you can see on Slide 10, more than $73 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, which we expect to decline in the third quarter. While we have increased wages in select locations, those increases are not material and have the opportunity to be offset by productivity and cost-out improvements going forward. Third, $44 million of purposeful operating expense investments against our Recipe for Growth initiatives, like personalization, digital sales tools and assortment capabilities, which remain on track to be elevated for the rest of the year. And fourth, the productivity expense challenges Kevin referenced earlier, including ramp-up time associated with new higher productivity in our warehouses and trucks elevated overtime and third-party labor support in the face of staff absences.\nI want to emphasize that the management team at Sysco has been aggressive in pursuing the cause of the cost increases. While the transformation continues unabated, the team has also pushed hard to identify in action incremental profit opportunities and cost reduction initiatives, which should help the company in the back half and beyond as the environment stabilizes. Together the snapback investments in the transformation costs totaled approximately $116 million of operating expenses this quarter, and negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17.\nAll in, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure and delivered expense as a percentage of sales of 14.7%, which is flat from fiscal 2019 and down 145 basis points from fiscal 2021. Our cost-out efforts are meaningfully benefiting our P&L, and we continue to assess and execute against new cost-out projects each quarter.\nFinally, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted operating income increased $262 million from last year to $496 million. This was primarily driven by a 45% improvement in U.S. Foodservice and continued progress on profitability from International, partially offset by SYGMA. The second quarter SYGMA operating loss was driven by higher-than-expected labor costs, which will be offset in future quarters by specific actions already taken by the SYGMA management team. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.40 to $0.57 for the second quarter compared to last year.\nNow let me share a couple of comments on cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $377 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by our higher income and lower interest, offset by higher tax payments and a significant investment in working capital. Net CapEx was $175.9 million, somewhat lower than expected given increased lead times on fleet and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $201 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.\nAs seen on Slide 15, our results this quarter also reflected incremental progress against our capital allocation priorities. This included the further strengthening of our balance sheet by successfully refinancing debt during the quarter at longer maturities and more attractive rates, lowering our adjusted interest expense costs going forward. We also commenced our share repurchase program during the second quarter and repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares for a total of $416 million at an average share price of $72.30. This was in addition to paying our quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share in October. We remain committed to growing our dividend and as previously communicated, planned to next address decisions around our dividend per share during our fiscal Q4.\nWhile our track record goes back decades, as you can see on Slide 16, over the last 7 years, cumulatively, we have returned over $12 billion of cash to shareholders.\nLet's turn now to the look forward. Our Recipe for Growth transformation plan is on track. However, Omicron had a noticeable impact on our December and Q2 results continuing into January and now February. As a result, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that for fiscal 2024, Sysco will deliver adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 EPS of $3.55. We are updating our view of the back half to reflect the realities of the disruption caused by Omicron and the labor environment. We expect to fall below our prior EPS guidance for fiscal year 2022. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS of approximately $3 to $3.10. This translates to adjusted EPS in the back half of about $1.60 to $1.70.\nIn a typical pre-COVID fiscal year, adjusted EPS for our second half is generally weighted around 40% to Q3 and 60% in Q4 due to normal seasonality of our business. This year, we expect our second half profitability to be weighted even more to the fourth quarter. We expect a stronger Q4 this year relative to Q3 as a result of anticipated volume recovery, lower snapback expenses, improved operating productivity and specific actions we are taking to offset Omicron. In offering this perspective, we are assuming no further COVID variant disruptions to our operating environment.\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.\n\nKevin P. Hourican\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Sysco Corporation\n\nThank you, Aaron. As we conclude, I'd like to provide a brief summary. First, this quarter included substantial top line momentum and an acceleration of our market share gains. We are winning in the marketplace, and we have confidence that we will continue to win share. With that said, Q2 presented challenges from Omicron on both our top and bottom line. Our sequential volume growth progress stalled post-Thanksgiving and that headwind has continued into January. More importantly, COVID-related staffing disruptions increased our operating expenses for the quarter. As a result, our bottom line results were below our expectations.\nSecond, despite the short-term impact of Omicron on our business, we are confident that we will resume our volume improvement as soon as the variant recedes. And we can see green shoots of progress in February from a volume perspective. As it relates to expenses, we have a management plan to improve our year-to-go operating expenses. We are meaningfully focused on improving associate retention, training and productivity. These activities are a core competency of Sysco and our experienced field leadership team has a plan to deliver improvement for the remainder of the year.\nThird, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory at Sysco. And as Aaron stated, we are reaffirming our long-term guidance that includes significant sales and EPS growth. Our Recipe for Growth transformation is creating capabilities at Sysco that will help us profitably grow for the long term. The customer-first solutions we are developing will enable us to grow our share profitably and also enable Sysco to be more efficient. There are bright days ahead for Sysco, and I am proud to be part of the journey.\nOperator, you can now turn it over for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our third quarter 2025 earnings call. With me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call is Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer. And we welcome Cristian Massacesi, our recently appointed Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development.\nEarlier this morning, we posted our quarterly slide presentation to bms.com that you can use to follow along with Chris and David's remarks.\nBefore we get started, I'll remind everybody that during this call, we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date, and we specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.\nWe'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made from the same period in 2024, and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. All references to our P&L are on a non-GAAP basis.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChristopher S. Boerner\n\nExecutive Vice President-Commercial, Seattle Genetics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. Welcome, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Q3 was another strong quarter, reflecting focused execution across the business as we continue to make progress on our plan to position Bristol-Myers Squibb for long-term sustainable growth. Building on the momentum from the first half of the year, we saw continued strong demand across our Growth Portfolio, achieved positive clinical and regulatory milestones and further aligned our cost structure with the needs of our business.\nLet me start with a high-level review of our quarterly performance on Slide 4. Our growth portfolio delivered another strong quarter with sales increasing 17% year-over-year, strengthening the foundation we're building with assets that are early in their life cycle. Growth was driven by multiple products including our IO portfolio, Reblozyl, Camzyos and Breyanzi. And due to our strong performance to date, we are again raising our top line guidance and maintaining the midpoint of our bottom line guidance. David will provide more detail shortly.\nOur two recent launches performed well in Q3. Cobenfy is delivering steady growth as we continue to receive positive feedback from physicians on key indicators, supporting our expectation that this is a meaningful first indication for Cobenfy. Qvantig's launch is also tracking well.\nFrom a clinical and regulatory standpoint, I want to highlight a few recent updates. On the clinical data side, in our protein degradation platform, the Phase III EXCALIBER study for iberdomide in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in MRD negativity rates. Now that we have these results in hand, we will be discussing these compelling data and potential paths forward with health authorities. The trial will continue to evaluate PFS, which is expected in 2026.\nCELMoD have the promise to be a new foundation in the treatment of hematological malignancies. More broadly, our multipronged protein degradation platform has the opportunity to also address solid tumors, initially with our oral androgen receptor ligand-directed degrader, among others.\nAt the World One conference last month, we presented Phase II data for pumitamig with our partners at BioNTech. The clinical development program is both advancing and broadening for this important asset. Last month, we initiated the pivotal triple-negative breast cancer study and plan to share early data at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. Additionally, pivotal studies for pumitamig and chemotherapy combinations are now initiating in first-line microsatellite stable colorectal cancer and first-line gastric cancer.\nThis week, we announced encouraging data at the American College of Rheumatology Convergence Conference, which continue to strengthen our conviction behind CD19 NEX-T in autoimmune diseases and Sotyktu in rheumatology. We presented additional follow-up data for CD19 NEX-T in both lupus and scleroderma, have presented the first disclosure of data in myositis. For Sotyktu, the long-term extension data from the Phase II PAISLEY study continues to validate its potential in lupus as we look forward to Phase III results.\nOn the regulatory side, we achieved several milestones, which include our potential first-in-class bispecific ADC iza-bren receiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation for previously treated advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. And earlier this month, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to our anti-tau antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease currently in a Phase II study with data expected to read out in 2027.\nTogether, these milestones highlight the potential of our pipeline to both enhance and sustain growth in the outer years by addressing critical areas of unmet need and the importance of advancing these programs quickly and efficiently.\nOn the business development front, we recently announced we are acquiring Orbital Therapeutics to strengthen our cell therapy franchise where we have industry-leading expertise. This acquisition will add a potential off-the-shelf best-in-class asset, OTX-201, which can be administered in the community setting. This in vivo CAR T represents a novel treatment approach that could redefine how we treat autoimmune diseases. We will also gain access to Orbital's differentiated RNA technology platform, which combines various RNA engineering and advanced delivery methods.\nIn addition, we saw progress with our partner, SystImmune, as we announced that the first patient was treated in the global Phase II/III trial of iza-bren in previously untreated triple-negative breast cancer ineligible for anti-PD-L1 drugs. In August, we closed the previously announced licensing agreement with Philochem for exclusive worldwide rights to OncoACP3, potential best-in-class radiopharmaceutical therapeutic and diagnostic agent with the opportunity to become a breakthrough treatment for prostate cancer.\nWe continue to be excited about the overall opportunity with radiopharmaceuticals and believe Philochem added to Rayze, offer a transformational platform for cancer treatment.\nIn terms of progress, we opened a U.S. manufacturing hub with the ability to deliver Rayze's next-generation radiopharmaceutical therapies directly to patients within just 3 days of production, a critical advantage due to the short shelf life of RPTs. The facility is currently manufacturing clinical doses of Rayze 101, which is in Phase III clinical trials for GEP-NETs.\nMoving on to key data catalysts on Slide 5. As we've said before, we are entering a data-rich period. We continue to anticipate data readout for ADEPT-2 by the end of this year and have two additional Cobenfy studies in Alzheimer's disease psychosis, both of which are expected to read out next year. We anticipate needing 2 of these 3 studies to read out positively to support regulatory approval.\nThe pace of pivotal readouts will accelerate in 2026. As a reminder, over the next 12 to 24 months alone, we expect data for 7 new molecular entities and 7 meaningful life cycle management opportunities. Among others, we will see data for admilparant and IPF, a fatal lung disease with high unmet need; CELMoD, iberdomide and mezigdomide, which represent a significant step forward in the treatment of multiple myeloma; the broad milvexian program, where we are running 3 large Phase III trials to address ongoing unmet needs for patients with cardiovascular disease, including an AFIB trial that could potentially open treatment to at least the 40% of AFIB patients not suitable for Factor Xas today; Cobenfy and a broad range of Alzheimer's related neuropsychiatric conditions; and Sotyktu in lupus and Sjögren's.\nTogether, these represent an attractive set of near-term catalysts that can further shape our pipeline and longer-term growth trajectory given the significant commercial potential of the indications. And looking out a bit further, by the end of this decade, we have the potential to introduce 10 new medicines to the market and at least 30 significant life cycle management opportunities. This strategy is designed to set BMS on a clear path of strong and sustainable growth, which remains our guiding principle.\nBeyond the specific commercial and R&D highlights, the company continues to focus on strong financial discipline. Consistent with prior quarters, while we generated significant cash flow in the third quarter, we also continue to be prudent in managing our expenses as we align our cost structure with the projected shape of our business. In addition, we progressed our efforts in the quarter to rewire how we operate, including continuing to integrate digital technology and AI across the company. We anticipate these efforts will drive additional efficiencies going forward and significantly enhance the agility of the organization.\nSo what does this mean? Between our Growth Portfolio performance, the business development activity I just referenced, including the BioNTech partnership and combined with our broad pipeline and strong financial discipline, we feel even better about our longer-term growth potential. I want to take a moment and thank my colleagues around the globe who are committed to our mission to discover, develop and deliver innovative and life-changing medicines to patients.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of execution. The Growth Portfolio continues to perform well and we continue to maintain cost discipline.\nNow turning to the third quarter sales performance on Slide 7. Total company sales were approximately $12.2 billion, which reflects strong demand across our business. Global sales of the Growth Portfolio increased 17%, driven primarily by demand across multiple brands, notably our I/O portfolio: Reblozyl, Camzyos and Breyanzi.\nBeginning with a review of the oncology portfolio on Slide 8. Opdivo global sales were approximately $2.5 billion, up 6%, driven primarily by continued demand. In the U.S., sales grew 6% to roughly $1.5 billion, largely driven by a strong launch in MSI high colorectal cancer and continued share growth in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. This growth was achieved even as we saw expanded uptake of.\nOutside the U.S., sales grew 6%, driven by demand with expanded indications across multiple markets. We are pleased with the expanded growth of Qvantig with sales of $67 million in the quarter. Growth was fueled by continued use Qvantig across all indicated tumor types as well as the permanent J code received in the quarter. Due to the strong performance year-to-date, we now expect global Opdivo sales together with Qvantig to deliver stronger growth than previously guided, with sales expected to increase in the high single-digit to low double-digit range for the full year.\nTurning to our hematology performance on Slide 9. Reblozyl's global sales were $615 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength across our MDS-associated anemia indications. We're annualizing over $2 billion in sales for the brand. In the U.S., revenue growth continues to be strong, up 38%, primarily due to demand in first-line RS-positive and RS-negative setting as well as improved duration of therapy. Outside the U.S., Reblozyl sales grew 31%, driven by demand in newly launched markets.\nMoving to Breyanzi. Sales were $359 million in the quarter and now annualizing over $1 billion. Global sales grew 58%, reflecting strong demand across all indications. In U.S., sales were $251 million, growing 45%, reflecting growth in large B-cell lymphoma and expansion from new indications approved last year. Outside the U.S., sales were $109 million, more than doubling due to continued strong demand across existing markets along with added demand from newly launched markets.\nTransitioning to our cardiovascular performance on Slide 10, starting with Camzyos. Global sales increased 88% to $296 million, reflecting continued robust demand. This is another asset in our growth portfolio also now annualizing over $1 billion. In the U.S., sales were $238 million, up 76% driven primarily by increasing new patient starts. Outside the U.S., sales growth more than doubled driven by continued launch momentum in multiple markets. Eliquis global sales were $3.7 billion, growing 23%, primarily driven by continued strong demand and the expected favorable impact of Medicare Part D redesign, U.S. sales grew 29% and ex U.S. sales grew 11%.\nMoving to immunology performance on Slide 11. Sotyktu sales grew 20% globally. In the U.S., sales remained consistent with prior year due to demand being offset by higher rebates associated with our increased commercial access.\nNow turning to discuss Cobenfy on Slide 12. Cobenfy sales were $43 million in the quarter and $105 million year-to-date. As previously communicated, sales and weekly total prescriptions continue to grow steadily. We remain focused on disrupting the entrenched D2 prescribing behavior by educating physicians on Cobenfy's innovative profile and we've completed our field force expansion to increase reach and frequency to targeted health care professionals.\nNow let's move to the P&L on Slide 13. Gross margin was approximately 73%, primarily due to product mix. As expected, operating expenses decreased by approximately $100 million to roughly $4.2 billion compared to the same period last year, primarily reflecting the savings from our ongoing strategic productivity initiative. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.3%, reflecting our earnings mix. Overall, diluted earnings per share was $1.63 due to strong performance in the quarter and includes net charges of approximately $530 million or $0.20 per share attributed to acquired in-process R&D and licensing income primarily related to the Philochem asset license and SystImmune milestone payment.\nTurning to the balance sheet and capital allocation highlights on Slide 14. Our financial position remains strong. We generated cash flow from operations of about $6.3 billion in the third quarter with nearly $17 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to take a strategic and balanced approach.\nAs Chris mentioned, in recent months, we closed our license agreement with Philochem, announced the acquisition of Orbital Therapeutics and advanced our SystImmune in partnership. Strategically investing in our growth portfolio brands along with business development are our top priorities. We also continue to be on track to further delever our balance sheet. As of the end of the third quarter, we have paid $6.7 billion of the $10 billion debt paydown we've committed to by the first half of 2026. And we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through the dividend.\nNow turning to our non-GAAP guidance on Slide 15. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $750 million at the midpoint to a range of $47.5 billion to $48 billion, primarily reflecting continued strong performance of our Growth Portfolio. We continue to expect the Legacy Portfolio to decline approximately 15% to 17% for the year, and our Revlimid sales expectation remain at approximately $3 billion, along with the continued impacts from generics of Pomalyst in Europe, Sprycel and Abraxane.\nOur gross margin guidance for the year remains unchanged at approximately 72%, and our operating expense guidance also remains unchanged at approximately $16.5 billion, reflecting over $1 billion in net savings versus 2024. Regarding OI&E, we now expect annual income of approximately $500 million due to higher-than-anticipated royalties, ,licensing income and favorable interest income. We are maintaining our full year tax guidance of approximately 18%.\nAs a result of our strong performance year-to-date, the midpoint of our revised 2025 non-GAAP guidance would have increased by approximately $0.20 per share. This increase was offset by the net impact of acquired in-process R&D charges and licensing income, primarily related to Philochem asset license and a SystImmune milestone payment. As a result, we are narrowing our expected EPS range for 2025 to be between $6.40 and $6.60, which leaves the midpoint of our range unchanged.\nTaken all together, I'm pleased with the performance of the business year-to-date, and I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for their continued focus and execution.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Chuck to start Q&A.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, David. And before we start our Q&A session, I want to note that questions related to our solid tumor development programs will be answered by Adam rather than Cristian during today's call.\nAnd with that, Betsy, could you please poll for questions?",

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our second quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer.

Boerner\n\nExecutive Vice President-Commercial, Seattle Genetics, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chuck. Welcome, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. In Q2, we continue to make good progress reshaping the company for long-term sustainable growth. I'm pleased with our performance and our financial results speak to that. Building on the momentum from the first quarter, we saw strong demand across our growth portfolio and continue to optimize our cost structure to match the needs of our business.\nLet's double-click on our quarterly performance on Slide 4. Our growth portfolio delivered another strong quarter with sales increasing 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by demand across all key brands. David will provide more color on our portfolio's performance in his remarks. In addition to strong performance in our growth portfolio, we continue to make regulatory progress across the globe. In Europe, we secured approval for both Opdivo and neoadjuvant lung cancer and for Qvantig across multiple solid tumor indications. Additionally, in the U.S., we appreciate recent actions by the FDA that have resulted in streamlined patient monitoring requirements and the removal of REMS programs for all cell therapies. This is expected to enable more patients to benefit from these transformative therapies over time.\nWith respect to capital deployment, we announced strategic partnerships with BioNTech to expand and extend our immuno-oncology leadership as well as with Philochem to strengthen our radiopharmaceutical business and expand our focus in prostate cancer. I will discuss these deals in a moment. With the results achieved in the quarter, we are again raising our top line guidance as well as our bottom line guidance before considering acquired IP R&D charges in the quarter. Our recent launches of Cobenfy and Qvantig are progressing well. Cobenfy has delivered strong performance since launch, and we have consistently received positive feedback from physicians. They are seeing firsthand the medicine's differentiated profile with robust efficacy on both positive and negative symptoms and improved cognition.\nRegarding the U.S. launch of Qvantig, early feedback is encouraging, with strong uptake delivering treatment in just 3 minutes saves time for patients, caregivers and providers while also improving clinic efficiency, increasing patient comfort and reducing treatment complexity. Additionally, fewer port procedures streamline care allowing physicians to treat more patients.\nNow moving to recent business development initiatives on Slide 5. First, we entered into a global strategic partnership with BioNTech to codevelop and commercialize BNT327, a potentially transformative PD-L1 VEGF bispecific that could set a new standard of care across multiple tumor types. We're excited to bring together BMS' deep scientific and clinical expertise development and regulatory capabilities and commercial infrastructure in the IO space with BioNTech's innovation on BNT327. With a strong partner, we're well positioned to accelerate existing clinical trials, expedite time to market and expand the number of indications. The combined capabilities of BMS and BioNTech give us the opportunity to place BNT327 within the first wave of launches in this arena, either first or second to market, a critical advantage in terms of maximizing the commercial opportunity.\nBNT327 has the potential to become another needle-moving I/O therapy and accelerate our overall growth trajectory. The partnership is off to a great start. We are well underway in advancing a robust joint clinical development program that expands upon the initial indications by further developing BNT327 in numerous additional tumor types in combination. We look forward to sharing more information in the future. Separately, in terms of our early stage pipeline, we entered into a license agreement with Philochem for exclusive worldwide rights to OncoACP3, this is a potential best-in-class radiopharmaceutical therapeutic and diagnostic agent with the opportunity to become a breakthrough treatment for prostate cancer.\nWe believe this collaboration will further strengthen our position in the rapidly advancing radiopharmaceutical space. Earlier this week, we announced a transaction with Bain Capital to form a new company focused on advancing innovative immunology therapies. As part of this transaction, we out-licensed 5 assets to a newly formed company, including 3 clinical stage compounds and 2 Phase I ready compounds. This deal represents a compelling opportunity to accelerate the development of these promising immunology assets while also allowing BMS to participate in future value creation through royalties, milestone payments and a roughly 20% equity stake.\nBMS will continue to have a strong presence in immunology. We are focusing our immunology R&D efforts in areas where the company is best positioned to lead. These strategic BD initiatives demonstrate our ability and flexibility to continually identify opportunities to both source external innovation and also externalize pipeline assets where appropriate. This is all in support of our objectives of driving improved growth in the outer years and attractive returns for shareholders.\nMoving to our key data catalysts on Slide 6. We're entering a data-rich period. In the next 12 to 24 months alone, we expect 7 registration assets and 7 meaningful life cycle management opportunities. These represent important needle-moving events that can derisk the pipeline and help shape our trajectory through the end of the decade, recognizing we've had a few studies readout this year where results were not as expected. We are reviewing all of our near-term studies to best ensure the timely delivery of these programs with the highest probability of success.\nWhile we are encouraged by the overall breadth of our pipeline, I would highlight 3 new molecular entities with near-term data readouts. We expect readouts for Molvexian in acute coronary syndrome and secondary stroke prevention next year and for atrial fibrillation in 2027. Data for admoparant and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is expected next year. And we're also expecting to see MRD negativity data in-house later this year and PFS data next year from the Phase III Excalibur study of Iberdomide. This could provide additional validation of our CELMoD platform as a next-generation potential standard of care in multiple myeloma.\nIn terms of life cycle management, we now have several ongoing registrational trials for Cobenfy in Alzheimer's disease patients. These include studies in Alzheimer's psychosis, agitation and cognition impairment. In addition, we are also enrolling a Phase III study in bipolar 1 disorder. In addition, we have attractive opportunities to invest in numerous oncology pivotal trials. BNT327 is enrolling in first-line non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. The study in first-line triple-negative breast cancer is expected to begin later this year. We're also advancing next-generation platforms that could redefine their respective categories. We are initiating 2 registrational studies for our PRMT5 inhibitor, 1 in non-small cell lung cancer and another in pancreatic cancer based on encouraging early data with additional longer-term non-small cell lung cancer results to be presented at World Lung.\nAdditionally, we are now recruiting a pivotal study for our EGFR HER3 targeting ADC isoprene in first-line triple-negative breast cancer and expect early data in non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors later this year.\nLastly, in immunology, we are also now enrolling patients in a pivotal Phase II study for our CD19 NEX-T cell therapy in severe refractory lupus. Data readouts are expected to continue next year and throughout the end of the decade, providing an increasing line of sight into the strength of our pipeline. We are investing in and prioritizing areas where we see the strongest potential for high-value assets. We are doing what we said we would do, driving focused execution across the business and delivering solid results as we advance our multiyear plan to emerge as a top-tier sustainable growth company by the end of the decade.\nFinally, I want to welcome Dr. Christian Massacesi to BMS, who will be joining us starting tomorrow as Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Development. It's a pivotal time to lead our development organization given the number of key pipeline advancements we are making in the months and years ahead, and I look forward to the impact that he will be bringing to our pipeline and the team. I also want to thank Samit for all of his contributions and leadership during his 6 years at BMS and his commitment to groundbreaking science on behalf of our patients worldwide.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We continue to deliver strong performance in 2025. Our growth portfolio remains a key focus, and we are executing on driving top line growth and prioritizing investments to ensure we are positioned in the company for long-term sustainable growth.\nNow turning to the second quarter sales performance on Slide 8. Total company revenues were approximately $12.3 billion, reflecting strong demand across our business. Global sales of the growth portfolio increased approximately 17%, driven primarily by demand for our IO portfolio, Ryans, Reblozyl and Kenzia.\nLet's start a review with the oncology portfolio on Slide 9. Opdivo global sales were approximately $2.6 billion, up 7%, driven primarily by demand. In the U.S., revenues approximately $1.5 billion were largely driven by a strong launch in MSI-high colorectal cancer and continued growth in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Outside of the U.S., revenues grew 7%, driven primarily by volume growth and onetime favorable adjustments in the quarter.\nTurning to Qvantig. We are pleased with the performance in the quarter. Sales were approximately $30 million. The launch in the U.S. is going well with use across all indicated tumor types, received a permanent J code on July 1, which will support additional conversion as reimbursement improves. Due to the strong performance year-to-date, we now expect global Opdivo sales together with Qvantig to deliver stronger growth in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year.\nNow turning to our hematology performance on Slide 10. Reblozyl global sales were $568 million in the quarter and over $1 billion year-to-date, reflecting continued strength across our MDS-associated anemia indications. In the U.S., revenue growth was up 30% and versus the prior year, primarily due to demand growth in first-line RS positive and RS-negative MDS-associated anemia. Outside of the U.S., Reblozyl sales grew 46%, driven by continued demand across newly launched markets. Turning to Breyanzi, revenues were $344 million in the quarter. Global revenues grew 122%, reflecting strong demand across all indications and higher-than-expected infusions that benefited the second quarter.\nWe expect strong second half with sales skewed more towards the fourth quarter as the third quarter normalizes. In the U.S., sales were $255 million, more than doubling again this quarter. which reflects growth in large B-cell lymphoma, expansion from new indications approved last year and improved manufacturing success rate. Outside of the U.S., sales were $88 million, nearly tripling due to strong demand and launches in new markets.\nMoving to our cardiovascular performance on Slide 11. Starting with Camzyos. Global sales were $260 million, growing 86% due to robust demand. In the U.S., sales were $214 million, up 65%, driven primarily by increasing new patient starts. Sequentially, revenues grew 70%, driven by demand as well as a typical second quarter inventory build. And outside the U.S. sales were $46 million, reflecting launch momentum in over 20 markets. Eliquis global sales were $3.7 billion, growing 6%, primarily due to strong demand and U.S. sales grew 4% and ex U.S. sales grew 12%.\nMoving to immunology on Slide 12. Sotyktu sales grew 29% globally. In the U.S., sales increased 5%, primarily due to higher demand and an inventory build which was partially offset by higher rebates associated with increased commercial coverage. We remain focused on driving further demand growth with our improved access position to help offset the impact of higher rebates.\nNow moving to discuss Cobenfy Slide 13. Cobenfy sales were $35 million in the quarter and $62 million year-to-date. The launch of Cobenfy is tracking as we expected, weekly total prescriptions continued to grow, and we expect continued steady growth with sales in the second half of the year higher than the first half.\nNow let's move to the P&L on Slide 14. Gross margin was approximately 73%, primarily due to product mix. As expected, Operating expenses were approximately $260 million lower compared to the same period last year, primarily reflecting the results of our ongoing strategic productivity initiative. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.1%, and including the impact of the upfront charge for the BioNTech partnership. Overall, diluted earnings per share was $1.46 and due to the strong performance in the quarter and includes approximately $1.5 billion or $0.57 charge related to the BioNTech strategic partnership, which is reflected in acquired in-process R&D.\nTurning to the balance sheet and capital allocation highlights on Slide 15. Our financial position remained strong with roughly $13.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30. We generated cash flow from operations of about $3.9 billion in the second quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to take a strategic and balanced approach, investing in our growth portfolio of brands, along with business development, are our top priorities. We are on track with our plan to further delever our balance sheet and pay down $10 billion of debt by the first half of 2026 relative to our March 31, 2024, balance and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend.\nNow turning to our guidance on Slide 16. We're increasing our full year reported revenue guidance by $700 million at the midpoint to a range of $46.5 billion to $47.5 billion, reflecting continued strong performance of our growth portfolio, better-than-expected legacy sales in the second quarter and a favorable impact of approximately $200 million related to foreign exchange rates. Additionally, we now expect the legacy portfolio to decline approximately 15% to 17% for the year, a more moderate rate than previously anticipated due primarily to Revlimid's strong year-to-date performance. We now project full year REVLIMID sales of approximately $3 billion. We maintain our gross margin guidance at approximately 72% as some of our high-margin legacy brands are expected to continue to decline through the second half of the year. and Eliquis revenues to be more evenly phased throughout the year.\nWe are adjusting our operating expense guidance to increase slightly to approximately $16.5 billion, reflecting investment behind recent business development deals, and additional investment opportunities within our growth portfolio. As previously guided, our operating expenses are anticipated to be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, reflecting timing of investments, including the recently signed BD deals.\nOur operating margin target of approximately 37% for the full year remains unchanged. For OI&E, we now expect annual income of approximately $250 million due to higher-than-anticipated royalties and favorable interest income and we're maintaining our full year tax rate guidance of approximately 18%. As a result of the strong performance year-to-date when excluding acquired and process R&D charges, the midpoint of our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance would have increased approximately $0.20 per share. After including these charges of $0.57 per share, primarily related to the buy-in tech partnership, our expected EPS for 2025 is now projected to be between $6.35 and $6.65.\nThis increase reflects a strong performance of our growth portfolio as well as better-than-anticipated sales from our legacy portfolio and accommodates recent business development and other growth-oriented investments. All in all, I'm pleased with the performance of the business year-to-date.\nI'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for their continued focus and execution.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Chuck to start Q&A.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President, Investor Relations, Pfizer Inc.\n\nThanks, David. Operator, can we please start the polling for the Q&A session? Thank you.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal conference specialists by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two.\nPlease note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our Q1 2025 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer, and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development. Earlier this morning, we posted our quarterly slide presentation to bms.com that you can use to follow along with Chris and David's remarks. Before we get started, I'll remind everybody that during this call, we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements.\nActual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date, and we specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements, even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at BMS.com. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made from the same period in 2024, and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. All references to our P&L are on a non-GAAP basis. And with that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Chuck. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our Q1 earnings call. We had a strong Q1, driven by solid execution across the business and continued focus on our strategic priorities: maximizing our growth portfolio, accelerating our R&D pipeline, driving operational excellence, and strategically allocating capital. Our plans to transition the portfolio to deliver long-term sustainable growth are underway. Today, I will begin with some comments on our Q1 performance and highlight our recent accomplishments. Then, I will discuss our pipeline and upcoming catalysts that can further strengthen our long-term growth potential.\nI'll end by addressing the current operating climate. Starting with performance on slide four, our growth portfolio again delivered double-digit sales growth, driven primarily by strength in key marketed products, including our I/O portfolio, Breyanzi, Reblozyl, and Camzyos.\nAs expected, our legacy portfolio performance primarily reflected the impact of generic entries for certain older brands. So, turning back to our growth portfolio, let me speak to our recent launches. As you'll recall, in October, we launched Cobenfy, the first truly novel mechanism for the treatment of schizophrenia in decades, and we are pleased with the early prescription trends. Patient and physician feedback is very positive, reflecting its favorable tolerability and efficacy profile, and noting that patients are observing cognitive benefits. In January, we launched Opdivo Qvantig, the subcutaneous formulation of nivolumab, which is also receiving promising early feedback from practices and patients. Based on our performance in Q1, we are increasing our top and bottom-line guidance. David will provide more details shortly.\nWe continue to advance our pipeline during the quarter with several recent announcements.\nOpdivo plus Yervoy received FDA and EMA approvals for the treatment of first-line liver cancer and FDA approval for use in MSI high colorectal cancer in the US, further solidifying its leadership in immuno-oncology. Breyanzi was approved in the EU for treatment of follicular lymphoma, expanding our cell therapy presence in blood cancers. Camzyos received approval in Japan and a favorable label update in the US, which reduces the REMS echo monitoring requirement in the maintenance phase. In addition, milvexian reached an important milestone in the quarter with the completion of enrollment in the Librexia atrial fibrillation trial. This event-driven study remains on track to read out in 2027. Turning to slide five and our two recent top-line readouts.\nWhile we're disappointed that the Camzyos ODYSSEY study in non-obstructive HCM and the Cobenfy ARISE study in adjunctive schizophrenia did not meet their primary endpoints, I want to put the results in proper context. Although these are not the results that we had hoped for, neither outcome meaningfully alters our strategy or growth trajectory. For Camzyos, the study strongly suggests that non-obstructive and obstructive HCM behave distinctly. We do not expect these data to significantly impact peak sales, and our focus remains on our existing obstructive HCM indication, which represents the vast majority of the market opportunity. For Cobenfy, although it did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement as an adjunctive treatment in the ARISE trial, these data are encouraging, showing a noteworthy improvement for the majority of patients as well as a tolerable safety profile.\nAs we noted earlier this week, we will complete a full evaluation of the phase III trial data and will plan to engage with the medical community and regulators to discuss these results and potential next steps. Also, it's important to remember there are no currently approved adjunctive therapies for schizophrenia. Our commercial strategy remains focused on monotherapy, which accounts for 70% to 80% of the market, where our goal is for Cobenfy to become the foundational treatment. As I mentioned earlier, Cobenfy's differentiated profile is resonating, and we're seeing strong early uptake. Looking ahead, we're confident in the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of opportunities in our pipeline. We expect several of these opportunities to come this year, such as the first look at one of the phase III trials for Cobenfy and Alzheimer's disease psychosis, where there is significant unmet need.\nWe also plan to initiate several new pivotal studies this year, including seven phase III studies for Cobenfy across three indications: Alzheimer's agitation, Alzheimer's cognition impairment, and bipolar I, all expected to be underway by mid-year. At the same time, in oncology, we're advancing two next-wave solid tumor programs. First, our EGFRxHER3 antibody drug conjugate, Iza-bren, is expected to begin enrollment in a pivotal study in first-line triple-negative breast cancer in the coming months. And second, our androgen receptor degrader program in prostate cancer has begun enrolling patients in a pivotal study. We also expanded our registration program for golcadomide, a potential first-in-class CELMoD for lymphoma. The GOLSEEK-4 study in second-line plus follicular lymphoma will explore the combination of golcadomide with rituximab, where we know effective chemo-free regimens are needed for patients.\nIn total, we believe these programs represent significant opportunities over the back half of the decade, given the unmet medical need. The numerous pivotal data readouts in the coming years have the potential to meaningfully enhance the long-term strength of our growth portfolio. Our commitment to innovating for patients remains strong as we advance first and/or best-in-class medicines, both through internal discovery and business development, which remains a top priority. In terms of BD, we're actively pursuing opportunities that can enhance our growth profile, where there's strong strategic alignment and financial rationale. With our renewed organizational agility and balance sheet in a solid position, we have the flexibility to act decisively when we find the right opportunities. As we've said, maximizing long-term growth starts with strong execution this year and over the midterm.\nThe growth portfolio is performing well, and our pipeline is advancing.\nAt the same time, we're taking deliberate actions to right-size our cost structure and become a more efficient company. Overall, I'm confident we will deliver on disciplined execution as we position the company for top-tier growth by the end of the decade. Before I turn it over to David, I'll just say a few words on the current global operating climate. There's a lot of uncertainty, whether related to tariffs, a potential economic downturn, or restructuring at the FDA and HHS. This backdrop notwithstanding, our focus continues to be on building a strong and resilient company that can navigate and manage through operating complexities. We remain confident in our ability to deliver for our patients, employees, and shareholders.\nOur strategy is clear, and we're executing. We have a rich pipeline with strong growth potential.\nWe act swiftly when we see opportunities, whether it's business development to bring in great science or pursuing efficiencies in our business. Finally, we are laser-focused on execution, as you can see by our strong performance this quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in 2025 is off to a strong start. We're executing our growth strategy in terms of driving revenue for key products while also right-sizing our cost structure. Our persistent focus on execution is strengthening our foundation and positioning the company to deliver long-term sustainable growth. This morning, I'll provide highlights of our performance in Q1 and then review our outlook for the year. Now, turning to Q1 on slide seven, total company revenues were approximately $11.2 billion, reflecting strong demand across our growth portfolio, including the launch of Cobenfy, offset by the impact of generics and Medicare Part D redesign, primarily in our legacy portfolio.\nGlobal sales of the growth portfolio increased approximately 18%, led by key brands, including our I/O portfolio, Breyanzi, Reblozyl, and Camzyos.\nTurning to key product performance on slide eight, Opdivo had a solid first quarter, with global revenue up 12%, driven primarily by volume growth. Separately, initial sales of Opdivo Qvantig were approximately $9 million in the quarter. The US launch is progressing well, with early adoption across multiple tumor types. We continue to believe that physicians will convert approximately 30% to 40% of patients to this new product. Let's turn to hematology on slide nine. Reblozyl global sales reflect a continued strength across first- and second-line MDS-associated anemia.\nHigher sales in the US were related to increased use in first-line setting. Outside of the US, Reblozyl's strong double-digit sales growth was driven by demand across newly launched markets in Europe and Japan. In cell therapy, Breyanzi was another key contributor to our strong growth portfolio performance in the quarter, driven by demand across all indications.\nSales more than doubled and international sales tripled. Moving to cardiovascular on slide 10, let's start with Camzyos. Sales in Q1 nearly doubled, benefiting from strong global demand. Camzyos in the quarter was driven by new patient starts and a 19% increase in total prescriptions for the three months ending 31 March. We continue to expect steady growth of Camzyos in 2025 due to its compelling efficacy and safety profile on obstructive HCM. Turning to Eliquis, global sales were down 3% in the quarter, mainly due to the impact of Medicare Part D redesign in the US. We continue to expect total Eliquis revenue to be stronger in the second half of the year, primarily due to the Part D redesign and elimination of the coverage gap.\nMoving to immunology on slide 11, across our immunology portfolio, we saw higher commercial rebates, as previously discussed, related to improved access and Medicare Part D redesign. First-quarter Sotyktu sales reflected demand growth and offset the net impacts related to higher commercial rebates. We will continue to leverage our broader access position to drive further demand growth. Now, moving to slide 12, in its first full quarter on the market, Cobenfy is off to a solid start with sales of approximately $27 million, driven primarily by demand. During the quarter, weekly total prescriptions remained strong, tracking ahead of all branded schizophrenia launch benchmarks. Now, let's move to the P&L on slide 13.\nGross margin was approximately 73%, primarily due to product mix. Operating expenses were more than $500 million lower compared to the same period last year, primarily reflecting the results of our strategic productivity initiative.\nOur effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.1%, primarily driven by earnings mix. And overall diluted earnings per share were $1.80. Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation highlights on slide 14, our financial position remains strong with approximately $12.1 billion in cash equivalents and marketable securities as of 31 March. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $2 billion in the first quarter. In terms of capital allocation, we maintain our strategic and balanced approach. As Chris highlighted earlier, business development remains a top priority, and we continue to actively assess opportunities in line with our strategy.\nAnd we remain on track with our plan to pay down $10 billion of debt relative to our 31 March 2024 balance. Our capital allocations also include rewarding shareholders through the dividend. 2025 marks our 93rd consecutive year of dividend payments.\nIn addition to strategically allocating capital, we are also driving operational excellence through our previously announced strategic productivity initiative. With respect to our 2025 expansion, we expect to realize approximately $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2027, and we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of these savings by the end of this year. Now, turning to our outlook, starting with revenue on slide 15, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance to a range of approximately $45.8 to 46.8 billion, reflecting strong performance of our growth portfolio, better than expected legacy sales in the first quarter, and a favorable impact of approximately $500 million related to foreign exchange rates relative to our previous 2025 guidance.\nAdditionally, we now expect legacy portfolio to decline approximately 16% to 18% for the year, a more moderate rate than previously anticipated, due primarily to Revlimid's strong Q1 performance. We now project full-year sales of Revlimid to be at the top end of our previously guided range of $2 to 2.5 billion. We maintain our gross margin guidance at approximately 72%. We continue to expect underlying operating expenses to be approximately $16 billion, with an additional impact of about $200 million due to foreign exchange rates. Expenses are now anticipated to be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, reflecting timing of investments. Our operating margin target of approximately 37% for the full year remains unchanged.\nFor OI&E, we now expect annual income of approximately $100 million due to higher-than-anticipated royalties and favorable interest income.\nAlthough the Q1 tax rate was slightly lower than our full-year projection, we're maintaining our full-year tax rate guidance of 18%. As a result of these changes, we are raising the midpoint of our 2025 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.15 per share, with an expected range between $6.70 and $7. Our revised guidance includes the estimated impact of current tariffs on US products shipped to China but does not account for any potential pharmaceutical sector tariffs. In summary, our strong performance in the Q1 reflects our focus on disciplined execution. We are well-positioned to manage the near-term uncertainty in the macro environment while advancing our long-term growth strategy. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chuck for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then two. At this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nThe first question will come from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Maybe just two ones for me. Just first, bigger picture, as we think about tariffs and the 232 stuff that's going on right now, can you just provide any color on the company's US manufacturing footprint, ability to shift manufacturing to the US over time, and just in general, your ability to navigate this dynamic? I know the details are lacking right now, but just maybe just help frame out how you're thinking about this. And then the second question for me was on Cobenfy just in light of the adjunctive results we saw.\nJust talk a little bit about what this does for your outlook on Cobenfy and just how you think about kind of use in adjunctive given the negative trial results we saw. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSo thanks for the questions, Chris. I will start with your tariff question, and I'll turn it over to Adam to address Cobenfy. So first, let me just say at the outset that we certainly appreciate the administration's efforts to enhance US manufacturing. As we think about the pharma sector, though, obviously, that needs to be done in a very thoughtful and deliberate way. As you can appreciate, there's a lot that we don't know here. We don't have specifics on the outcome of this investigation, but our hope is that wherever this lands, we ultimately end up enhancing the competitiveness of US companies like BMS. We are a significantly US-based company today.\nWe have been up-investing in core infrastructure in the US for many years. So we need to ensure that ultimately our trade policies enhance the sector and support efforts like the ones we've been making.\nIn terms of our exposure, again, we've said is the tariffs that have gone into place, namely around China, have been reflected in the guidance that we provided today. It really is simply too early to provide a lot more on pharma-specific sectors. So we'll have to wait for the specifics there. And once we have them, obviously, we'll continue to update you. Adam, do you want to talk about Cobenfy?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSure. As Chris stated in his opening remarks, we don't expect these data to have a meaningful impact on Cobenfy sales, Chris. Recall, about 70% to 80% of patients are treated with monotherapy. And clearly, that's the most significant commercial opportunity. And it's also the treatment goal for psychiatrists. What happens in the real world, psychiatrists exhaust monotherapy options before trying adjunctive use.\nAnd that's after several failed monotherapy treatments happening later in line, third line, fourth line plus. Our focus is moving Cobenfy earlier in treatment. And that's exactly what we've been seeing in the market. In fact, roughly 40% to 50% of the Cobenfy prescribing today is now in second line and third line.\nPhysicians have also told us both in research and through advisory boards that missing the endpoint of the study would have no impact on monotherapy usage or their willingness to use Cobenfy, particularly when you look at the safety of the study results. There's a significant unmet need that still exists for patients with schizophrenia. Cobenfy fills the need with its efficacy and safety profile. That's why we're seeing strong uptake in the market since launch with positive feedback from both physicians and patients. We're going to continue to execute our plan for Cobenfy to become the foundational monotherapy treatment. We have a clear opportunity to continue to drive significant growth.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Operator, can we take our next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. So Chris, a big picture question for you. I mean, given that, I mean, there has been a lot of cost rationalization over a period of the last couple of years. How are you thinking about R&D here? I mean, again, there have been a couple of setbacks here with melanoma and all. But as going forward, I mean, when you think about taking bets, I mean, is there a change in the thought process?\nAnd how are you thinking about the future pipeline and the riskiness of it? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nWell, let me say a few things. Then obviously, just given the focus on R&D, Samit, you can certainly weigh in here. As you noted, we've been spending a lot of time over the last 18 months focused on a few key things. First, making sure we're driving strong execution, that strong execution in commercial, but really across the enterprise. I think you've seen the fruits of those efforts in terms of our performance last year, and continuing in the Q1 performance. Second, as you know, we've spent a lot of time focusing on making the organization more efficient and more agile.\nThat was reflected in the cost optimization efforts we had last year, as well as in the $2 billion initiative that we announced in our Q4 call.\nAnd then third, driving additional productivity coming out of R&D, and importantly, delivering on the swath of new opportunities we have coming out of our mid- to late-stage pipeline. And that's going to continue to be a focus. And as I step back and look at the opportunities for the company, the confidence that I have that we can deliver on the growth ambitions for the company, in part driven by our internal R&D pipeline, remains absolutely unchanged. It's important to keep in mind that while the two studies that read out over the last couple of weeks were certainly not the results that we had hoped for, as we said in our prepared remarks, they have no, or modest, financial impact on the company and no impact on the prospects for growth coming out of the decade.\nWe're going to continue to stay focused on delivering against that pipeline. We're going to continue to invest in strong areas of science where we have the opportunity to add significant value, and we can deliver on our mission for patients and for shareholders. Also keep in mind that we are in a very strong financial position. That financial position gives us a lot of strategic flexibility to continue to source innovation externally, which will also be very much focused on from a capital allocation standpoint. Anything, Samit, you want to?\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, just to add a couple of things, Chris. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. If we just were to put this into context, what has happened over the last five years since I've been here at least. We've had 43 major approvals since that time. So that speaks very loudly of the productivity of this organization. And this is in the top quartile, 90th percentile, actually, if you look across the industry from a KMR data perspective.\nCertainly, the three setbacks that you talked about are very notable that we've taken into account from an R&D perspective. We learn from these.\nBut what it does is now we have to look forward as the vision has already been created, looking forward to 10+ new molecular entities that we want to bring forward by the end of the decade, and 30+ new indications that we have planned for by the end of the decade. And they will start reading out now. And we just started early, yes. But a small opportunity would be in myelofibrosis that will read out later this year. There is, of course, ADEPT, which is very eagerly awaited by everyone, just like us.\nAnd then in 2026, there's a slew of readouts for new molecular entities. So we are well-planned for that one and looking forward to just growing the portfolio from there on.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nAll right. Thanks, Samit. Let's move to our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Maybe just another question on Cobenfy. Just wondering how the readout from ARISE impacts your levels of confidence in Alzheimer's psychosis readout, and perhaps any additional trials that you may be planning. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks. Thanks, Louisa. I'll ask Samit to take that.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Thanks, Louisa, for the question. ARISE data has no impact as we think about Alzheimer's disease psychosis. There are a few reasons for that. One, obviously, the disease is very different. Two, Alzheimer's disease overall plan in psychosis, as well as future-looking cognition impairment and agitation, those are based on the data that have already been generated many years ago, a couple of decades ago for xanomeline, where it showed statistically significant benefits in the behavioral patterns in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\nAlso, from a design perspective, in Alzheimer's disease psychosis, there's a longer duration of treatment of up to 12 weeks, which is obviously going to be beneficial as we think about observation of output for primary and secondary endpoints. So overall, confident in the conduct of our studies.\nAs you know, we are also initiating several studies, as Chris spoke about earlier, seven different phase III trials this year. So really looking forward to initiation of that program.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thank you. Let's move to our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Healthcare, Citi\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Chris, just got a couple for you. Another one on tariffs. Maybe if you could just talk about at a high level the flexibility of transfer price assumptions, either maybe from an IP or tax or site of manufacturing.\nI wasn't sure also about your ability to step up inventory as a potential strategy as well. And then second on BD, just given recent deals for Chinese assets, but also how low valuations are across US small biotech, how do these factor in your strategy, your urgency, etc.? Thanks so much.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, Geoff. I hope you're doing well. I will start, and then I will ask David to chime in a bit on the transfer pricing component of your tariff question. Obviously, as I said earlier, we've got a lot that we still have to wait and see that comes down with respect to the impact of any pharma industry sector tariffs. We appreciate the fact that the administration is taking time to study this issue. You know well, Geoff, that in this industry, our manufacturing networks are incredibly complex.\nThey're global supply chains. You have inputs coming from all over the world. There are long lead times in terms of making changes to the supply chain. Manufacturing processes are highly complex. Certainly, with respect to BMS, the medicines that we make are critical for patients and can't be easily substituted.\nHaving said that, in anticipation of potential tariffs, we continue to execute mitigation efforts. We have a broad global manufacturing network where we're looking for opportunities to optimize with tariffs in mind. As I mentioned, we already have a significant presence in the US, and we're continuing to invest. We have already undertaken efforts to reduce risks of disruption and shortages as a result of efforts like onshoring. We're going to continue those efforts. We're also going to continue to engage with the administration to ensure that ultimately whatever comes down is well thought through and delivered in terms of how we move forward.\nBut David, anything you want to comment on transfer pricing? And then I'll come back to BD.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. So Geoff, thanks for the question. BMS, we have a really broad manufacturing network both in the US and globally. We're not overly relying on any single country in terms of our supply chain. The situation related to tariffs continues to evolve, and we're closely assessing. We have a cross-functional team in place that's evaluating the flexibility.\nWe have a tremendous amount of flexibility to be able to move our manufacturing around should any potential tariffs come up. As we learn more and there's more specifics, obviously, we'll update you when that becomes known. But as Chris said previously, we continue to ensure the administration as well as policymakers understand the impact of these tariffs, as well as any potential future actions both on patients as well as the industry.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nAnd then, Geoff, with respect to business development, business development is our top capital allocation priority. That includes both partnerships and acquisitions. And of course, as you note, we're going to source that innovation from wherever it comes. And there's certainly a lot of exciting innovation taking place in China. We're going to be focused on a few things, though. We're going to be focused on strengthening our position in the core TAs that we operate in.\nThat's bringing in promising areas of science, assets where we can improve the growth profile of the company. And what's important is that we like the science, and we feel we're the rightful owners. The financials make sense. And again, that's strengthening the growth profile in key areas. And we believe that we can drive value for the company and shareholders.\nIf we hit those criteria, then we certainly have the financial ability to execute and move quickly.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nAll right. Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the rumblings we're hearing about the potential implementation of most favored nations pricing, potentially with regard to drug price negotiation in the IRA. I guess, what are you hearing? And more importantly, what's your stance on how that could impact negotiations for IRA drug prices going forward? And then secondarily, I'd love to touch on the potential impact, positive impact on the relaxed cardiac monitoring for Camzyos and how this could help accelerate sales with that franchise.\nThank you so much.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nWell, let me start, Evan. Thanks for the questions. Then I will turn it over to Adam on the second part of your question. Clearly, with respect to MFN and international reference pricing, there's a lot of focus here. I think the president and the administration is rightfully focused on the differential between US and ex-US net pricing. The way we think about it is I think you have to look at both sides of that equation.\nWith respect to ex-US net prices, we actually agree with the administration. Countries outside of the US need to be allocating more healthcare spending to innovative medicines. So we're engaging directly with the administration, working with our pharma partners, of course, and supporting the administration's efforts here to leverage whatever tools they can to get ex-US countries to allocate more of their healthcare spending to the types of innovative medicines that we develop at BMS. In terms of the US pricing environment, I think our perspective really is unchanged here. We have to address the complexity of the US healthcare system. $0.65 of every dollar spent on pharmaceutical products in the US goes to middlemen.\nThese are entities that don't discover, develop, or deliver medicines to patients. These are entities that, because of their market power, also have control over what patients pay in terms of co-pays. There are ample opportunities to make that system more complex and ensure that ultimately any rebates that we provide as industry ultimately go to improve what patients ultimately have to pay for medicines.\nBeyond that, I would say we continue to be focused on addressing other aspects of healthcare, notably fixing some of the more egregious aspects of IRA, the pill penalty, and addressing spillover risk on top of mine there. And of course, we continue to be very focused on and concerned about abuses in the 340B program. And that's going to be a big focus area of ours as well. Adam, do you want to take the second part of that question?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Thanks, Evan, for the question. So we've continued to deliver strong growth for Camzyos. We've virtually doubled sales versus prior year in the quarter. And our goal has been to ease the burden of ECHO requirements for both patients and physicians. And based on our long-term clinical data as well as the robust data collection, our label change reflects the FDA's confidence in the safety and efficacy of Camzyos, now with over 15,000 patients prescribed Camzyos in the United States.\nSo the label has been updated to reduce the frequency of ECHO monitoring for patients taking Camzyos from every 12 weeks, now to once every six months in the maintenance phase. And this is going to, number one, simplify processes for both patients and physicians. Number two, it's going to open up additional capacity at the COEs.\nAs a result, physicians are going to be able to treat more patients. It reduces the burden on patients and physicians' time and alleviates resourcing at the COEs. I will say that we're just super early in the launch, but early customer feedback has been very positive since the label change. Taken together, we're seeing good momentum for Camzyos, and we expect continued strong growth.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks for the background, Adam. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess maybe two for me. First, on the Cobenfy launch, Adam, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing with the prescriber base right now in terms of kind of breadth and depth. And then I know the slides also mentioned some one-time gross to net impact in the first quarter. So just wondering if you could elaborate on that and how we should think about the cadence of gross to net over the course of the year.\nAnd then David, I know you're not going to give 2026 guidance yet at this point, but again, heard you reiterate the 37% op margin for 2025. But just directionally, how should we think about 2026? As it seems like there are still a number of moving pieces as we think about next year. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, Terence. Adam then David.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Thanks, Terence. So we're very pleased with Cobenfy's launch performance. The launch is off to a strong start. We're now over 1,600 TRx per week, and it's tracking ahead of all branded schizophrenia launch benchmarks. We've made very good progress achieving Medicaid and Medicare access.\nWe're now at virtually 100% access across both channels, and we're making good progress with commercial payers. I mentioned earlier that because of this access, it's allowing us to move Cobenfy up earlier in treatment, which is critical. And I think most importantly, we are hearing very encouraging feedback from both patients and physicians around Cobenfy's efficacy and safety profile, physicians noting efficacy in positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and improvement in cognition and clarity of thought. We're also, I think, a critical metric for us is the growing number of new trialists.\nWe are seeing consistent growth week over week in new trialists since launch. We've got an opportunity to continue to expand and reach the 30,000 psychiatrists that are on our target list. So, as we've said, we expect to see strong uptake over the course of 2025 with a ramp in the back half of the year after we continue to increase the frequency of calls to our customers and try to break those reflexive habits. But we know the work we need to do to maximize this launch, and we will make this a very big product for the company over time. Now, as it relates to gross to net, as you saw in the slides, we delivered $27 million in net sales for the quarter, and that was inclusive of $9 million in a gross net benefit.\nSo the underlying demand for Cobenfy is strong. And at launch, we made assumptions around payer mix and discounts. So Q1 essentially was a true-up for favorable gross to nets in Q4. So we've been very disciplined in discretionary gross net spend. As you know, there are mandatory discounts in Medicaid. We now have very strong access. So we expect to see increases this year in gross nets for the full year. But again, we expect to see strong uptake over the course of the year with a ramp taking place in the back half of 2025.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nDavid.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. And look, as far as 2026, we're not going to provide guidance on this call. But the way I would think about it is we remain very financially disciplined by the strategic productivity initiatives that we've rolled out. And as we said, we're well on our way this year to delivering $1 billion in savings relating to that and on track for that $2 billion by 2027. So that gives us a lot of flexibility. Also, we continue to leverage AI and look to further automate, which is making us even more efficient. So we see greater opportunity there as well.\nAnd as we've shown in the past, we're constantly looking at our portfolio and prioritizing that accordingly. So all of that being said, we feel we have a lot of levers to continue to manage this business.\nBut at the same time, Terence, we're going to invest in long-term growth of the company as well. And that's critically important to strengthen that growth position. And as we said, our cash position remains strong. Business development remains a priority. So we look to bring in to strengthen that portfolio and bring in new assets, which we'll invest behind.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nAll right. Thanks, David. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Trung Huynh with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi guys. Thanks for the question. Just a couple on Camzyos from me. So one on the Alzheimer's psychosis trial, just what's your expectations for the bar for that study? What's a meaningful reduction in hallucinations and delusions we should be thinking about? And then the second, just a clarification on the Camzyos gross to net question.\nIf you back out the Cobenfy numbers, X that one off, it looks like gross to net is 35% to 40%. I think you just said that we should be thinking about that increasing. But you've also previously said you should have modest discounts above Medicaid statutory rate, which is like 23%. So are we thinking that gross to net increases from 35% to 40%? Are you having to be more aggressive on rebates for traction?\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nLet me have Samit take the first part of your question, which I believe was on Cobenfy. And then the second part of your question, I'll ask Adam to take.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. So for the Cobenfy ADP trial, remember these are trials that are being compared to placebo. And what we have to show is statistical significance in the primary endpoint for NCI hallucinations and delusions in this patient population. So we're not predefining as to what the real number needs to be to be clinically meaningful. I think over here, there are no drugs approved. So I think all improvements are good. But what we do know from the prior studies of xanomeline, there have been remarkable improvements, not only on these symptomatologies, but also other elements such as cognition.\nSo we will continue to monitor that. The data we'll read out for the first trial in the second half of this year. So at that time, we'll be able to share more.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nAdam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. As it relates to gross to net, we don't share specific discounting rates. But as I mentioned, we've been very disciplined in discretionary gross to net spend. And so when you look at the gross to net impact for the Q1, what we saw, this was just a true-up for a projection that we made that was favorable in Q4. So we will have increased in gross to net for the full year because we have now 100% access virtually in both Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Adam. Let's take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Courtney Breen with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, all. Thanks for taking the question today. A couple for me. The first kind of as it relates to tariffs, we've seen a number of companies come out and make statements about kind of their capital investments within the US in manufacturing and R&D, kind of both backward-looking as well as forward-looking. So I wonder if you could provide some comments on kind of Bristol's perspective there in terms of committed capital expenditure going forward. And then the second question is just as we think about kind of M&A, and I know there's been a couple of questions on this so far, you've also got some kind of key data cards to turnover.\nMilvexian, I think, is one of the big ones, as well as some of these kind of subsequent Cobenfy trials.\nCan you talk a little bit about kind of how you're approaching making those M&A decisions in the context of kind of internal success rates and kind of waiting for sequencing of those data cards to turnover? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSure. I'll take both of those. So first, as I mentioned earlier, we're a company that's significantly based in the US today. If you look back over the last number of years, we've been up investing in core infrastructure. That's infrastructure related to R&D, technology, as well as CapEx. We certainly have plans to continue to invest in those very same areas in the US in the coming years.\nSo again, what ultimately transpires with trade policies, we hope, will ultimately enhance the sector and support efforts like the ones that we've been making, and support the competitiveness of US companies. With respect to business development, obviously, business development has been a priority for the company from a capital allocation standpoint for a number of years. It's going to continue to be our top allocation priority this year.\nIf I step back and look at how we've thought about business development, we really don't think about it in terms of the relationship between specific data readouts of our own internal program. It's always been a way that we've thought about sourcing new science and new innovation. And so in some ways, you can think about those things as very distinct. When you look at what we've been doing over the last 18 months, we were very clear last year that we were going to focus on execution. We were going to focus on digesting the deals that we had done at the end of 2023. And most importantly, as part of that, ensuring that we got Cobenfy off to a very strong launch.\nWhen I look at it, I think we delivered on all of those things.\nSo as we think about this year, there's certainly no endogenous constraints or specific events that we have to see for us to be able to execute on business development. We're going to go back to the criteria I referenced earlier. If the science looks good, if it's an area that we think we can add value, and most importantly, if we believe it can enhance the growth profile for the company exiting this decade, we certainly have the financial horsepower to be able to execute and execute quickly.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you for the questions. I have a question on long-term guidance. So Chris, when you took over, you kind of stopped providing those or you guys kind of withdrew some of the elements that you had given. Can we expect you to revisit this at some point? I know on trough guidance, you've said end of the decade. I think the key there is the absolute level of the trough number. So wondering if you can assure us that it won't go lower than $6 a share.\nThat's kind of where a lot of analyst numbers bottom out. And then the second question is just transfer pricing. So companies commonly have these set up with major brands, not all brands. Levels of disclosure next to nothing.\nAny color you can share in which particular brands Bristol has transfer pricing arrangements in place such that if tariffs come through in Europe that ensnare this, we have some idea of which brands might be impacted?\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, Tim. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to David to talk about transfer pricing. We're not going to be giving long-term guidance as a standard course. This is what we've discussed previously. That's a philosophical point of view. Our focus is, as you know and as we've been discussing, is to drive sustained top-tier growth as we exit the decade.\nWe've talked at length over the last 18 months about how we're going to deliver on that. The way we think about guidance, Tim, is we want to give you guidance that is a clear line of sight to the things that we're going to hold ourselves accountable for and that you can ultimately hold us accountable for. That's what we're going to do with respect to all of the guidance elements that we've done.\nSo we really have fixated on going back to what the company has done historically, which is to provide annual guidance. Then, of course, as we did today, we update that guidance as the business conditions warrant. With respect to trough, I think that's going to be how we talk about trough will be very aligned to that philosophy. But rest assured, the way we think about trough is we're going to do everything we can through either accelerating our internal clinical programs, continuing to engage in business development, and just executing across the enterprise to ensure that we do everything we can to shorten the depth of that trough, move it in as close as we can so that we can, again, return this company to sustained long-term growth and do that certainly by the time we exit this decade. David, do you want to talk about this?\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. And Tim, look, on transfer pricing, I know this question has come up a few times. Transfer prices are determined by tax law, both tax law in the United States as well as tax law in the other jurisdictions in which we operate. So from a tariff perspective, I would not be thinking transfer pricing. Transfer pricing is determined by tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, David. Let's move to the next question, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners",
    "content2": "Yes. Thanks very much, and thanks for all the updates. So I have two questions. First is high level, and then one is on Cobenfy. So the industry is obviously facing three major government threats in the United States. Number one, actions that are harming US biopharma innovation, including HHS cuts, questioning, and criticism of esteemed medical scientists.\nSecond, tariff threats. And third, the Trump administration's agenda to take down drug prices more than the Biden administration. So considering what appears to be a lack of appreciation in Washington on the benefits of the biopharma industry to the American public at large and to the economy in the country, could you comment on how Bristol's leadership team and board are engaging differently today with Washington to defend the industry and company?\nAnd then separately, regarding the Cobenfy adjunctive trial failure, could you talk about the more disappointing results in the risperidone subgroup and whether the company believes that risperidone DDIs with Cobenfy may have impacted the efficacy in that subgroup and how you may potentially evaluate Cobenfy in combination with other therapies in the adjunctive setting in the future? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, David. I'll ask Samit to start, and then I'll come back and answer your more general questions.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSure. Thank you, David, for the question. So for ARISE, certainly, as David has already, sorry, Chris has already mentioned, we saw a notable improvement in terms of BANT scores. If you think about patients who received the non-risperidone antipsychotic therapy, certainly we are evaluating and assessing all avenues in terms of understanding the data on risperidone population, including the DDI potentials, PGP in 2D6, and all of those enzymatic pathways. With all of that said, there is a lot more work to be done to look at other endpoints in the trial as well. Once all of that is done, then we will be able to define the next step soon, which could include engaging with the regulators, apart from obviously the treating physicians, as well as conducting additional studies as we look to the future.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nAnd then with respect to your more general industry question, look, I think we agree with your perspective that America has a real gem in the biopharmaceutical industry. Over 70% of the research and development in this space takes place in the United States. What drives that is a very healthy ecosystem that supports innovation, rewards innovation, and ultimately ensures that companies like ours can do everything we can to deliver innovative medicines to patients and do so quickly. Americans have benefited from having access to more innovation faster than patients anywhere else in the world. At the core of that is an ecosystem that starts with having strong government support for early research and also setting clear rules of engagement from a regulatory framework. Just to be clear, we have not seen a notable impact on our business from any of the changes taking place in Washington.\nWe're obviously going to closely monitor implications of changes. But just to be clear, as of today, we've not seen any real impact on our business. Having said that, we're going to continue to do what we've always done, which is focus on strengthening the ecosystem for innovation in the US. That means ensuring that we are able to continue to invest in strong areas and interesting areas of science supported by a strong intellectual property framework. We're going to also continue to engage with the government on pricing and the support of the payment for innovation on the back end. We've talked about the need to fix the more egregious aspects of IRA, notably the PIL penalty, and addressing some of the spillover risk that we saw in IRA.\n\\We also want to ensure that we're making the US ecosystem less complex.\nThat means addressing the role that middlemen play. And then, an area that we absolutely agree with this administration is outside of the US, getting countries to allocate more healthcare dollars to support innovative medicines like those that we make at Bristol Myers Squibb. So those are really our main areas of focus. We're going to continue to engage with our pharma partners to engage the administration. We'll also be engaging directly. And that's going to be our continued focus.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chris. Let's take our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Carter Gould with Cantor. Please go ahead.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cantor\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. The BD messaging is coming through clear, and the focus on that endogenous events won't be a stage gate is clear. I guess my question is more on exogenous events and the extent to which uncertainty around tariffs, FDA, and drug pricing environment are sort of stage gates to being able to move on drug pricing either hold up on your side or on the target side. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nI'll take that one, Carter. I think you mean that any of those exogenous factors having an impact on our ability to do business development. Look, I think we clearly have been focused on putting ourselves in a very strong financial position. We do that by, frankly, executing on the business, as you saw us do in this quarter that we've been discussing today. But also, as David referenced, by continuing to focus on making the company more efficient and more agile, that enables us to pull costs out of the system and puts us in a stronger position. That financial flexibility gives us the ability to be much more engaged on business development.\nAnd frankly, that, I think, is way more important than any of the exogenous factors that you referenced. And so again, I would just reiterate, business development remains our top priority.\nWe have the financial position to move on business development, but we're also going to be very disciplined. We're going to stay focused on those opportunities where we like the science, where we're the rightful owners, and importantly, where we can continue to improve the growth profile of the company.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chris. Let's take our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Steven Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nSenior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. Two questions, probably both for Samit. Just to be absolutely clear on your prepared remarks and answers to questions, and I know that you need to speak with regulators, but Bristol seems to see a path to positive regulatory action on the existing ARISE data. Is that correct, or is there no such path? So that's the first question. Second question is, to what extent did the milvexian phase III trial benefit from the competitor phase III stoppage?\nFor instance, did enrollment jump 10%, 20%? And given that, why hasn't timing of the primary endpoint changed? Were events, for instance, running behind in the patients previously enrolled before the competitor setback? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSamit, you want to take those?\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Thank you, Steve, as usual. Great questions. For ARISE, look, we would not obviously speculate right now. As I said earlier, we do need to do all of the work to understand all of the data, including the additional endpoints that we have not yet looked at. We will plan to then engage with the regulators to define what the next steps would be.\nFor milvexian, we certainly continue to manage and monitor the events that we are observing. As we have said before, our overall event rate remains very low for atrial fibrillation trial. We have not reprojected the timelines. We will continue to work together, J&J and ourselves, and we will communicate if there is a change in the timeline in terms of the readout. As you know, we've already communicated.\nWe still look forward to the readout for the ACN SSP trial in 2026, and then AF is in 2027. We've already completed enrollment. We've communicated that as well for the AF trial. So overall, all on the right track, and we'll keep you posted if the timelines were to change with the evolution of the events.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks, Samit. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nZach Dunn\n\nSenior Equity Research Associate, Guggenheim\n\nThis is Zach Dunn on for Seamus Fernandez. Thank you for the questions. A few from us on Camzyos and your CMI portfolio. Firstly, how defensible is your first-in-class position with Camzyos, such as your establishment at HCM centers and updated REMS in light of aficamten potentially coming to market this year? And then to non-obstructive HCM and myosin inhibition, what read-through, if any, might there be to your development efforts in HFpEF? How would you characterize prospects for success in HFpEF with MYK-224? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks. Both great questions. Adam, then Samit.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Let me start. Thanks for the question. So as I mentioned, we continue to deliver strong growth and steady growth with Camzyos. We've established a very strong revenue base and expect continued growth from expanding our prescriber base. We're seeing very high persistencies, so long durations of treatment, and we're continuing to add new patients each and every week.\nWe're focused right now on increasing our depth of prescribing in the large COEs, and the label change that we mentioned earlier should help accelerate that. We're also making good progress expanding into community cardiology accounts, and we're seeing solid growth and increasing number of trialists each and every week. As it relates to competition, we've always planned for competition in the space. We don't see any meaningful clinical differentiation versus aficamten.\nWe've now had the opportunity to talk to literally hundreds of thought leaders, and almost all have said that aficamten and the data that they presented appears undifferentiated. So it's going to be important to see what their data and their label looks like later in the year, but we'll be prepared for when aficamten comes to market. We maintain a consistent view that we will remain leaders in this space.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. And thank you for the question on the nHCM result and the impact on HFpEF for MYK-224. Look, we still have to do a lot more digging into the data. As Chris has mentioned, we do know, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy versus a non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a suggestion of a differential disease because of the outflow tract obstruction in one versus the other. As it relates to HFpEF, remember how nHCM study was designed and where we had seen the impact on the biomarkers, NT-proBNP as well as on the troponin T. We had hoped that those changes in the biomarkers will translate into a clinical benefit and outcome in nHCM.\nDid not happen.\nHowever, as we think about HFpEF, these biomarkers have tracked historically as we think about the other trials in HFpEF and other drugs that have worked in HFpEF as we think about the overall functionality of the heart. So it's too early to say what the outcome is going to look like. We are enrolling a large cohort of patients in the phase II study that we are conducting right now for MYK-224. Once those results are available, then we'll be able to say more the impact overall on the HFpEF program. I think it's too early to comment on that.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Samit.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThank you. Now, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Asad Haider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAsad Haider\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the question. Maybe just going back to capital allocation, and I know a lot has been answered already, but just if you could just unpack, Chris, what's driving this renewed emphasis on BD, if you could unpack that a little bit more in the context of the lack of visibility on some of the structural challenges that the industry is facing, and then any comments on size and what exactly you're looking to solve for as you scan the landscape of external assets. Is it near-term revenue growth or earlier stage assets, and what are the therapeutic areas of interest? Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSure. Well, let me be really clear. Capital allocation focus, the focus that we have hasn't changed. Business development is a top priority. We said that last quarter and the quarter before that. We are focused on strengthening in our key therapeutic areas that we know well and improving the growth profile of the company.\nThose are the things that I think we've consistently said. With respect to size, we don't evaluate opportunities focusing on size. What I would say is that the way we think about any opportunity from a business development standpoint is we put it through a set of filters. We're in a strong position to do a lot of things, but the way we think about it is, does it strengthen the therapeutic areas that we're in? And you know those well.\nAre they areas where we have an ability to add to the science, and we're the rightful owners of it? Do the financials make sense? And the one thing that we've been consistent in overlaying on those criteria is, does it improve the growth profile of the company at the back end of the decade and going into the 2030s? And those are the criteria that we've consistently been using, and those will be the main priorities. Of course, around that, we'll continue to look for opportunities for earlier stage programs, but I would say that's how we think about our top priorities right now.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Chris. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Matt Phipps with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Phipps\n\nPartner and Group Head of Biotechnology Equity Research, William Blair\n\nThanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. I know it's early days, but any particular indications or physician settings where you're seeing more adoption or more interest in Qvantig so far? And then, independence trials coming up. Just how meaningful is this market opportunity expansion, and can you give us any sense of what would be a clinically meaningful benefit in transfusion independence? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nAdam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Matt. Thanks for the question. We're making good progress with our Opdivo Qvantig. We're now around three months post-launch. The feedback's been positive. What we're seeing is the majority of the use thus far has been in the community setting, about 80% as expected.\nWe're focused on continuing to increase breadth of prescribing and doing that both in community and in academic settings. What's encouraging is we're seeing physicians use our Opdivo Qvantig across multiple tumor types. So as a result, the uptake is tracking right in line with our expectations. Last thing I'll mention is what we have shared previously. We were issued a temporary J-code like all Part B biologics, and that does impact reimbursement timing. Some accounts are waiting on the sidelines for a permanent J-code.\nTherefore, the subQ conversion will take time to ramp.\nWe'll get that J-code 1 July issued, and thus we expect a second-half ramp. So overall, we're pleased with what we're seeing in the early days of the launch.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nI think the second question was regarding MF overall opportunity so.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nI could take that too. So, thanks for the question. So as it relates to myelofibrosis and anemia-associated MF for Reblozyl, the opportunity there is a pretty modest commercial opportunity. The majority of the business for Reblozyl is going to be driven by the indication we have from COMMANDS, and that's first line. And our teams are focused on really driving that first-line RS negative patient. We're making good progress in the United States.\nWe're also unlocking reimbursement outside of the US as well. So we expect continued growth there. The next readout for Reblozyl that's going to be important is going to be the non-transfusion dependent readout. We'll open up another part of the marketplace. But again, we're focused on really driving the indications that we have today in first line.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Let's move to our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Sean McCutcheon with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nSean McCutcheon\n\nVP of Biotechnology Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the question. For the EXCALIBER study with MRD negativity readout later in the year, do you suspect that you could be able to obtain an approval on that MRD negativity outcome as an intermediate endpoint? With the movement of CAR-T into second line and later, how do you think this shapes the opportunity and the bar for utilization of iberdomide in the triplet if it does show benefit over DVD? Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question, Sean. Samit, you can start, and then Adam maybe weigh in on the latter part of that question.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nSure. So remember, the trial is designed with MRD, and then there is the PFS, and then there is overall survival as endpoints. Again, very important study for the second-line plus population. As we look at the MRD data, we will have to look at the totality of the data that other endpoints are moving in the right direction, because the supportive evidence would be needed from a regulatory perspective as the regulators look at this, that the other endpoints are not going in the opposite direction. Again, when the data reads out, we'll be able to say more in terms of the regulatory possibility. I'll just add one more thing in terms of the placement of iberdomide once the data are read out and if they're positive and the drug gets approved.\nRemember, we've talked about it before as well.\nCAR cell therapies are still limited to academic centers. There's a large amount of patients who are treated in the community setting. So small molecules and combinations are going to be required in the community setting, and therefore, there is that unmet medical need that will be fulfilled with iberdomide and in the future, mezigdomide as well.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Thank you, Samit. So as you know, this is a very crowded competitive market, but as Samit was alluding to, it's a very fragmented market as well with a lot of room for additional entrants. So yes, cell therapies are moving up in lines of treatment, but they are moving up in treatment in these CAR-T centers of excellence, which represent a relatively small percentage of the market. In fact, the majority of the market, over 70% of multiple myeloma, is treated in the community as Samit was alluding to. What we're excited about for the Novel CELMoD agents in multiple myeloma is that, number one, they provide a tailored approach of efficacy with a manageable toxicity profile, combinability, as well as an oral convenience.\nAs Samit talked about, we've got four ongoing pivotal trials across iber and mezi. For iberdomide, it's a triplet combination combining well with dara as well as moving even further upline, head-to-head versus Revlimid in a post-transplant maintenance setting. For the EXCALIBER study for mezi, there's a lot of excitement there around the potency of mezigdomide, which has the opportunity to read out as well potentially in early 2026. This is our most potent CELMoD combining well in triplet combination with PI. Taking together, we're excited about the potential launches of these important assets.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks, Adam. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nVP of Biotechnology Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I have one question on your radio franchise and then maybe a big picture question. Can you talk about expectations from RYZ101 in first-line small cell lung cancer that's expected later this year? And then maybe a big picture FDA question. The FDA commissioner has recently made a lot of comments on his vision for changes at the FDA at different levels.\nWas there anything in particular that you think might have a significant impact on either the timelines or how you do drug development or post-marketing surveillance? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, Kripa. Maybe Samit, you could take both of those.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Thank you, Kripa. So yes, truly looking forward to the readout of the phase one study in extensive stage small cell lung cancer where the radioligand therapy is being combined with the background of chemotherapy. And what we're really looking for is primarily the safety. And certainly, efficacy will be looked at, but again, with an open-label study and single-arm study, you'll have to compare that to the historical controls to see what the overall efficacy looks like, where chemotherapy does work well, but the durability has generally been challenging in terms of maintaining that response. So all of that data is what we are expecting to see as we look towards the back end of this year as the trial reads out.\nAnd that will then set up the stage for taking it further in patients with SSTR2 expression in their small cell lung cancer.\nFrom the FDA perspective, look, I think thus far what we've seen from our perspective, that our approvals have come on time. In fact, some of the approvals have come before time. If you think about the first-line HCC approval that we recently got, as well as for the MSI-high colorectal cancer approval, our meetings across the therapeutic areas continue to be on time. Some of them are actually in person now, going forward. So overall, we are very constructively and collaboratively working with the regulators to ensure that transformational therapies that we are developing are not delayed. And we will certainly continue to work with the administration, as well as the regulators, to convey the point if we start to see any change in those timelines for any of the activities that are going to be critical to bring these medicines to patients on time.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Samit. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you for the question. One for Chris. Sorry to belabor macro, Chris, and totally understand the backdrop is still fluid, but is there an initial data point or policy decision that will inform next steps? For example, would having visibility on US corporate tax reform be a starting point, or would you need to actually form a tariff rate or any color like that to budget accordingly? And then one for Samit.\nWhat are your thoughts on the recent PD-1/VEGF data sets? Specifically, does the data look consistent? Does it look competitive to PD-1? Just get your views there.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nMaybe I'll start, and then Samit, you can take over. Look, I think that there are multiple aspects of the policy environment that are in flux, and we're going to be monitoring each and every one of those. I don't think there's one that rises to more prominence than the other. They're all important at some level. What I would say, if you just step back, though, if the goal here is to ensure that we continue to invest in research and development and that we're investing in the United States, one thing we should not overlook is one of the points you just made, which is the importance of tax policy. The US tax rate and making the US corporate tax rate more competitive is critically important.\nIn fact, when you go back to 2017 and the corporate tax rate came down to 21%, you saw a positive impact on investment in the United States in R&D. And so I think that in the focus that a lot of folks have on tariffs and on what may happen in the US and ex-US pricing environment, we shouldn't lose sight of the importance of tax.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nI think from the PD-1/VEGF perspective, the data continues to evolve in the right direction, I would say. What we saw yesterday or the day before when the news broke out for an additional phase III study in China showing a progression-free survival benefit, one of the things that we'll continue to watch out for is when does that OS data start to become available and what the overall impact on overall survival is going to look like. Second thing to watch out is going to be what is the impact on safety? Right now, it seems, at least from the press release we saw, it's comparable between the two arms. So we'll have to just look at those parameters.\nAs it applies to us, I would just close it out from that perspective that we have a large portfolio in non-small cell lung cancer, which is obviously precision-driven, as well as looking at overall portfolio, also building on the I/O franchise as we think about the high-dose relatlimab combination with Opdivo. So we have a lot of work to do in non-small cell lung cancer, but we certainly keep an eye on these data.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Samit. We know you all have a busy day, so if I can just turn to Chris for some closing remarks, then we'll wrap up the call.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. So thanks a lot, Chuck. We do know that you all have a very busy day. There are several companies in our sector that are reporting, and we certainly appreciate everyone's attention. I hope it was clear throughout our messaging that the priorities that we have as a company remain consistent and clear. I think what you see in the quarter is our growth portfolio is delivering.\nWe've shown good progress. We're better aligning our cost structure with our revenue base, and many of our key pipeline readouts remain in front of us. In fact, we are just at the very beginning of the wave of catalysts that we have coming. We're in a strong financial position, which affords us options in terms of capital allocation priorities and business development. And before we close, I want to recognize our colleagues for all of their hard work.\nAnd of course, even in these uncertain times, we remain committed to our overarching goal, which is to reshape and optimize BMS to deliver top-tier growth by the end of the decade and, most importantly, generate attractive returns for shareholders. So again, thank you all for tuning in today. And as always, the team's available for follow-ups and have a great rest of the week.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Please go ahead.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our Q4 2024 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer, and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development. Earlier this morning we posted our quarterly slide presentation to bms.com that you can use to follow along with Chris and David's remarks.\nBefore we get started, I'll remind everybody that during this call we will make statements about the Company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date, and we specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.\nWe'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made from the same period in 2023, and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. All references to our P&L are on a non-GAAP basis, and with that I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chuck, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As we'll discuss today, 2024 was a year of good execution across multiple fronts. Importantly, our performance last year establishes a solid foundation to continue our multi-year journey to achieve top sustainable growth by the end of the decade. I will begin with some comments on our Q4 and full year accomplishments. Then I will speak to the promise we see with COBENFY and the steady cadence of clinical data catalysts that will begin this year, further defining our future growth potential. I will end with an overview of our 2025 guidance.\nStarting on Slide four, we closed 2024 with strong Q4 performance reflecting another quarter of double-digit percentage increase for our growth portfolio. In addition, we saw strong performance across key parts of the company and achieved notable commercial and R&D milestones. Looking at the full year, let's turn to slide five. I'm pleased with the progress we have made executing on our multi-year plan for the year. The growth portfolio delivered double-digit revenue growth led by Breyanzi, Camzyos, Reblozyl, and Opdualag. In the latter part of the year we re-established our presence in neuroscience with the US approval and launch of COBENFY,\nwhich is the first novel mechanism for the treatment of schizophrenia in decades. We also received US approval of Opdivo Qvantig in late December. This new subcutaneous formulation of nivolumab will help extend the reach and impact of our immuno-oncology franchise to patients into the next decade. Throughout 2024, operational excellence and financial discipline were top priorities for us. As part of this effort, we reallocated significant spend towards high potential growth opportunities, achieving most of our targeted $1.5 billion in savings. We expect to capture the remainder this year. Additionally, we put considerable focus in 2024 on improving R&D productivity.\nAs a result, we have been able to accelerate several programs in our late-stage pipeline. Notable examples include Camzyos, where we completed enrollment in the Odyssey Non-Obstructive HCM study six months earlier than expected and now anticipate top-line results next quarter. With COBENFY the ADEPT-2 study in Alzheimer's disease psychosis is expected to have a top-line readout in the second half of this year versus our original expectation of 2026. This is due to our focus on accelerating patient recruitment following the acquisition of Karuna and with our iberdomide Excalibur trial in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma.\nEnrollment is complete, and we have an opportunity for a data readout this year, also ahead of schedule due to the recent addition of MRD as a co-primary endpoint. Looking ahead, we will continue to sharpen our focus on operational excellence. You saw the early steps of this strategy last year. As a continuation of that, we are taking deliberate steps to become a leaner, more focused company and have identified an additional $2 billion in savings. We expect approximately $1 billion of these savings to be realized this year and the remainder by the end of 2027. David will provide more details shortly.\nThese actions are consistent with our strategy of investing in our growth portfolio and promising areas of science while maintaining financial discipline. As I've said, this is a journey, but we're already seeing progress. I'm confident the actions we are taking are the right ones that will further advance our long-term sustainable growth strategy. Turning to Slide six, the US approval of COBENFY for schizophrenia was an important achievement in 2024, and the launch is off to a great start. While we're focused on delivering on the schizophrenia indication today, we see the potential for additional benefit to patients and have made strategic investments in a broad clinical development\nprogram. We expect to have important data readouts starting this year and every year thereafter for the remainder of the decade. This year we're initiating seven phase III studies across three: Alzheimer's disease agitation, Alzheimer's disease cognition, and bipolar I disorder, and next year we plan to begin phase III studies in autism spectrum disorder irritability. The significant ramp-up in spending on COBENFY illustrates our focus on continuing to invest behind key growth drivers and, while simultaneously maintaining financial discipline. Moving to slide seven, we are entering a data-rich period with multiple catalysts over the next 24 months across a significant number of\nassets. In 2025, we have multiple important registrational catalysts, as you can see on this slide, including several that I already mentioned, as well as the COBENFY ARISE study in adjunctive schizophrenia. Then, in 2026, we expect to have registrational data for numerous potential first- and/or best-in-class medicines, including Milvexian in acute coronary syndrome and secondary stroke prevention, BMS-986141 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and mezigdomide in multiple myeloma. We also expect to have registrational data for allogeneic GPRC5D CAR T in multiple myeloma and for RYZ101 in GEP-NETs. We believe these data readouts will further de-risk the pipeline and\nprovide meaningful insight into the future growth profile of the company. Now let me give you an overview of our 2025 guidance and how we see this year playing out on slide eight. In terms of the top line, we estimate revenue to be approximately $45.5 billion, reflecting, as expected, the near-term impact of generics across multiple products and the continued strength of our growth portfolio. As it relates to the bottom line, we expect our 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $6.55 to $6.85. This reflects the expanded savings program I mentioned earlier. David will provide more details on our guidance. Finally, turning to slide nine, BMS is evolving into a\nfundamentally different company with a clear multi-year plan, strong execution, and an accelerating pipeline.We now have a younger and more diversified growth portfolio. This includes COBENFY, which has the potential to be a significant contributor to growth over the coming years. We have a multitude of important data readouts over the next 24 months with the potential to launch 10 or more new medicines and pursue over 30 indication expansion opportunities over the next five years, and we remain focused on the therapeutic areas where we have a long track record of success and delivering transformational medicines to patients. We are confident in the steps we are\ntaking to reshape BMS, and by the end of the decade we expect to have a transformed portfolio of marketed products driving top tier sustainable growth. Now I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my review of our 2024 financial results, focusing on our Q4 performance. I will follow up with the introduction of our non-GAAP financial guidance for 2025 and some important considerations to help you better understand our financial outlook for this year. Our performance in 2024 is marked by focused execution on driving top-line growth, generating strong cash flow, and managing our cost structure. We have entered 2025 with a stronger foundation to deliver on our long-term growth strategy. Starting with Slide 11, sales in the Q4 grew 9% to approximately $12.3 billion, driven by volume growth\nacross the portfolio and higher inventory levels in the market. Our growth portfolio delivered another strong quarter with sales up 23% and represented slightly more than half of our revenue. Key brands like Reblozyl, Breyanzi, Camzyos, and Opdualag all achieved significant growth within the legacy portfolio. Higher sales of Eliquis were offset by the expected impact of increased generic volumes across several other brands including Revlimid, Abraxane, Sprycel, and Pomalyst. Overall, our performance in the Q4 capped off a very good year for our company, making progress in building a foundation for long-term sustainable growth.\nTurning to Product Performance on Slide 12. Starting with Oncology, Opdivo delivered solid growth in the Q4 primarily due to higher volume. In 2025. We are focused on conversion and educating the US market on the benefits of Opdivo Subcutaneous, and we expect low single-digit growth for this product and Opdivo. Taken together with Opdualag, we delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven by demand in the US, where it remains a standard of care in first-line melanoma. Ex-US sales benefited from uptake in newly launched markets. Moving to cardiovascular on slide 13, Eliquis delivered over $3 billion in fourth-quarter sales.\nUS sales grew 19%, benefiting primarily from continued strong demand and the typical inventory build. Importantly, as you think about the impact to Eliquis from Medicare Part D redesign, Q1 US sales growth will be tempered sequentially due to the implementation of the 10% manufacturer responsibility in the initial coverage phase. The remaining quarters of 2025 should steadily increase, particularly in the second half of the year due to the elimination of the coverage gap. Turning to Camzyos, sales in the Q4 more than doubled, benefiting from higher demand and a large inventory build as a standard of care in obstructive HCM.\nCamzyos continued to show strong momentum as evidenced by the approximate 1,300 new patients added to commercial drug in the Q4. Additionally, we recently received a label update for Camzyos in Europe to ease the ECHO monitoring requirements in the maintenance setting for obstructive HCM. Importantly, we are pleased to announce today that we have a PDUFA date in April for a similar easing of the REMS ECHO monitoring requirements in the US. Let's turn to hematology on slide 14. Reblozyl delivered more than 70% growth, reflecting solid uptake across first- and second-line MDS-associated anemia patients.\nSales in the US benefited from demand and included one-time gross-to-net benefit. Outside the US, Reblozyl sales more than doubled, driven by demand across newly launched markets in Europe and a strong launch in Japan in cell therapy. Breyanzi's Q4 sales more than doubled, driven by its best-in-class profile and strong demand growth across all its approved indications. Now moving to Immunology on slide 15, global sales of SOTYKTU grew more than 30%. US sales benefited from higher demand, tempered by gross-to-net impacts from higher rebates associated with expanded access coverage. Starting in 2025, we further improved our access position with 80% of\ncovered lives having zero step edits, which will help us drive demand growth as a result of this improved access position. However, we expect additional headwinds from higher rebates, notably across the immunology franchise. Regarding SOTYKTU specifically, this will temper our reported sales in the first half of the year. Until demand volume can offset these impacts, I will wrap up reviewing our performance for the quarter on Slide 16 with Neuroscience and COBENFY. COBENFY Sales in the Q4 were approximately $10 million and represent roughly two months of sales and initial stocking, and we've seen strong prescription uptake during these early months of launch.\nFeedback from both patients and physicians has been favorable, highlighting the benefits of COBENFY's differentiated efficacy and safety profile. Let's now move to P&L on Slide 17. As expected, gross margin declined about 240 basis points in the Q4, driven primarily by product mix, excluding in-process R&D. Operating expenses increased approximately 8%, largely driven by R&D investments, partially offset by our ongoing cost savings program. Regarding our operating expenses, we made significant progress during 2024 against our $1.5 billion strategic productivity initiative.\nAs of the end of Q4, we realized approximately $1.1 billion in savings and expect the remaining $400 million to be realized in 2025. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 19.9% compared to 14.9% in the prior year, primarily driven by earnings mix. For the full year, excluding in-process R&D charges, our effective tax rate was 18%. Overall diluted earnings per share were $1.67 for Q4 and full year diluted earnings per share came in at $1.15. Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation, highlights on Slide 18, our financial position remains strong with approximately $11.2 billion in cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31st.\nWe generated strong cash flow from operations of approximately $4.4 billion in Q4. In terms of capital allocation, we continue to ensure we employ a strategic and balanced approach. Business development remains a priority, as does our plan to pay down debt. As of the end of 2024, we have repaid approximately $6 billion of the $10 billion of debt we committed to pay down relative to our 31 March 2024 balance. Our capital allocation priorities also include returning cash to shareholders through our commitment to the dividend. 2025 marks our 93rd consecutive year of dividend payments. On Slide 19, I'll provide more detail on our expanded Strategic productivity initiative that Chris\nmentioned earlier. Building on the work we did to capture cost savings last year, we identified additional opportunities to streamline operations, further leverage technology, and drive greater efficiency in our ways of working. As a result, we expanded the existing program to include approximately $2 billion of incremental run rate operating expense savings, with approximately $1 billion to be achieved in 2025 and the remainder by the end of 2027. Under this expanded initiative, savings will be driven by changes in organizational design and efforts to enhance operational efficiency, with each accounting for roughly 50% of the targeted savings.\nWithin organizational design, we will continue to optimize and streamline our workforce to better align with the future needs of the business. To further optimize resources and enhance productivity, we will drive operational efficiencies across multiple areas of the business. In contrast to the initial $1.5 billion cost savings program where savings were mainly reinvested, this expanded program will see the incremental $2 billion in savings drop to the bottom line. Overall, our focus is to become a leaner, more efficient company while investing behind our growth portfolio and promising areas of science. With that in mind, let me walk you through our non-GAAP 2025 guidance\non slide 20, starting with revenue. As Chris said earlier, we estimate revenue in 2025 to be approximately $45.5 billion, primarily reflecting the near-term impact of generics across multiple products and the continued strength of our growth portfolio. We expect an 18% to 20% decline in the legacy portfolio due to the stacking of LOEs and anticipated headwinds from foreign exchange of approximately $500 million. This will be partially offset by higher revenue and continued strong performance of our key growth brands. Now, continuing with our 2025 guidance for certain P&L line items, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 72%, which reflects the impact of product\nmix. Excluding in-process R&D, we expect total operating expenses to show a meaningful decline to approximately $16 billion driven by the expanded cost savings program I just mentioned. We anticipate our overall expenses to be more evenly phased throughout the year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 37% for 2025, we're expecting OIE income of approximately $30 million, and we expect to maintain our tax rate of approximately 18%. Considering these factors, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of approximately $6.55 to $6.85. Before closing, let me provide some insight regarding our expected quarterly\nprogression of revenue for 2025 as it relates to quarterly phasing. We expect the first quarter to be impacted by the typical inventory destocking we see each year following the build in Q4, as well as the additional gross to net pressures from Medicare Part D redesign, which will be accentuated within Eliquis. As I said earlier, we expect Eliquis revenue for the remaining quarters of 2025 to steadily increase, particularly in the second half. As a result of this, we expect the legacy portfolio to decline approximately 10% to 12 on a sequential basis reflecting these dynamics and continued generic impacts as previously communicated.\nHowever, on a total company basis, we expect the inventory and gross to net dynamics to normalize beginning in Q2, with second half revenues to be higher than the first half of the year. In closing, our strong performance in 2024 has strengthened our confidence in our ability to deliver long-term value for our patients and shareholders. We remain focused on executing our growth strategy and right-sizing our cost structure. We also look forward to multiple data catalysts which will accelerate over the next 24 months and will de-risk our pipeline and provide more certainty on the future shape of our company. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Chuck for Q&A.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks David and Chris for the prepared remarks. Allison, could we please poll for questions?\n\nOperator 2\n\nSure. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. At this time we will pause for a moment to assemble our roster. The first question today will come from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just two quick ones for me. First, on COBENFY, it seems like feedback and coverage dynamics are progressing well. Can you just elaborate on how you're thinking about the ramp of the drug from here as we balance, as you highlight, kind of entrenched physician prescribing habits against what seems like a relatively poor standard of care and pretty large unmet need in the space. I'm trying to get a sense of like the ramp, how you're thinking about it for 2025. And the second one is just on the cost program. Once you're done with this incremental $2 billion, should we think about additional cost opportunities as you go through that 2028 LOE cycle, or is this\ngoing to really put the company in, I guess, the right place as we think about the longer term model and longer term business? So basically kind of thinking about is the 27 run rate kind of a good way to think about this or is there another step down as we head into Eliquis and Opdivo? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, Chris. I'll have Adam take the first question, then I'll take the second. Adam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. So, with regards to COBENFY. You know, we're very pleased what we're seeing with COBENFY. With three months post-launch and the launch is really off to a strong start. We're now at approximately 1,000 TRXs per week and you know, we made very good progress achieving our access goals. So for Medicaid and Medicare we're tracking ahead of our expectations. We've achieved over 90% Medicaid access and over 80% Medicare access. Recall, those two payers represent over 80% of the covered lives in this category and as expected, the majority have one step edit post-generic.\nWe're also making very good progress with commercial payers. The feedback over the last several months has been very positive. There's been a lot of enthusiasm around the efficacy and safety profile. I'm also pleased with the number of trialists that we're seeing since launch, and we have an opportunity to further expand and increase adoption with the roughly 30,000 psychiatrists. So you know, as you say, this is the first new mechanism of action in decades in the treatment of schizophrenia. And so we're out with our team educating customers on COBENFY's differentiated profile, and we're breaking reflexive prescribing habits, and that's going to take some time.\nSo we would expect to see continued strong uptake through 2025, and as we said, you know, with a ramp in the back half of this year. But taken together, you know, we are really pleased with what we're seeing so far, and we plan to make this a very big product for the company over time.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Adam and Chris. With respect to the second part of your question on the cost program, let me say a few things. First, as you think about this cost program. Keep in mind that our focus as a company continues to be on investing for growth. That's investing in the products that we have today, investing in the pipeline, both the late stage pipeline as well as promising early areas of science. And maybe just give you two quick vignettes on that. We plan to initiate seven phase III programs starting this year on COBENFY, clearly illustrating that we'll continue to invest in our pipeline. And then Adam can speak to this. But we made significant upfront investments in commercial last year which\nexplains, we believe, part of the progress that we've made on products like Camzyos, Opdivo, and Breyanzi. So investing in growth is a priority for us and that's the top priority with respect to the cost programs. Just a bit of context. As we were executing on last year's program, we cataloged a number of opportunities for us to become a more agile company, to become more nimble and speedy in terms of how we operate. Given where we are on that program as well as where we are with respect to LOEs, we think it makes sense for us to capitalize on those\nopportunities now. So that's really driven the timing of this announcement, and we think it puts us in a good position going forward with respect to this, the follow up to that, which is, will there be additional cost cutting efforts there? I think we're always going to align the organization to the needs of the business. This is an extension of last year's program. It gives us more financial flexibility. That financial flexibility gives us strategic flexibility. But we're always going to be focused on ensuring that we've right sized the organization, we've got the right level of spend given where the business is.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Chris. Allison, can we go to our next question?\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Louisa Hector of Berenberg. Please go ahead.\n\nLouisa Hector\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nHello. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to check your assumption for Part D redesign, if you can quantify it in 2025. And then just an update on Cendakimab. I don't see it on the slides, but any update on the filing plans there? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question, Louisa. I'll have Adam take both of those questions.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Louisa. Good morning. As relates to Part D redesign, there are pushes and pulls. Overall, you know, we're going to see favorability with Eliquis due to the elimination of the coverage gap. And with that, you know, we're not going to see the historical dynamics with Eliquis where first half sales have been higher than the second half sales. In fact, you know, what we're going to see in Q1 is going to be the lowest quarter of sales for Eliquis. In fact, mid single digit sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 globally, and we'll see second half sales be higher than first half sales. But for the full year, we expect strong year on year growth for Eliquis.\nSo when you look at products like Revlimid, Pomalyst, Orencia, and Camzyos, for example, that's going to offset the Eliquis favorability as we see increasing growth to net pressures starting in Q1 as patients enter the catastrophic phase. As you know, we're responsible for 20% in the catastrophic phase and 10% in the initial coverage phase. As we've said previously, you know, we project this to be roughly net neutral across our portfolio this year. As it relates to Cendakimab, given the data that we have seen, we've made the decision not to commercialize Cendakimab and we're going to continue to prioritize investments and opportunities where we have a competitive advantage. We can deliver the highest return for the company in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to deliver potentially transformational outcomes for patients.\nWe made a similar decision late last year with Zeposia in UC as we saw the unsuccessful trial in Crohn's disease. Based on our competitive position with Zeposia IBD, we made that decision as well.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nRight. Thanks Adam. Next question please. Allison,\n\nOperator 2\n\nthe next question will come from Jeff Mecham of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Senior Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat morning guys. Thanks so much for the question. I had another one on COBENFY. I know. Chris, you highlighted the expansion opportunities on slide six. I guess, are there others that you could add or accelerate, you know, beyond what you have? I guess the main question is, since the Imraclidine failure, are there changes to the investment plan that you're contemplating? And then on the policy front, want to get your perspective on RFK Jr.'s nomination. Our confirmation looks, I think, fairly imminent. What are the potential puts and takes on IRA revisions? Obviously, been a lot of chatter on. What discounting could look like in the outer years. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSure. I'll take the first part of that question and then turn it over to Samit and Adam and then come back and talk about the policy bit. Just let me give you a top line on COBENFY . Obviously the competitive dynamics and changes on the competitive front have an impact at the short term on that product. We have always been focused on delivering that product as quickly as possible to patients. However, we do believe that those competitive dynamics provides a more significant long term opportunity for us. And so we have put a full court press on ensuring that we do everything we can to capitalize on that opportunity in the long term.\nAnd that includes accelerating programs where possible. So maybe Samit and Adam want to comment?\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, absolutely true what Chris just said. Because if you think about the dual muscarinic agonism mechanism of action that the drug carries, it opens up the door for investigating and exploring many of the dementia-associated psychosis and agitation disorders. So we will continue to explore where the drug could be applied, where additional indications could be added, and how we can accelerate the development of this molecule and as well as continue to look into our pipeline, what other molecules we can bring forward in the neuropsychiatric space to be able to manage the unmet medical need that exists for these patients at this time.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nI'll just add Samit, our focus has been on ensuring a successful launch where generic atypical have about 80% market share and COBENFY has significant safety and efficacy advantage there. As Samit just mentioned, we see the unique efficacy advantages around the three domains of schizophrenia hitting on positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognition due to its unique mechanism. So we didn't expect competition from other muscarinics in schizophrenia until late 2026, early 2027, and the failure of Imraclidine. We have a clear path forward in\nschizophrenia and we're excited about the opportunity with COBENFY and we believe that we're going to drive meaningful growth for COBENFY really into the middle of the next decade.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nOn the policy front, maybe just a few things. First, as a company, as you well know, we have a long history of working across both sides of the aisle. We actually look forward to working with the new Congress as well as President Trump's administration, including nominees like RFK Jr. Once those nominees obviously are confirmed, our focus as a company is going to continue to be on policies that strengthen the ecosystem for innovation, that make sure that we're ensuring to address the needs of patients and our employees. Also, I would add ensuring that the FDA has what it needs to fulfill its mission.\nAnd so that's going to be our focus as a company. With respect to IRA specifically, I do think there's an opportunity for us to address in the coming administration some of the challenges. As one of the first companies to go through the IRA price setting process, we've been very clear on concerns that we have with that law and we see the need to have a number of fixes that will avoid some of the more damaging aspects of the law and some of the more perverse incentives. I would highlight addressing the pill penalty and addressing the spillover impact as two of the most important areas that we'll be focused on.\nOf course there are other policy priorities. In general we look forward to working with this administration and we think we've got some opportunities to do so.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chris. Next question please. Allison.\n\nOperator 2\n\nThe next question will come from Chris Shibutani of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. I'm struck by the ability to do several things at the same time while. Trying to realign your costs and integrate these businesses. There have been several advancements of timelines in terms of data readouts, and there's. Also been an absence of slippage across. Integrating aspects of the pipeline that are very important. What are the keys, in your opinion, to being able to deliver on this progress? And in particular the advancement of timelines.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nMaybe I'll start and then turn it over to Samit. I think Chris, you correctly pointed out there are a lot of moving parts. But I would say one of the reasons that we've been fixated on operational excellence becoming a more nimble and focused organization is making sure that we're staying absolutely focused on those things that are going to drive value to the company and value to shareholders. And so one of those things has been a very laser-like focus on R and D productivity. The work that we've done in that regard has enabled us to accelerate a number of programs that are going to add value for the company.\nIn fact, one of the reasons we have this wave of catalysts that are coming forward over the next 24 months is that we have been focused on ensuring we hit the timelines that we set internally and where possible, accelerate. Samit's team's done a nice job of helping us do that. So, Samit's team, do you want to comment on specifics?\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you for the question, Chris. As Chris just said, the laser focus is the start. But then again, following the principles we laid out a few years back, in fact, between Robert and myself, from the research and discovery perspective, the causal biology to discover the drugs, matching the modality to the mechanisms, and then picking the right diseases, and then after that accelerating that proof of concept generation. But then if you look at the late development, we broke down the process into multiple pieces and dig deeper into where we were doing well, whereas where are the spaces where we had the opportunity to shorten the timelines, and there we\nidentified several opportunities, and then we started to dig deeper into it. The other thing we did last year is also prioritized our portfolio and made certain decisions what we will pursue versus what we will not pursue. Some assets, some trials were stopped, and then we started focusing on where the most amount of scientific rigor was there to be able to achieve the proof of concept. And once that was achieved, how do we then accelerate that into generation of the data to bring the drug to the patients and to commercialization? All of that has helped, and the examples that are right in front of you.\nLast year we were able to accelerate and deliver the psoriatic arthritis data. Early this year we'll be able to give Camzyos data. Early this year we'll be able to bring in ADEPT. Now we are working on the next trial as well, as we think about multiple myeloma, LPA1, and IPF as well as SLE trials for SOTYKTU. Of course that mindset will go in all of these seven trials that we've talked about for COBENFY as well. Overall, very pleased with the progress we've made, but we have a little bit more distance to go and we'll continue to focus on our portfolio to deliver that.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAnd just to put a finer point on what Samit said, Chris, we have the potential for 15 or more registrational trials that will read out by the end of next year. And so the work that Samit's team is doing to ensure that those are delivered, delivered on time is, we think, critical. And we've made good progress in 2024. And as Samit said, we're heads down continuing to execute on that.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat, thank you. Let's move to the next question please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nThe next question will come from Tim Anderson of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much. I have a couple questions. So the revenue guidance for 2025 is about $1 billion less than consensus. In as much as you've looked at consensus, where are you seeing the biggest differences? Could COBENFY be one of those contributors of the delta? And then a longer term question on earnings. In the past, Chris, you've suggested trough earnings would really be in the very late 2020s. And to me it felt like maybe 2028, 2029. Is that still the right way to think about it? And could a product like COBENFY or some of these other programs possibly pull that forward?\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, Tim. Maybe I'll start and then turn it. Over to David for the first part. On your question, then I'll come back for the second part. Look, with respect to how we thought about guidance and the outlook for this year, I think you as well as I think everybody knows the LOE exposure that we have as a company, as expected this year, we're seeing the increased step down on Revlimid as well as the stacking of full-year impacts products like Pomalyst, which lost exclusivity in Europe as well as in the US pricing on Abraxane. Our guidance reflects that. But keep in mind those are short-term impacts in the long-term, which is what we're focused on.\nWe feel good about the progression that we're making on the new product portfolio. And then, as we discussed just in the last question, we have an exciting set of assets that are going to be reading out that will frame out what the company looks like in the back part of the decade. And then maybe I'll ask David to fill in some of the specifics on. The LOE's.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah Tim, thank you for the question. Just as a reminder, your Bloomberg's for the total company sitting around 46 to 47. We're guiding approximately 45.5 if you remember in my prepared remarks. I said there's a headwind of currency which we don't believe has been built in, which is around $500 million. So as we look at where we are versus consensus from a revenue perspective, we're broadly in line with where it is. Any minor differences is really as we keep, you know, highlighting is around the legacy portfolio in particular Revlimid coming down to two two and a half but as well as the other generic impacts that we mentioned on the call.\nBut overall we feel pretty good where we are versus consensus.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nWith respect to the trough question first, I think the way you're thinking about the trough in general is the right way to think about it. As we've said before, we're not going to be giving long-term guidance as a standard course. This reflects the philosophy that we have that we're going to guide to what we and you can hold us accountable for. But what we've also been very clear on is that our focus continues to be on driving top-tier growth exiting this decade, and specifically that means increasing the velocity of growth that we have in the last couple of years exiting this decade and into the next.\nSo as it relates to trough, we're working to do everything we can to change the timing, the depth, and duration of that. And how we do that is to continue to do more of what we frankly did last year, drive growth, brand performance, accelerate the pipeline so that we de-risk some of these future catalysts as quickly as possible, use our capital to accelerate growth. Frankly, that's what we did when we acquired Karuna to bring a product like COBENFY into the portfolio. And in fact, as a result of that and what we see as the long-term potential, we believe we've accelerated the velocity of growth as we exit this decade.\nSo we're going to continue to be focused on finding ways to use capital to continue to accelerate the growth profile, and we're going to become more nimble as a company so we can move quickly to capitalize on those. That's what we're focused on and that's what we're going to be transparent about our performance against on these calls.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thank you, Chris Allison. Let's move to the next question.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question will come from Mohit Bansal of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nSenior Biotech and Pharmaceutical Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. My question is regarding Eliquis. So I mean there was some thought about Eliquis getting some tailwind because of Part D redesign. Given that there is no donut hole now and maybe there is like given the price point, the impact of Part D design may not be a lot. So in the context of that, how are you thinking about the growth for this brand for this year? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question, Mohit. Adam, you want to take that?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Mohit, thanks for the question. As I mentioned, we're going to see favorability with Eliquis this year in the US due to Part D redesign with the elimination of the coverage gap. And so I talked about the dynamics historically where the first half sales were higher than the second half sales. So we're going to see something very different this year where Q1 sales will be the lowest quarter for Eliquis, and we'll see higher sales in the second half of the year. For the year, we expect strong double-digit growth for Eliquis overall, and we look at where we are positioned in the market. In the US, we have a market share that continues to grow linearly.\nOur share in the US NBRX is roughly 75% and we know that with Xarelto out of the market, we've got a great opportunity to continue to drive this important brand to the company.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nRight. Thanks Adam, next question please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Trang Han of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrang Han\n\nEquity Analyst, UBS\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just two please. So firstly, can you just give us some color on the gross margin cadence for 2025? You touched upon Q1 dynamics but should we just follow the Revlimid step downs for the year? Is there any other considerations that we should think about here, and then just wondering if you can give us any early insights into the access and coverage of Opdivo Qvantig and any thoughts on the uptake for 25? Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question. Strong. David, you want to take the first one? Then Adam, you can come in on the second.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nNo, as you said, you know the step down will be mainly driven by Revlimid and Pomalyst volumes coming through with those gross margins being slightly higher than the average. And the only other consideration obviously is Eliquis. And I think as. You know Adam had covered; typically Eliquis is larger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. This year that's going to be inverted in that our lowest quarter for Eliquis would be the first quarter, but our sales will be higher in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. So that would be the other consideration as you think through the gross margin of the company in total.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYes. So as it relates to Opdivo Qvantig, these are very early days. The team's out in the field educating healthcare practitioners on the benefits of subQ versus IV. As we said previously, we believe physicians will convert at least 30 to 40% of the IV business ahead of our LOE in late 2028, which will extend the franchise into the 2030s. We have seen so far some very positive feedback early on, especially around usage in adjuvant patients, patients who are treated in combination with Yervoy like in first-line metastatic melanoma, first-line RCC. The feedback specifically has been positive regarding the three to five minute infusion time taking off that treatment burden for both physicians\nand for patients. We've also seen a number of NCCN guidelines updated, for your reimbursement question, to include Opdivo Qvantig within just a few weeks after approval. I think the most common question that we're getting is around the reimbursement dynamics here, and we've said conversion from IV to subQ in the first half of the year is going to take some time, mainly due to a temporary J-code which is routine for any new product in this category. Conversion will accelerate in the second half of the year once we transition to a permanent J-code on 1st July. And so we're excited about the launch and what this means for patients, physicians, and importantly the durability of our\nIO franchise.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thank you, Adam. Let's go to our next question, please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question one on BD. More specifically, now that we're on this side of the muscarinics debate with COBENFY approved and Imraclidine not showing efficacy, can you walk us through kind of your process in determining why you went for Karuna when you wanted to get into schizophrenia? And on kind of a more mechanistic perspective, what's happening with Camzyos? We saw a nice step up. What are you seeing in the field that's driving the uptake there? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the questions, Evan. I'll start and then turn it over to Adam. There's no magic bullet with respect to how you approach business development from our standpoint, but I think there were a few things that we did well with the Karuna acquisition that will frame how we continue to do business development. First, I would note that the senior leadership team of the company owned the decision to move forward with that acquisition. Capital allocation is critically important. As we've discussed, business development is a top priority for us as a company. It's important as we navigate the back part of this decade.\nWhen you're allocating investor capital at that scale, it's critical that senior leaders take ownership and accountability for it. So we did that. Second, we were very disciplined in the approach. It started with making sure that we really like the science. We considered multiple options and we zeroed in on the science that was coming out of Karuna as compelling in our view. And beyond that, we felt strongly that this had an opportunity to strengthen our therapeutic areas as well as to give us opportunities to accelerate growth in the back part of the decade. And of course we were very disciplined on the financials.\nWe needed to make sure that we could put a compelling case together that it would add value to the company and ultimately to shareholders. You actually saw how we executed against that post the decision to acquire, in that we spent a lot of time with the heritage Karuna team to fully develop this asset in ways that they were unable to do so. And we think that's important in terms of how we think about the long-term opportunity. And maybe the last lesson learned that I'd highlighted is we moved very quickly. And so those lessons, I think, will frame out how we continue to do business development at the company. And then. Adam, do you want to take the second question?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb",
    "content2": "Yeah, Evan, regarding Camzyos. We've seen strong, steady, and consistent growth from Camzyos. As you heard from David's opening remarks. Year-end 2024, there were approximately 12,000 patients in the hub and roughly 9,500 patients on commercial drug. So we've established a strong revenue base and we expect continued growth from the expansion of our prescriber base. We're seeing high persistency and duration of therapy, and we're continuing to add new patients each and every week. So our focus is now on increasing depth of prescribing in the larger COEs while at the same time increasing breadth in some of the smaller institutions and larger community\nbackground. And we're making some good progress there. We also have a couple things David mentioned. One, we look forward to the PDUFA date that's coming in April. So similar to what we've seen in Europe, our goal is to ease the burden of ECHO requirements for patients and physicians. And we expect that to open up additional capacity at the COEs and as a result, physicians will be able to treat more patients. And as you're also aware, we have a data readout in non-obstructive HCM and we're looking forward to seeing the Odyssey data in Q2 and that will expand the eligible patient population by about 30% or so.\nAnd so that's going to allow Camzyos to have a nice first mover advantage in both indications and across the full spectrum of patients with symptomatic HCM.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat.Thank you. Adam, let's take our next question, please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Akash Tiwari of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nAkash Tiwari\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey. Hey. Thanks so much. So what's the risk around the adjunct schizophrenia trial for COBENFY? Because we haven't seen a lot of companies run that specific trial, and if they have, they've often failed. So why wouldn't the probability of success? For this trial be more like a. 50, 50 coin flip? On the Camzyos label update, are you aiming for six-month echo monitoring requirements, and if so, how do you think that will help expand access into the community setting? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question. Samit and Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSure. Thank you for the question. On the adjunctive schizophrenia. I remember where we started off and how patients are treated in the real world. So we obviously have developed the drug as a monotherapy, but these patients were primarily before they got onto the trial were receiving the D2 agonist and thereafter there was a washout period. Patients came on the drug and then of course the trial evaluated the primary endpoint and in EMERGENT-1, 2, and 3 at the shorter window. But remember, EMERGENT-4 and 5 have now read out with a 52-week follow-up.\nMany of those patients obviously are also taking concomitant medications in the background and we've seen that efficacy continue to be maintained as we look towards the 52-week data point as well. So overall from that perspective, we are confident on the overall safety profile that is emerging on that. And then of course from a blinded data perspective, the study has continued at this point. So now we are only a few months away from the readout for that trial. And of course on top of that we'll look at ADEPT trials also reading out beginning at the back end of this year. Coming to Camzyos.\nJust a point that I would like to make is it is very important that we continue to decrease the burden on the sites, on the patients, and the treating physicians. And from that perspective it was important. The data that we've collected from the real world as well as from the clinical trial suggests that the overall safety profile of Camzyos is maintained. Many of the patients are treated actually at the lowest doses of 2.5mg and 5mg. Considering all of that data is where we approach the health authorities. You've already seen the action taken in Europe, and now looking forward to the\nApril action as we think about the maintenance for these patients with the longer duration in between echoes as we look to the US reviews as well. Adam, if you want to add anything.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nJust adding just one bit, again pointing you to the European label. The label was updated late last year to reduce the frequency of echo monitoring for patients taking Camzyos from every 12 weeks to once every six months when patients are in the maintenance phase. So that's after week 12. And what we would expect is not so much in the community, but this will open up additional capacity at the centers of excellence, and as a result physicians will be able to treat more patients.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you both. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. David, I just wanted to clarify on the new productivity initiative, should we think? About the run rate for year end 2027 as being $15 billion, so an incremental $1 billion off of the $16 now? Just wanted to. Sure I understood it correctly. And then on Iberdomide, the addition of the MRD endpoint, did FDA sign off? On that and if so, are you? Able to get approval on just an. MRD endpoint, or do you need follow? Updated data from the PFS and anything you can say about what kind of. Efficacy delta you'd need on MRD. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Terence. David, then Samit.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Yes, you have that right. So we said an incremental $2 billion program. All that dropping to the bottom line, we said $1 billion of that would drop this year with operating expenses of $16 billion. The further $1 billion achieved by 2027 would get you to operating expenses of $15 billion.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nIn terms of thinking about Iberdomide, of course quite excited that based on the discussions that you probably followed from the ODAC setting perspective, MRD as an endpoint is more and more becoming important because in multiple myeloma there are multiple lines of therapies that are available, but still no cure available for patients with multiple myeloma. So it is important that we continue to figure out how to accelerate the process of drug development. That's why newer endpoints are needed. So of course, we've discussed with the FDA the ability to include MRD as one of the primary endpoints in the clinical trial, and we'll certainly be reading that out most likely in\nthis year. Now, everything in the regulatory world will be dependent on the risk-benefit ratio and the overall magnitude that we'll observe at the end of the day. So when the data is available, that's when we will engage with the regulators in terms of how they will see that data and what else they would need. Remember, we have not taken out PFS as the second primary endpoint within the trial as well. So of course the patients will be followed for PFS and as well as the secondary endpoints, which is overall survival as well. So we are going to collect maximal data from the clinical trial and engage the authorities based on the magnitude and the timing of the readout.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Samit. The only thing, Terence, I would add, and David got it right with respect to how the cost savings will flow, is to, as I said earlier on this call, keep in mind that as we think about the overall cost structure, as we see compelling opportunities for growth that exist, we're going to make sure that we continue to invest in those. So just keep that in mind as framing all of this discussion around cost.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nRight. Thank you. Let's move to our next question, please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question will come from Courtney Breen of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nThanks so much for taking my call today. My question today, Nicole, two parts. I think you spoke a little bit about business development in an answer before and referenced it as the top priority from a capital allocation perspective. Can you just talk a little bit about the alignment, kind of what good looks like, particularly in the context of the organization you have right now. I think last year was a little bit of digesting the deals that you'd done quickly and so wanting to understand kind of how you're thinking about that appetite now and over the course of the year. And then the second was just around kind of COBENFY and specifically kind of gross-to-net evolution as we're\nthinking about this access evolving from kind of initial private payment to more of the government setting to then adding on a little bit of the commercial environment. That would be really helpful to understand how you're expecting that to flow. Thank you\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nBoth. Good questions. I'll start and then turn it over to Adam. As we said earlier and as you reiterated, business development is a top priority for us. Think about that both in terms of partnerships and, where it makes sense, acquisitions, and the way we think about therapeutic areas is that we're really focused on strengthening our position in the core therapeutic areas that we have today. And that we can do by bringing promising areas of science into the company as well as looking for assets that can improve the growth profile of the company. And I think you saw shortly after I became CEO in 2023, we did both of those things.\nWhat's important and the way we think about it is that we need to like the science and feel that we're the rightful owners of it. The financials have to make sense. Again, we've included in that thinking. Strengthening the growth profile is a key factor we're considering. We have to believe that we can drive value for the company and ultimately for shareholders. As we look across the core therapeutic areas that we have today, we see opportunities to strengthen our position in those therapeutic areas. The nice thing is that we're in a very strong financial position. As I said earlier, that financial strength and flexibility gives us strategic flexibility, and that flexibility includes doing\nbusiness development where it makes sense.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chris. [crosstalk]\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nOh, wait, yeah, I'll just answer the question around Gross-to-net. Courtney, thanks for the question. As it relates to gross-to-net, the brand is going to continue to lean heavily towards the public sector, Medicare, and Medicaid. And you think about the evolution of schizophrenia and schizophrenia indications or our Alzheimer's indications, whether it be Alzheimer's disease, psychosis, or Alzheimer's cognition, these are patients who are going to be in Medicare or Medicaid. Commercial patients are less than 10%. You will see that more commonly in some of the indications, such as autism and in bipolar disorder.\nBut the majority of the brand will largely be in the public sector where there are Medicaid best price.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Let's move to the next question, please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nOh, great. Thanks for the question. So, just quickly on COBENFY, I was hoping you could talk about the patient experience that you're seeing so far in the field. You know, we know that patients certainly feel better cognitively, but there are questions around the tolerability and the bid dosing. So just interested to know if there's any early signs of, you know, sort of the durability and how you're managing the GI profile. That's been talked about a bit by some thought leaders in that regard. And then the second question is, just as we think about the overall kind of multiple myeloma opportunity, just hoping to get a sense of where you think novel oral drugs like iberdomide or\nmezigdomide could appropriately fit within the context of the overall multiple myeloma market, you know, given the availability of generic Revlimid and Pomalyst. Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Seamus. Adam. And then maybe Samit, you can chime in as well.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Seamus, thanks for the questions. We've been really pleased with what we're hearing from both physicians and patients. The feedback has been very positive with a lot of enthusiasm on the efficacy and the safety profile. So what we're hearing is, you know, patients are seeing improvement in positive symptoms as early as the first week of treatment and on really the lowest dose, 50mg. And we're also hearing good successes on negative symptoms. And you know what we were really excited about this asset for improvement in clarity of thought, improvement of cognition, patients being able to reengage with their families, and even start thinking about going back to work.\nThe AEs, what we've heard from physicians, they're manageable, including the nausea and vomiting, because what we're seeing is the majority of physicians in the real world are treating patients at the lowest dose. They're starting with 50 mg. They're taking a week or two before they titrate up to the next dose at 100 mg, unlike what you saw in the clinical trials, which moved to 125 mg within the first eight days of the trial. So that has been incredibly positively received. And so we're not hearing a lot of the GI tolerability issues from physicians, but our teams are out there making sure that we're educating on what to expect as it relates to bid.\nWe know that on average, patients are on seven pills per day. And so we're not hearing this as a major objection to prescribing. Last thing I'll mention is we got an ongoing study looking at taking COBENFYwith food that will read out this year. So that will also improve the ease of prescribing for physicians and make it easier for patients as well.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSo I'll just take it off from there. And one thing that I would just add on COBENFY. So prior to COBENFY, what drugs were doing was treating the symptoms of schizophrenia, meaning the positive symptoms, primarily with COBENFY. Now we are treating schizophrenia, meaning also impacting the negative symptoms, and we are seeing the impact on cognition. As we have recently published the data on multiple myeloma. Switching gears, it's important to understand where the patients are treated and what the drugs are available. If you think about the cell therapies and the T cell engagers or bispecifics.\nThey are to be primarily used in the academic settings, whereas most of the patients with multiple myeloma, especially with the relapsed refractory disease, are being treated in the community setting where it is very difficult to get these therapies with the side effect management and the REMS program that go along with it. And that's where it is very important to continue to develop small molecules which are easy to deliver and can be combined with the standard of care therapies. And that's exactly where Iberdomide and mezigdomide sit. And you know, mezigdomide is being compared head to head versus pomalidomide. And that's how you replace pomalidomide.\nAnd then of course, there's another trial looking head to head, Iberdomide versus Revlimid, which certainly will read out later. But it is a very important component of the overall development plan.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks, Samit. Next question please. Allison.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question will come from David Risinger of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much and congrats on all the updates. Sorry, I have another call coming in here, so my apologies. They want me on the box to speak. So I have two questions. First, with respect to the performance in 2025, so obviously the worse that the LOEs perform in 2025, the better the setup for the trajectory of growth for the company in 2026. But if the loss of exclusivity products. Perform better than expected, then it makes it a little bit tougher to grow in 2026. Could you just discuss that a little bit and provide some initial context for 2026? I know that you're not providing guidance at this time.\nAnd then second, just with respect to. Yervoy, it's been performing very strongly, growing 20%, you know, roughly in Q4 and roughly 20% for full year 2025, sorry, 2024. Can you comment on gross growth prospects for Opdivo going forward as well? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, David. David Elkins and then Adam.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, so just on your question around 2025 and what to think about heading into 2026 first, you know, Revlimid, as we said, we have additional generic entry coming. So about 70% of the market will be supplied by generics, remember, for Revlimid, full generic entry in January of 2026. So we'll be through that by the end of the year. And we have generic entry of Pomalyst next year as well. And the only other headwind that I would mention is we provided that guidance on IRA, which really took out the worst case scenario for Eliquis as we head into the IRA in 2026 and 2027. But really our focus remains on investing in the growth drivers.\nYou saw the strong execution in that growth portfolio that's now greater than 50% of our business. We actually double digit growth last year. We feel really good about the position that we're in this year. Then as you think about going into 2026 with that growth portfolio, you heard Adam talk about the additional indications in Camzyos and SOTYKTU as well as Reblozyl, and you know we got some really important data readouts that we're going to be able to add up to six new NMEs here over the next two years. So that growth portfolio is really coming together. We're adding to that, and then you've heard all the commentary around COBENFY further adding to that growth portfolio.\nSo there's pushes and pulls there, but what's becoming clear is the strength of the growth profile as we go into the second half of the decade here.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAs it relates to Yervoy, we're seeing solid demand growth across our core indications, first-line lung, first-line RCC, as well as first-line melanoma where Yervoy is used in combination. And that growth is coming both from the US and from our international markets. In the US, we continue to see good adoption in the community, and as you know, last year we presented. I think it's remarkable 10-year long-term data in first-line melanoma. I think the last thing I'd say is we're also preparing for launches this year in first-line HCC and first-line MSI high CRC, both in combination with Opdivo, which will help drive Yervoy performance.\nWe also have the Opdivo Yervoy lung approval that's pending in China. So taken together, we would expect continued growth from Yervoy in 2025.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Adam. Let's take our next question please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Matt Phipps of William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Phipps\n\nGroup Head of Biotechnology, William Blair\n\nThanks for taking my questions. You know, following up on the MRD primary endpoint for the Iberdomide trial, is there a time course that the FDA wants as far as how much durability on that MRD and why not add MRD endpoints to the Mezigdomide trials? It does look like you already have MRD on the Arcellx QUINTESSENTt-2 and then similarly in multiple myeloma is there a point at which Abecma what is kind of the profitability breakpoint for Abecma and does success of Arcellx really kind of negate the need for Abecma? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Matt. Samit, and Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSure. Thank you, Matt, for the question. So for multiple myeloma, look, MRD endpoint is something that is new from the perspective of using as a registration trial endpoint. And that's why we have to continue to follow the patients and provide the durability in terms of not only MRD but also overall response rate, CR rate that we will see. And these will be the points of discussion with the FDA as we get into those time points once the magnitude is known for this endpoint as well as the events occur in the Iberdomide trial. In terms of how we are thinking about use of this\nparticular endpoint for other trials, we are continuing to evaluate the potential to leverage an earlier MRD endpoint readout to accelerate the development of our multiple myeloma assets across the board. But it will all depend on the timing, the population, as well as how the event accrual is occurring. Successive studies target a little bit more of a difficult to treat patient population. So we'll see how the event occurrence happens, and that may become as one of the studies that we may consider an endpoint as well in the future, but not at this time.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAs it relates to Abecma, we know multiple myeloma is going to remain a very crowded and competitive space, and there are multiple treatment options available. We remain committed to Abecma, but we're going to see continued competitive intensity and competitive pressures. So our focus is making sure that we're optimizing the value of Abecma, and we're going to remain competitive in the space. As you heard earlier from Chris and David, we're very excited also about GPRC5D, which we believe is going to play a critically important role in the treatment of post-BCMA CAR T with a single infusion and an improved safety profile.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Allison, let's take our next question please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Steve Scala of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. I have two questions. First, Bristol's second generation TYK2 completed phase II in psoriasis in August 2024 but hasn't progressed. So curious what the profile of this agent is. What are plans and is IBD within those plans? And secondly, Milvexian phase III readouts in stroke and ACS are expected in 2026, but later in the year. Curious if events are tracking for that 2026 readout and is there any possibility at all for a 2025 readout for either trial? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Steve. Samit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Steve, for both the questions. So first of all, for the backup TYK2, we completed those studies, we have the data. But as you know, we are continuing to progress our overall plans for TYK2 at this time. And as we spoke earlier, we have to decide within our pipeline where we are going to really focus and prioritize. And at the current time, our focus is truly squarely on SOTYKTU and maximizing that opportunity from a development and commercial perspective. So at this time, that TYK2 is not in development, as you already have stated from the SSP and ACS readout; events are tracking as well as the enrollment is going really well. We do not expect that readout in 2020.\nWe expect that readout, as we have stated, at the back end of 2026.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Samit. Next question please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Kripa Devarakonda of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nSenior Biotech Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. I have a Camzyos question. You know, congrats on getting the label update in EU. I was wondering would the label change in EU and potentially a change in the US as well. How do you see the peak opportunity now and with Odyssey data upcoming this year, can you help set expectations for the readout and then if I can. Squeeze one in forCOBENFY. One of the docs we recently spoke to said that there was an issue with drug availability at average pharmacies, is what he said. I was wondering if this is just a one-off or just does it just take time to ramp up availability? Thank you.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYep. So I can certainly take the Oscar, but thank you. So as it relates to the label for Camzyos, you know, as I said, we expect to have a PDUFA date in April of this year, and our goal is to continue to ease the burden of the ECHO requirements for both patients and physicians, and this could open up additional capacity at the COEs. You know what we are seeing for Camzyos, which is consistent and steady growth. We have a very large revenue base that's building, and we continue to expect growth from the expansion of prescribers and high persistency. Patients are staying on treatment for very long time because that they're feeling better, and so that's going to help with the\nduration of therapy, and we're focused on continuing to add new patients each and every week as it relates to the Odyssey readout. Maybe Samit, if you want to talk a little bit about it. But just as I mentioned, we're looking forward to seeing top line data in Q2. This is going to add, if positive, around 1/3 of patients in HCM and have an opportunity to build upon the success of Camzyos with a strong first mover advantage across both indications. And we're certainly looking forward to that data readout. And so I'll turn it to Samit to talk a little bit more about nHCM and then I'll quickly answer your COBENFY question.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, I'll address the Odyssey question very quickly. The paper from methodology perspective as well as the baseline characteristics of the patients were just published in JACC Heart Failure. So you can certainly pick it up from there. And the primary endpoints of KCCQ and pVO2 are well described as well as what the statistical methodology is. So of course we're looking forward to the readout. And it's just I think in the next quarter we'll be able to see the results and then we'll share them with you.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, just really quickly on that. You know, we're not hearing that our teams are out both with physicians, but they're also at the pharmacies as well. So you know, I do think that is potentially a one off and we want to make sure that the COBENFY is available broadly across the US so patients can get access to this really important product.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Adam. Let's go to our next question please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Olivia Brayer of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Brayer\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you. For the question, what data did you submit to the FDA for the less restrictive Camzyos REMS? Did that include anything additional versus what was submitted to EMA? And are you asking the agency for the same two updates that were proposed in the December agenda? I think those are around monitoring frequency and the use of LVOT gradient. And then Adam, I just wanted to clarify one point you made earlier. You said the European label was updated to reduce frequency, I think you said from every 12 weeks to once every six months. Just wanted to clarify that I heard that correctly.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Samit and Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nMaybe I can start off. Thanks for the question, Olivia. We will not be able to give you the specifics at this time in terms of the asks of the FDA. Certainly, there are several of them, and then we'll see which ones we are able to have a conversation and get from a relief for the patient perspective. And in terms of the data that were submitted, they come from both clinical trials as well as from the real world evidence. So, overall, data package was very strong, and we continue to have the dialogue with the regulatory agencies.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, and Olivia, just to clarify again, the label in Europe was updated to reduce the frequency of echo monitoring for patients taking Camzyos post week 12. So after week 12, as patients move into the maintenance phase, instead of once a quarter, they're able to now have echoes once every six months.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Adam. Next question please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from James Shin of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you for the question. Guys. I just wanted to follow up on the RYZ question. What are BMY's expectations for the PANscore benefit and then any color on how ADEPT-2 will be disclosed. Will the NPIC be top-lined in the PR, and will this be followed by a full data set at medical congress? Thank you\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSamit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you for the questions. Let me start with the second one for ADEPT, as has been recently done and previously done at the top line, when it reads out, we will be putting out a press release but generally we do not disclose the data. Those will be presented at medical conference appropriately. And for ARISE again, the magnitude that we are going to be looking for is going to be the difference between the two arms rather than. And as well as we look, the difference that we observe from baseline to the time of readout. So both of those endpoints are going to be important, apart from, of course, the secondary endpoints.\nRight now we're not commenting on the overall magnitude, but here even small differences in terms of the points would be very, very important and clinically meaningful, as you know, in the neuropsychiatric space.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nRight.Thank you, Shaman. Next question, please.\n\nOperator 2\n\nOur next question will come from Sean McCutcheon of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nSean McCutcheon\n\nVice President in Biotechnology Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nHi guys. Thanks for the question. Can you speak to the expectations for? The cadence of data for the targeted radiotherapeutic portfolio and prioritization of further investment in BD and internal development following that investment in the infrastructure in that segment. Thanks.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nExecutive Vice President, CMO, and Head of Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYes, from the RayzeBio portfolio perspective, of course the phase III is already ongoing in GEP-NET and this is in the patient population that has already received prior Lutathera. So it's. And certainly the phase I data was very strong and we'll continue to look for not only the response rate but of course progression-free survival is going to be important to continue to observe in this one as we look to the readout in 2026. As you know, we are also exploring the activity of this drug in patients with small cell lung cancer in a phase I study and we recently started a breast cancer program as well.\nAnd from the portfolio perspective, we're looking forward to initiation of our phase I program for GPC3 as a new target. And then of course there's a pipeline behind it in the research space as well.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThe only thing I would add is that we continue to be looking for opportunities to enhance the acquisition of Rayze. We believe in this platform, and if it's appropriate and it makes sense for us both financially and scientifically, we would consider business development as well.\n\nChuck Triano\n\nSenior VP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. Operator. We'll take our last question and then we'll turn it to Chris for some closing remarks.\n\nOperator 2\n\nNext question will come from Alexandra Hammond of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Head of Therapeutics Research, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for squeezing me in. Just one on Bristol's long-term growth potential. The team has mentioned an underappreciation of the pipeline. Can you highlight the key assets you expect to drive revenue looking to the back end of the decade? Maybe your favorite child or two. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nWell, listen, I'll take that one. We feel great about the pipeline. We have a number of really exciting assets that are coming. We've spoken at length obviously about COBENFY, clearly. We also are very excited about our CELMoD programs. We have multiple CELMoDs. There's Iberdomide and mezigdomide that we've spoken about today, but we haven't spoken about golcadomide. That's a potentially very meaningful product in lymphoma. Milvexian is important. So it's very difficult to pick a favorite child here whenever there's such a wealth of opportunity in the late-stage pipeline.\nAnd we haven't even talked about the next wave of assets which includes some really exciting opportunities including products like CD19 next ARLDD in. Prostate cancer as well as others. And by the way, I forgot to mention in the first wave of assets, LPA1, which is also a very exciting opportunity. So a plethora of potential catalysts that will be playing out over the next 24 months, and we look forward to seeing them play out and going from there. So I think with that we'll close today's call. I appreciate everyone staying on. I know we went a bit long, but hopefully we were able to get to virtually all of the questions. Let's take a step back and maybe summarize where we are.\nOur priorities as a company, hopefully you've seen on this call, are clear. We're focused on continuing to deliver very strong commercial execution and to deliver on the upcoming pipeline catalyst, some of which we just discussed. We're going to continue to have the ability to enhance value creation through business development and all the while maintaining strong financial flexibility. As I look at 2024, we made very good progress, and I want to recognize our colleagues for all the hard work that they had last year. We continue to take decisive action to further right-size our cost structure and invest in future growth.\nWe believe these are important next steps in continuing to execute on the multi-year journey that we're on. And, of course, we remain committed to our overarching goal, which is to reshape BMS to deliver top-tier growth by the end of the decade and, most importantly, generate attractive returns for shareholders. So, thanks again for tuning in today, and as always, the team's available for follow-ups and have a good rest of the week.\n\nOperator 2\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. Thank you. You may now disconnect."

Please go ahead.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer, and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development. As you'll note, we've posted slides to BMS.com that you can use to follow along with Chris and David's remarks. Before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statement. During this call, we make statements about the Company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com, and with that I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nChair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Tim and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Starting on slide 4, our second quarter results reflect continued progress against our strategy to position BMS for long-term sustainable growth. In Q2, we continued to strengthen commercial performance with uptake accelerating across a number of our marketed products. Growth portfolio revenues increased 18% year-over-year or 21 excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This portfolio is on track to be a larger component of our overall mix. Moving forward, we also advanced our pipeline demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and the development of our first- or best-in-class assets. This includes US Regulatory approvals for Breyanzi, Camzyos, and Augtyro.\nWe also achieved a number of milestones this quarter for our IO franchise, including European approval in first line bladder cancer, presented data at ASCO in first line liver cancer, and are progressing to a more convenient subcutaneous formulation of Nivolumab where we now have a PDUFA date from the US FDA of 29 December. The EMA is also reviewing our Sub Q application. Before we get into more details around quarterly performance on Slide 5, I'd like to step back and take stock of where we are as a company and where we are headed. As discussed previously, we are focusing on reshaping BMS to achieve sustained top-tier growth and maximize long-term value. We're doing this by focusing on three key objectives. First, we are focusing our portfolio on transformational medicines where we have a competitive advantage.\nThis means advancing and, where possible, accelerating first- or best-in-class treatments across our therapeutic areas, prioritizing pipeline assets with meaningful growth potential, and discontinuing programs that no longer meet our threshold for return on investment. Through these actions, we are ensuring our R&D efforts are focused on programs where BMS has a right to win and where we can deliver compelling ROI to shareholders. Second, we are actively driving greater operational excellence throughout the organization. This includes streamlining our operations and focusing the organization on what matters most, becoming more efficient in how we operate, improving R&D productivity, and driving a culture that emphasizes speed and accountability. We're executing on our cost reduction efforts and are on track to achieve the $1.5 billion in cost savings we announced in Q1. Third, we are strategically allocating capital for long-term growth and returns.\nWe remain focused on ensuring we are investing behind our growth portfolio and most critical pipeline assets. Business development and partnerships remain important for us, and we continued to strengthen our balance sheet while maintaining our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. Taken together, these actions are ensuring we're focused on the highest value activities across the organization, tightening our execution where needed, and accelerating our ability to deliver important medicines to patients. On that note, turning to Slide 6, our objective of generating top tier growth requires us to deliver on the potential of our pipeline. In hematology, oncology, we're driving leadership by extending our IO business and broadening our focus to include cell therapies and protein degraders. We have also expanded into ADCs and radiopharmaceuticals. In cardiovascular, we are leveraging decades of expertise to deliver new treatment options in thrombosis, heart failure, and cardiomyopathies. In immunology.\nWe're focusing our R&D efforts on therapies that reset the immune system with a potentially transformational program in cell therapy. And finally, we are reestablishing our presence in neuroscience, starting with KarXT in neuropsychiatry, followed by an exciting pipeline in neurodegeneration which continues to advance nicely on Slide 7. Let me update you on our progress with KarXT. Specifically, we have two main objectives, preparing for the upcoming launch and executing against a robust clinical program to expand this important therapy into multiple indications. We are rapidly building out the necessary infrastructure ahead of KarXT's anticipated FDA approval in late September. We're excited about the commercial potential for this product. Adam can speak more about our launch prep in Q&A.\nAs previously discussed, we are also expanding KarXT to additional indications with data expected in adjunctive schizophrenia in 2025 and Alzheimer's disease psychosis in 2026. Our plans to start trials in both Alzheimer's agitation and bipolar disorder are on track. Finally, we have also initiated planning for two new indications for this product in autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's cognition. On slide 8, I want to highlight a few important pipeline milestones across our therapeutic areas this year. In Hematology Oncology, we're extending our IO franchise with Nivolumab sub Q and lung data for Opdualag. With the anticipated launch of the subcutaneous formulation of Nivolumab at the end of this year, we continue to estimate that at least 30% to 40% of US patients being treated with IV will convert to the more convenient subcutaneous administration across multiple indications.\nThis ultimately allows patients to benefit from the standard of care cancer medicine into the next decade. With Opdualag, we plan to share phase 2 proof of concept data soon. This supports initiation of a phase 3 study in a subset of patients with first-line non-small cell lung cancer later this year. In immunology, we expect to see data this year for CD19. Next, by resetting the immune system, we believe this therapy can deliver meaningful benefits for patients across multiple indications. We have also completed enrollment of our two phase 3 trials for Sotyktu in psoriatic arthritis, and now expect to see data later this year. Looking ahead on slide nine, we will begin to see important data readouts for our pipeline in the second half of this year, with momentum building through 2026. A few to focus on include LPA1 in pulmonary fibrosis.\nOur registrational multiple myeloma pipeline including GPRC5D cell therapy and our CELMoDs Iberdomide and Mezigdomide, and of course Milvexian which has the potential to be the only oral Factor XI A inhibitor in atrial fibrillation, all have the potential to deliver significant benefits for patients and form a large commercial opportunity for the company. With increasing pipeline momentum, we are confident in our ability to further strengthen our growth profile. Let me close with our outlook on slide 10. Given the strength of our Q2 results and the confidence we have in the remainder of the year, we now expect to deliver top line growth at the upper end of our guidance range. We are also raising our guidance range for full-year EPS. David will discuss these updates in more detail shortly.\nLet me summarize by noting that in Q2 we took notable steps forward on our journey to drive sustained long term growth. While there is more work to do, we are strengthening the foundation for that growth by progressing what is a catalyst rich pipeline, growing our commercial portfolio, and maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides strategic flexibility. I want to thank the employees of BMS for their contributions in the quarter and their commitment to delivering breakthrough medicines to more patients even faster. Let me now hand it over to David.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nEVP and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you Chris and good morning everyone. I'll begin with the highlights of our quarterly sales results on slide 12. Let me start with a brief reminder that unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made from the same period in 2023 and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. All references to our P&L are on a non-GAAP basis. Our performance during the second quarter reflects focused execution across the business including a 21% increase in our growth portfolio and a 3% growth in our legacy portfolio. The growth portfolio continued to increase as a portfolio portion of our total sales and now represents about 46% of the business.\nExpenses during the quarter came in more favorable than expected, reflecting our focus on driving operational excellence and timing of spend, resulting in a slightly higher operating margin of roughly 40%. These results support our positive outlook for 2024 and our updated financial guidance. Second quarter sales performance across our key therapeutic areas reflect continued momentum for several important growth brands, including Reblozyl, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Opdualag. While we saw growth across our immunology business, we recognize there is still more work to do, particularly with Sotyktu in this highly competitive category. There are also some inventory and gross-to-net favorability across several growth brands this quarter, which will be important to take into consideration when phasing sales in the second half of the year. Let's take a closer look at our key brand performance starting with our oncology franchise on slide 13.\nOpdivo remains an important product within our immuno-oncology business. Sequentially, global sales were up driven by demand and an estimated benefit of $65 million related to customer buying patterns in the US. We expect growth this year to be in the mid-single-digit range as core indications mature and we await additional regulatory actions, including FDA approval in the peri-adjuvant lung expected in October. In our IO franchise is further strengthened with Opdualag, which delivered another quarter of double-digit growth driven primarily by higher demand. Outside the US we see encouraging trends across several newly launched markets and remain focused on securing reimbursement. As we said previously, we are pursuing further development of Opdualag in a segment of first-line lung cancer, and we remain on track to initiate our Phase 3 registrational program later this year.\nThese expansion opportunities, coupled with the pending approval to Nivolumab subq, further support extension of our IO franchise into the next decade. In cardiovascular on slide 14, Eliquis remains the market leader anticoagulant worldwide with global sales of more than $3 billion. In the US, sales were primarily driven by higher demand and market share gains. Sequentially, as is typical in Q2, US sales reflect an unfavorable gross-to-net impact as patients begin to enter Medicare coverage gap. As a reminder, these dynamics are more acute in the second half of the year resulting in lower sales versus the first half. Turning to Camzyos, Q2 sales more than tripled compared to the prior year. Sequentially, US sales were driven mainly by demand.\nUS demand in the second quarter was led by an increase of approximately 1,300 commercially dispensed patients since Q1, bringing the total to almost 6,900 patients on commercial drug. This growth demonstrates steady and consistent adoption outside the US. Sales growth reflects the timing of reimbursement in approved markets, and globally we see significant room for future growth. Let's turn to hematology on slide 15. Sales of Reblozyl in the quarter grew 82% with growth in both US and international markets. In the US, sales benefited from higher demand driven by first-line MDS-associated anemia and some favorable inventory in gross-to-net. Outside the US, the brand is approved in approximately 40 countries including recent broad label introductions in Europe and Japan. We look forward to seeing the first-line indication reimbursed across the globe in cell therapy.\nWe saw quarter over quarter sales growth with Abecma driven largely by ex-US. We continue to work through the competitive dynamics in multiple myeloma by discussing our KarMMa-3 data with customers. Breyanzi grew 55% in the quarter, which was driven by growth across multiple indications and expanded manufacturing capacity. International sales growth reflected strong demand in markets such as Germany, France, and Japan. Now moving to immunology on slide 16, performance of Sotyktu continued to be impacted by the competitive environment and the quality of commercial access in the US. At the same time, during Q2 we achieved improved commercial access across multiple large PBMs with zero step edits, and starting earlier this month we added another large PBM. As we discussed last quarter, we now have greater than 60% of covered lives with favorable access.\nAs a result, in the near term we anticipate modest incremental gross-to-net pressure on revenue growth, which will be offset by demand growth over time. Now turning to Slide 17, I will highlight some components of the P&L. In addition to solid commercial execution, our second quarter performance reflects a focus on financial discipline and steady progress against our $1.5 billion cost savings program we discussed on last quarter's call. As a reminder, we plan to reinvest the cost savings into higher growth opportunities to drive greater patient impact and accelerate our sales growth in the second half of the decade. Gross margin came in favorable this quarter, driven primarily by product mix. Operating expenses excluding in-process R&D were impacted by higher deal-related spend, partially offset by cost savings related to our efficiency initiatives and the timing of planned expenditures.\nOn a sequential basis. Expenses came in lower than anticipated due to timing of planned investment spend that shifted to Q3. Our tax rate in the quarter changed from 16.9% in the prior year to 14.1%, primarily due to a release of income tax reserve. Overall earnings per share was $2.07 in the quarter. Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation highlights on Slide 18. Both our growth and legacy portfolios delivered solid revenue growth in the quarter, with legacy continuing to contribute to our robust operating cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion, and we closed the quarter on 30 June. We had approximately $7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities on hand. During Q2, we reduced our total debt position by $3.1 billion, including roughly $2.7 billion of commercial paper and $400 million of long-term debt.\nThese actions are consistent with our plan to pay down approximately $10 billion of debt over the next two years. In terms of capital allocation, we are prioritizing opportunities that will further strengthen our long-term growth outlook while remaining committed to our dividend. Please turn to Slide 19 to walk through the details of our guidance on Q2 performance. Focused execution across the business generated top-line growth and driving operational excellence. These results provided support for updated full-year guidance. As is our practice, we provide revenue guidance on a reported basis as well as on an underlying basis, which assumes currency remains consistent with prior year. Our guidance for the full-year revenue is now low single-digit growth, which we now expect to come in at the upper end of the range.\nThis is due to continued performance of our growth portfolio and better than expected sales of Revlimid. With respect to gross margin, we are raising our guidance to reflect the impact of sales mix excluding acquired in-process R&D. We continue to expect our total operating expenses to be at the upper end of low single-digit percentage increase range. This reflects incremental costs associated with the recent acquisitions partially offset by the realization of savings due to our productivity initiative. Given a delay in timing of anticipated expenses in Q2, we now expect a step up in Q3. Overall, our previous operating margin target of at least 37% for the full year remains unchanged for OIE. We now expect annual expenses of approximately $50 million due to higher than anticipated estimated royalties and favorable net interest expense.\nThe annual tax rate will be affected by one-time non-deductible expenses of Karuna-acquired in-process R&D charge, which impacted our non-GAAP net income in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, the estimated underlying tax rate for the full year is still expected to be about 18%. As a result of these changes, we are raising the range of our 2024 non-GAAP EPS guidance to between $0.60 and 0.90. Let's walk through the phasing of our sales for the full year. Year to date, our growth portfolio has grown approximately 16%, and we anticipate a similar rate of growth in the second half in relation to phasing of product sales in the back half of the year. Keep in mind the typical product seasonality we expect to see in the business in the third quarter.\nAlso, we had roughly $150 million in stocking in Q2 and we anticipate reversing in Q3. Normalization of these dynamics next quarter will likely temper sequential growth. However, as a result of these dynamics and the strength of our underlying business, we expect strong growth across the portfolio in Q4 and from Revlimid. While we continue to monitor variability from generics and other dynamics. We now expect full year sales to be at the higher end of our $4.5 to 5 billion sales range. In closing, we have entered H2 2024 with sales momentum building in key brands and financial discipline driving a leaner and more agile organization. As Chris said, we're excited about the long-term opportunity ahead of our emerging neuroscience platform.\nWith the anticipated FDA approval of KarXT in September, we are committed to investing in high growth areas where we have competitive advantages to meet the needs of our patients. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Tim for Q&A.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks. David Rocco, could we go to the first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And as a reminder, everyone, if you'd like to ask a question, please press Star then one on your telephone keypad. If you're using the speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Today's first question comes from Chris Schott at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just two quick questions here. Maybe the first one is can you just talk about the immunology portfolio and how to think about pricing going forward? I know you mentioned that there's some modest incremental price pressure on Sotyktu given the broader access, but once that rolls out, I guess as we think about the second half of this year, is that a good run rate to think about price for immunology? Or when we consider further access competitive environment, is this a business that likely continues to see price erosion over time? The second question I have is just on IRA. I know we're all kind of waiting on the price disclosure on Eliquis, but is there any just directional color you can share of?\nJust in terms of how negotiations went, any surprises just how you think about IRA price negotiations more broadly as you're thinking about the portfolio and kind of markets you're competing, et cetera. Just, is there anything you could share on that front or do we just have to wait until that disclosure? I guess in a month or so. But appreciate it, thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks, Chris. Maybe I'll start with your second question, then I'll flip it to Adam. So, as expected, we've received the government's final MFP price for Eliquis, and as is consistent with what we've discussed previously, we anticipate CMS is going to publish the MFP price either on or before 1 September and once that happens, we look forward to providing you more color on the impact of MFP on the shape of the Eliquis business.\nWhat I'll say today now that we have seen the final price, we're increasingly confident in our ability to navigate the impact of IRA on Eliquis. Eliquis is an important drug for patients. It's going to continue to be an important drug for the company in the short- to medium-term if we step back from Eliquis. Though, I want to continue to emphasize that we firmly oppose government price setting under IRA. We continue to believe that arbitrary price setting by the government on life-saving medicines is not good public policy. So irrespective of short-term dynamics, we remain very concerned about the long-term implications of IRA on innovation. But we'll be able to give you more color on Eliquis once we get that price published, which we anticipate in the coming weeks and certainly before September 1st Adam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Chris, thanks for the question. Just more broadly in immunology, we know this is a highly competitive and highly rebated category, and we're making good progress across a number of our key products, as you heard from David and Chris, in our growth portfolio as well as in immunology. Now, I have to acknowledge that Sotyktu performance has been slower than we'd like, but we're focused on improving that. We're executing our plan. A key focus has been on improving our access position. As David mentioned, we're continuing to make significant progress in that area. We came into the year with 25% unrestricted access, and we had that through roughly the first half of the year. As we move into the back half of the year, essentially effective 1 July, we more than doubled that.\nWe now have approximately 65% access, the majority of which is zero step edits. So that's about over 100 million lives now. We expect further access improvements in January. So obviously that's important because we'll see new patients move faster onto commercial product. We'll work to move patients quickly out of our bridge program and onto commercial product, and we'll see much fewer patients attrit at the specialty pharmacy. We'll also see, as David mentioned, a modest increase in gross-to-net due to the rebates required for improved access offset by increased volume. As a reminder, in Q2 we had a one-time negative impact of about $6 million due to a gross true-up.\nSo as we exit the year with our expanded access, we're going to be in a much better position versus where we started this year, which will give us a lot of momentum as we move into 2025 and we're committed to making this a big product for the company.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Rocco, could we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question is from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\n\nLuisa Hector\n\nAnalyst, Berenberg\n\nHello. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wondered whether you could describe where the $150 million stocking benefit occurred across which products in Q2 and then perhaps a question on Cendakimab. So good to see the positive readout there. Could you tell us how soon you might be able to file and perhaps how you can position this and, and some sort of color around the access and the launch ramp, sort of piggybacking on your comments on Sotyktu. So how should we think about the potential launch there? Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks, Luisa. I'll ask David to start and then Samit and Adam can address the question on Cendakimab.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nEVP and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Luisa, thanks for the question on the inventory. That's really in the IO franchise across Opdivo and Yervoy, but as well there's some in our immunology franchise at the EULAR symposium.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, David, and thank you for the question for Cendakimab. We have a positive phase 3 study that read out just recently. The trial met both its primary endpoints on dysphagia days as well as the eosinophilic count decrease. It also met the secondary endpoints. But we've just received the data in our hands, so we are doing a deep dive on that. And as we look at the data, we'll of course take into account when the data will be presented at the medical conference, as well as take into account what the landscape is in terms of how patients are treated today.\nAs we plan for the next steps for Cendakimab from a commercial perspective, let me pass it on to Adam who can then comment on that as well.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Luisa, thank you for the question. So we're obviously pleased with the positive phase 3 study for Cendakimab. It's early days, and so we look forward to presenting the data. But just roughly, when you look in the US, there are about 300,000 treated patients. Treatment rates in EOE are pretty low in the United States. In fact, first line treatment rates around 4%, and that increases as you go down lines of therapy to third line, which about 1/3 of patients are treated. And the majority of patients are on conventional therapies like PPIs, steroids, and then they are treated with Dupixent, and so, as Samit mentioned, you know, dysphagia days are important for patients, as also the potential for remodeling here.\nThis is a market where payers are managing about half of the lives in the US. We expect in the majority of lives to be positioned behind Dupixent. And again, we look forward to sharing data with regulatory authorities and presenting at an upcoming meeting.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Let's go to the next question, please. Rocco.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning.\nThank you very much. Chris, you and the team have been much more aggressive on the business development front over the last six days, nine months, and you've had to make some really thoughtful decisions about prioritizing programs so that the costs don't overrun. What's your capacity now and in particular, what's your appetite? Noting that historically Bristol has been in cardiovascular disease, metabolic, and just the requisite question about any interest in the obesity and obesity adjacent realms. Thank you so much.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nSure.\nThanks for the questions, Chris. Maybe I will start and then I'll turn it over to David, who can speak to the capacity. Well, as expected, we continue to prioritize business development. It's, as you point out, something that we've certainly had as a priority going back to when we did the deals at the end of last year. I would say our priority right now is to execute the deals that we completed seven months ago. Notable among that is we're actively preparing for the KarXT launch, hopefully in September. And certainly Adam can speak to that. As David also mentioned, I would highlight that we're also focused on paying down the debt as a top priority. Beyond that though, business development and partnerships are going to be continue to be important to us in terms of the types of deals that we're interested in.\nObviously they have to make strategic and financial sense. As a first order, we're going to continue to be disciplined there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you saw the therapeutic areas and modalities that we're focused on and where we feel we have a right to win. So those would be primarily the areas of focus for business development. And then the requisite question on obesity, I'll get to in a second. But there's also a requisite question on size of deal. I would think about bolt-on deals and partnerships as being the priority for us in the immediate term. And look, we're going to continue to monitor the obesity market, but I would say with respect to business development for us right now, I would focus on those areas that I highlighted in my prepared remarks. David,\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nEVP and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nChris, I think you covered it well.\nThe only thing I'd emphasize as we.\nThink about capital allocation overall besides the.\nDebt paydown is, you know, we remain firmly committed to the dividend, as evidenced by us paying a dividend for the past 92 years and increasing it the last 15 years. As you know, we have one of the lowest payout ratios of our peer group. You know, overall we remain very.\nFinancially disciplined from a capital allocation perspective.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question, please? Rocco. Absolutely.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst 1]\n\nAnalyst 1\n\nThank you. Can I go back to the IRA stuff for a moment? There's no formal gag order preventing drug companies from talking about ongoing price negotiations. I'm told CMS has asked drug companies to keep quiet nonetheless, and all the drug companies have been complying with that, including Bristol. I'm trying to figure out why would drug companies comply with that request and really kind of keep it quiet ahead of the coming announcement. Then second, we might actually be getting that announcement much earlier than people are thinking, possibly in the next week or so ahead of the Congressional recess. If that update does come earlier, can we assume that you'll provide your update, you know, shortly thereafter so, you know, meaning possibly in the next couple of weeks if the news were to come earlier?\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nSure. Thanks for the questions, Tim. So first, we've been consistent that we're going to only speak to the specifics of MFP once we have CMS having published, which we anticipate being on or before 1 September. What I'll say is once that price is disclosed, we're going to be able to provide a very good picture of the shape of the business for Eliquis going forward, inclusive of the impact of IRA. And we very much look forward to being able to provide that clarity. And again, what I would emphasize is based on having seen the price, we're very confident in our ability to navigate the impact of IRA on Eliquis. And so again, we'll provide more details.\nWhen that price becomes public. One other point is what we will provide once that becomes public is we will announce earlier if CMS comes before 1 September, and we'll put what we anticipate around IRA and its impact on our IR website. And so that's how we'll be communicating that.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan David Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys, thank you so much for taking my question two for me.\nSo, Adam, can you walk me through?\nSome of the key launch preparations you're taking for the launch of KarXT that will help you capitalize on your competitive head start and then on the IRA drop earnings. I'm not going to push on the price, but what else do you need to know or need to have in hand to really be able to help us understand kind of when these trough earnings that we've been talking about, when you'll be able to provide kind of when that happens. Thank you guys so much.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nSure.\nSo why don't I let Adam start on KarXT and then I'll take your second question.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Evan, thank you for the question. So we're excited about the launch of KarXT as this is a very important drug with significant commercial potential. As a reminder, given a late September and Q4 launch, we effectively see this as a 2025 launch and KarXT is going to be the first innovative therapy in schizophrenia approved for decades. So let me talk a little bit about how we are preparing for the launch and I'll focus on a few key areas. Number one, we're sourcing a very experienced field sales and strong medical organization to prepare the market for this new mechanism. Secondly, the access team that we have has been out there for months reinforcing the profile with state Medicaid directors and Medicare payers. Just as a reminder, the schizophrenia market is very different in terms of access than markets that are highly PBM driven.\nGovernment payers will be critical to building access for this product since the patient population is greater than 80% Medicaid and Medicare. We've received very positive feedback from thought leaders and payers in the space that CAR fills a significant unmet need. The third area that I'll highlight is we need to ensure that physicians and patients have a positive first experience. This is a new mechanism with a different profile and ensuring that patients stay on treatment. Overall we're pleased with the launch readiness efforts and we look forward to launching this important medicine later this year.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you Adam. I just want to add a couple of things, Evan. Samit here. In addition to looking forward to the approval in September, we are also executing on the overall development plan for KarXT. As you know, the adjunctive schizophrenia study as well as the Alzheimer's disease associated psychosis studies are ongoing, and they're enrolling well. We look forward to data readouts in 2025 and 2026. We anticipate initiation of the phase 3 trials in bipolar disorder as well as Alzheimer's agitation also in 2025 with a bid dosing, and then also preparing to start the phase 3 study, Alzheimer's disease cognitive impairment, also in 2025. In addition to that, we are now making the preparations for the autism studies, which will include children. So do we need to do some work on that? But really a large program that is being initiated and executed right now.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks, Samit. Now Evan, going back to your question on trough, I'll redirect you back to the comments that I made at the beginning of the year. We've talked about navigating a period that starts in 2026. Now having said that, our focus continues to be on improving the shape of the business over time, and the good news is we have a lot of strategic levers to pull. We have a growing portfolio of young assets. We saw good growth in the first half and we expect good growth in the back half. We have new products launching, notably KarXT and Nivo Sub Q this year. Those are going to be important in terms of describing the shape of our business longer term. We have late-stage pipeline assets that are reading out starting this year and accelerating through next year and into 2026.\nAs we've discussed over time, these have considerable commercial potential with some very interesting early programs. We're going to start seeing proof of concept starting this year, notably CD19 NEX-T. And of course, as David has mentioned already today, we have a very good balance sheet and the capacity to do smart partnerships in business development. So those are a number of the things that are obviously going to shape how this business looks like in the back half of the decade. And we're fixated on delivering across the business in the short term as well as pulling the strategic levers I just mentioned that are going to be needed to accelerate the timing and pace of growth for the company in the back half of the decade.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question please. Rocco.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one for Adam. You had a really nice quarter in Breyanzi. You highlighted some of the drivers there. Can you maybe.\nCompartmentalize that a bit and help us think about, then, the second half of the year as we think about both those new indications, but also the step up in supply, just again, given sort of the reset in Q2? Additional color here would be pretty helpful.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nAdam?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Carter, thank you for the question. We're pleased with Breyanzi performance in the quarter. Remember in Q1, we said we expected significant improved manufacturing capacity and also a tailwind from our new indications. So in the second quarter, as David shared, sales increased over 50% versus prior year, and we anticipate that to continue through the remainder of the year. We expect continued strong growth to be driven first by our lead indication in LBCL, as Breyanzi is increasingly recognized as the best-in-class CD19, as well as by our expanded indications, which are off to a very good start. We're also pleased, and I want to acknowledge and thank our GPS organization. With our exceptional expanded manufacturing capacity, we're now in a much stronger position to meet demand in the market.\nTaken together, our recent approvals, our expanded manufacturing capacity, and best in class will enable us to compete much more effectively to win in this market.\n\n[Analyst 2]\n\nAnalyst 2\n\nThanks, Adam.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question please. Rocco.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim Securities. Please go.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat.\nThanks for the question.\nSo, a couple of quick ones. You know, you have a number of clinical readouts coming in multiple myeloma with your CELMoD portfolio in 2026. Just hoping you could help us understand how you see those products potentially commercially, or maybe not commercially, but clinically positioned relative to the very increasingly crowded landscape that we see today. And then the second actually harkens back.\nA little bit to IRA, but more.\nTo Part D redesign. Can you guys help us understand how the Part D redesign dynamics that are likely to materially impact the substantial payout that you make on.\nEliquis is likely.\nTo be offset negatively by the impact of the catastrophic cap that comes in in 2025? At what point will you seek to educate the market on those pushes and pulls in 2025? Will that fall with the IRA negotiation effects or will it fall, you know.\nSimply with 2025 guidance? Thanks.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nSamit, then, Adam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Seamus, for the question. As we think about multiple myeloma, it is a disease which has really been benefiting from multiple therapies that have been approved over the years and certainly has had transformational outcomes for these patients, including small molecules as well as large molecules. And now with cell therapies and bispecifics coming into the play, as we think about cell mods, as we think about Iberdomide and Mezigdomide, both in development across the four phase 3 clinical trials, with the readouts coming in 2026, the way we think about it is multidrug regimens will be required for these patients because ultimately right now we don't have a cure for the disease. And that's the way we have designed the studies with Mezigdomide going head to head versus pomalidomide.\nWhereas if we think about Iberdomide, we're looking at combinations to really change the outcomes when we combine them with Velcade and dexamethasone, or moving into a maintenance setting after transplant going head to head versus Revlimid. So we believe that there are patients who are not going to be eligible to receive cell therapies where these therapies will play a role. Also, we need manageable toxicities which don't have the same outcomes of CRS, etc., that are associated with bispecific therapies right now. So placement of these therapies will become important and we'll continue to generate more data through many other trials so that we ultimately give more armamentarium to physicians to prescribe to the right patients for better outcomes in multiple myeloma.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks, Samit. Seamus, before I turn it over to Adam to walk through the redesign specifically, I'll just say that when we give the color on MFP, that will be inclusive of all aspects of IRA, including the Part D redesign. And that, whenever we talk about the final MFP price. But Adam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Seamus, you know, as you alluded to, you know, products are impacted differently by the Medicare redesign. We carefully evaluate each of the individual dynamics, both now as well as into the future, to determine the potential impacts. We will see favorability with Eliquis next year due to the Part D redesign, notably with the elimination of the coverage gap that will partially be offset by rev and Pomalyst having responsibility now in the catastrophic phase. So we're monitoring this very closely to understand what the impact is on out of pocket caps as well and other shifts that are happening in the landscape.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nYeah, and just to close off on that, what I would say when we look at Part D redesign across the entire portfolio, we actually think that it offsets and will be largely neutral.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. Could we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from Terence Flynn at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question, Dave. I was just wondering if you can provide any early commentary on how we should think about 2025 operating margins. Maybe just walking us through some of the puts and takes, and then separately was wondering if you guys can disclose the Winrevair royalty from Merck. Thank you,\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nDavid.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nEVP and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks, James. And look, we remain committed to our greater than 37% operating margin. And as you saw, we saw strength in our gross margins with a mix of our business, and we feel really good about the operational efficiency programs that we're executing against now, which gives us a lot of flexibility in maintaining those operating margins above 37%.\nThanks Terrence.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnswer about Winrevair, David.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nEVP and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nOh, and Winrevair. That. So we recognize 22% of global sales of Winrevair that comes through our other growth revenue that comes through there. And you'll hear about those sales from Merck when they come through. But obviously an important growth driver for us at that 22% royalty rate.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat, thanks very much, David. Can we go to the next one, please, Rocco?\n\nOperator\n\nYes sir. Our next question today comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question, and maybe one question I want to ask is, like, with new launches, there are spaces you have done really well, like oncology and cardiology, now with Camzyos picking up. But immunology seems to be a challenge, and even before Sotyktu, there was Zeposia. So just want to understand what are the access dynamics that you are finding challenging versus your expectations going in. I'm asking because with some of those IL-23s and all, they have found better access than what we are seeing with Sotyktu. So could you please help us understand that? Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks, Mohit. Good question. And Adam, you'll take it?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSure Mohit, thanks for the question. So as we talked about, we are focused on continuing to accelerate our growth portfolio. As you saw in the quarter, we're making good progress there and we're delivering strong performance for products like Reblozyl, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Opdualag. You know, as I talked about, Sotyktu performance is slower than we would like and we are focused on improving both performance and execution. But ultimately it's the access there that has taken longer than we expected. Remember in many of the immunology categories that we compete in, these are highly controlled, highly managed products by the large PBMs. And so it took longer for us to get into a preferred position based on entrenched contracts.\nSo as we're seeing uptake now, we're in a much better position with approximately 65% access, you know, most of that is at zero step edit and that could be really important. So we recognize this is a highly competitive market and you know, we're continuing to make improvements and we expect further improvements in access in January. As relates to Zeposia, Zeposia has really been a tale of two launches. We entered the market in multiple sclerosis and we've seen good uptake there over time. We're doing that in a market that continues to contract based on the increases in the products like Ocrevus and Kesimpta, but we continue to grow our share in a competitive market. Now UC has been more challenging, it is more managed, it's more managed. Class TNFs have preferred status across virtually all of the PBMs.\nWe're also focused on making progress there as well. You know, I think it's hard to paint immunology in general with a broad brush. You know, Orencia continues to perform well, no biosimilar in sight. And finally, you know, as we talked about, we're ready for the launch of Sotyktu, which has very different access dynamics than what's in the immunology space today. We are continuing to make progress in delivering strong performance and execution, and we're confident in our ability to continue to grow our business in the near term and into the longer term.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners",
    "content2": "Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the performance. So two questions please. First is with respect to IRA, many companies, including Bristol, have suggested it's not too much of a problem.\nSo I'm just helping. I'm hoping that you could help us understand a little bit how you're thinking about drugs that aren't rebated today, like Part B drugs such as Opdivo, and their risk of price pressure when they're negotiated relative to drugs that are heavily.\nRebated today, like Eliquis.\nSo if you could just comment on that, that would be helpful. And then second, with respect to some of your growth drivers, obviously you kind of comment a lot on Sotyktu and Opdualag. But there are competitors that have shown some pretty encouraging data and competitors claim, and in some cases that is with respect to Sotyktu, they're running head to head trials that their drugs are going to show much better efficacy cross trial than Sotyktu and Opdualag and launch late decade. So if you could just comment on that and how you're thinking about the future competition. Thanks so much.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks, David. I'll let Adam address certainly the first question and actually, probably the second question as well. But let me just first say we're not going to speculate on the impact.\nProducts that have not been or aren't planned to be negotiated. Adam can speak generally about how we manage the different books of business between Medicare and commercial. But Adam?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, I mean, I think we're a long way off to 2028. So I agree. I think it's premature to, you know, to discuss if Opdivo would be eligible even for, you know, for IRA negotiation. Remember, you know, if Opdivo makes the list, you know, there could be generics in the market or biosimilars in the market as well. But I think most importantly is what you heard from both David and Chris is that, you know, we announced a PDUFA date for our Nivo Sub Q in late December. So our goal is to convert as much business as we can well prior to the LOE. And we expect to convert at least 30% to 40 of the total US business for Opdivo ahead of the LOE. And we think this is a great opportunity for both physicians and patients.\nWe look forward to launching this important formulation also with a biosimilar in the market. We don't expect to see Opdivo completely fall off either. We also expect to see the Sub Q and the IV continue into the next decade as well as it relates to the competition in immunology or in PSO. I think more specifically, as you're asking again, you know, we are preparing for competition there. I think so. Take two has set a high bar for new orals in the PSO space. This is a very competitive category today. It's only going to become more crowded and more competitive over time.\nWe also plan to have several indications, including PSA by, you know, we'll see some data by the end of this year which will help both PSO and help accelerate Sotyktu as well as SLE, both of which, you know, SLE and PSA will be approved and will read out at that time. So we're going to have to see the results of the study. The oral IL-23 phase 3 data would need to be meaningfully different in order to move the needle. But we're continuing to make progress with Sotyktu in executing our plan and we focus on growing this important brand.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAnd I think I'll just add because I think you also mentioned Opdualag, and as far as Opdualag is concerned, once again we are way ahead with melanoma indication already approved in the first line, anticipating the data for the adjuvant melanoma, anticipating also the presentation of the phase 2 data soon, and then initiation of the phase 3 program in the subset of non-small cell lung cancer to continue the progress. Rest of the data that we've seen from the competition is just too small to really interpret anything out of that.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nAnalyst, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks. Can we go to the next question please, Rocco?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Chris, I apologize for being picky, but you said two times on the call that Bristol would give visibility on the contour of Eliquis business around 1 September, but you didn't say floor guidance. And when you were specifically asked about floor guidance you repeated something from earlier in the call. So is floor guidance no longer in the plans? And secondly, update on cendakimab in EoE. So Dupixent showed 60% of patients achieved histologic remission at 24 weeks. Is cendakimab fully competitive with that? You sound very confident. So it sounds like yes. And historically your tone in saying things like this has been very predictive. So I'm just curious what to make of it. Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks Steve.\nI'll start and then I'll turn it over to Samit. So look, we know there's a lot of interest in this topic around floor guidance. As I've said before, in general we've moved away from providing long-term targets. This actually reflects us going back to what the company has done historically. That said, we continue to increase our confidence in the long-term growth profile of this business. We're going to continue to provide updates to you on that business as appropriate, and we'll be transparent about how we see the business evolving. As for how we do that and when we do that, as I think most of you are aware, our normal practice is to provide forward-looking guidance at the beginning of the year, normally when we report our Q4 results, and we're going to continue with that process. Samit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you and thanks for the question. Steve, as always, very pointed one. Look, we did do the study as it relates to comparison versus Dupixent. So it's very hard to start comparing the data. Also remember the way the dysphagia days, which is the more important and most important thing from a symptom relief for the patient, the way we measured it versus what Dupixent did in their study, are very different ways. So we have to keep that in mind. Certainly will not comment on the specificity of the data because we would rather present it at a medical conference or to come on that. Certainly, as mentioned earlier by Adam as well, we look to the data deeply and put it into perspective as we go forward, also in communications with regulators.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question please. Ranka.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst 3]\n\nAnalyst 3\n\nMorning guys. Trung Huynh from UBS. I have a few follow-ups on the Sub Q Opdivo. So today you highlighted again the 30% to 40 conversion. How quickly are you arriving at this 30% to 40 of patients? What's stopping it from being more as we've seen things like Darzalex have quite significant conversion. And then when is the exclusivity expected to last for this Sub Q vs IV? Given the somewhat recent CMS drafts on IRA on Sub Q formulations. I think you mentioned in one of the questions the next decade, but do you have a year? Thank you,\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nAdam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Trung, thanks for the question. So again, as I said, we are looking forward to the PDUFA date in late December, and our launch planning is, we said, we would convert at least 30% to 40 of the total US Opdivo IV business. We have the good news. We have time because the LOE is not until 2028. So we expect that conversion to come largely from patients who are in the adjuvant setting, use in combination with Yervoy where there's continuing Opdivo treatment. For example, indications in metastatic melanoma, in first line RCC, as well as in Opdivo monotherapy. These indications represent approximately 70% of our overall business. So we talked about the benefits of Sub Q, has the potential to benefit both patients with a less than 5 minute infusion time and physicians who are able to free up chairs, particularly in the community setting.\nWe do have the potential to benefit patients in the next decade with Nivo Subq based on the fact that we've got a broad patent estate. So we expect to see both Nivo Subq and Opdualag continue to persist our leading IO franchise into the early 2030s.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Adam. Let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Matthew Phipps with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Phipps\n\nAnalyst, William Blair\n\nThanks for taking the questions. Two quick ones on phase 3 trials.\nWhat are these?\nRecruitment has recommenced in the ACTION-1 trial with RYZ101 and Actinium-225 supply is secured there.\nOn the successor trials with Mezigdomide. It looks like the trials have advanced.\nTo part two of the Phase 3. Wondering if you can give us any sense of the dose that was taken from part one into part two? Thank you,\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nMatt. Thanks, Matt. Amit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thank you. For both the questions for the Actinium-225 study. As you know, we are the furthest along in terms of Actinium-225 phase 3 trial. GEP-NETs is the first indication with very strong data supporting it. We have reinitiated the recruitment in the trial, and we are still looking forward to the data readout in 2026 along with certainly looking forward to new indications starting with small cell lung cancer phase 1 trial that is already ongoing for Mezigdomide trial. Again, enrollment is continuing. We will not yet declare what the dose we've taken forward, but certainly yes, both trials have moved to the part 2 of the study, and you'll continue to hear about how the trial progresses, and we're looking forward to the readout starting in 2020.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Samit. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst 4]\n\nAnalyst 4\n\nHi, good morning, and thank you for the question. I wanted to ask a follow up on sotatercept. It looks like you guys changed your other income guidance by about $200 million for the year. So is that essentially entirely from the sotatercept launch? Obviously a big number there. If you back it out based on a 2022 or a 22% royalty rate. And then how are you thinking about sotatercept's contribution to your P&L going forward just given the strong economics there. And one more, just can you also comment on level of enthusiasm around your PRMT5 program and what we'll see from the phase 1 readout in the back half of the year? Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nDavid.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nEVP and CFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Olivia, thanks for your question. The 1 increase was mainly driven by two things, as I said earlier in my remarks, which is the diabetes royalties coming in better than we had anticipated, as well as interest expense coming in better than anticipated. What I was saying earlier related to Winrevair, since we still own the intellectual property of that, that 22% of global sales related to the product goes through our other growth revenue line. It comes through sales.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Olivia, for the question on PRMT5. Certainly, again, very much further along on that one. Phase 1 trial continues on what we will be presenting data is the responses that have been seen across multiple different tumor types.\nSo, really looking forward to presenting that data as we plan to initiate the phase 2 studies and a couple of indications, which we will talk about more as we get closer to the initiation of those trials in selected patients, of course, with MTAP deletions.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks. Let's go to the next one please. Rocco.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question comes from Steve Chesney with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Chesney\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nYeah, great, thank you. Maybe just a follow up on radiopharma, please. With regard to the commercial opportunity for RYZ101 and GEP-NETs, I wonder how competitor filings of an ANDA and a 505(b)(2) for Lutathera impacts your thinking on pricing for innovators in the space. And then also on CD19 NEX-T, we've seen a couple competitor data sets over the past month or two that showed relapses at a fairly early time point and somewhat lower than expected response rates. Just wondering how you guys have been thinking about that as it relates to CD19 NEX-T. You know, whether you have more confidence in your construct or are you doing something differently on dosing? Thank you,\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nAdam Then summit.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, first let me just talk about our enthusiasm about RayzeBio and the platform that we have here. We believe this is a really exciting platform, one that's going to grow significantly through the back end of the decade. And you know, what particularly excites us about RayzeBio is the kind of robust IND engine that we'll see over the course of the next decade or plus, as well as what we know is a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that has now the lead program in RYZ101 in GEP-NETs is, you know, I think a fairly modest commercial opportunity. However, when you look at this technology, particularly actinium-based radiopharmaceutical platform, this has the potential to have efficacy and safety across a host of solid tumor treatments.\nSo you know, as we've talked about, we are looking at this in small cell lung cancer and potentially many other tumor types. So we look forward to launching the GEP-NET indication that will be the lead asset as well as a number of new INDs coming in the back half of the decade and beyond.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. And thank you, Adam. And just to talk about CD19 NEX-T, there are a couple of things to understand. Number one, we have two studies ongoing. The first study enrolls patients not only with far advanced systemic lupus erythematosus, but also systemic sclerosis as well as myositis. The second study is enrolling patients with multiple sclerosis. Now, it's very important to understand the profile of the patients that are being enrolled. These are patients who have far advanced disease. They're on glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and these patients may also have underlying organ dysfunctions such as renal failure and kidney damage. So as we think about the impact of these single infusion CART cell therapies, what are we trying to achieve? We're trying to achieve a remission in the sense that patients can go off of their treatments such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants.\nWhat one does not expect at this time, at least, that we can revert the damaged kidney to a normal state because kidney doesn't grow by itself. So, I think we have to keep that in mind as we look at the data, and we're looking forward to bring that data as we look to the presentation of these patients that we are treating today.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat, thanks Simon. Let's go to the next one please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from James Shin with DB. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nA couple more on the pipeline just to piggyback on PRMT5 readout later this year. Can you shed some light on the.\nData size, which data points to expect.\nAre you thinking this will be disclosed via conference setting and then similar to that about CD19 NEX-T, how will that be rolled out? Then I think another question, a previous question talked about some of the negotiation dynamics and immunology. You know a lot of these PBMs are getting into biosimilars. Has that changed the negotiation dynamics at all in your early interactions? Thank you,\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nSamit Then Adam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, and I think your question. You're breaking up a bit, James. I think you were asking about disclosure for PRMT5. Exactly.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSo both of these molecules. We are looking forward to presenting the data this year, certainly through a medical conference, for both of them for PRMT5, all the patients that have been enrolled. We're looking forward to bring the dose, overall safety, and where we've seen responses, and certainly that'll be the data that we will be presenting for CAR NEX-T. We're looking forward to presentation of the data for, certainly, SLE at an upcoming conference as well, and then grow from there. We are obviously preparing and planning to have conversations with regulatory authorities as well to plan for later stages of development of this molecule.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, just quickly on the biosimilar question. As I mentioned in UC, yes, biosimilars do have a preferred position in first line. However, in respect to the PSO market, we are continuing to work with payers to understand the dynamics there. But we have not heard or seen PBMs move to a biosimilar first approach. The reason for that largely is the fact in PSO products like Humira and Stelara do not have a dominant position in that space. So we would not expect biosimilars, at least in the near term, to take on a preferred position.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Let's go to the next one, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question today comes from Kripa Devarakonda with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter performance. I have one question on Camzyos and maybe a question on IRA for Camzyos. In terms of patients added per quarter, it seems like we're starting to see a little bit of acceleration. I know last year, couple of quarters you said you started reaching steady state. Do you think this is just noise or could this be a trend going forward? Are you seeing awareness and understanding of the drug increase uptake? And the other thing on IRA is actually a little bit more futuristic maybe. Do you see any potential impact on IRA implementation, depending on result of the November election, could there be any change? Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nSo, Adam, and then I'll take your IRA question.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nCopy. Thanks for the question. We've seen steady and consistent growth from Camzyos, and, as David mentioned, we saw approximately 1,300 patient increase on commercial drug quarter over quarter. We expect that to be steady and consistent growth over time. Physician and patient feedback continue to remain very positive. Our focus is increasing our user base both in the large COEs while also increasing breadth of prescribing in some of the smaller institutions and some of the larger community practices. In fact, we'll be deploying additional community representatives. These are our Eliquis representatives into the community cardiology accounts to drive treatment. So we're seeing good momentum with Camzyos, and we're pleased with the performance of this very important product.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nI know we're running over, got time maybe for two more here, so maybe go to the next one please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes sir. And our next question today comes from Sean McCutcheon and Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nSean McCutcheon\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking over or staying over to take my question. Maybe one for Samit. So we're going to get the OCEANIC-AF data at ESC in about a month. Obviously the Bayer's AF is ongoing and time will tell if there are any distinctions from the rapid failure we saw for Asundexian and likely insufficient dose finding and PACIFIC is noted. But what are the specifics you're looking for for a read through on the mechanism for those data and do you see any risk to getting data that come in that clearly show sufficient inhibition of Factor XIa activity yet a detriment on stroke prevention?\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nBefore Samit answers, I just want to address the second part of Kripa's question just very quickly around national, obviously we're going to continue to follow the election in the United States. It's difficult to speculate on how things will change from a policy standpoint with any given administration, just simply because it's not just a presidential election, but it's also, you have to look at the composition of Congress. So I think we're just going to have to continue to pay attention to this over time. But Samit, do you want to address.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you. Thank you for the question as well. Look, I think let's start off with the first fact that when we started the Milvexian program, it was based on the prior learnings from the phase 2 studies. That's why we chose the doses that we chose for a single agent at a higher dose of 100 mg bid, whereas the 25 mg bid, where there was a background of antiplatelet agents. Second, independent investigators have now conducted preclinical work to show the differentiation between Asundexian versus Milvexian, showing the inhibition and the time it takes and the doses that are required for real inhibition of Factor XIa. And so that gives us a little bit more confidence in terms of how things are shaping up.\nThird, for AF secondary stroke prevention as well as ACS, the enrollment continues very well in these three trials, and we're looking forward to those readouts. Last thing I would say is when the data are presented, we certainly would like to see the number of events that happened, what time they happened, and the impact of the dose that was used. That will all be very helpful as we think about Milvexian.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat, thanks. Let's go to the last one, please, Rocco.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our final question today comes from Alex Hammond at B of A. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst 5]\n\nAnalyst 5\n\nHey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. So following Camzyos's strong performance this quarter and the REMS registry data acc, can you set expectations for potential REMS modification moving forward? And do you think having the results from the Odyssey study reading out early next year will provide a favorable time to reengage with the FDA? Thank you.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nSamit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nCMO and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you for the question. As both David and Adam said earlier, thousands of patients have now been treated with Camzyos. And certainly we've learned a lot and we see the manageable profile here as well as the transformational outcomes that these patients have and stay on treatment for a very long time. With 80% of the patients being treated with 2.5mg and 5mg doses, we continue our conversations with the FDA. I will not get into the specifics, and certainly now that we have pulled in the readout of the non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy study about six months in, with a readout now expected in Q2 next year, we will certainly have multiple engagements with the FDA on that front as well.\n\n[Company Representative]\n\nCompany Representative\n\nThanks Amit.\nSo before we close the call, maybe.\nI'll just leave you all with a few things. We are pleased with the performance of the business and, in particular, the growth portfolio performance where revenues grew nicely in the first half and now represent, as David said earlier, 46% of the total business. At the same time, our pipeline continues to advance with new medicines, and we look forward to important catalysts coming up like the KarXT launch and a number of data readouts in the coming months. So overall I'd say we've executed well in the quarter. We feel good about the full year and are raising our outlook accordingly. It's certainly going to be a busy back half of the year, and we're focused as a team and as a company on driving strong execution.\nSo, thank you all for your time today, and the investor relations team is certainly available to answer any follow-up questions that you may have. Have a nice weekend.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.\n[inaudible]\n[inaudible]"

Please go ahead.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our Q1 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer, and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development. As you'll note, we've posted slides to bms.com that you can use to follow along with for Chris and David's remarks. Before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statement. During this call, we'll make statements about the Company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the Company's SEC filings.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com, and with that I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was a busy quarter for us and a good start to 2024. Starting on slide four and knowing what an active quarter we had, I wanted to start by telling you how we think about our performance across four dimensions. First, the performance of our commercial portfolio was good and broadly in line with our expectations, even with some products impacted by inventory or gross-to-net. Second, we made solid progress advancing our pipeline. Third, we closed four important transactions that strengthen our long-term growth profile during Q1, and fourth, we're taking decisive actions to improve productivity. Taken together, Q1 performance was broadly aligned to our internal expectations, and importantly, there is no change to the underlying business outlook we provided in February.\nAs you know, we've included the accounting impact of the recently closed transactions in our non-GAAP EPS guidance. Let's turn to Slide 5 for some details. I'll start with some highlights on commercial performance. We've seen real strength across key brands including Eliquis, Opdualag, Reblozyl, Yervoy, and Breyanzi. Though the BCMA space remains competitive, our objective is to return Abecma to growth over time with the KarMMa-3 approval as we move into a larger patient population. Turning to Opdivo, Camzyos, and Sotyktu, what's important about all three brands is that demand grew while revenue was impacted by other factors such as inventory and gross-to-net. Today we are seeing the inventory patterns for Opdivo and Camzyos normalizing, and for Sotyktu we are steadily building commercial script volume as access continues to improve this year.\nDavid will give you more details, but taken together, the commercial performance in Q1 is in line with our expectation and sets us up for the year. Second, we made important progress advancing our pipeline. This includes two important cell therapy approvals, the initiation of new registrational trials, and important proof of concept data for Opdualag and lung cancer from a prespecified analysis of our II during Q1. We're looking forward to starting a III registrational trial versus standard of care in a segment consisting of about 20% to 30% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and not on the slide. But important for patients is Movexian, which has the potential to be the only oral factor XIa medicine in afib, and the trials are continuing following the most recent DSMB review with enrollment accelerating. Third, we closed four important deals during the quarter.\nAcross all four, we have added assets, capabilities, and expertise that strengthen our ability to drive long-term growth. As we exit the 2020s, our team is driving performance of core portfolio. The RayzeBio radioligand plant in Indiana is now operational. We're in the process of filing an application to supply clinical product for RYZ101 from the site. SystImmune's first-in-class bispecific ADC is advancing into global clinical trials in tumors, including lung and, over time, breast cancer, and we are very excited about the potential of KarXT from Karuna, which I will review on slide 6. The team is on track and focused on two objectives. First, launch preparations are underway and on track for KarXT. Second, we are executing against a robust clinical program for this important asset.\nOn the slide you can see the significant unmet need in schizophrenia and highlights of data recently presented for KarXT. These data demonstrate its compelling long-term efficacy as KarXT was associated with significant improvements in symptoms of schizophrenia across all efficacy measures without evidence of metabolic or movement disorder side effects. This reinforces the very attractive profile for this medicine as an important advancement for patients and a significant commercial opportunity for the company. Underpinning our efforts to navigate this decade is an enhanced focus on driving operational productivity and efficiency, and we have made some notable progress already this year. Let's go to slide seven. At a company level, we have clearly identified brands and programs that are most critical to both near and latter half of the decade performance.\nAcross the organization, we have initiated efforts to delayer and streamline decision making, and within R&D we are optimizing the portfolio to focus our internal efforts on higher ROI programs. These are programs with compelling science, significant commercial value, and in therapeutic categories where BMS is positioned and resourced to win. As a result of these actions, we anticipate cost savings of approximately $1.5 billion by the end of 2025, which will allow us to reinvest in high priority growth brands and R&D programs. With our heightened focus on improving productivity and efficiencies, we're strengthening the company's long-term growth profile. This is a snapshot of what has been a very busy start to the year, and while we clearly have more work to do this year, we're off to a good start. Let me close on slide eight. Overall, our business outlook remains unchanged.\nWe remain confident that we will deliver top line growth for the year consistent with what we communicated in February, and our underlying non-GAAP EPS forecast has also remained unchanged. We are taking important actions to effectively manage the decade. Our management team is focused on ensuring the disciplined execution required to deliver both this year and set us up for the longer term. I want to thank the employees of BMS, including new team members from our recent acquisitions, for their contributions and commitment to delivering for patients. Let me now hand it over to David. David.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris highlighted, we're off to a good start to the year with top line growth as shown on slide 10. As a reminder, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made from the same period in 2023, and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Building on our momentum coming out of last year, we are executing against our plan to drive our growth portfolio, which delivered approximately 11% sales increase in the Q1 compared to the prior year and now represents approximately 40% of our total revenue. This growth was broad-based with most growth brands recording significant increases in the quarter. Our legacy portfolio also contributed to overall sales growth in the quarter with strong sales of Eliquis, which remains an important cash flow generator for the company.\nNow turning to the Q1 performance of our key brands and starting with oncology on slide 11. On this slide you can see the impact of our strategy in broadening our IO franchise and expanding in new targeted solid tumor therapies. Global sales of Opdivo were impacted by inventory drawdown and timing of orders in the US, partially offset by demand growth. As we said in the past, we expect to see growth at a more modest pace in 2024. Opdualag, a standard of care treatment and first line melanoma generated strong quarterly sales with the US sales growth primarily driven by strong market share. We are very encouraged by the future expansion potential of Opdualag not only in adjuvant melanoma, but also in our plans to develop it in first line lung cancer.\nThis, along with the anticipated launch of our Opdivo subcutaneous formulation next year, will extend our IO franchise well into the next decade. Our targeted solid tumor therapies expanded with the addition of Krazati after the completion of Mirati acquisition in late January. Our reported sales represent a partial quarter, and on a pro forma basis Krazati global sales in Q1 were approximately $27 million primarily in the US. With the recent conditional marketing approval by the European Commission, we look forward to bringing Krazati to more patients toward the end of the year. Augtyro's Q1 performance reflects positive early sales trends. We remain focused on driving awareness and penetration based upon its potential best-in-class profile. Now moving to slide 12 and our cardiovascular franchise. Eliquis remains the market-leading oral anticoagulant worldwide.\nQ1 sales in the US grew 12% primarily due to strong demand including increased market share. Internationally, sales were roughly in line with prior year. Camzyos generated strong sales in the quarter, nearly tripling its performance versus Q1 of last year. In the US sales were driven by demand growth including an almost 25% increase in commercial dispenses since Q4 of 2023. Sequentially, US sales of Camzyos were impacted by the inventory dynamics of approximately $20 million and gross to net impacts from the typical copay reset at the start of the new year. We expect the momentum of Camzyos to continue, supported by the compelling real world evidence in over 1,500 patients presented earlier this month at ACC. Let's now turn to slide 13 and discuss our hematology business. Our legacy brand Revlimid saw sales decline in the Q1.\nUtilization of free drug program normalized in the quarter. We continue to anticipate variability in Revlimid sales quarter to quarter based upon historic dispensing patterns in specialty pharmacies. As anticipated, there is increased volumes of US generics starting in March. Turning to Reblozyl, growth in the quarter was driven primarily by the strong US launch of the broader COMMANDS label and first line MDS. International sales growth benefited from the new market launches, and we look forward to bringing Reblozyl to more patients with the recent first line approvals in the EU and Japan in cell therapy portfolio. Global Breyanzi sales growth reflected the strength of the clinical profile and improved manufacturing capacity consistent with what we previously communicated. Starting in Q2, we expect Breyanzi to benefit from the recent new indications and expanded manufacturing capacity with Abecma.\nUS performance in the quarter was impacted by ongoing competitive pressures. Future demand will benefit from the recent KarMMa-3 approval, which expands the addressable patient population. Internationally, Abecma demand growth was offset by unfavorable pricing pressures to secure access. Now moving to immunology on Slide 14, Zeposia sales in the quarter were primarily due to demand of new patient starts and multiple sclerosis. Sotyktu sales performed in line with our expectation during the quarter. We delivered on our goal of achieving roughly 10,000 commercially paid prescriptions. Sales in the quarter reflected increased demand and expanded commercial access. In addition, we expect to add another large PBM later this year that will expand access coverage by approximately 30 million lives. Now turning to Slide 15, I will walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis.\nAs expected, gross margin decreased compared to the prior year, primarily due to product mix excluding acquired in-process R&D. Q1 operating expenses increased mainly due to the impact of the recent acquisitions and higher costs to support the overall portfolio. We expect this growth to be mitigated later in the year through savings and productivity initiatives. I will speak to shortly. Other income and expense declined as expected in the Q1, primarily due to lower PD-1 royalty rate and the financing costs associated with the recent transactions. Acquired in-process R&D in the quarter was $12.9 billion, primarily due to the previously disclosed one-time charge of $12.1 billion for the Karuna transaction and $800 million for SystImmune. Our tax rate in the quarter was impacted by the one-time nondeductible in-process R&D charge for Karuna.\nBefore the impact of acquired in-process R&D, our Q1 earnings would have been $1.89. Taking into account the impact from the recent transactions including acquired in-process R&D, we reported an earnings per share loss of $4.40. Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 16, cash flow from operations remains strong with approximately $2.8 billion generated in the quarter, resulting in approximately $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities on hand. As of March 31, our strategic approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. We are committed to the dividend, and as we said previously, we plan to utilize our cash flow to repay approximately $10 billion of debt over the next two years, and we remain financially disciplined around business development to further strengthen the company's long-term growth profile.\nNext, let's turn to slide 17 to discuss our productivity initiative. As Chris described earlier, we have taken action to increase productivity, efficiency, and focus our efforts on the assets and opportunities with the highest potential ROI and those most likely to drive our long term growth. As part of this process, we are making deliberate choices to prioritize the assets that will have the greatest clinical benefit to impact areas of high unmet need and where we can deliver the most value for patients. We will disproportionately invest in higher return opportunities which improves our portfolio ROI and strengthens our growth profile in the second half of the decade. After a thoughtful process, we have made the decision to discontinue and externalize several clinical assets.\nWe anticipate cost savings from these actions of approximately $1.5 billion by the end of 2025, thereby absorbing the incremental OpEx expense from the recent deals. These cost savings will come from across the organization, include reductions in direct clinical expense, site rationalization, and elimination of open roles, and reduction in headcount. As we realize these savings, we will reinvest in the highest potential opportunities. Now turning to slide 18, I'll walk through the impact of our recently closed acquisition on our EPS guidance. As you can see on this slide, if you take our previously stated non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $7.10 to $7.40 from February and include the previously stated impact of deal dilution and the one-time impact of Acquired In-Process R&D, our revised range continues to reflect the strong outlook of the business as we told you in February.\nNow let's walk through the details of our guidance on Slide 19 starting with revenue. As is our practice, we provide revenue guidance on a reported basis as well as on an underlying basis which assumes currency remains consistent with prior year. We continue to expect 2024 total revenues to increase in the low single digit range at reported rates as well as excluding foreign exchange. This reflects our confidence in the growing momentum of our growth portfolio including products such as Opdivo, Reblozyl, Breyanzi, Camzyos, and Sotyktu. As a reminder, the Sotatercept royalty will be included in the other growth revenue line. We continue to expect gross margin to be approximately 74% and as we saw last year, we should see a sequential dip in Q2 related to our sales mix excluding Acquired IPR&D.\nWe continue to expect our total operating expenses to increase in the low single digit range, reflecting incremental costs associated with the recent acquisitions, partially offset by the realization of internal savings through the productivity initiative I mentioned earlier. Given the timing of the deal closures, we expect to come in at the upper end of our guidance range with an expected step up in Q2 and the remaining OpEx to be more evenly spread across the back half of the year. We remain aligned with our previous operating margin to target at least 37% through next year. For OIE, we now expect approximately $250 million of expense, primarily reflecting the debt financing costs from Karuna and RayzeBio. The tax rate was affected by one-time nondeductible expense of the Karuna acquired in-process R&D charge, which impacted our non-GAAP net income.\nExcluding this impact, the estimated underlying tax rate in the quarter was about 19.5%, and as a result we now see full-year underlying tax rate of about 18%. Before we move to Q&A, let me take a minute to review some of the key highlights on our call today. We grew the top line, we advanced the pipeline, and we are executing our productivity initiative, and our expectations for the underlying strength of the business remain unchanged from the beginning of the year. Finally, I'd like to recognize our BMS employees around the world for their unwavering hard work and commitment as we continue to make progress in strengthening the company's long-term growth profile and bringing truly transformational medicines to patients. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tim for Q&A.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks David. Could we go to the first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. As a reminder to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad to remove yourself from queue. Please press star then two. Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst in Biotech and Pharma, Bank of America\n\nMorning everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had one for Chris or maybe for David on the cost savings. How much would you say was legacy Bristol, either workforce or facilities versus optimizing integration of all your recent deals? I guess I'm trying to get a sense for whether you think there's further optimization to come as you guys focus on the new launch portfolio. Thank you\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGood morning, Geoff. I'll let David answer that.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks Geoff, for the question. The majority of the savings come from the historical BMS. As we talked about, the main drivers of the $1.5 billion savings really came into three buckets. First was really looking at the portfolio. Obviously with Mirati, Karuna, and with RayzeBio, we have really important portfolios that we're bringing into the overall portfolio. That gave us the opportunity to look at that and maximize the ROI in totality of the portfolio as well as adjusting for some updates, new data, and the competitiveness. The second thing that we really looked at for legacy BMS is how do we become more agile, quicker decision making, and streamline the organization by removing layers of management so decisions can be made more quickly. And there we talked about the roughly 2,200 impacted employees as a result of those changes.\nThen lastly, we went through all of our third-party relationships, continuing to look for efficiencies and third-party service providers. That was the last category. A lot of those activities are also legacy BMS. So the vast majority of the savings are coming from our in-house existing operations.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, David. Can we go to the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director in Biotech Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. Obviously a lot of moving parts. Operationally, strategically, I think investors have been keen to get a sense for how you're thinking about potentially a trough level of earnings. I think the notion that there might be some visibility into where you could begin to see some growth. And I know in your vocabulary you use about exiting the decade and into the next. Help us with where you are with that thinking since we haven't had that clarity with all the moving parts. But, but how are you thinking about the potential to communicate that kind of timeline and model?\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nOkay, thanks Chris. I'll take that one. I think they're embedded in that question. Maybe two things. First is how we're thinking about how we're going to guide around this trough and then there's maybe a second question in there which is when we think we'll see that trough and what's the timing of it with respect to the first question? Look, we've been engaging with investors on this topic over the last number of months. Bit of context here. Given industry dynamics, we certainly, I believe companies in this industry need to be judicious with respect to providing long-term guidance. But we get why you are asking the question here because it's something that we're going to need to continue to engage with investors on to strike the right balance in terms of how we think about providing guidance on this topic.\nOne uncertainty that we know that's related to this question though is the impact of IRA on Eliquis. And once that price is public and remember that's going to happen in the September timeframe, we'll provide the impact of Eliquis both on the top line as well as on EPS in terms of how we think about the timing of the trough. Based on our current plans, we start to see an impact in 2026 and then as we said earlier in the year, we anticipate to be returning to growth before the end of the decade. And then obviously we're clearly focused on accelerating both the timing and the pace of growth in the back half of the decade. And that's going to influence timing as well. But thanks for the question, Chris.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nCan we go to the next question please Rocco?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nQuality Compliance Associate, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just a two-parter. Coming back to the restructuring, I guess the first part is the redeployment of savings going to be mostly focu sed on the R&D side or on SG&A. And just related to that, in terms of investment in the growth drivers, it seems like elements such as payer dynamics and competitive launches are impacting uptake of some of the new launch assets. I'm just interested in which products you see having the greatest potential for improvement with further investment and how you, I guess, balanced SG&A vs either further R&D or just dropping some of those savings to the bottom line as you're considering kind of how to redeploy that $1.5 billion. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Chris. Let me just say a couple words, and I'll turn it over to David for the first part of your question, and Adam can come in on the back end first. As David mentioned, when we thought about these efficiencies, we were really thinking along three lines. The need to invest in the pipeline, ensuring that we had adequate investment for our growth products, and then needing to be more agile and focused as an organization in terms of how we think about allocating those redeployment opportunities. I would say generally speaking they're in that order with the majority going back into R and D. But David, do you want to start?\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. And Chris, thanks for the question. The way to think about it, about 2/3 of the savings associated in the R&D area and about 1/3 is in M&A. But importantly, if you really think about the acquisitions that we've just done, if you think about Mirati and Krazati in particular, you know, really important development programs in first-line lung, both the doublet as well as the triplet, then if you think about Karuna and Adam can talk further about this. We see multiple indications, billion-dollar indications in this space. We talked about schizophrenia, excuse me, the adjuvant schizophrenia as well is moving into Alzheimer's with agitation and psychosis. So there's significant investments that we have to make there. And then if you think about radioligand and RayzeBio, you know we see multiple INDs being able to come out of this.\nWe're also finished the manufacturing facility in Indianapolis. We're going to be able to supply our clinical studies out of that. So, significant investments in those three areas, which, through all of that as well as reprioritizing our existing BMS portfolio, what we've been able to do is increase the ROI of the portfolio, but just as importantly, we increase the growth profile of the company in the second half of the decade. So, there's a lot of work that's going under the surface in order to continue to maximize the value of the portfolio and strengthen the growth profile of the company. Adam?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYes, Chris, thanks for the question. So we're making good progress across the totality of our growth portfolio. As David shared, we saw strong year-on-year demand growth across the majority of our growth products, and we continue to be focused on accelerating our key brands, and we're doing what we said we would do as we continue to drive our growth portfolio. So just a few of the products that, you know, I think is important to mention. Opdualag has become a new standard of care in first-line metastatic melanoma, grew 76%. Reblozyl continued to deliver strong performance post first-line COMMANDS approval, grew over 70% as well. We have increased investment at the end of last year behind products like Sotyktu, Breyanzi, and Camzyos. Camzyos continues to demonstrate strong growth. We had 25% growth of new patients added onto commercial drug quarter-over-quarter. Breyanzi.\nWe also increased our investment. We're a much stronger supply position today than we were last year and increasingly being recognized as a best-in-class CAR T. As David mentioned, we're readying for the launch of Breyanzi in September, which is a very significant multibillion-dollar opportunity. You know, I would say that, you know, product like Abecma has been, you know, more challenging for, you know, for us. But we have an opportunity now with KarMMa-3 approval to work to return Abecma to growth over time as we move into a larger patient population. But adding it all up, we continue to make good progress in delivering strong commercial execution and performance.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Rocco, could we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research, Senior Biotech, and Biopharma Analyst, BMO\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Kind of a follow up to what we've been talking about. So when you talk about the cost savings being reinvested, do you mean that you're going to manage your margins by titrating the reinvestment of the cost savings? Are you going to deploy the $1.5 billion, kind of informed by the science or potential for growth? Then a follow up, as you mentioned, you're going to discontinue and externalize several clinical assets. Any commentary as to which ones you're thinking about? That would be great. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Evan. We'll have David start and then Samit.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thank you, Evan. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're looking at our operating margins as we previously communicated, in that 37% range. So that $1.5 billion of savings that we'll achieve by the end of next year, that's being reinvested both in the portfolio, as I described earlier, particularly with the acquisitions that we did. But we've also had good progress like Opdualag lung where we're going to continue those clinical studies as well. And all of that put together, as I was saying, really strengthens not only the ROI, but the growth profile of the business in the second half of the decade. And I'll turn it over to Samit on the assets that we're looking at to externalize.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, David. Just to build on what David said from a pipeline perspective, we took a very thoughtful approach to see from our rich pipeline, what are the assets that we are not going to be continuing on our own. So first thing that we looked at is the evolving science from the ongoing exploration of our clinical assets. An example over there where we look at CTLA-4 in our pipeline that we were developing, we had set the bar with Ipilimumab, which is already a high bar, to then look at the data. Then we decided that if the data are not going to be better than Ipilimumab, we shouldn't be continuing that program. So we decided not to continue with that.\nSimilarly, when we looked at external and internal data for the SIRP-alpha program that did not meet muster and we wanted to look at the real return on that investment as well for patients. So we are not going to continue that program. The second way we looked at it is that the science may be really good. Data evolution is really good. But does it really make sense for a company our size to continue a program if it's not going to be ultimately a growth driver? So from that perspective, if you think about BMS-986158 where the data are pretty good and myelofibrosis, but really from our perspective does not meet the threshold to be driver for our growth potential. So that program we are not going to be continuing.\nAnd then, of course, we continue to look at our desire to be either first in class or best in class product profile. So, from that perspective, we continue to focus on what we will continue versus not. Overall, I would say, Evan, that we have discontinued about 12 programs at this time, but it's a continuum. And so, throughout the year, we'll continue to look at these same principles and see what else we need to take out from our pipeline and either externalize it or not be able to develop it further.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Samit. Can we go to the next question, please Rocco?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to check in on your thoughts around IRA and the impacts associated with that as we approach 2026 in particular. And if you might be able to provide us any color on progress or process in the quote unquote negotiations or price fixing that may come from the US government\nThen just the second question. Hoping you might help frame for us the Opdualag opportunity in lung cancer and when we might gain some incremental visibility on that. Is it going to be more from clinical trials hitting ClinicalTrials.gov and we'll get some information in that regard first or will we actually see the data in this potential subset? Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question, Seamus. Maybe I'll start, have Adam weigh in a little bit more on IRA. With respect to the ongoing discussions with CMS. We're not going to be commenting. As I said earlier, we will have the outcome of that public in September, and we'll be able to provide more insight at that point. But Adam, you can speak to some of the other aspects of IRA and then Samit.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thank you, Chris and Seamus. Thanks for the question. As it relates to IRA, there are obviously multiple components to it. There's the negotiation. There's also the change in the Part D benefit design. So in 2024, we don't anticipate significant impact across our portfolio across, you know, Eliquis, Revlimid, or other brands. We do expect, though, more substantial changes to the Part D benefit next year since the products are impacted by the redesign. We are carefully evaluating each product individual dynamics now, and we'll see into the future. And we're monitoring very closely to understand the impact of, for example, out-of-pocket caps and other shifts that are happening in the system.\nSo as we move from a $3,500 cap to a $2,000 cap, we would expect to see more patients' ability to fill their medicines and improve as the cost becomes lower at the pharmacy counter. But obviously we'll need to do more, see more data before we can provide additional details.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Adam, and then thanks, Seamus, for the question. For Opdualag. Let's just take a step back and understand what we were planning to do and try to do so for Opdualag. We conducted a study of Opdualag plus chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. At first we wanted to define the dose, so we tested a couple of doses in the first part of the study and in the second part of the study. Then we randomized the patient to receive Opdualag plus chemotherapy versus Nivolumab plus chemotherapy. And as we have said before, what we wanted to understand is the drug applicable for all patients or are we going to find a differential activity in a subset of patients?\nWhat we have said is we have found a subgroup of patients where the drug's activity is good and encourages us to now go into a III trial. And so we are looking forward to presenting the data in the second half of this year as well as initiating the trial versus standard of care in the second half of this year. And we are planning that we'll be executing that as soon as we have that ready, you will be hearing about it. In addition to that, Opdualag has, of course, other opportunities. As you know, we are already waiting for the data for the adjuvant melanoma trial, and we are looking forward to the data evolution towards the back end of this year in first line hepatocellular carcinoma as well.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks very much. Rocco. Could we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-part for me on the CAR T franchise. David, I think you mentioned something about Abecma ex-US pricing dynamics, some change there to help boost access. Can you just provide a little bit more detail if that was a one-off in a specific country or what's going on there? And then on Breyanzi, Gilead has talked more recently about moving in the US out to some of these secondary community hospitals as they think about expanding, particularly on the second-line label indication. And so is that something that you guys are considering as well or do you feel pretty good about your current footprint for Breyanzi at the primary academic hospitals? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Terence. I'll let Adam take both of those.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Hi Terence. Thanks. So as it relates to Breyanzi, what we saw in the quarter was we were able to stabilize the decline; the US sales were roughly flat versus last quarter. What you're referring to internationally is we did see strong demand growth, which we expect to continue. But that demand growth was offset by negative pricing and securing reimbursement mainly in Germany. So that's where that took place. And now with KarMMa-3, it gives us the opportunity to have a different conversation with our customers about our data in a larger patient population. And you know, our objective is to return Abecma to growth over time as we move into this larger patient population. Now for Breyanzi, we're very excited about this product. In Q1, we increased sales over 50% versus the prior year.\nWe anticipate robust growth this year because not only just in accelerated growth in LBCL as Breyanzi is increasingly recognized as the best-in-class CD19, we also expect to see expanded indications. We just received approval in the US for CLL, and with additional approvals anticipated next month in follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. This is going to roughly double the addressable market for Breyanzi. We're also very encouraged by our expanded manufacturing capacity, and now in a much stronger position to meet demand. We're seeing about 20% outpatient use today for Breyanzi, and we expect that to continue based on the differentiated safety profile. So taken together, we're very excited about the growth profile of Breyanzi.\n\nOperator\n\nCan we go to the next question, please?\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Jolly\n\nSenior Equity Research Associate, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, thanks. This is Adam on for Tim at Wolfe Research. So just on Sotyktu, can you give us some updated market share metrics? Things like new to brand share or versus Otezla in the oral category, percent use in first line versus later lines, that sort of thing. And also any details on when the free drug program might begin to wind down. Thanks.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSure, I'll take that. Adam, thanks for the question. So we're continuing to make progress with Sotyktu and we're executing our plan. We delivered in the quarter what we said we would do and that's reaching approximately 10,000 paid prescriptions. That's what we shared in January and we expect to roughly double that to 20,000 paid prescriptions in Q4. So that's what we're focused on driving today. Remember, we also said there would be an increase in gross-to-net due to broader rebating needed to secure improved access and this impacted sales in Q1. But the volume that we'll see will more than offset that throughout the year. So we talked about improving our access position and aside from the wins that we announced last year in CVS and Cigna ESI, we saw access improvement with Sotyktu which was added to Optum.\nAs David mentioned, we do expect to announce additional improved formulary access, including a large PBM with approximately 30 million lives. We remain focused on securing zero steps by 2025. When you have that better access position, the need for a bridge becomes less and less important. Basically when you look at, you know, when you have better access, patients move faster into commercial product because they go directly to the specialty pharmacy. As far as market share, look, this is a highly competitive market. We look at launch analogs at the top of the funnel or written prescriptions. TYK2 performance is ahead of products like Trimfya and Cosentyx.\nAt the same time of the launch, we are laser focused on share growth versus Otezla, which is a critical area of focus and becoming the oral standard of care in the market over time.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Rocco, could we go to the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, sir. Our next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks very much and thanks for all of the detailed perspectives that you're sharing. So I'm hoping that you can help with other income prospects in the future, including the outlook for AstraZeneca other incomes. Run rate and then the anticipated step down in coming years. Thanks very much.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Dave. David. Yeah. So you know, this year was the big step down in the PD-1 rate, and then the other thing impacting that is the diabetes that will step down next year as well. The other thing to keep in mind, as I said in the prepared remarks, is, you know, on the interest for the additional debt that we just did. That was the big change in the guidance that we just provided for this year, going from $250 million of OIE income down to $250 million of expenses, and the bulk of that is related to the additional interest cost, which is around $13 billion with 5.3% interest rate, and that's slightly offset by the royalty income.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, David. Could we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much for my question. I actually want to probe the trough guidance comment a little bit further. It does seem like that you are considering it, but if that is the case, can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes there regarding the timing of such guidance? I'm asking because it depends on when you think the trough is, if it is 26 or if it's 28, because you might not want to provide if it is 28 just now because it is still a little bit uncertain regarding the timing of it. So what are the puts and takes regarding the timing of it when you eventually decide to provide it? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, so maybe I'll start and then David can chime in if he has any additional, anything else that he would like to provide. I think the way we're thinking about the trough guidance and again, it's something that we have been engaged with, with investors for the last number of months. I think the way I would think about it is first and foremost, probably the underlying question on guidance right now is what is the impact of IRA on Eliquis? We will, as I said earlier, be in a position in September when the price for Eliquis coming out of the IRA process is known and public at that point to talk about what that price is and the impact on Eliquis on both the top line and as well as on EPS.\nThen in terms of how we're thinking about the timing of the trough again, and we said this back at the beginning of the year, we see the impact starting in 2026 and our plan is to be growing by the end of this decade. David, anything else you would add?\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nI think you covered it, Chris.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks. Thanks, Chris. Can we go to the next question, please, Rocco?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst in US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the callers today, I wanted to dig into Camzyos for a second. You did update ACC and sort of the curtain raiser that went with that seemed very positive. And just when you think about that REMS registry data and the potential to potentially get the REMS modified down the road, should we be reading into that data any level of confidence or anything on that front you want to message? And I guess along those lines as well. Just, I believe, housekeeping on: Did I hear a $20 million inventory impact in the quarter? I know there was something that was called out on the slides, but I'm not sure that was quantified. Any help there would be great too. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks, Carter. Maybe Samit can start and then Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thank you, Carter, for the question. So for Camzyos, we remain obviously very confident in the overall profile of Camzyos. It has been a very transformational therapy for patients. And as you mentioned, the data at ACC clearly showed from the patients that have been treated in the real world that there is transformational outcome. And from a safety perspective, with 80% of the patients being treated at the 2.5mg and the 5mg dose, the overall outcomes remain really, really positive as well as the impact on the ejection fraction is minimal at best. So certainly it gives us an opportunity to collate that data and inform the conversations continuing with the FDA at appropriate times. Remember, we also got the non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy study that we'll be reading out early next year.\nSo that will provide another opportunity for us to also engage deeper into conversations for the REMS program as a whole and how we can bring this therapy to more patients, as well as decrease the burden on the patients. With that, let me pass it on to Adam to comment more.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Carter, thanks for the question. We're pleased with Camzyos' performance in the quarter. We saw a nice acceleration of new patient starts. We saw about a 25% increase in patients added to commercial dispense, but that was offset, as you mentioned, by approximately $25 million inventory drawdown from Q4 to Q1. And, you know, we saw a slight gross-to-net impact as well from copay restart that happened at the beginning of the year. What we see from Camzyos is consistent positive feedback from physicians and patients. It's very positive. We also are making very good progress in the launch internationally as we work to secure reimbursements. So we're seeing good momentum for Camzyos and we feel good about the performance of this important product from now until the end of the year for sure.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. This is a different version of earlier questions, but there are a number of potential obstacles in Bristol's future: Eliquis, IRA price and patent expiration, Opdivo, patent expiration, other patent expirations, et cetera. But based on your replies to those earlier questions, it sounds like that Bristol views the IRA price of Eliquis as the single biggest obstacle to profits in the next decade. Is that the conclusion that you'd like us to draw? And then the second question is that it was noted Revlimid free drug was lower in Q1. Just to confirm, is that consistent with prior Revlimid guidance, and what is the reason it is lower? Was there just fewer patients requesting free drug or did Bristol change the terms? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb",
    "content2": "So Steve, I'll start and then I'll ask Dave to take the last part of your question. We've highlighted the issue around the Eliquis price and the negotiations because that is an important consideration in the midterm as we think about this sort of transition period that going through that we've talked about in the middle of the decade. So we'll have greater insight into what that impact is later this year, and we'll be able to provide more of an estimate for the impact both on top line and on EPS as we get into the back half of the decade at that time. What I would say though, as I step back, I mean clearly you've articulated that the importance of Eliquis, and as we've discussed in the past, we have a number of LOEs that we face during the course of the decade.\nI think it's important to note as well that we've talked a lot about the importance of the growth portfolio that we had. We saw nice double-digit growth with that portfolio in the quarter. We actually are now about 40% of the overall business is comprised by that portfolio of products. Remember, this is a diversified portfolio of assets across each of our therapeutic areas. We feel good about the potential of that portfolio going not only through the end of this year, but to be a catalyst for growth in the back half of the decade. Then we saw very nice progress with the pipeline over the course of the quarter.\nSo I think it's important to recognize that while IRA has an impact in the middle of the decade, we feel very good about being able to more than compensate for that with a very young and attractive growth profile coming from our growth portfolio and the pipeline. David.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, and Steve, on your question around Revlimid, just a couple comments I'll make on that. One is what I said is that, you know, the free drug programs come down to normal levels, so no change in, you know, the program there. Just throughout last year, you know, those levels came down in the start of this year. Remember, every calendar year it starts again back at traditional levels. So that was in relation to that comment. The other thing as it relates to Revlimid is as we said, there's no change to our guidance this year. As previously said, it was a $1.5 to $2 billion step down this year and the same next year. So for this year, if you remember, we exited last year at $6 billion.\nSo we'll be in that $4 to 4.5 billion is our best view this year, and then further step down next year. So we'll be through the LOE of Revlimid, you know, basically at the end of next year. And then as Chris talked about, you know, we'll get insight to what's happening with Eliquis from an IRA perspective when that price becomes public here in September. And recall that the LOE for Eliquis is in 2028. And then lastly the thing I'd say about from an LOE perspective as it relates to Opdivo is, you know, that LOE is in December of 2028, so 29 is when that LOE would start. And then three things I'd say about that as we think about that franchise. One is we're looking forward to launching the subcutaneous formulation of that early next year.\nWe believe that will help that franchise continue into the next decade. I think you've heard Samit talk about Opdualag and that combination. We're really excited, number one, with its performance and standard of care and first-line melanoma. But also with the data that we're seeing in lung, we're really excited about continuing that program into phase III and bringing that. And also there's other tumor types that Opdivo will come in. So as we think about that franchise, there's multiple avenues for that franchise to continue into the next decade.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nJust adding one thing, Steve, around Revlimid, we had seen some volatility in generic dispensing in the quarter, including some generic supply shortages. So Reblozyl and our legacy portfolio continues to be strong source of cash flow for the organization.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Trung Nguyen with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrung Nguyen\n\nProgram Manager, UBS\n\nHi guys. Trung Nguyen from UBS. Thanks for the question. Two from me if that's okay. Just one on the cost saving program. How is that $1.5 billion split between this year and 2025? There's no change to your OpEx guide, but I think you noted savings were absorbed by the deals. Is 2024 the main year? You'll see most of these costs realized, and then just on Abecma, you have KarMMa-3 on the label now. You noted it's going to be important for growth. How quickly can we start to see that helping? Is it realistic to see an inflection immediately? Thanks very much.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question. Trung, David, then Adam.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, the vast majority of the savings comes through this year because if you think through the actions that we're taking, whether it's positions, the portfolio actions, we made those actions immediately and the third party spend will receive that, and then you have it annualized fully next year. So that's really the difference between 2024 and 2025. But it's safe to say that most of all the actions we're taking, 90% of those are being done this quarter.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. Turning to Abecma, we're certainly pleased with the regulatory approvals of KarMMa-3 in a triple-class exposed setting in the US, in Europe, and in Japan. This will remain a very competitive space with multiple products and modalities available. Our focus is on educating physicians on the KarMMa-3 data, Abecma's differentiated predictable safety profile, as well as the manufacturing reliability that we've had with Abecma. We're also focused on expanding our site footprint in the US and around the globe, making Abecma available to more patients. So we believe that there is a place for multiple assets in this market and our objective is to return back into growth over time as we move into a larger patient population.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Matthew Phipps with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Phipps\n\nGroup Head of Biotech Equity Research and Partner, William Blair\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions, Adam. I was wondering if you can comment on: is there any path to grow Opdualag in melanoma outside the United States or will additional data be needed? And then maybe for Samit on KRYSTAL-12, I don't suppose you can give us any tidbits on trends and overall survival at this point. I know the study's ongoing there, but maybe if not just confidence in that data set as it stands today, being able to support full approval.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, I'll start. Thanks for the question. First, I'd say we're pleased with our continued progress as Opdualag has become the standard of care in the United States. In first line metastatic melanoma we saw over 70% growth versus prior year and our market share now is above 25% in the US and we still have further room to grow, penetrating what's still around 15% monotherapy use. It's exciting because we're also starting to launch internationally in markets like Australia, Canada, Brazil, as well as several European markets. We still have not had an opportunity to launch in Germany, but we are working on that negotiation and we're hopeful we have an opportunity to launch there sometime in the back end of this year and into next year.\nAdditionally, as spoken earlier, we're very pleased to have the proof of concept study with LAG-3 on top of PD-L1s and chemo in first-line lung cancer. And you know, when you add that up, coupled with opportunities with lung and adjuvant melanoma, Opdualag truly has the potential to meaningfully extend our IO franchise well into the next decade.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you for the question. If I think about KRYSTAL-12, remember this is a study with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival, and you will see the data being presented at ASCO. Overall survival data remains immature at this time, so I will not be able to comment on the specifics of that. But really excited for the confirmation of the single arm study previously done now with the randomized study.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Samit. Let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\nOlivia Brayer\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHey, good morning, guys, and thank you for the question. What does the commercial rollout strategy look like for KarXT as we look past that September PDUFA and any thoughts around Medicaid negotiations? And then when do you think we start to see some meaningful growth from that franchise? Whether that's next year or more so in 2026. Thank you.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAdam. Yeah, thanks for the question. So we're very excited about the opportunity to launch KarXT later this year. This is a very important drug with significant commercial potential. As we talked about, KarXT will be the first innovative therapy in schizophrenia approved for decades. And what we've shared is KarXT offers Zyprexa-like efficacy without the significant adverse events that's plagued the D2 such as weight gain, hyperlipidemia, EPS. And we know how compelling this is for physicians. We are rapidly preparing for the launch, and the plans are going well, and we will be ready to launch by the summer, well in advance of our PDUFA date. We've been focused on prelaunch efforts and made very good progress preparing for the launch. So Karuna had made good progress in sourcing a very experienced commercial organization.\nOur field medical and our access teams have already begun meaningful conversations with thought leaders and payers. Our prelaunch efforts today are focused on driving awareness of this new mechanism. We're currently building out a large neuroscience field sales organization. In fact, we've increased the investment across multiple fronts to maximize the opportunity that we have. So we also need to ensure that physicians have a positive first experience. So we're focused on building our customer model to make sure that we have the optimal physician, caregiver, and patient support. And as you alluded to, we know that achieving rapid access is important. And so this is a largely Medicaid and Medicare opportunity around 70%. And our access teams are ready today. You know, we will leverage our large access organization to ensure rapid access for patients.\nOur teams have already been out meeting with state Medicaid directors, and the feedback on the product profile has been very, very positive. So over half of state Medicaid programs either have no step edits or a single step edit. So our goal is to improve the quality of access to only one step edit, which we know is going to take some time, but we're very confident in our ability to achieve quality access for this product. So given a 26 September 2024 PDUFA and some of the timelines to attain broad Medicaid coverage, we effectively see this as a 2025 launch. But we're very excited about the potential of KarXT, and we plan to make this a very big product for Bristol Myers Squibb.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. We're starting to run a little short in time. Maybe take two or three more. Can we go to the next one?\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on Opdualag phase II for frontline small cell lung. I know full dataset is set for readout in the second half, but can you share if what you've seen is any different or comparable to the other LAG-3 non-small cell data sets such as TACTI?\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nCertainly, I can take that question. Look, obviously can't comment on what others have seen. All we know is they've seen six patients' worth of data. Hard to compare six patients' worth of data with more than 200 patients treated with Opdualag plus chemotherapy in the first-line setting. What we have seen is overall review of our own data set, looking at the various endpoints that we looked at as well as the biomarkers we looked at in our trial. And we remain confident in the profile of the drug to take it forward into phase III.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next one, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kirpa Devarakonda with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nVP of Biotechnology Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nGuys. Thank you so much for taking my question and for all the color on the call. I had a question about your acquisition of RayzeBio and now that you've got enablement and we're seeing it's getting to be very competitive, just wanted to see what the urgency and what Bristol strategy is to build out the radiopharma pipeline and also when, you know, when can we see more details on what the priorities are and also regarding actinium production going live. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nWell, let me start and then I'll ask Samit and Adam to speak. Let me just at a high level though say that we continue to be incredibly excited about radiopharmaceuticals as a platform. It's one of the fastest growing platforms in solid tumor oncology. We believe we have a best in class asset that we've acquired with Rayze. The integration of that team has gone very well. We continue to be very excited and happy with the bringing online of the facility in Indianapolis. So in terms of us getting that asset, incredible enthusiasm and the integration has gone well with Samit. Maybe you and Adam can speak to details.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thank you for the question for Rayze. As Chris just mentioned, the platform is absolutely exciting and very encouraging data that we have seen emerging from the first program that is already in III for the SSTR-directed radioligand therapy. And that III program is right now enrolling in the GEP-NET indication as well as the small cell lung cancer I studies ongoing. And we are looking to see a couple of other indications added over there and we're designing those trials as we speak and conduct those. So it holds a huge amount of promise because of the specificity of the directed radiation to the tumor itself. Thereafter we're looking forward to additional IND filing later this year and that might then be able to start our very specific tumor-directed indication within HCC at the back half of this year.\nThen thereafter we're looking to see an IND generation coming from this platform as we go forward within Indianapolis manufacturing facility now up and running. We're looking forward to supplying the actinium part of it as well as the drug product towards the back half or back end to early part of next year, and that will certainly help in terms of continuing the supply and taking it forward. We are learning lessons from the frontrunners, and those lessons will be very helpful as we go into the commercial stages in a couple of years.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAdam, anything to add?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, I'll just add just a few things. RayzeBio was an important strategic acquisition that we believe continues to diversify our oncology portfolio. As Chris mentioned, we see this as a modality that's going to continue to grow over time. It'll be a competitive space. But what we liked about RayzeBio, this is going to be an IND engine and the lead program, RYZ101, is already in phase III development as you heard earlier for GEP-NETs. But we have opportunities in small cell lung cancer, in breast cancer, and potentially many other tumor types. So this is tremendously complementary to our existing portfolio.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to our last question if you don't mind, Rocco.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. Our final question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nMorning. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Evie on for Akash. We just have two quick questions. The first one is a follow-up for KarXT. So do you think patients on the drug will develop tardive dyskinesia? If not, how will that help position KarXT in the schizophrenia market? Our second question is for CAR T. So why do you think CAR T for autoimmune is more attractive than CD19 bispecific? And also would you consider approaches that don't require leukapheresis? Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSamit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSure, thank you. First of all, great profile for KarXT that I think Adam has spoken about earlier from a safety profile perspective, and the data has recently been presented also at the SURS conference, where we do not see the same toxicities that are seen with the atypical, such as the tardive dyskinesia, the movement disorders, and many of the other elements that have been spoken about. So I won't repeat. So that's why we are very confident on the profile and looking forward to bring it to the patients with schizophrenia.\nAnd then, as David said earlier, with other indications as well for AD psychosis, agitation, bipolar disorders, and others that we are exploring on the CAR T side, certainly an advantage for a single infusion leading to good outcomes for patients, especially starting with SLE in the refractory setting where patients have had multiple other treatments, ongoing, and organ dysfunction that occurs in these patients. That is the advantage. A single infusion, if that can cause tremendous transformational outcomes for these patients. As you know, our program is quite large, so we are also looking at multiple sclerosis, as well as systemic sclerosis, as well as idiopathic myositis. So those programs, as they enroll patients, will generate the data, and we are hoping to be able to present some data from SLE later this year. Certainly future approaches might include non-lymphodepletion therapies, but we're not ready for that right now. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nBoard Chair and CEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Samit, and maybe I'll just close by saying first, thank you all for joining the call today. I know it is a very busy day for all of you, so maybe I'll just leave you with a few things first. We're off to a very good start in 2024. Our performance this quarter reflects execution and actions that we've taken to strengthen the company's long-term growth profile. Our business outlook remains unchanged from the beginning of the year, and of course, we look forward to sharing our continued progress on future calls. And with that, we'll close the call. And as always, the team is available to answer any questions you have following today's discussion. And I hope all of you have a very good day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

Please go ahead.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nWell, thank you and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our Q4 2023 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Chris Boerner, our Chief Executive Officer, and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer, and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development. As you'll note, we've posted slides to bms.com that you can use to follow along with for Chris and David's remarks. Before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statement. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com, and with that, I'll hand it over to Chris.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks Tim and good morning to all of you. I'm very pleased to be speaking to you on our earnings call for the first time as CEO, and I'm excited about the opportunity for our company to continue to deliver transformational medicines for patients. Please turn to slide four. Q4 2023 was a good quarter including strong sales momentum in our in-line and new product portfolio with 9% growth and nearly $10 billion in revenue with growth across multiple key brands including ELIQUIS, OPDIVO, REBLOZYL, OPDUALAG, BREYANZI, CAMZYOS, and SOTYKTU. We also continued to generate significant cash flows from operations of $4.3 billion in the quarter, and as you'll hear from David in a few minutes, we expect to grow our business this year. During the Q4, we also achieved important pipeline milestones and several key business development transactions to strengthen our growth profile.\nThis is an important time for BMS. I know that many of you are focused on our strategy to navigate the decade and on the importance of disciplined execution at the company. We are writing the next chapter for BMS, and with that comes an opportunity for change. So let me take a few minutes to tell you about our strategy to navigate our LOEs and be very clear about my focus on execution. Let's go to slide five and how we see the company today. When we look at our business, it's comprised of two portfolios. First, we see a legacy portfolio of well-established products facing headwinds such as IRA. Though this portfolio is declining, it is expected to continue to generate strong cash flows and to enable investment in our future growth drivers.\nSecond, we see an expanding portfolio of growth products, many of which are relatively newer to the market and have significant expansion potential. When you look at these portfolios combined with our exciting pipeline, you can see how it all comes together as depicted on slide six. As we think about this decade, we see three distinct periods: a near-term growth period, a transition period, and potential for sustainable top-tier growth which we plan to drive in the back end of the decade. Between now and the middle of the decade, our focus will be on maximizing the opportunity we have with our growth portfolio. This, along with pipeline execution, can best position the company into the transition period.\nThen, starting around 2026, our exposure is most acute, and our focus will be on shortening the transition period as much as possible by accelerating our R&D programs, executing on product approvals and launches while maintaining P&L discipline. Finally, in the latter part of the decade, around 2028 and beyond, we plan to deliver sustainable top-tier growth, and we have the portfolio, pipeline, and financial flexibility to support this opportunity. Many of you recognize the first two periods. However, the late-decade return to growth phase is less appreciated externally, including a number of important products that are not fully appreciated in consensus models today. What supports our confidence is our expanding pipeline, recent deals, and newly launched products.\nOur strategy is to minimize the transition period coming in a few years while maximizing our growth in the back part of the decade, turning to slide seven. My confidence in our strategy is supported by the fact that, compared with other companies that successfully navigated similar periods, we have some clear strengths: an expanding growth portfolio across multiple therapeutic areas, an exciting pipeline, differentiated platforms, and continued financial strength to further invest for growth with business development. And the momentum from our most recent quarter to capitalize on these strengths is clear. From slide eight, in October we told you we would strengthen commercial performance, and during Q4 we've been making progress. We have increased investment behind key growth brands such as CAMZYOS and SOTYKTU. We are re-accelerating growth for REBLOZYL by capitalizing on the launch of the compendia indication in first-line MDS.\nOur efforts to further establish OPDUALAG as the standard of care in first-line melanoma are driving further growth, and we have made progress expanding capacity for cell therapies, particularly setting up BREYANZI for significant expansion this year. In R&D, we delivered important milestones including recharging our early-stage pipeline with 10 INDs as we told you we would do at our R&D day, delivering the approval of AUGTYRO in first-line ROS1-positive lung cancer, and advancing our key platforms including initiating our CD19 NEX-T study in multiple sclerosis for our cell therapy program, and showing early but important phase I data for the ARLD prostate asset from our targeted protein degradation platform. Importantly, we have been active in business development.\nSpecifically, we further diversified our oncology portfolio with targeted oncology assets such as KRAZATI and PRMT5 from the recently completed Mirati acquisition, the planned addition of a differentiated bispecific ADC from SystImmune with exciting phase I data across tumors including lung and breast cancers, and the planned acquisition of RayzeBio bringing important radiopharmaceutical assets, pipeline and manufacturing capabilities, and we announced the planned acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics bringing KarXT, which we believe will be a transformational medicine for patients with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, psychosis, and potentially other indications with multibillion dollar sales potential. We are looking forward to launching this medicine after closing the transaction later this year. These deals add important growth substrate to our company and diversify our portfolio for the long term. Let's turn to slide nine. Execution for me is a top priority.\nStarting with commercial, the focus is on continuing to accelerate performance for key growth drivers. This means ensuring the right resourcing and investment levels across our most important brands, and it means having the best people and driving accountability for delivering results in R&D. Building on the momentum I described coming out of last quarter. As we highlighted at our R&D day, we have a strong pipeline with the potential to deliver over 16 NMEs through the late 2020s, and here we need to accelerate and deliver top-tier productivity. We are also taking a hard look at our pipeline to prioritize investments for projects with higher return opportunities and discontinuing lower priority programs and our OpEx base. As we told you, we are going to absorb the OpEx from Karuna.\nThis means we need to make room for these assets by focusing our OpEx base to increase efficiency and productivity. We have begun executing across all three fronts and look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters. We plan to grow our business this year as shown on slide 10. David will provide much more detail on our guidance in a few minutes, but what's important from my perspective is that getting our long-term plan to work requires us to deliver well in the short term. A few weeks ago, I reaffirmed our long-term targets as of that date. At that time, I also said we were going back to our historical practice of providing mainly annual guidance with total company rather than product level revenue targets. Therefore, we will not be updating those long-term targets moving forward.\nWith that in mind, you can see that our growth portfolio is strengthening, and our guidance reflects expected top line growth this year. Before I hand the call over to David, I would like to thank my BMS colleagues for their efforts at serving patients during 2023 and for their enthusiasm for embarking on our next chapter as a company. David?\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Chris, and thank you all again for joining our call today. As Chris mentioned, this is an important time for BMS as we embark on our next chapter. Transforming Our Portfolio. Our performance in 2023 reflects the continued strong growth of our in-line and new product portfolio and the ongoing erosion of REVLIMID. Let's get started with our top-line performance on slide 12. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made versus the same period in 2022, and sales performance growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. We delivered sales of approximately $45 billion in 2023, which reflected 8% growth from our in-line and new product portfolio offset by unfavorable impact of generic entries.\nDuring the year we saw continued strong demand for our key inline products such as ELIQUIS and OPDIVO, while new products gain traction in the respective markets. If you turn to slide 13, you see our 2023 sales split between legacy and growth portfolio that Chris spoke about earlier. This is how we will report our business as we move forward. What I can tell you is the transition of the business is already well underway from our legacy to our growth portfolio. For 2023, our growth portfolio delivered approximately 15% growth. This supports our strategy that Chris discussed earlier. We see our legacy portfolio providing a solid foundation for cash flow generation in the near term while the products within our growth portfolio grow in significance. Let me dive deeper into our Q4 and full year sales performance starting with our oncology portfolio on slide 14.\nWe are pleased with the robust demand for OPDIVO, which achieved strong global sales growth for the year. In the Q4 US sales grew 12%, primarily driven by increased volume and core indications including first-line lung, upper GI, and adjuvant bladder cancer, partially offset by optimized growth in first-line melanoma. During the quarter, US and international markets each benefited from approximately $50 million of favorable stocking. Internationally, sales grew 4%, led by increased demand for lung and gastric cancer indications and from expanded reimbursement. Turning to OPDUALAG, which more than doubled its full-year sales in 2023 and is now a standard of care treatment first-line melanoma. In the Q4, US sales grew 80% versus the prior year and 15% sequentially, benefiting from its strong market share position with respect to sales of AUGTYRO in the Q4.\nWe launched in late November and upon US approval and Q4 sales reflect the initial wholesaler stocking during 2024. We look forward to bringing this important medicine to more patients. Let's turn to our Cardiovascular on slide 15. ELIQUIS generated over $12 billion in sales in 2023 and continues to be the number one oral anticoagulant globally. In Q4, sales grew primarily driven by demand in the US as we continue to gain market share from competitors. Internationally, sales in Q4 were broadly flat driven by generic entry. In several European markets, sales of CAMZYOS in the Q4 and full year were strong including $88 million in Q4. As of 31 December, we had roughly 4,500 patients on commercial drug and on average we have been adding roughly 1,000 patients to commercial drug per quarter.\nThe momentum in the US for CAMZYOS is expected to continue in 2024, and internationally, we expect modest near-term sales contribution based on timing of reimbursement in newly launched markets. Turning to our hematology portfolio, performance on slide 16. Starting with REVLIMID, global sales for the full year were approximately $6 billion. Looking forward, we anticipate continued variability in REVLIMID sales quarter to quarter based upon historic patterns in specialty pharmacy dispensing. We anticipate an additional volume of US generics to enter the market in March. We continue to forecast a step down in REVLIMID revenues in the range of $1.5 to 2 billion this year. Now moving to REBLOZYL, global sales grew 40% in 2023, surpassing $1 billion on an annualized basis for the first time. For the quarter, REBLOZYL generated 60% sales growth driven by strong demand and supported by our broad US first-line label.\nSales grew 75% in the US in Q4, internationally. REBLOZYL continues to be launched in different markets across the globe, including recently in Japan. Turning to our cell therapy portfolio, starting with sales of ABECMA in the US, we continue to experience competitive impacts. While ex-US demand remains strong in the quarter, we remain focused on demonstrating the benefits of the product profile to our customers in anticipation of expanded use in the US upon the potential approval of KarMMa-3 data in third-line plus setting. ABECMA was recently approved in Japan in the third-line setting based on KarMMa-3 data, and last week we received positive CHMP opinion. Moving to BREYANZI, global sales doubled year-over-year, reflecting the strength of its clinical profile and our improved manufacturing capacity.\nWe are pleased to have received FDA priority review for all three of our expanded indications for BREYANZI and look forward to the PDUFA date in March for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and additional PDUFA dates in May for follicular, and mantle cell lymphoma indications. Looking to this year, we expect to see strong sales growth starting in Q2 driven by improved supply capacity and the potential for these new additional indications. Moving to immunology on slide 17, global sales of ZEPOSIA in 2023 grew 72% to $434 million driven by increased demand in multiple sclerosis, and ulcerative colitis. We remain focused on driving growth across both indications for 2024. Keep in mind the typical impact of US seasonal sales in Q1 due to co-pay assistance for commercially insured patients whose benefits reset. With SOTYKTU, our goal continues to be driving demand and broadening access.\nWe made good progress on both fronts in the Q4. Q4 sales in the US also benefited from a clinical supply purchase of $17 million. When you strip out the one-time purchases in Q4 and Q3, we showed strong underlying sequential sales growth of approximately 40% reflecting good pull through from CVS and increased demand. Going forward, the way to look at our progress in the US is through commercially paid prescriptions. As we build volume and improve access, we will be subject to higher rebates, which is something to keep in mind as you model SOTYKTU for 2024. Of course, Adam can talk more about this in the Q&A portion of our call today.\nInternationally, we expect SOTYKTU to gain additional country regulatory and reimbursement approvals over time. Switching gears to our Q4 P&L on slide 18, having just covered sales performance, let me walk through a few non-GAAP key line items. Gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 150 basis points to 76.4% compared to prior year due to product mix and lower hedge settlement gains, excluding acquired in-process R&D. Q4 and full year operating expenses decreased primarily due to timing of expenses in 2022. The Q4 decline was partially offset by increased investments in CAMZYOS, SOTYKTU, and the timing of pipeline investments. Acquired in-process R&D in the quarter with $600 million, which was partially offset by licensing income, resulting in an unfavorable net impact of $0.20 of EPS. The Q4 effective tax rate was approximately 14.9%, driven primarily by earnings mix.\nOverall earnings per share was $1.70 in the quarter and $7.51 for the full year. Now moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on slide 19, our financial position remains strong with approximately $12.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand as of 31 December, as we generate cash flow from operations of $4.3 billion in the Q4. Through our strong financial discipline, we have been able to invest in our business and further expand our portfolio, maintain strong operating margins, pay down debt, and return significant cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over the past three years, we've returned over $30 billion in shareholder distributions including the dividend, which we have increased annually for 15 years in a row. As you know, we're going to be taking on additional debt this year to finance our planned acquisitions of Karuna and RayzeBio.\nHowever, with our strong financial position, we plan to utilize our cash flow to pay down our debt. As we've demonstrated in the past, our plan is to repay approximately $10 billion of debt over the next two years to improve our leverage profile. Before turning to our line-item guidance, let me close with our 2024 non-GAAP guidance on slide 20, which includes Mirati but excludes the future impact of pending transactions SystImmune, Karuna, and RayzeBio. As we did in 2023, we were providing revenue guidance on a reported basis as well as on an underlying basis which assumes currency remains consistent with prior year. We expect 2024 revenues to increase in a low single digit range reflecting our confidence in the growing momentum of our growth portfolio excluding foreign exchange.\nWe expect revenues to increase in the low single digit, as well as driving our momentum this year, will be increasing the sales in our growth portfolio from products like OPDIVO and our recently launched products. As we said previously, we expect a more modest pace of growth than last year for OPDIVO, with the potential for acceleration in the back half of the year from new indications, and while our legacy portfolio includes assets that are maturing, we expect strong growth from ELIQUIS in the US this year as it relates to quarterly progression of our sales.\nA few reminders for products like REVLIMID, POMALYST, and CAMZYOS: keep in mind the typical impact on sales in Q1 due to patients entering the Medicare coverage gap early in the year, and for ELIQUIS, the coverage gap dynamic works in the opposite direction where we expect sales in H1 to be higher than in H2. As it relates to our line item guidance for the year, we expect gross margin to be approximately 74%, which reflects an evolution of our sales mix and the non-recurrence of hedging gains from last year, excluding in-process R&D. We expect our total operating expenses to increase in a low single-digit range, reflecting the additional costs of Mirati and the reallocation of costs and efficiency initiatives in M&A as we continue to invest in our new product launches.\nThis aligns with our previous operating margin target of at least 37%. This means we will remain focused on driving operational efficiencies across the organization, including portfolio prioritization, to enable us to invest for growth while maintaining high productivity. We expect OIE to be approximately $250 million of income, reflecting the PD-1 royalty step down in January from 6.5% to 2.5%, as well as the financing costs related to the Mirati acquisition. We project our tax rate to be approximately 17.5%, reflecting an increase due to non-recurrence of one-time tax benefit that occurred in the Q3 of last year, plus the anticipated impact of Pillar 2. Finally, we expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share within the range of $7.1 to 7.4.\nFor clarity, our 2024 guidance excludes the three pending transactions. As a reminder, SystImmune is expected to add about $800 million in in-process R&D. Karuna is expected to be about $0.30 dilutive to earnings relating to financing costs, as we plan to absorb the OpEx, and RayzeBio would be approximately $0.13 dilutive to earnings, with half in financing and the other half in OpEx. When we report in Q1 in April, we will update our guidance to reflect the deals that have closed at that time. Before we move to question-and-answer session, I want to thank all of our colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication in 2023. This is an exciting time for BMS as we write a new chapter and maintain a singular focus on improving our growth profile over the course of the decade.\nI believe that our focused financial discipline coupled with strong cash flow generation are key advantages that will enable us to further diversify our portfolio and invest in growth opportunities to deliver for patients and our investors. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Chris for Q&A.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nFirst question please. But before we do, just a reminder, it's obviously a busy morning for everybody, and to the extent you can keep to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible, we would appreciate that. So let's go to our first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe first question will come from Luisa Hector of Berenberg. Please go ahead.\n\nLuisa Hector\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nGood morning. Maybe I'll start with ABECMA because you have the FDA ADCOM coming up. So just your level of confidence heading into that. Any comments on how the label changes are impacting or not for all CAR T's, and just any pressure that you're seeing from CARTITUDE-4 and how that might evolve in 2024? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nFirst, we'll have Samit answer and then go to Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Luisa, for the question from ABECMA perspective. KarMMa-3 data. We've shared updated data at ASH last year, and as you saw, it was very clear what is driving the overall survival curves. It's because of the crossover that the patients have allowance for the progression of their disease on the standard of care arm, and therefore that curve does benefit, and therefore you see much of an impact on that overall survival benefit that these patients are getting. We are very confident, and we are very much looking forward to having that dialogue and discussion with the regulatory authorities and looking forward to to getting this product to the patients as soon as possible. So the second part that you ask about the label updates that the FDA is seeking right now for all CAR T products around T-cell malignancies.\nOnce again we've treated thousands of patients, and from our perspective, as we look into our data, we do not see a causative relationship to CAR T cell therapies in terms of BREYANZI and ABECMA. So we'll continue to have the dialogue with the regulators on that as well. As we look to the final wording, the FDA will with that. Let me pass it on to Adam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Lisa, for the question. So we do expect growth in 2024 for ABECMA. KarMMa-3 is a key catalyst for growth this year, and as Samit said, we do look forward to the ODAC to reinforce the benefits of ABECMA in a triple exposed patient population. As you can imagine, our commercial teams have been launch ready for some time, and we're also seeing continued strong international performance, and we'll launch both ABECMA and BREYANZI in a number of new countries this year. We've stated that we've seen continued impact from additional BCMA agents. This is a highly competitive market, putting some pressure on ABECMA growth.\nBut our teams are squarely focused on opening new accounts, expanding our site footprint not just internationally but also in the US, and closing the gap on efficacy perceptions, including solidifying any misconceptions around ABECMA's efficacy and reinforcing ABECMA's safety profile, particularly as it relates to CNS neurotoxicity. So taken together, we're confident in the back of this profile. Looking forward to the ODAC and I'm confident that we'll be more competitive this year.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Could we go to the next question please, Andrea?\n\nOperator\n\nAndrea, the next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. Maybe a bigger picture question on the new launches. I think those new launches did about $3.6 billion in 2023, and I know you're not giving longer term targets, but just any rough framework of how to think about those sales in 2024, I guess. Is there a target you're providing if there's not a target? Can you maybe just talk a little bit about any areas you see that maybe you're more or less optimistic versus where street consensus is? I know there's quite a bit of focus on the trajectory of those ramps. Thanks so much.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question, Chris. Maybe I'll just start very quickly and then I'll turn it over to Adam. As we had mentioned, we're not going to be providing individual-level guidance, and I think we had alluded to that when we met at JPMorgan three weeks ago. But we did give and we'll continue to give company line-item guidance as we did today. And then you'll see as we report it today, we're going to be talking additionally about the growth portfolio that we have, which is going to be important as we think about the business going forward. Adam, do you want to talk about the new launches?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah. So thanks for the question, Chris. I mean, we're coming off a good quarter and we have a strong foundation for growth to build upon. We're focused on continuing to accelerate our new product portfolio and maximizing the 10 launches that we've had over the last four years. We're certainly prioritizing the execution of our new launches and adding investment to accelerate the performance of our growth portfolio for products like CAMZYOS, SOTYKTU, and BREYANZI. You've also seen strong performance from REBLOZYL and OTEZLA.\nWe also have some of our growth products like ELIQUIS and OPDIVO, which will continue to contribute significant growth in 2024. And finally, we're readying for the launch of KarXT in September, which we're excited to launch this product which will be the first new treatment in decades for schizophrenia and also brings a multibillion-dollar opportunity to the organization. So adding it up, that's why we're excited to continue to drive commercial performance in an important 2024.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAndrea, could we go to the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Shibutani of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Goldman Sachs)\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for taking our questions. This is Charlie on for Chris. We had a question on the subcutaneous OPDIVO strategy for a potential launch there. We heard from one of your competitors yesterday on their potential for a subcutaneous CPI where they were considering what sounded like a careful pricing strategy in the context of potential intravenous biosimilars that could be on the market at the same time. So just wondering how you're thinking about pricing on a potential subcutaneous OPDIVO. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAdam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks, Charlie, for the question. We're not going to comment on the pricing of Sub Q, but I can say, as you know, we announced positive results of our Sub Q OPDIVO study. In the quarter, we anticipate a launch early next year. As a result, we have the opportunity to potentially benefit thousands of patients well into the next decade. With Sub Q OPDIVO, I think an important thing to keep in mind, remember, Sub Q has the potential to address the treatment burden for both patients and physicians due to less than 5-minute infusion time. We talked about our ability to convert roughly 30% to 40% of the overall US OPDIVO business into Sub Q. That's why we would expect to see this franchise endure into the next decade. We certainly look forward to bringing this important formulation both to patients and physicians.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question please, Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Andrew Baum of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nHead of Global Healthcare, Managing Director, and Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nYeah, thank you. A question for Adam. Have you rethought the use of bridge programs for launches in the US following your SOTYKTU experience and then, you know, same topic. Realistically, how long do you think it will be before SOTYKTU starts printing revenues through the combination of broader coverage as well as just getting these patients off the bridge? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAdam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Thanks Andrew. Let me just take the second question first and then I'll answer as well the bridge question. So SOTYKTU is an important brand for, for the organization and we are executing against our plan. You know, we shared last year we're focused on two areas. The first is driving demand at the top of the funnel and the second is securing access and of course, as you mentioned, pulling through those patients from bridge to commercial. And we're making progress against both.\nYou heard from David. When you normalize sales, excluding clinical trial orders, net sales increased about 40% versus Q3. Access is critically important in this highly competitive market to drive commercial sales. So we secured ESI, and now Cigna, in a one-step position that adds approximately 40 million lives to complement CVS, which was in a zero-step position, will continue to be this year, and that's probably 25 million lives. We're actively negotiating with other payers and look forward to updating you on additional progress in due course. I think this year it's really important to focus on increased paid commercial prescriptions for SOTYKTU.\nWe will continue to build volume from both new patients that are going to move directly onto SOTYKTU at the specialty pharmacies, which quite frankly become easier with the improved access that we have now, as well as moving patients out of bridge and onto commercial products. David talked about where we are today, but in Q1 we expect to see around 10,000 paid prescriptions for SOTYKTU. He also mentioned there will be an increase in gross-to-net due to broader rebating, which was needed to secure improved access. That impacts net sales in Q1. But we expect to see good momentum in growing our base of paid prescriptions this year, and we plan to get roughly double that level around 20,000 prescriptions in Q4, and that volume momentum will more than offset the gross-to-net reset in Q1 as the year progresses.\nAs you also asked around conversion, conversion is going exactly as we expected. We've made very good progress in shifting patients from CVS, from the bridge to commercial product. We talked about taking around two to three months for patients to move from bridge to commercial, and as a result you saw that 40% sequential growth that excluded the clinical trial purchases. And so we'll continue to drive demand and work to continue to improve moving patients from our bridge with our ESI and Cigna wins in 2024 and also work to secure improved access in 2025 as well, where it makes financial sense to do so.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Andrea, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Seamus Fernandez of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nSeamus Fernandez\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Securities\n\nThanks very much. So just a quick one here on REBLOZYL, the continued strength of the brand and the acceleration that we're starting to see. Can you just talk about what's driving that incrementally and maybe give us a little bit of a sense of how we should be thinking about the international opportunity for REBLOZYL in particular? Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAdam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Seamus, thanks for the question. The first-line MDS launch is progressing very well in the US with strong demand, supported by our broad label in an RS-agnostic patient population. Just take you back. We launched in late August and initially after the launch we saw rapid switches from ESAs to REBLOZYL.\nBut we're now seeing strength in first-line use across the RS-positive population and we're steadily building momentum in the RS-negative patient population, particularly in the community setting where the majority of patients are treated. We also have, after the ASH presentation, we've heard feedback from both academic and community physicians recognizing the durability of response and the ability to remain transfusion-independent as key features of the brand. So we're very pleased with the launch. As you know, we're seeing strong sales performance. We expect that to continue this year. REBLOZYL was also approved in Japan in mid-January. We're seeing nice uptake there and we expect European approval in the first half of this year.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. Let's go to our next question please Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you. On SOTYKTU, I think it was at Q3 you mentioned it would take longer to get no step edits. So I'm wondering what the current step edits are exactly. What brands do patients have to step through? Is it OTEZLA primarily or is it Humira, either brand or biosimilar or what? Exactly.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, Tim, thank you. As I mentioned, we've secured additional access at ESI and now Cigna in a one-step position. That really is regardless of the product. That could be a step after OTEZLA, could be a step after IL-17s or the IL-23 agents in the market. What's important is that adds another 40 million lives to complement our zero step edits in CVS. Taken together, that's 65 million lives today. We're continuing to actively negotiate with payers, and we will update you on additional progress over the coming months.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nNext question please. Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Trung Huynh of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my question. Just on IRA, I realize there's not much you can say about the negotiation where I think CMS has just sent their initial offer, but I was wondering more, how do you think about the impact? For ELIQUIS, given the patient mix is largely skewed towards Medicare, do you think there could be a potential uplift that could help offset that pricing erosion? How do you anticipate the commercial spillover from those pricing impacts?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYes, thanks for the question. I'll take that. As it relates to IRA, you know, we do expect an improvement in patient affordability as the patient out of pocket changes for patients this year and into next. We'll see this more acutely next year as out of pocket max is capped at $2,000, and then patients have 0% liability thereafter. You know, more broadly, we largely don't expect Medicare Part D design changes to impact our portfolio because that'll largely take effect in 2026 when branded REVLIMID will be fully eroded. As it relates to commercial spillover, I think it's important that we always look at multiple planning scenarios, including the risk of spillover, but also the potential opportunity as I just shared around patient affordability. There are pushes and pulls there with changes in the benefit design.\nWe are going to have to continue to manage potential spillover risk to commercial with the transparency of the MFP price on 1 September. We also do that today as we manage both books of business, and we'll need to continue to remain disciplined across our commercial payers. At the same time, just because a payer wants to include this in negotiating mix in commercial, it certainly doesn't mean that we have to agree there. We expect continued strong performance this year for ELIQUIS in the US and expect significant growth through the end of 2025.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Adam. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey guys, good morning and thanks for the question. Chris or David on capital allocation. You guys have some deals closing obviously in the first half of this year, would you say the balance of the year is more of a pause on deals with the focus on integration, or would bolt on still be of interest? I'm just trying to get a sense with all the launches operationally, whether newer products or more products, and integration could be a distraction to what you're doing commercially. Thanks.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks for the question, Geoff. I'll take that one. As we've discussed previously, as we think about capital allocation, business development continues to be a top priority for us. Obviously, we've just executed a number of deals towards the end of last year, and we've got to stay focused on executing those deals. Having said that, we certainly are going to continue to be interested in bringing innovation into the company that makes strategic and financial sense to do so. I would characterize those a bit more as bolt-on opportunities at this point. We're also, of course, continuing to look at partnerships and licensing deals as well, but that's how I would characterize it. Business development is still a priority.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, Chris. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Matt Phipps of William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Phipps\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nThanks for taking my question, Simon. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how many SLE patients do you expect to treat with the NEX-T CAR T program this year? Is the next step after this phase I study straight to a pivotal, give a sense yet of what that looks like?\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSamit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thank you for the question, Matt. Look, we are in the dose escalation phase. As you can recall, we have to go through one patient by one patient in the beginning, but very soon we'll be able to treat a number of patients at the same time. I can't give you a number in terms of how many patients we intend to treat at this time, but certainly the trial will remain open as we want to certainly get a good understanding of the efficacy and safety profile at the right dose for patients with SLE who have advanced disease. We do intend to present the data later this year emerging from the first trial in terms of what the next steps would be.\nWe will be engaging with some data in hand with the regulatory agencies in terms of defining what the trial should look like in this particular case, what a single arm open label study such as has been done with immunological malignancies, will that be the acceptable approach or will the regulators require a randomized approach? Those are yet to come, certainly looking forward to the emergence of this data and presenting that later in the year.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks so much. Let's go to the next question, please Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nAndrea, the next question comes from Steve Scala of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. I believe Milvexian's AFib trial right around now is at the point where Bayer stopped its Factor XIa AFib trial. Can you reassure us that events in the Milvexian AFIB trial are progressing as expected? Summit, based on everything you know, are you very confident in Milvexian and AFib? The trial has been underway for approaching a year, so I would imagine some sort of look has already been taken. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSamit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Steve, for the question. Very thoughtful as always. What we can tell you is the trial is continuously progressing. All three trials, AF, second restore prevention, and ACS, enrollment is going very well, and certainly the DMC continues to oversee the trials, and we do not have any indication from the DMC otherwise. We will continue to look at the data from a perspective of safety, as well as the DMC will continue to look at the data.\nThere's nothing more to report at this time. I would say one thing though, that assuming just because a competitor trial failed for whatever reasons and the doses that they picked, we don't have that same philosophy. We actually did conduct two very well-designed studies. We picked differential doses between atrial fibrillation versus SSP and ACS, and those are the reasons to believe. We will certainly be looking forward to the readout of these trials in 2026 and 2027.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you. Samit, Andrea, can we go to the next question please?\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on your thoughts on BREYANZI commercial potential this year, particularly in the second line setting, and how the final OS data might impact that. Anything you're seeing with respect to outpatient treatment for BREYANZI here. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAdam then Samit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, certainly. Thank you. I'll start off and pass it on. R&D always comes first before commercial. I'll start off with BREYANZI. Certainly looking forward to these three PDUFA dates that Adam had mentioned earlier, as well as David in his remarks, for follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and CLL. Of course, planning to do a few more trials in these lymphoma patients because that remains a very high unmet medical need. There are multiple other cell therapy products that are in development. We'll be talking more about that from the out of spec or the continuation of those discussions. We continue to engage with the regulatory authorities, and we'll update at a later date once we have an inkling in terms of where we are landing on that.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. We're pleased with BREYANZI performance in the quarter. You saw double-digit growth quarter on quarter. We also expect to continue to make good progress with BREYANZI in 2024, supported by strengthening of our vector supply. In fact, we will see supply materialize even further in Q2 and expand to support our new indications for BREYANZI, starting with the planned CLL indication in March, where BREYANZI will be the first and only cell therapy agent to have this indication. As some had alluded to, we're making good progress in reducing turnaround time, out of spec, and drug product capacity.\nAs we move through the course of the first half of the year with its broad label in LBCL and now with three FDA prior reviews in the first half of the year, BREYANZI has the potential to treat the broadest array of B cell malignancies of any CAR T. In these indications, we believe this will double the addressable patient population for BREYANZI. We're very pleased with what we're seeing, the progress that we're making. We are seeing increases in outpatient use because of the best-in-class safety profile that BREYANZI brings, and we expect strong demand growth this year.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question, please, Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman (BMO Capita\n\nManaging Director, Head of Healthcare Research, Senior Biotechnology, and BioPharmaceutical Analyst\n\nHi guys. Hi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Last week you presented initial data from your antigen receptor ligand directed degrader at ASCO GU, then hosted an event for the sell side. I'd love for you to speak to why you think it's important for investors and analysts to pay attention to a phase one asset at a company as large as Bristol Myers. I know you have a lot going on in your pipeline. Why should we be focused on things like this? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSamit, we'll start and then we'll turn it to Adam to get some feedback from KOLs on this product.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you, Evan. I think it's a good question, and the reason we believe that it is important for us to be able to highlight this are multifold. Let me start off by saying, remember last year at R&D day we had said that there are two platforms that are very critical, and we believe in, and we are continuing to progress on them. AR LDD, the molecule, is the first protein degrader from that platform that goes into solid tumors, and we wanted to absolutely be able to demonstrate that it is, as we anticipated, it is progressing well, showing efficacy and manageable safety profile in patients with late-line prostate cancer.\nAs you saw from the data, the PSA 30, PSA 50 reductions, the durability of that, and those are truly correlated. If you look at the data sets as well as in literature, the correlation of that impacting the overall survival. We are truly excited about what we've seen thus far. We are of course enrolling more patients. We are in the dose optimization phase. We've had interactions with regulatory authorities and now planning for initiating the next phase of development registration trials within the next six to 12 months. Let me just pass it over to Adam to comment further from his perspective as well.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks, Amit, thanks for the question. We're excited about, as said, the platform of protein degradation as it relates to AR LDD in prostate cancer. This diversifies our IO portfolio even further to complement some of the recent deals we had. You know, a number of KOL and community feedback coming out of the ASCO GU presentation and field have been enthusiastic about the profile, particularly around the efficacy of the asset, the durability of response. When we asked community physicians, they were reassured around the safety profile as well, stating that it was a manageable safety profile. You know, they were enthusiastic about moving this into phase three registrational studies and look forward to having the opportunity to treat patients with late line prostate cancer.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb",
    "content2": "Let's go to the next question, please Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst of US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question for Adam. I wanted to come back to CAMZYOS. You sort of have shown a pretty steady kind of addition of the sort of the same number of patients each quarter. I would expect, now that you've gotten your feet underneath with the launch, that that number would be increasing each quarter like we see with most launches, which I guess suggests there's some other gating factor, whether that's logistics or whatnot. Can you maybe elaborate on what you're seeing and whether you disagree, agree with how I frame that there, and to whatever extent you can comment on the trends going forward in 2024. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nAdam.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSure, Carter. Thanks for the question. We are continuing to make very good progress with CAMZYOS. As we talked about, we're investing further behind the brand in unbranded and branded direct to consumer. We do expect to see continued, steady, and consistent growth. As David mentioned in his opening remarks, we're averaging around 1,000 patients on a quarterly basis. Patient and physician feedback continue to be very positive.\nRemember, these patients are going to be on treatment for a very long time. Taking me back to JPMorgan, if you recall, Chris showed an analog where CAMZYOS is tracking akin to a very strong CV launch, in this case Entresto. This is the way that cardiovascular launches uptake, and we are focused on continuing to drive breadth in our top COEs. We're continuing to expand outside of our top COEs, and we're working to increase diagnosis rates by activating patients via our new DTC advertising. That coupled with new launches internationally, we are confident that this is going to lead to continued and sustained growth for this important brand.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question, please Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Wells Fargo)\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, this is Serena on from Mohit Bansal. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to ask about the phase two OPDUALAG readout coming out early this year in first line lung cancer. I was wondering how meaningful you think this data could be considering that the impaired arm is OPDIVO-chemo vs OPDIVO-Yervoy being the approved regimen. Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSamit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you for the question. Obviously we're looking forward to seeing the data for OPDUALAG, a randomized phase II study looking at the combination of OPDIVO relatlimab plus chemotherapy, comparing to OPDIVO-chemo. The intent of doing this is twofold. One, we wanted to get the contribution of component question out right away so that we can show the contribution of relatlimab on top of OPDIVO with chemotherapy. Number two, we also wanted to plan this study so that when we do go to phase III, the appropriate control arm that is most widely used right now is pembro-chemo, and therefore we are set for that, dependent of course on the data. Later this quarter and this year you'll be able to hear about the data and then based on the data we will be making decisions on where to go with this drug.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Truist Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. This is Kripa for Robyn. I have a follow-up question on CAMZYOS. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you think the recent data from a competitor might broadly impact the landscape in HCM. Obviously, the drug is not approved, but do you see these data improving awareness? Based on that, do you expect to see any sort of inflection points? Also, can you talk a little bit more about your efforts ex US and if we should continue to see steady growth or any sort of inflection points based on the reimbursements that you expect? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYes, thanks. Samit then Adam.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thank you for the questions. The way we would look at it is that the competitor data actually further strengthens our confidence in CAMZYOS. Within the CAMZYOS clinical trials, we now have three phase III trials that have read out with amazing transformational data. You've seen the data for EXPLORER, you've seen the data from VALOR, and recently we had the readout of a phase III trial in Japan as well, which replicates the results that we've already seen for the first two trials.\nAs Adam would tell you, we've treated now thousands of patients, and that data also continues to showcase the efficacy of the drug as well as maintains the safety of the drug. As you will see when the data are presented from the real-world setting at ACC, what the overall safety profile of the drug is. What I would say is that CAMZYOS lives up to its promise of a transformational potential for the patients, and any patient who goes on the drug usually doesn't want to come off because of the benefit that they're achieving. Adam?\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYes, thanks for the question. Certainly, when we look at the top line data from SEQUOIA, it's consistent with our internal expectations. We'll obviously need to see the data set, but ultimately, we don't see any clinically meaningful differences in the data. In fact, when we spoke to many TLs after those data were shared, they have stated that Aficamten data appears similar and undifferentiated from CAMZYOS. They also, of course, want to see the broad data set. They also talked about the difference in pVO2 being not a clinically meaningful endpoint, and likely any differences are due to differences in patient populations across the two studies. I can assure you we will certainly be prepared for Aficamten when it comes to market with our leading cardiovascular organization, and we have maintained a consistent view that we will remain leaders in this space.\nI've also said, though, that the important thing to keep in mind with this class is we do see that another competitor could be a net positive to help drive awareness for patients with symptomatic OHCM and increased diagnosis rates, which is also really important. Finally, as it relates to expansion outside of the US, we're just starting to see expansion outside of the US. We've launched in Germany, we'll prepare to launch in Japan, in China in mid year, and a host of other markets. We'll start to see that those sales manifest in the back end of the year and into 2025.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to the next question, please Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from James Shin of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on ZEPOSIA. Adam, I think you mentioned earlier or late last year the access was still improving for UC. Is that access going to improve meaningfully this year, or is it going to take a little bit more time? Sort of like a similar situation to SOTYKTU and psoriasis.\n\nAdam Lenkowsky\n\nChief Commercialization Officer, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Overall, we're seeing solid and continued quarterly and year-on-year growth. As David shared, we showed 66% growth versus prior year, and I think ZEPOSIA has been really a tale of two launches. Its performance amongst the oral competitors is solid. We expect continued share growth there, and we're growing in the face of a declining oral market in favor of B cell agents.\nWe continue to have an opportunity for continued growth in UC, which, as you know, is a very competitive market. You know, we're making progress as volume and share are increasing. We are focused on expanding the breadth of prescribers. We're continuing to position ZEPOSIA earlier in line to treatment and the opportunity for additional indications like Crohn's disease. The data readout later this year will also add to the, you know, the sales for ZEPOSIA. We do expect to see continued growth for ZEPOSIA as patients continue to accumulate, and physicians continue to gain experience with the product.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nGreat. We maybe have time for one or two more. Maybe we go to the next question for now and then one after that. Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. The next question is from Akash Tewari of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nAkash Tewari\n\nGlobal Head of Biopharmaceutical Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks so much. Can you comment on what drives your confidence on the Alzheimer's psychosis trials reading out positively, any color on what percent of patients you think will be able to get on the high dose of KarXT and what percent of dropouts you think will occur in the treatment arms for these ADEPT trials? Should it be roughly similar to what we've seen in the schizophrenia studies? Thank you.\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nSamit.\n\nSamit Hirawat\n\nChief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThank you. Thank you for the question, Akash. Look, our confidence in trial remains very high. The reason for that is if you go back to the first publications of the xanomeline trial, that was a study that was published, I think, in 1997 in fact. If you look at that data, that is a positive trial, which tells us that M1, M4 muscarinic receptor agonists do work over there. The obvious issue over there was the toxicity due to the peripheral muscarinic agonism that was seen. That combination with trospium has led to obviously better outcomes as we saw in schizophrenia. The trial in AD psychosis is right now at the beginning stages. The doses are being tested right now. It's hard to comment on what the dose utilization would be, whether patients will be on the highest doses. It's too early to tell.\nWe'll have to get into it. Of course, Karuna and us, we continue to operate as separate companies right now, and once the transaction closes, we'll be able to get deeper into it and look at what the future looks like. We'll be talking about it at a later date. Thank you.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nLet's go to our last one, please Andrea.\n\nOperator\n\nAndrea, the next question comes from Rajesh Kumar of HSBC. Please go ahead.\n\nRajesh Kumar\n\nHead of European LifeSciences and Healthcare Equity Research, HSBC\n\nHi. Morning. I appreciate that you obviously give any color on ELIQUIS price negotiations, but when we look at your margin guidance this year. I'm assuming that you have made an assumption and that is implicit in that guidance, an outcome of this negotiation, or should we expect as we get more clarity to adjust your guidance from what you learned?\n\nChris Boerner\n\nCEO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nRajesh, thanks for the question. I'll try to start and then I'll turn it over to David to just talk a little bit about how we're thinking about margin. Correct. We're not going to be able to give any additional discussion around where we sit with IRA on ELIQUIS. We got the initial offer, we're going to follow the process they have, and the price will be public in September. We won't be providing additional details around that. Maybe David can talk to you a bit about how we think about margins generally.\n\nDavid Elkins\n\nCFO, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nYeah, just overall, as we guided, we anticipate gross margins to be about 74% this year. That's really driven by the LOE brands coming down. But as the growth portfolio continues to increase, obviously that will help offset longer term where those gross margins are going. We also said that our operating expenses grow in the mid- to low-single-digit range. And with that, really there's a lot going on there that as we said on Karuna, we're going to find savings and efficiencies in order to cover those expenses. But also, you know, as Adam indicated and I said in opening remarks, we're increasing, you know, our investments in ZEPOSIA and SOTYKTU. So you know, with that we're finding from our legacy brands refunneling those resources into that. And all that said, we'll be able to deliver a margin greater than 37% for the year, which we feel very confident about.\n\nTim Power\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Bristol Myers Squibb\n\nThanks, David. I think that was it for the time that we have. I thank you all for joining the call today. I know it's a very busy day for all of you. Hopefully you get a sense from the discussion this morning that we exited 2023 with good momentum to capitalize on the strategy that we have articulated about how we're going to navigate this decade. Of course, we look forward to sharing the progress against that on future calls. With that we'll close the call. As always, the team is available to answer any questions following today's discussion. I hope all of you have a very good day, and a good weekend. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect."

Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com. With that, I'll hand it to Giovanni.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was a solid quarter for the company. We delivered sales growth for our in-line and new product portfolios and continued to advance the renewal of our business, delivered important clinical and regulatory milestones, and further strengthened the long-term prospects of the company through the planned acquisition of Mirati. On my 49th and last quarterly earnings call, I am proud of where Bristol Myers Squibb is today. We have built a highly diversified business. The strength of our in-line products and the potential of the launch portfolio gives us confidence in the ability to navigate the Revlimid LOE through 2025. The focus is clearly on the second half of the decade. We continue to strengthen our position thanks to a growing registrational-stage pipeline and the ability to source external innovation through business development.\n\nOur R&D day highlighted the breadth and depth of our research efforts, which provide us with confidence in the long-term sustainable growth of the business. It has been an honor and privilege to work alongside my talented and dedicated colleagues at BMS over the past 23 years and to help grow this company into the industry leader it is today.\n\nYou all know Chris very well, and I am sure you will share my confidence in him as a leader. I'm excited to see the company's continued progress in delivering against our critical patient-centric mission. My sincerest gratitude goes out to all our employees for the work they have done and will do to enable BMS to improve outcomes for millions of patients around the world. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Chris to talk more about the quarter.\n\nThank you, Giovanni. Before I dive in, on a more personal note, I want to recognize Giovanni for his tremendous impact on the organization. He is consistently focused on ensuring that we are strengthening our company while delivering for patients, and I wish him every success in his next chapter. Let's start with our third quarter overview on Slide 5. As Giovanni said, we delivered continued top line growth for the in line and new product portfolio during Q3. We also advanced our pipeline and announced an important business development transaction with the planned acquisition of Mirati. You'll have seen that we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. We also updated our target for our new products to grow to more than $10 billion in 2026 and for our operating margin to be above 37% while reaffirming our other 2020-2025 guidance.\n\nI will give you more color on our outlook in a moment, so let me step back and provide some context.\n\nLet's turn to Slide 6. As I told you last month at our R&D Day. My objective as incoming CEO is to continue to position our company for sustainable long-term growth. Three levers I outlined there were commercial execution, R&D leadership, and strategic business development. I'd like to take a minute to tell you where we are on each of these, starting with commercial execution on Slide 7. David will provide more details in his remarks about our commercial results, but let me describe how I think about our performance and outlook. Let's start with our key in-line products where we are seeing good growth. Eliquis demand growth in the US is strong with continued opportunities for growth going forward. Consistent with previous years, revenues in Q3 were impacted by gross-to-net adjustments.\n\nWe expect these to normalize through Q4 as we've seen in previous years. Opdivo continued to see good demand growth in Q3. Importantly, we've delivered a number of important future growth drivers with new data and approvals during the quarter that I will describe momentarily. David will provide highlights for the remainder of the in-line and LOE portfolio. Turning to the new product portfolio overall, our new products continue to perform well, providing confidence in the portfolio's growth potential and ability to diversify our business over the long term. I would characterize the performance of these products in three categories. First, we are seeing strong performance for a number of products including Reblozyl, Opdualag, and Breyanzi. Specifically for Reblozyl we're seeing strong growth with a broad label for COMMANDS as Adam can discuss further, we're seeing encouraging trends in both first-line and second-line.\n\nWe are also very pleased to see that the NCCN guidelines recognize the importance of Reblozyl as an important treatment in first-line MDS for both RS-positive and RS-negative patients. For Opdualag, growth was also robust for the quarter, and the product is on the path to become the new standard of care in first-line melanoma. This product has considerable growth opportunity remaining in its existing indication, and we are continuing to study its potential in future indications, which Samit can speak to. Breyanzi performance was strong for the quarter, and we expect strengthening performance for this product heading into 2024 as manufacturing performance and supply continue to improve.\n\nSecond, there are a couple of products, notably Camzyos and Sotyktu, where performance is strong but growth has been slower than expected. For Camzyos, we continue to see steady increases in use, and all feedback metrics from customers and patients continue to be very strong. At the same time, getting cardiovascular accounts onboarded and the pace of getting patients onto therapy, as patients may see their cardiologist only one to two times per year, has resulted in a longer adoption curve. As we have shared, we expect consistent and steady growth akin to a cardiovascular launch for this important product, and we remain confident in our long-term projections for Sotyktu. The profile continues to be strong, and we're seeing nice increases in share. Access continues to be the main constraint for this brand, and why we will see broad and meaningful access improvements in 2024.\n\nGetting to zero step edits will take a bit longer than anticipated for some key plans given emerging payer dynamics in the immunology market. Importantly for both of these products, our peak expectations remain unchanged, though the time to peak will shift. Finally, I would highlight Abecma and Zeposia where performance has lagged expectations for Abecma in class competition and dynamics with bispecifics and late line multiple myeloma have impacted performance. At the same time, real world data generated by a consortium of KOLs demonstrates that our efficacy, safety, and reliability are quite competitive. This has been further strengthened by recent data in triple class refractory patients who receive bridging therapy presented at the IMS conference. Our focus will be on ensuring our teams are fully leveraging this breadth of data to effectively reinforce the profile of this important treatment. For Zeposia, performance remains strong in MS.\n\nIn UC, access has been a constraint that will require continued focus to unlock future growth. Again, Adam can provide additional context. Taken together, we now expect sales from this portfolio to be $3.5 billion in 2023. This is slightly lower than we expected at the start of this year. Looking forward, we see continued growth in the medium term. We do expect to achieve greater than $10 billion in sales for this portfolio in 2026 rather than 2025. The commercial team is laser-focused on building on the momentum of performance in the quarter and, importantly, accelerating performance where necessary. We are also further increasing our investment behind selected brands to ensure performance accelerates. Finally, I would highlight that our new product portfolio will expand this quarter with the addition of Repotrectinib next month and upon completion of the Mirati transaction.\n\nKrazati. Turning now to our R&D engine on slide 8. As I mentioned last month, we have exciting opportunities to strengthen our pipeline and deliver more important medicines to patients across therapeutic areas, including expanding our registrational pipeline from 6 to 12 assets over the next 18 months. Since our R&D day, we've continued to make progress in oncology. For Opdivo, we've delivered several growth drivers including US approval in stage 2 adjuvant melanoma, presentation of positive data for peri-adjuvant lung with CheckMate 77T, and for first-line bladder cancer with CheckMate 901. Importantly, we've met the co-primary endpoints for the subcutaneous nivolumab trial, CheckMate 67T. This has the potential to open a regulatory approval in indications that constitute approximately 65% to 75% of today's Opdivo business in the US and extend franchise durability into the 2030s.\n\nYou may have also seen that Mirati presented encouraging PD-1 combination data in first-line lung cancer at ESMO. These data further strengthen our conviction in the potential of Krazati and the value it will add to our oncology portfolio in immunology. Our LPA1 inhibitor has now been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in progressive pulmonary fibrosis by the FDA. This builds on the previously granted Fast Track designation from FDA for the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis indication. These actions reinforce the potential importance of this asset in these diseases with high unmet medical need. And importantly, our CD19 CAR-T cell therapy is making progress. We have started dosing patients in our lupus study, and today I can disclose that we have now achieved clearance from the FDA to begin our MS trial.\n\nThese are important milestones that illustrate our strategy of rapidly advancing cell therapies and into immunologic diseases and becoming leaders in the space, and we are moving forward with other assets in our pipeline. You can expect to hear more about our hematology assets at ASH later this year and about AR LDD at a medical conference early next year. Turning to business development, a key priority for capital allocation on Slide 9, as you know, BD has been a key component of our strategy to supplement our internal innovation. Our recently announced planned Mirati acquisition is an excellent example of a transaction with great strategic fit, compelling science, and financial soundness. Through this acquisition we're strengthening and diversifying our oncology portfolio with the addition of Krazati and potentially PRMT5, along with a pipeline of future KRAS inhibitors and enabling programs.\n\nWe maintain significant cash flow to support continued investments in business development, and this will remain a top priority for capital allocation for the company. Turning now to our scorecard on slide 10, I've already discussed many of the positive recent milestone achievements noted here. While we recently learned that the second line HCC study for Opdualag did not support moving forward in a registrational trial for this indication, we have a second study underway in first line liver cancer that we expect to read out next year. In addition, as discussed already, we've seen a number of important accomplishments not included on this slide, notably first line bladder and Sub Q Opdivo. All of this speaks to continued strong pipeline execution and the progress of programs that will become important catalysts for the future growth.\n\nTurning to slide 11, when you add everything up as we discussed last month, we have numerous levers to drive growth into the back half of this decade and beyond. I am confident in our ability to transform our portfolio both organically as well as through business development and to deliver new medicines for patients. With that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through our product performance and financial results in more detail.\n\nDavid, thank you, Chris, and thanks to all of you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Turning to Slide 13, let's discuss our top line performance. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made versus the same period in 2022, and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Total company sales in the third quarter were $11 billion, driven by continued growth of our in-line and new product portfolio, offset by the expected decline in Revlimid sales. Let's move to our new product portfolio on Slide 14. During the quarter, we delivered solid growth for the portfolio with $928 million in revenue. Growth was strong across the portfolio, though we have seen an impact of Abecma from both manufacturing site maintenance in June and from increased availability and usage of alternative BCMA targeting therapies for multiple myeloma.\n\nBased on the performance year to date, we now expect the new product portfolio to deliver roughly $3.5 billion for the full year 2023. This is primarily due to the impacts of our cell therapy franchise, particularly Abecma. As Chris mentioned, we are laser focused on continuing to accelerate growth of our inline and new product portfolio into the next year and beyond.\n\nLet's discuss performance of our solid tumor products on slide 15. Our flagship oncology product Opdivo continues to grow well with sales up 11% globally. In the US, Opdivo grew 9% primarily driven by demand. Sequentially, sales grew double-digit driven by demand and a reversal of roughly $50 million of unfavorable buying patterns in the second quarter. Outside the US, third quarter revenues increased 15% primarily driven by demand for indications such as lung and gastric cancer. This performance, along with potential new launch opportunities in perioperative adjuvant lung and first-line bladder, as well as in the recently approved adjuvant melanoma indication, reinforces our confidence in the continued growth for Opdivo. As Chris mentioned earlier, we now have positive data for the subcutaneous formulation. We believe this supports the potential for an important new option for patients and strengthens the franchise longevity into the next decade.\n\nWith respect to our next generation IO asset, Opdualag revenue nearly doubled as we build share in first-line melanoma in the US, we now see market share of roughly 25% with additional room to grow, particularly in the approximately 15% of patients that are still receiving PD1 monotherapy. Opdualag has become a new standard of care in patients with metastatic melanoma, where BMS total share is 65% in this important market.\n\nLet's now turn to Cardiovascular on slide 16. Eliquis continued to grow with $2.7 billion in revenue in the quarter. In the US sales grew 4% year over year driven by strong demand growth offset by unfavorable gross-to-nets due to channel mix including an impact of approximately $75 million in Q3. Internationally, sales were primarily impacted by generic entries in Canada and the UK, pricing pressures we mentioned in the past. At the same time, we're encouraged to have successfully defended our IP in several EU countries this year including France, Norway, and Sweden. Moving to Camzyos, our first-in-class obstructive HCM product, we are pleased with the continued growth of the product delivering $68 million of revenue in the quarter. In the US we added roughly 1,000 patients both to our hub and to commercial dispense.\n\nWe are very encouraged to see good persistence with roughly 3,500 patients now on commercial drug. Our patient base continues to grow as we steadily bring more patients onto treatment and convert them to commercial dispense. Turning to our hematology products on slide 17, starting with Revlimid, global sales in the quarter were just over $1.4 billion. At this point we expect revenues of approximately $6 billion for the full year, primarily due to higher level of demand for lenalidomide. Now on the Pomalyst, global revenues were down 2% versus prior year mainly due to free product dynamics in the US we described in July. Internationally demand for Pomalyst was stable. Revenues also benefit from a $40 million clinical supply purchase during the quarter. Turning to Reblozyl, which generated revenues of $248 million in the quarter.\n\nIn US, revenue growth accelerated, increasing 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased demand. With the COMMANDS approval, we are seeing increased use in first-line as well as an increase in second-line patients that are rapidly switching from ESAs to Reblozyl along with a continued increase in duration of treatment. Though it's early in the launch in first-line MDS, we're hearing very positive feedback on the profile, especially in the community setting. Overall, we're encouraged by the strong label for Reblozyl and first-line MDS-associated anemia, and we believe it sets us well to deliver this medicine to more patients with this disease. Moving to Abecma with revenue of $93 million in the quarter. This was impacted by the manufacturing site maintenance in June and the use and availability of other BCMA-targeting agents.\n\nTurning to Breyanzi, sales in the quarter were $92 million, more than double versus prior year and down slightly compared to prior quarter due to timing of infusions. As we mentioned in July, during the quarter we remained constrained with respect to vector. However, with continued strong demand in second- and third-line plus large B-cell lymphoma and an expected increase in supply next year, we are confident in our ability to grow in 2024 and beyond. Let's move to our immunology products on slide 18. Global sales for Zeposia were $123 million, up 75% compared to prior year in the US.\n\nIn addition to a $15 million contribution due to favorable gross-to-net and inventory in the quarter, we continue to be pleased with the momentum in multiple sclerosis with the best-in-class share within the S1P class and continued volume growth in a very competitive ulcerative colitis market. Outside US sales increased mainly due to demand in MS. Turning to Sotyktu, underlying launch trends remained strong. Sales in the quarter were $66 million, which included a clinical supply purchase of approximately $30 million, and we saw continued strong volume demand during the quarter with over 38,000 script equivalents dispensed since launch. We delivered over 15,000 script equivalents in the US during the third quarter. Within the oral category, our share is now roughly 40%.\n\nReinforcing that Sotyktu is establishing a position as the oral of choice in this market, and we are making progress converting covered CVS patients from the free drug program to commercial dispense. We expect this will take on average two to three months per patient. Building on our momentum, we continue to expect the further strengthening of Sotyktu next year.\n\nNow moving to the P and L on Slide 19, I will focus my remarks on a few non-GAAP key line items. Having just covered sales performance, compared to Q2, gross margin was favorably impacted by product mix acquired in process. R and D in the quarter was $80 million, which is partially offset by $12 million of licensing income, resulting in a net impact of $0.03 of EPS. The reduction of the effective tax rate during the quarter was primarily due to recently issued Section 174 guidance regarding deductibility of certain research and development expenses. This resulted in an adjustment in the quarter to our estimated tax rate. Overall, third quarter earnings per share was $2 per share, growing approximately 1%.\n\nTurning to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 20, cash flow generation and our balance sheet remained strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was approximately $4.8 billion with over $8 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand at the end of Q3, our capital allocation approach remains focused on business development as a top priority with the planned acquisition of Mirati as an example. We also remain focused on growing our dividend and on opportunistic share repurchases. In this regard, during the quarter we executed $4 billion ASR and expect that to be completed by the end of the year. Today we have roughly $2 billion of authorization outstanding. Lastly, turning to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 21, we continue to expect revenue to decline in the low single digits compared to last year.\n\nAs mentioned, we expect new products to be about $3.5 billion this year, and for Revlimid to deliver about $6 billion. Turning to OpEx, we continue to expect roughly low single-digit decline compared to last year, corresponding to roughly $4.4 billion expected in Q4. Based on the changes to tax I described earlier, we are revising our full-year effective tax rate to 15.5%. With respect to our earnings, we have increased the midpoint of our non-GAAP EPS guidance and narrowed the range to $7.50 to $7.65.\n\nWith respect to our medium-term guidance on Slide 22, as Chris described earlier, we reaffirm our low- to mid-single-digit revenue CAGR from 2020 to 2025 and the $8 to $10 billion growth from our in-line portfolio during this period. We have adjusted our new product portfolio target to greater than $10 billion in 2026, a year later than previously communicated. With respect to operating margin, we're restating our target to greater than 37% through 2025 to reflect continued strong profitability while enabling flexibility to invest in future growth and incorporating a dilution from Mirati. Now, before we turn it over to Questions and Answers, I'd like to recognize Giovanni's leadership of the company and thank him for his considerable contributions in transforming BMS. I also want to acknowledge the hard work of our teams around the world during the quarter.\n\nI know that our people remain focused on delivering for patients and will continue to do so under Chris's leadership moving forward. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim, Giovanni, and Chris for Q and A.\n\nGreat.\n\nThanks very much, David. Before we go to the first question, we know it's a very busy morning. We want to get to as many questions as we can. If you can try to keep to just one question per person, that would be very much appreciated. Keith, can we go to the first question please?\n\nYes. Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star, then 2. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. The first question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just maybe for me, just a bigger picture question. You're lowering the 2025 targets? It sounds like there's a couple of the products that adoption is just taking longer than expected. I guess what gives the company confidence that this isn't kind of a different dynamic with some of these products that isn't going to enable maybe some of those longer term targets as we look up to 2030 that you've announced before. So maybe just kind of elaborate a little bit more on how much of how do you make sure the company is positioning itself to hit those longer term peak sales, and do we need to maybe just rethink some of the peak sales potentials of some of these assets, given what we've learned from the launches over the last year or so. Thanks so much. Thanks, Chris.\n\nThis is Chris.\n\nI'll start and then I'm going to turn it over to Adam. I think it's important to step back and be clear on what we've said on this call. First, I think it's important to recognize that for the new product portfolio in totality, we continue to see very strong long term potential consistent with what we've said previously. There's been no change in the conviction for this portfolio overall and in fact the question really is a question of when, not if. We have, however, recognized the timing change that we've communicated today and that's really around a few things. First, there are, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, a number of products where expectations, where performance is achieving if not exceeding expectations. However, we also have to acknowledge that there are a few products where the dynamics are different for products like Sotyktu and Camzyos.\n\nThe reality is, while the long-term potential for these products remains unchanged, it's taking a bit longer, and Adam can speak to those dynamics, and there are a couple of products where performance needs to change. And so, for example, with Abecma and Zeposia, we know that we've got challenges there. The team is reorienting and making sure we've got the right resources and focus on delivering for those products. But I think it's important that when you step back and look at the portfolio in totality, our conviction around these products and the importance that these products will play in terms of driving long-term growth and helping us diversify the business that remains unchanged. When you then layer on that to good in-line performance with products like Eliquis and Opdivo, we're as confident as we have been on the long-term growth profile of the company.\n\nSo the focus right now is around executing on the commercial side, continuing to move the pipeline forward, and ensuring that we've got the right focus on bringing innovation in externally with business development. Adam, anything you would add?\n\nNo, I think you covered it very well.\n\nThanks.\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nThanks, Chris. Keith, can we go to the next question please?\n\nYes. And that comes from Jeff Mecham with Bank of America.\n\nMorning everyone. Thanks for the question. You know, you have recent data for Sub Q Opdivo. I guess the question is what's the.\n\nIncremental benefit here, and maybe how strategically important is this? You know, is this approach just given IRA implementation, and you know, potential opportunities.\n\nTo extend the LOE?\n\nThank you very much. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start. In spite of a lot of the progress, when you look at IO, there are still opportunities we know to improve patient experience and address the treatment burden that exists with these assets. And that's really where Sub Q comes into play. And we're very pleased with the data that we've seen with 67T. The data are compelling in our view, and we look forward to, after we finish the review, presenting those at an upcoming conference and obviously engaging with regulators. The way we've thought about the Sub Q program consistently is that this would address specific patient needs as well as the opportunity to address those centers where, for example, chair time is at a premium. And that's still where we think this will go.\n\nWe think that these indications will represent somewhere between 65% and 75% of the Opdivo business as it sits today. And with focused effort, we think we can convert roughly about 50% of the overall business over time. And so that's really how we're thinking about it. And if you sort of were successful in doing that, we think this has the potential to extend the franchise into the early 2030s.\n\nThanks Chris. Keith, could we go to the next question please?\n\nYes. That comes from Louisa Hector with Berenberg.\n\nOh hi. Thank you for taking my question. Still on the medium term outlook, can you confirm that there is no contribution from Mirati in that guidance? And then perhaps some comments around the lower margin expectation. Just is that purely linked to the new product revenue guidance or are there other factors at play? Thank you.\n\nThank you for the question. So the long-term guidance new product portfolio does not include anything related to from a Mirati sales perspective. If you do recall, we did say the dilution next year related to Mirati's about $0.35 as it relates to the margin. That does factor in how we view our margin going forward. If you recall previously, previously our mid-term guidance was margins above 40%. But we continue to see opportunity invest in our launch portfolio, invest behind products like Camzyos and Sotyktu as well as our cell therapies. But also we continue to see opportunities in our portfolio. As you know we had multiple readouts this quarter, you know, LPA being one of those, as well as additional indications for Opdivo and we had first-line COMMANDS.\n\nBut as we step back and what we shared at R&D Day, we see opportunities to continue to accelerate in our R&D pipeline. So that's why we revised our guidance to incorporate the dilution from Mirati, as well as the investments that we're making in a new product portfolio and the R&D portfolio.\n\nThanks David. Keith, can we go to the next question please?\n\nYes. And a question from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.\n\nThanks for the question. So just trying to get a little bit of a better sense on the 37% margin guidance. You know, is that something that we should anticipate is a potential floor in 2024 as you lose the Keytruda royalty or is it really sort of a sequential floor for margins in 2025 as you lose Sprycel and Pomalyst following the loss of the Keytruda royalty? So just trying to get a sense of kind of the path to 2025 as we move through the balance of.\n\nThis year and next year.\n\nThanks.\n\nYeah, thanks Seamus for the question. The 37% guidance is a floor that we've provided as we look forward to that midterm period, which is 2025. We haven't provided guidance yet; we'll do that on the fourth quarter earnings call as it relates, you know, to 2024, which I think is what your question is getting after. I'd say the one thing to think about is one, we've talked about Revlimid in the past and that we said we've revised Revlimid's guidance this year from $5.5 billion to $6 billion, and we still see next year stepping down to about that $4 billion. Then we'll update you on all the other line items when we do our fourth quarter earnings as far as profitability next year. But you should think about the operating margin as a floor as we look forward through 2025.\n\nThanks, David, and thanks for the question, Jamus. Keith, could we go to the next question, please?\n\nYes, certainly. And that comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\n\nThank you very much. You made some comments about Sotyktu and the reimbursement environment as that is evolving and the constraints that you have, perhaps from Adam or whoever would be appropriate. Could you comment further about what you're seeing there and how we should be thinking about the cadence? I think the setup had been that 2024 would be an opportunity and that seems to be slightly different.\n\nChris, thank you for the question. First, I want to say we're very pleased with the performance of Sotyktu. Our goal remains to be the standard of care in the oral market. In fact, as you heard, we have achieved now a 40% share of newly written prescriptions, and we're the third most newly prescribed systemic therapy. And we've done that in a little over a year post launch. Now, as you have stated, our focus really is around accelerating access, and we anticipate achieving broader access in 2024 and continuing in 2025. Remember, today, Sotyktu is not covered on approximately 80% of lives in the United States. And so, you know, we expect to see significant improvements coming next year.\n\nWe're in the throes of negotiations with the PBMs, so we would expect to see a market improvement in 2024 and that could continue into 2025, where we would expect to have very broad access across the other two PBMs. That's, you know, we're very confident in our ability to achieve that.\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Adam. Could we go to the next question please, Keith?\n\nYes, certainly. That comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\n\nThank you very much. Regarding the midterm guidance changes, I'm a.\n\nBit puzzled as to why now, particularly.\n\nWhen you had a major meeting last month.\n\nTime to go through the specifics.\n\nI'm sure these changes were evident at that point. Or wait until Q4 when you have to set the stage for 2024 and beyond. I think the answer will be that that was an R and D meeting.\n\nLast month, but still, Chris, you opened the meeting by kind of setting the stage and tone for the company.\n\nI'm just wondering why you're fitting these changes in on a Q3 call?\n\nThank you.\n\nSure. Steve, let me take that. And then David can provide additional color. So the timing of this shift is really driven by the fact that in the short term we have seen additional trends, mainly around Abecma, that have required that we change our short term guidance. And that's giving the guidance for the new product portfolio for this year. And as we said, we expect that portfolio to be roughly $3.5 billion this year. And that is slightly less than what we had anticipated when we began this year. As a result of that change and what we're seeing with the new product portfolio, the dynamics of which I described in the prepared remarks, we made the decision that we wanted to update the 2025 guidance as we anticipated that would be a question that would come out on this call.\n\nAnd so that's why we made the decision to change the 2025 guidance. And then of course, as we get into next year, we'll provide additional color as to how we expect 2024 to proceed. But that was really the motivation for the timing of why we decided to make the changes in guidance today.\n\nThanks, Chris. Keith, could we go to the next question, please?\n\nCertainly. And that comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question. I guess, Chris, maybe for you, just the launch reboot strategy for some of these, some of the drugs that have come in below your expectations, maybe you could just walk us through each of those and some of the steps you're taking and why you're confident that that's going to have success. Thank you. Sure. Terence, let me start and then I'll ask Adam to provide some specifics, really around the products where we think we're going to need to have either a reboot or where we are moving to accelerate. I think the way I characterize in the opening remarks is right, we have a number of products which are either hitting or exceeding our expectations. Certainly Opdualag Reblozyl is performing very, very well.\n\nBreyanzi, as David alluded to, we saw good performance in the quarter, but importantly, we're seeing very strong manufacturing performance. We anticipate both supply and the quality of manufacturing for that product to improve. Given the profile of the drug, we have every expectation that's going to continue to perform very well as we get into 2024. So those products we feel very good about. For Sotyktu and Camzyos, the dynamics are the products are just taking a bit longer and the trajectory for those products requires that we think about the time to peak being shifted back. What's important, and Adam can speak to this, is the fundamentals for both of those products continue to be very, very strong. We get good, strong share.\n\nFor Sotyktu, we anticipate, given the quality of that data and what we're seeing from customers, this will become the oral standard of choice, which is, remember what the objective was when we launched the product. And for Camzyos, every metric across this product, whether it relates to how physicians see the product and how patients see the product, remains very strong. The dynamics in the cardiovascular market are such that that's just simply going to take a bit longer. I'll have Adam speak to any additional color on those two products, but mainly focus on Abecma and on Zeposia.\n\nYes, thanks, Chris. Thanks, Terence for the question. Let me just add a little bit more color, as you heard. You know, we have said that we're seeing continued impact from additional BCMA agents pressuring Abecma growth. Our teams are focused on, number one, expanding our site footprint both in the US and internationally. We're differentiating and contextualizing Abecma real world data for physicians, which really look very similar and consistent with our clinical trials. We're educating on the sequencing and some of the emerging data that the use of CAR T therapy ahead of bispecifics is ultimately better for patient outcomes. We're also very pleased with the progress we made on manufacturing around our predictability and low out-of-spec rates.\n\nSo that's what we're really doing around Abecma as it relates to Zeposia, you know, as Chris mentioned, and then I'll shift to the others, you know, we continue to see quarterly demand growth. You know, MS is really driving that growth. And so we made a lot of progress on the MS front, even in a declining oral market in favor of B-cell. And so we continue to expect growth in the MS market. Now we have certainly an opportunity for continued growth in UC. We're making progress, but our access challenges, they remain and we're working to improve our access position. But we're also seeing progress in Zeposia in the first-line setting post ASA as physicians are identifying Zeposia really as a good treatment option based on its efficacy and safety profile.\n\nSo we're focusing there on expanding breadth of prescribing and continuing to really drive adoption across our, you know, a broader use of physicians. So for those reasons we do expect to see continued growth and uptake for Zeposia now as it relates to Camzyos and Sotyktu. As you know, Chris opened, he talked about the importance of those two products and really not a matter of if, but a matter of when. And that's why we made that decision. And so for Camzyos, you know, we are pleased with the uptake there. The focus on Camzyos remains to continue to increase our breadth in our COEs, go outside of the COEs to kind of the non centers of excellence to expand utilization.\n\nWe're seeing doctors get much more comfortable in using, the patient response has also been very, very strong there, and continuing to bring patients out of the hub. Remember, these patients are going to be on treatment for a very long time. And then finally, just again, I'll just close on Sotyktu. I mentioned some of the key areas we're focused on around access, and David talked about pulling through those patients through the hub. But we're also continuing to drive breadth of prescribers, where we're making really meaningful progress and reinforcing our superior efficacy profile compared to Otezla.\n\nThanks Adam. Keith, could we go to the next question please?\n\nSure. That comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital. Hi guys.\n\nThank you for taking my question. This one's on Mirati.\n\nSo, Krazati and the general KRAS rest.\n\nG12C class has recently really fallen below expectations. Can you just walk me through your thinking of the opportunity for Krazati? What's the key value driver here in the acquisition, and what can you do differently versus Mirati to accelerate growth of this asset?\n\nYeah, thanks Evan for the question. You know number one, we're very confident in Krazati's significant commercial opportunity as we believe this is a best in class KRAS G12C. Remember, the real opportunity for Krazati is in the first-line setting and so in lung cancer. And so we have, you know, Mirati has started their phase 3 study in combination with PD-1. We'll also see data around the triplet to PD-1 chemo KRAS. I think that's another significant advantage of Krazati where it can combine with multiple agents including PD-1. We obviously need data to understand the potential of that opportunity. But Evan, we think this could bring significantly greater upside to this opportunity. And then also we're very excited about the other assets that.\n\nMirati has PRMT5, KRAS G12D, and the SOS1 inhibitor, which we think also showing very promising early efficacy. So taken together, we do believe that this is a really exciting deal for the company and will be a strong catalyst of growth in the back end of this decade.\n\nThanks, Adam. Keith, could we go to the next question please?\n\nYes, certainly. That comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.\n\nHi, good morning, guys.\n\nOn Abecma, can you help frame? You mentioned some of the headwinds and.\n\nSome of those are obviously transient in nature. How should we think about how long?\n\nIt might take to get back to.\n\nSort of the run rate you were seeing in H1 2023 and I guess along those lines as well, given some of the commentary on the guidance, just your confidence in an on-time approval of KarMMa-3? Thank you.\n\nLet me just start off with the KarMMa-3 part first. As you know, that we have a PDUFA date in December, and that's all, pretty much, we can comment on as we continue to work with the regulatory agencies to bring it forward.\n\nYeah, Carter, I'll just expand on that just a little bit. You know, we mentioned two things. Last quarter's earnings, remember? Number one, you know the S12 maintenance that occurred in June would dampen Q3 sales. And you know, we're seeing that happen. However, you know, we are also seeing a continued impact from additional BCMA targeted agents. So we knew this is going to be a highly competitive market putting pressure on growth. And I talked about what we're doing to really stabilize that business and return to growth. Clearly a KarMMa-3 approval would move Abecma into earlier lines of treatment and be a catalyst to return Abecma growth by opening up a significant larger patient pool. But as some had said, obviously we have to wait to see that approval come.\n\nThanks, Adam. Can we go to the next question please?\n\nCertainly, certainly. That comes from Andrew Baum with Citi.\n\nThank you. Question for Adam. Many of your predecessors has been scarred trying to get off the bridge onto reimbursed plans. Are you still confident that you're going to be able to by the end of this year get 60% of your CVS insured patients off the bridge onto a reimbursed basis?\n\nYeah, Andrew, thanks for the question. So conversion is going as we expected. You know, we are focused on pulling through the early access win for Sotyktu at CVS. And shipping those patients to commercial product from Bridge. As I said last time on the call, it takes about two to three months for patients to move from Bridge to commercial. And you know, we have started to see that conversion happening towards the end of Q3. We believe the majority of CVS patients will be coming out of the Hub by Q4 and start to see some benefit towards the tail end of Q4 and into Q1. We're also seeing new patients on CVS move very quickly into commercial products. So that's also helping to accelerate performance.\n\nSo I talked earlier, you know, that coupled with broader formulary access in January of 2024, we are confident that will be a strong accelerator of growth for Sotyktu in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThank you, Adam. Keith, could we go to our next question please?\n\nOnce again, please press Star and then one if you would like to ask a question.\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson, Wolfe Research.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo you gave product specific peak sales targets out to 2030. I think you did that for almost 10 products.\n\nAre any of those trending ahead of what those prior targets were? We've heard of several things, it sounds.\n\nLike, where it might be trending below that. And are we going to get updated?\n\n2030 targets on those same list of products at some point?\n\nThank you.\n\nSo Tim, let me start, and I'll ask Adam to comment on how we're seeing performance trends overall. But what I would say is, look, I would go back to how I characterize the new product portfolio at the beginning. We've launched nine new products over the last two and a half years, and it's a portfolio of products, and we are seeing some products perform at or better than expected. I think when you factor in some of the early manufacturing constraints that we had, I look at a product like Breyanzi, the best-in-class profile. That product has considerable opportunity to meet or exceed expectations. Look, I think we knew the competitive dynamics around Abecma coming into this launch. I fully expect that the team is going to get that product back on track as it relates to competition from other BCMA targeted agents.\n\nBut in the long run that product will continue to be a competitive product for us. And then certainly as we look at the opportunity for a product like Camzyos and a product like Sotyktu, we think the long term potential still remains on track and possibly for a product like Camzyos in excess of what we had anticipated. And then as you would expect in any portfolio product, there are a couple of products where performance is lagging. We've highlighted what those are but maybe I'll ask Adam to comment on any additional underlying dynamics he wants to speak to.\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. I think you know, when we looked at totality of a portfolio, you know, we obviously see some products that are ahead where we projected them to be at peak, and some are tracking behind. But taken together, you know, we don't see any changes in what we had discussed, which is on a non risk adjusted basis that these, the new product portfolio, you know, could exceed that objective, you know, by 2030. You know, Chris talked about some of the, you know, the pushes and pulls. I would just add, I think Reblozyl is certainly a product that we're seeing that is tracking at or even ahead of expectations with the COMMANDS label. Camzyos, we also see that tracking ahead in the longer term.\n\nYes, it's taking slower than we initially guided to, but it's tracking very similar to a very, very strong cardiovascular launch. And so we expect that adoption to continue with sustained growth into the long term. Chris mentioned Breyanzi. You mentioned, you know, Breyanzi has been seen as the best in class.\n\nCell therapy agent, and coming into next year we're going to be in a much better supply position and that is going to help accelerate and catalyze that product and also Sotyktu as well. Because if you think about Sotyktu, you know, once we are able to secure access early next year we'll see accelerations in Pso. But we also have important data readouts as you know, coming in PSA, and in SLE or Lupus which will all contribute to having Sotyktu exceed potentially our expectations in the back end of this decade.\n\nSo Tim, just to close it out, we had said that that product portfolio had $25 billion plus potential. Where we said today we still see that potential, at least $25 billion, as we get to the end of this decade.\n\nThanks Chris. We go to the next question please. Keith.\n\nYes, that comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners.\n\nYes, thanks very much. So I just wanted to sort of pivot to 2026. So considering that you extended the new product portfolio revenue guidance to 2026, could you please comment on both the inline product segment and the recent LOE segments for 2026, specifically how you'd frame the magnitude of potential declines for Eliquis and Revlimid given the, you know, the pressures?\n\nThat they are set to face.\n\nThank you very much.",
    "content2": "Thanks, Dave. Just as a reminder, you know, as far as the only change that we made was from a new product portfolio going to 2026. We're not providing line item guidance for the other line items. But what I would like to do is just remind you there's really no change to that in-line portfolio growing from 2010 to 2025 at $8 to $10 billion. Feel very confident in that. And I think the double-digit growth you saw on Opdivo, you know, year to date, it demonstrates our continued confidence there. And the only change that we made in relation to the guidance was in that new product portfolio after 2026. As it relates to the LOE. Again, we increased the guidance this year for Revlimid from $5.5 to $6 billion.\n\nAs we said on the second quarter, there's really no change to how we're looking at it, which is pretty consistent with where consensus is for 2024 and 2025, dropping down to about $4 billion next year and $2 billion in 2025. Remember, by the time we finish this year, Revlimid will be beyond 60% of the erosion of that product. So, and a significant portion of our growth going forward is going to be represented by that, you know, in line and new product portfolio LOEs in 2025 would be less than 10% of our total revenue. You know, we'll have a much younger portfolio by the time we get to 2025 and set us up well for 2026. You know, that's where we stand today.\n\nThanks, David. Go to the next question please. Keith.\n\nYes. Next is Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\n\nHi.\n\nI mean, I think all the questions are focused on near term, but I have gotten a lot of bullish indicators on your launches thinking more longer term like next year. We've heard from KOLs that LVEF drops in the real world for Camzyos seem to be better than what we're seeing in the clinical trials. Maybe you can provide some color on what you're seeing and how that impacted uptake. I think big picture, do you see any potential for changes to REMS because of what you're saying? Thanks.\n\nThank you, Robyn. I think what we have heard and what Adam has talked about in the past as well, that overall profile for Camzyos as we think about patients and the prescribers remains very, very positive, and we remain very confident on that profile as well as it relates to the REMS impact. Look, these are data that we have to collect for a long time from the real world. There is no commitment in terms of really getting the REMS changed, but certainly we'll continue to try as more and more data evolves and more and more patients are put on Camzyos. Overall, once the patient goes on Camzyos, we have not heard of any stories of patients trying to get off Camzyos.\n\nIn fact, even if they have to interrupt for any other reasons, they want to go back on the drug because of the benefit that they see in their quality of life and how they perform on their overall daily living.\n\nThanks so much. Go to the next question please.\n\nYes, and that comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\n\nGreat, thank you for taking my question. And my question is regarding, my question is related to Sotyktu because it seems like in prepared remarks you mentioned that Sotyktu contracting to zero step edits may run into 2025 and you mentioned because there are some changes in the immunology contracting market.\n\nCan you please help us understand them?\n\nA little bit better? What are these changes and how should we think about the long term net pricing for this category? Thank you. Yeah Mohit, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. So as I said, we are working to improve significantly our formulary access in 2024. And as I said, we have approximately 80% of lives today that are not covered on Sotyktu. We expect that to change dramatically as we move in next year. However, when you look at where we will likely be in 2024, we will likely have the majority of our business in either a zero or one step edit position.\n\nWhen we're talking to PBMs and the reason why we're talking a little bit about 2025, PBMs are really thinking about different ways to manage the Pso class as well as the broader immunology class with now more and more biosimilar Humira coming into the market. So those decisions have not yet been finalized for 2025. But as I stated, we're very confident that we will see a significantly broader access position next year. So we'll go from non-covered to being covered, which will be a really nice growth opportunity for Sotyktu as you move into early next year.\n\nLet's go to the next question, please.\n\nYes, and that comes from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nHey, good morning, and thank you for the question. M&A has obviously been something.\n\nThat you guys have leaned into.\n\nSo does that strategy change at all after the Mirati deal? And if there is still an appetite for midsize deals, are there certain areas that may be best fit your growth strategy going forward?\n\nSure, let me take that one. So as we've said consistently, business development remains the top priority for capital allocation at the company. What I would say is at a macro level, the way we think about business development is somewhat consistent with the way we've always thought about it, which is we are going to be looking for deals that are scientifically interesting and related to things that we know well. They're going to be strategically relevant for the company, and of course, they have to be financially sound. The one thing that I would add is that we are going to index more heavily on those deals that enhance the growth profile of the company. That's an area that we remain fixated on as a management team. And so I think that's going to factor into how we think about business development going forward.\n\nWe're going to see areas, of course, that enhance the portfolio or help us to continue to.\n\nGive us capabilities or products that we don't have today. I think in some ways that's how you can think about Mirati. Mirati continues to diversify our oncology business away from oncology toward targeted therapies. We're very excited about that opportunity. But I think generally speaking, the way we approach business development will be largely consistent. Again, though, we'll be focusing on great science that can enhance the quality growth profile of the company.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Keith. Can we go to our last question, please?\n\nYes. That comes from Dane Leone with Raymond James.\n\nHi, guys.\n\nThis is Sean on for Dane. Thanks for taking the questions. It does appear maybe we can get a little bit more color on those Camzyos script trends. It does appear that the number of patients entering the hub may be slightly slowing. So just any further color on what you've been hearing from physicians on how burdensome the REMS program is and what you expect for further growth? Thanks.\n\nSure, Sean. I'll take that question. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing in the launch of Camzyos. We continue to see week over week, consistency in patient starts and rapid conversion of patients from the hub to commercial. You know, as we all said, we would expect to see steady, consistent, and sustained uptake for this product into the, you know, the distant future. We don't expect an inflection, but rather an accumulation of patients coming on to treatment and staying on treatment for a very long period of time. And so right now, you know, we've got 5,000 patients in the hub and approximately 3,500 patients on commercial products.\n\nSo that, coupled with patient and physician feedback, which continues to be very strong, we're focusing on driving penetration in our top centers where we have 90% adoption in our top 100 centers, and expanding use outside of those COEs. We're also focused on increasing diagnosis rates by activating patients. And as you know, we recently received approval internationally as well in Europe. So that will also be a contributor to growth. So taken together, we're very confident this will lead to a continued and sustained growth of this important product.\n\nSo maybe I'll close. So first, thank you all for joining the call. I know it's a very busy day. What I would just say to summarize where we are is look, this team has continued to be fixated on driving the growth profile of the company. How we go about doing that is as we've discussed on the call, we're going to continue to drive in-line product performance, the new product portfolio. We have continued very strong conviction in the long-term potential of this portfolio. Our focus is going to be continuing to drive where we have momentum today and accelerate those products where we need to accelerate. And that focus on execution transcends across the entire portfolio, including continuing to drive execution in R and D, and continue to find and source really attractive assets externally. And with that we'll close the call.\n\nAs always, the team is available to answer any questions following today's discussion. Hope you all have a good day and the rest of the week.\n\nThank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Tim Power, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Power, please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Chris Boerner, our Chief Operating Officer; Adam Lenkowsky, our Chief Commercialization Officer; and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development.\nAs you'll note, we've posted slides to bms.com that you can follow along with for Giovanni and David's remarks. But before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statements. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Giovanni.\n\nGiovanni Caforio\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4. As you will have seen in our press release this morning, today, we updated our outlook for 2023. The updates were driven by a significant change in our expectations for Revlimid and, to a lesser extent, Pomalyst for the year. Let me say that we do not take an adjustment of this magnitude lightly.\nBefore I provide you with more detail, when I look at the company overall, I'm encouraged by the strength of the in-line and new products as well as the progress with our pipeline. These are the drivers that will enable us to renew our portfolio and strengthen our business in the future. The impact we are discussing today is limited to Revlimid and, to a lesser extent, Pomalyst, and we expect it to be relevant only to this year, as I'll discuss shortly.\nImportantly, our in-line and new product portfolios remain on track. We are pleased with continued strong performance from our in-line business and are confident in our ability to roughly double revenue from our new products this year. In fact, our new product portfolio is already annualizing at $3.5 billion as of Q2. As a result of these strong trends, we are reaffirming all our financial commitments for the 2020-2025 period. Given our confidence in our future, this morning we also announced our intention to execute a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase in the third quarter.\nLet me now provide some details on today's update. Our revised guidance reflects a $1 billion decrease for Revlimid, and we are now guiding to approximately $5.5 billion in 2023. Combined with a roughly $300 million impact for Pomalyst, these changes account for our revised guidance on revenue and EPS ranges. As you know, we are navigating generic entry for Revlimid, though this is not the driver of our revision in outlook. Concurrent with entry of the most recent wave of generic volumes, we saw some softness in Revlimid sales beginning at the end of the first quarter.\nAs we looked into its drivers, we recognized there had been an unusual increase in utilization of 3 drugs provided by the independent BMS Patient Assistance Foundation starting at the same time. In Q2, the number of patients on free drug continued to increase and reached a level significantly higher than normal. The impact on Revlimid and Pomalyst revenues also accelerated in Q2. This issue is the main driver of our revised guidance.\nThe situation is complex, and to explain it, I'll turn to Slide 5 to remind everyone of some of the ways we meet our commitment to support eligible patients who can't afford their medicines. For commercially insured patients, we provide the co-pay support to eligible patients. Under U.S. law, however, we cannot provide copay support to government-insured patients, such as Medicare patients. There are third-party independent charitable foundations that provide financial assistance to patients to help with out-of-pocket costs, including Medicare patients.\nThese charitable foundations are supported financially in a variety of ways. This includes contributions from donors, including BMS, consistent with HHS guidance. Additionally, we donate BMS products to the independent BMS Patient Assistance Foundation, which provides free medicine to all qualified patients who are not financially supported elsewhere. Importantly, to comply with government guidance, once patients enter this program, the BMS Patient Assistance Foundation provides free product through the end of the calendar year.\nEarlier this year, funds at independent third-party charitable foundations, the ones that provide financial assistance to eligible multiple myeloma patients, closed for a period of time. This was because the collective funding from donors was not sufficient to meet the need for copay assistance for the patients taking the variety of medicines that the multiple myeloma funds support. We believe the funds closing for a period of time was the primary driver for an increase in patients requesting free product from the independent BMS Patient Assistance Foundation.\nDuring the second quarter, the level of free product utilization continued to increase, and ultimately, reached a level that was significantly higher than normal. These dynamics were building while we were also navigating the most recent wave of generic volumes for Revlimid. Today, we are able to provide you with an update on our company guidance for the year that incorporates the impact from both Revlimid and Pomalyst.\nI want to underscore that we do not expect these dynamics to continue into next year. This is based on 2 key factors. First, the BMS Patient Assistance Foundation has seen applications for free product returning to normal levels. Second, changes in Medicare Part D coverage, taking effect in 2024, will help improve patient affordability. This should directly impact the number of patients needing to access the free drug program.\nSo to sum up what this means financially, we estimate the impact of the increase in patients receiving free product to be approximately $330 million for Revlimid and Pomalyst in Q2, with about 80% of that being Revlimid. Because the BMS Patient Assistance Foundation provides free drug for the calendar year, the impact for Revlimid and Pomalyst will be more significant for the full year, approximately $1 billion and $300 million, respectively. Since revenues for Revlimid are lower than expected this year, we now expect a lower step-down of approximately $1.5 billion in 2024 and $2 billion in 2025.\nNow turning back to the products that will be key to our future. Let me turn to Slide 6, and our new products. Here, you can see that we continue to deliver very strong growth and remain on track to roughly double revenue for this portfolio this year. David will provide more details in a few minutes, and we see good momentum and growth opportunities across the portfolio, including progress with accelerating access for SOTYKTU, building demand and conversion to commercial dispense for Camzyos in the U.S. and achieving approval in Europe, continuing to build capacity for our cell therapy assets, as well as growing Reblozyl in its current indications in advance of an exciting future launch with COMMANDS.\nOn Slide 7, I would like to remind you of the targets we provided for our product portfolio. The process of renewing our portfolio and growing the business for the long term centers, first, on our 9 recently launched products. The combination of our scientific innovation and commercial execution gives us great confidence in the growth trajectory of this set of products. We continue to expect to deliver $10 billion to $13 billion of revenue from this portfolio in 2025. And the opportunity remains significant, with $25 billion plus or potential revenue in 2030 on a nonrisk-adjusted basis.\nImportantly, we are continuing to further derisk these products with opportunities such as COMMANDS for Reblozyl, CLL and follicular and mantle cell lymphoma for Breyanzi, and many more. Which brings me to our scorecard, outlining our strong pipeline execution on Slide 8. As I mentioned, we are making progress derisking our new products as well as accelerating our pipeline more broadly. And we achieved some important clinical milestones this quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, we presented exciting data for our LPA1 agonist in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The Phase II data for this drug showed more than a 60% reduction in the rate of decline in lung function without any of the GI tolerability issues associated with existing drugs. With the proof of concept also achieved in progressive pulmonary fibrosis, we look forward to presenting more data for this asset, and we are rapidly moving to Phase III trials.\nASCO and EHA were important meetings for us this year. In addition to presenting the Reblozyl COMMANDS data, strong data was presented for Opdivo in first-line classical Hodgkin lymphoma and for our GPRC5D cell therapy program in multiple myeloma. And we are excited to move this into registrational trials. These underpin the growth potential of our I-O franchise and the incredibly exciting opportunities we see ahead for our leading cell therapy platform, including into new areas such as immunologic diseases.\nWe have also announced a positive outcome from our CheckMate-901 trial of Opdivo and chemotherapy in cisplatin-eligible first-line metastatic bladder cancer. Not only is this a very positive development for these patients, it speaks to the breadth of opportunity in our pipeline beyond what's shown on this slide. We have a rich and broad pipeline that we continue to advance rapidly. We're looking forward to sharing more about the opportunities we see coming from our scientific research at our R&D Day in September.\nNow I'd like to spend a minute to take stock of where we are on our portfolio renewal journey. Turning to Slide 9. With 60% of the Revlimid erosion behind us at the end of 2023, we are well on track to meet our commitment of growing revenue low to mid-single-digit CAGR from 2020 to 2025, when, as we have told you, our recent LOEs will represent at most 10% of our revenue. The profitability of our business with operating margin of at least 40% provides us with the financial flexibility needed to continue to invest in our future.\nTurning now to Slide 10. I want to reiterate that our focus and our confidence in the renewal of our portfolio are as strong as ever. This rests on our in-line and new product portfolios and our pipeline as the key drivers of our performance beyond 2025, and we are pleased with where we are. There are 4 important levers which will enable us to renew our portfolio in the second half of the decade as Eliquis and Opdivo lose exclusivity:\nThe continued growth of the 9 medicines in our new product portfolio from $10 billion, $13 billion in 2025 to realization of their full potential of at least $25 billion of nonrisk-adjusted revenue by the end of the decade; the potential launch of 6 registrational stage assets with meaningful contributions before the end of the decade; continued progress with our early-stage pipeline and potential external innovation through business development. We are executing well on all 4 fronts. I'm excited and confident about what the future holds for Bristol-Myers Squibb.\nBefore I turn the call over to David, I want to thank our teams globally for their commitment to our patients and focus on our business. David will now walk you through our product performance and financial results in more detail. David?\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Giovanni, and thank you all for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's turn to Slide 12 to discuss our top line performance. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made versus same period in 2022, and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\nTotal company sales in the second quarter were $11.2 billion, driven by continued strength of our in-line and new product portfolio, offset by the revenue decline that Giovanni discussed earlier. At the same time, we continue to be pleased with the strong growth of our new product portfolio, which grew 79% in the quarter.\nMoving to our new product portfolio on Slide 13. I'm incredibly proud of the strong momentum in the quarter and pleased with the growth. The portfolio generated $862 million in sales in the quarter, already annualizing approximately $3.5 billion. New products grew significantly in the quarter and year-to-date, with 79% and 91% growth, respectively, versus last year. This strong performance was driven by several of our key products across the portfolio including Opdivo, Reblozyl and our cell therapies, Breyanzi and Abecma, as well as Camzyos and Zeposia.\nMoving to our solid tumor performance on Slide 14. Global Opdivo sales year-to-date were strong, growing 11% versus prior year, primarily driven by a continued demand for our newly launched and core indications. In the U.S., Opdivo grew 2% in the quarter versus last year, driven by demand in first-line lung, gastric and adjuvant bladder cancer indications, offset by customer buying patterns. Sequentially, we estimate these buying patterns to be about $50 million to $100 million.\nImportantly, year-to-date revenues were up 9% versus last year, with continued growth expected this year. Outside the U.S., second quarter revenues increased 10%, driven by demand for recently launched indications and expanded access.\nMoving to the strong launch of Opdualag. Sales in the quarter grew significantly over prior year with revenues of $154 million. This also represents 31% growth versus prior quarter. We're extremely pleased with the launch of Opdualag in first-line melanoma with market share approaching 25%, and continuing to be primarily sourced from PD-1 monotherapy. Positive experiences are driving repeat and expanded use across patients. This momentum gives us confidence in the ability for Opdualag to become the new standard of care in first-line melanoma.\nTransitioning to our cardiovascular portfolio on Slide 15, beginning with Eliquis. We continue to be pleased with our leading OAC, which generated sales of approximately $3.2 billion globally, largely driven by the U.S., where sales grew 7% year-over-year driven primarily by demand. Sequentially, as is typical in the second quarter, we started to experience unfavorable gross to net adjustments as patients enter into the donut hole.\nAs a reminder, these dynamics are more acute in the third and fourth quarters. with the second half revenues being lower than the first half as we see each year. Outside the U.S., sales continue to be impacted primarily by generic entries in Canada and the U.K. as well as government pricing measures we mentioned in the past.\nTurning to Camzyos, which generates sales of $46 million in the quarter, we are pleased with our continued progress. We are seeing healthy increases in patients being treated week-over-week with approximately 3,800 patients in our hub, of which approximately 2,500 patients are on commercial drug at the end of the quarter. We continue to make great progress with centers of excellence and broadening our prescriber base into the community site. Patients have highlighted significant improvement in symptoms, which has resulted in strong adherence and minimal drop-off.\nWe are delighted to have updated the label for Camzyos based upon the VALOR study, which reinforces the strong data seen in the EXPLORER study and further strengthens the clinical profile of Camzyos. Outside of the U.S., we're excited to have received European approval last month, and look forward to making this first-in-class medicine available to more patients once we secure reimbursement.\nNow turning to our hematology portfolio on Slide 16, and I won't go into details on Revlimid and Pomalyst since Giovanni already discussed them earlier. I'll turn to Reblozyl. We had a strong quarter with revenues of $234 million, from 35% versus the prior year, primarily driven by demand. In the U.S., revenues grew 24%, primarily due to continued total prescription share growth driven by longer duration of treatment. Internationally, Reblozyl roughly doubled as we continue to secure reimbursement in additional countries.\nWe have a strong foundation in place and look forward to the upcoming PDUFA date for Reblozyl in first-line ESA-naive MDS patients on the COMMANDS data, which will further accelerate growth of the band upon anticipated approval at the end of next month. Moving on to our transformative cell therapy products, Abecma and Breyanzi, we continue to make progress at expanding capacity which has enabled robust sales of $232 million, growing 81% versus prior year, driven by strong demand.\nAbecma booked sales of $132 million globally, growing 48% versus last year, primarily due to demand and an increase in manufacturing capacity. We expect third quarter revenues to be lower than second quarter revenues due in part to planned manufacturing maintenance in June, with growth expected in the fourth quarter. Having said that, we continue to be pleased with the reproducibility of our efficacy and safety data in the real world and the reliability of our manufacturing processes, which were reinforced at ASCO. We also look forward to the upcoming PDUFA date in December for Abecma in early lines based on the KARMA 3 trial.\nTurning to Breyanzi, which generated sales of $100 million globally, more than doubling versus prior year and 41% sequentially, primarily driven by demand in second line and third line large B-cell lymphoma and increased manufacturing capacity. We are pleased with our success in increasing supply. While factor constraints will result in third and fourth quarter revenues being largely similar to second quarter, we are further building out our capacity for growth next year. Outside the U.S., we're excited about the EU approval of Breyanzi in second-line large B-cell lymphoma and look forward to bringing this treatment to early aligned patients in Europe.\nNow let's turn to our immunology portfolio on Slide 17. And Global sales of Zeposia in the quarter were $100 million, growing 52% compared to prior year and 28% sequentially. In the U.S., growth was primarily driven by demand in multiple sclerosis and expanding contribution from ulcerative colitis. Outside the U.S., sales increased year-over-year, primarily due to demand in multiple sclerosis and securing reimbursement in additional countries.\nAnd lastly, turning to SOTYKTU. We are extremely pleased with the launch and progress we've made to date. Since launch, we have a greater than 23,000 script equivalents across bridge and commercial drug, nearly doubling volume in Q2 versus Q1. SOTYKTU's share of the oral market is now approaching 40%, continue to source more business from systemic-naive patients as well as Otezla in biologic experience patients.\nI'm also very pleased to report that we've made progress accelerating access, most notably, half of CVS plans were zero step edits effective middle. CVS indication-based plans account for approximately 30 million people or roughly 15% of the commercial covered lives, and we look forward to securing broader formulary access in 2024. Outside U.S., we continue to be pleased with the strong launch performance in Japan and are working with various countries across Europe to secure reimbursement.\nNow moving to our second quarter P&L on Slide 18. I'll focus my remarks on a few non-GAAP key line items having just covered the $11.2 billion of sales in the quarter. In the quarter, gross margin of approximately 75% was primarily impacted by product mix. Operating expenses of $4.2 billion, excluding acquired in-process R&D, increased approximately 2% versus last year, largely driven by an increase in spend to support our new product portfolio. Acquired in-process R&D in the quarter was $158 million, which was partially offset by $20 million of licensing income. Overall, second quarter earnings per share was $1.75.\nTurning to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 19. Cash flow generation on our balance sheet remained strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was approximately $1.9 billion, with over $8.7 billion in cash and marketed securities on hand as of June 30. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was primarily impacted by a $3 billion tax payments in the quarter, which is dynamic as we've seen in previous years.\nOur priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged, our business development continuing to be a top priority and a focus on balance sheet strength as well as returning capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repaid approximately $240 million of debt and $1.9 billion year-to-date, with an additional $2 billion maturing this year. Additionally, as Giovanni mentioned, we intend to execute a $4 billion ASR in the third quarter of this year, with approximately $2 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization after the ASR.\nTurning to our updated 2023 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 20. Our updated guidance reflects the decline of Revlimid and, to a lesser extent, Pomalyst revenues Giovanni mentioned earlier. We now expect 2023 revenues to decline in the low single-digit range on a reported and ex FX basis, and gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%. Excluding the impact of acquired in-process R&D, we continue to expect low single-digit decline in operating expenses, which reflects efficiency initiatives in MS&A as we continue to invest in our new product portfolio.\nFor the third quarter, we expect total operating expenses to be largely similar to the second quarter and approximately $4.2 billion. Our tax rate is now expected to be 17.5%, reflecting changes in product mix, and our earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.65.\nLastly, turning to Slide 21. Despite Revlimid dynamic this year,, the future of our company was driven by our in-line and new product portfolio. Importantly, the robust growth of this business remains unchanged. We continue to expect the new product portfolio to roughly double versus prior year. We are continuing to diversify our business and have become less concentrated as a result. As you can see and as Giovanni mentioned earlier, in 2025, greater than 90% of our business is expected to come from our in-line and new product portfolios.\nWe continue to expect low to mid-single-digit CAGR for 2020 to 2025 and reaffirm our midterm outlook. Before we move to Q&A, I want to reiterate and recognize the strong execution of our teams to accelerate the momentum of the future of our company, our new product portfolio. We remain laser-focused on bringing these transformational medicines to patients around the globe.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks very much, David. Jamie, can we go to the first question, please?",

[Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I'd now like to welcome Tim Power to begin the conference. Tim, over to you.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Chris Boerner, our Chief Operating Officer; and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development.

With that, I'll hand it over to Giovanni.\n\nGiovanni Caforio\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO\n\nThank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I'd like to address the leadership transition plan we announced yesterday. After 23 years at Bristol-Myers Squibb, including the last 8 as CEO, I have decided to retire as CEO effective November 1, 2023, so our family can spend more time together in Europe. I will continue to serve as Executive Chairman for a transition period to be determined by the Board.\nGiven the strong foundation achieved to position BMS for growth and success in the future, our strong pipeline and our incredibly deep bench of talent now is a natural time for this transition. That's why I am pleased to share that the Board has selected Chris Boerner, our current Chief Commercialization Officer, as Bristol-Myers Squibb's next CEO as of November 1. Effective yesterday, Chris was named Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And the Board also intends to appoint him as a member of the Board after the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nIn connection with Chris' appointment, Adam Lenkowsky, SVP, Head of Major Markets, has been named to succeed Chris as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer. The Board and I are confident that Chris is the right person to guide BMS through its next chapter of growth. Since joining BMS in 2015, Chris has been instrumental in shaping our strategy and our culture. His passion for science, his commitment to our workforce and his tireless focus on our patients, make him uniquely suited for the role.\nAmong a long list of accomplishments, Chris has helped guide the evolution of our portfolio over the past several years, notably building our leading presence in immuno-oncology, growing our CV business and launching multiple new medicines. His deep knowledge of our strategy and pipeline and his proven execution across all geographies give us confidence that he is the right leader to drive BMS's vision to be the world's leading biopharma company that transforms patients' lives through science.\nLeading BMS has been the highlight of my professional career. And I'm incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished together. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead and know that we will continue to put patients at the center of everything we do as we drive growth and sustained profitability.\nOur patients-first culture, coupled with our incredibly talented and diverse global workforce will continue to be the engine that drives our success. I look forward to working closely with Chris through the transition. And know, there is a very bright future for Bristol-Myers Squibb with Chris at the helm.\nNow let's turn our attention to our Q1 performance. Starting on Slide 4. As we continue to execute our strategy and accelerate the renewal of our portfolio, I am pleased to share that we had a strong start to the year. I am encouraged by the performance of the products that will drive our future growth.\nDuring the quarter, our in-line brands and new product portfolio grew 8% or 10% adjusting for foreign exchange. Notably, revenue from our new product portfolio more than doubled compared to 1 year ago, reinforcing our confidence that we expect to roughly double revenue from these products this year.\nOPDIVO and Eliquis, both performed very well with strong demand growth, particularly in the U.S. Looking forward, we continue to expect top and bottom line growth driven by our in-line and new product portfolio, more than offsetting the impact of generics. And we are affirming our non-GAAP financial guidance for this year. Along with strong commercial execution in the quarter, we continued to advance our pipeline.\nTurning to our scorecard on Slide 5. As you can see, we delivered meaningful pipeline milestones in Q1. We have a number of catalysts in our pipeline and made important progress expanding our new products, particularly with respect to regulatory achievements.\nStarting with cell therapy, where we further strengthened our growing leadership position. Following the publication of our KarMMa-3 results for triple class-exposed multiple myeloma patients in the New England Journal of Medicine in February, we have now delivered global regulatory filings across the U.S., Europe and Japan for this study. We look forward to the opportunity to offer these transformational products to patients in earlier lines of treatment in multiple markets in the future.\nWe also continue to make progress expanding supply for both of our cell therapy products. We recently entered into an agreement for a vector facility in Libertyville, Illinois to further strengthen our supply chain and expand manufacturing capacity. This will allow us to dual source vector supply and transition to newer, higher efficiency manufacturing processes.\nWe look forward to supplying more patients with both, Abecma and Breyanzi, as capacity increases over time. Our research teams remain focused on further improving outcomes for patients using cell therapy treatments, including with our exciting CD19 NEX T for severe refractory SLE that is entering the clinic.\nTurning now to SOTYKTU. As David will describe, the launch for plaque psoriasis continues to go very well, and we are successfully establishing this product as the oral of choice for moderate to severe patients. And during the quarter, we delivered approval of this medicine for patients in Europe.\nIn addition, we received data from our Phase II trial in Crohn's disease. And while it does not support moving to a Phase III trial at this time, we look forward to seeing data from the high-dose UC trial later this year to evaluate opportunities for this asset in IBD.\nMeanwhile, we continue to advance SOTYKTU into key expansion opportunities in Phase III studies for both, psoriatic arthritis and Lupus, which, as you know, has a very high unmet medical need.\nAnd turning now to Camzyos. We recently announced positive CHMP opinion for this medicine. We look forward to bringing this product to European patients soon. Looking at our next set of registrational assets. We have initiated the Phase III study for iberdomide in post-transplant maintenance during the quarter. This study will potentially enable us to demonstrate superiority of iberdomide over revlimid in an early line setting of multiple myeloma.\nAnd with our partners at Janssen, we are pleased to have now initiated all 3 Phase III trials in the milvexian program. We are excited about the benefits to patients from a potential next-generation antithrombotic that is equal to or better than current factors than a drug in terms of efficacy, but with a better bleeding profile.\nAs you can see, our progress is strong with multiple exciting pipeline opportunities ahead. Moving to Slide 6, and tying together what this progress means for our new product portfolio. This slide demonstrates that the renewal of our portfolio continues to gain momentum through a combination of strong commercial execution and the achievement of important clinical data and regulatory milestones that further derisk significant revenue opportunities.\nI am very proud of the accomplishments of our global colleagues as they strive to discover, develop and deliver transformational medicines to patients around the world. Together, we have built the foundation for an even stronger company with a more diversified portfolio of growth products and increased durability across each of our 4 key therapeutic areas.\nGiven our growing and rapidly diversifying business and our financial strength and flexibility, I'm excited about the opportunities we have for the rest of 2023 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to David to walk you through our product performance and financial results in more detail. David?\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Becton, Dickinson & Co.\n\nThank you, Giovanni. I'm recognizing this is another busy day for all of you. Thanks again for joining our first quarter earnings call. Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss our top line performance. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made for the same period in 2022, and sales growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\nTotal company sales in the quarter topped $11.3 billion, driven by strong double-digit sales of our in-line and new product portfolio, offset by [indiscernible] loss of exclusivity. Sales in the U.S. grew 4%, driven primarily by volume, while international sales were impacted by the annualization of loss of exclusivity for Revlimid.\nLet's delve deeper into the strong performance of the new product portfolio on Slide 9. As Giovanni mentioned, the new product portfolio generated over $720 million in sales, which more than doubled versus prior year and grew over 11% sequentially.\nThis strong performance in the quarter was driven primarily by demand for Opdualag, Abecma and Reblozyl, which I will touch on further in a moment, and provides us confidence in the growth potential for our increasingly derisked and diversified new product portfolio.\nMoving to our solid tumor performance on Slide 10. Global Opdivo sales were strong, growing double digit versus prior year, primarily driven by continued demand for our newly launched and core indications. In the U.S., Opdivo grew 17%, primarily driven by demand in first-line lung, upper GI indications and adjuvant bladder cancer.\nOutside the U.S., first quarter revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by demand for recently launched indications and expanded access. The strong execution in the first quarter gives us confidence in the continued growth expected for Opdivo.\nNow turning to the robust launch of Opdualag. Sales in the quarter were $117 million, growing double digit versus prior quarter. We are very pleased with the launch of Opdualag in first-line melanoma with market share now over 20%, primarily being sourced from PD-1 monotherapy.\nNow turning to our expanded cardiovascular portfolio on Slide 11. And starting with Eliquis, which generated over $3.4 billion globally, largely driven by the U.S. In the U.S., sales grew strongly, up 19%, driven primarily by robust demand. Internationally, sales were impacted primarily by generic entries in Canada and the U.K. and pricing measures we mentioned in the past.\nMoving now to our first-in-class myosin inhibitor, Camzyos. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making to bring Camzyos to more patients. Camzyos generated sales of $29 million in the first quarter. Now with approximately 2,700 patients in our hub, of which 1,500 patients on commercial drug at the end of the quarter. We continue to build momentum with considerable growth expected in the quarter-over-quarter.\nWe look forward to our upcoming PDUFA date for Valor in June, which will reinforce the strong profile of Camzyos as well as the expected European approval having just received a positive CHMP opinion.\nNow turning to our hematology portfolio on Slide 12. Starting with Revlimid. Global sales in the quarter were approximately $1.8 billion, impacted by generic entry. As we expected, the favorability seen last year reversed in the first quarter. And we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability.\nNow on to POMALYST, global sales grew 2% versus prior year. In the U.S., longer duration of first-line treatments impacted new prescription volumes. Internationally, revenues grew 12%, driven largely demand for triplet-based regimens as well as some buying patterns.\nTurning to Reblozyl, which generated revenues of $206 million in the quarter. Sales were strong, up 33%, largely driven by demand. In the U.S., revenues grew 18%, primarily driven by continued total prescription share growth. Internationally, Reblozyl more than doubled as we continue to secure reimbursement in additional countries, including being placed on China's national reimbursement drug list.\nWe are now launched in 25 countries outside the U.S. and expect to launch in additional markets this year. We look forward to presenting the COMMANDS data in an oral presentation at ASCO and EHA to further accelerate the brand by bringing this first-in-class product to first-line ESA-naive MDS patients upon approval.\nTransitioning to our first-in-class and best-in-class cell therapy products of Abecma and Breyanzi. We continue to make progress at expanding capacity, which has enabled robust sales growth driven by strong demand. With sales of $147 million in the quarter, we more than doubled our revenue for Abecma versus prior year and grew 16% sequentially.\nWe continue to be pleased with the feedback from physicians on the reproducibility of efficacy and safety in the real world and reliability of our manufacturing capabilities. As Giovanni mentioned, KarMMa-3 and triple-class exposed myeloma patients is now under review in the EU, the U.S. and Japan, and we look forward to bringing Abecma to earlier [indiscernible] line patients around the globe.\nTurning to Breyanzi. Sales in the quarter were $71 million, growing 66% versus prior year and 27% sequentially. Sales were driven by demand in second and third-line plus large B-cell lymphoma. With the broadest label in second-line large B-cell lymphoma and differentiated safety profile, feedback from physicians has been very strong, and we are pleased with the strong demand for Breyanzi. We look forward to bringing Breyanzi to earlier line patients in the EU in the coming months, with the recent CHMP positive opinion.\nLet's now move to our immunology portfolio on Slide 13. Starting with Zeposia. Global sales in the quarter were $78 million, more than doubling compared to prior year. In the U.S., growth was primarily driven by demand in multiple sclerosis and expanding contribution from ulcerative colitis.\nInternationally, sales increased primarily to demand in multiple sclerosis and securing reimbursement in additional countries. Lastly, turning to a strong launch of our first-in-class TYK2 inhibitor, SOTYKTU. We're extremely pleased with the launch so far. Just 6 months into the launch, we have over 9,500 script equivalents across bridge and commercial drug. SOTYKTU's share of the oral market is now in the mid-30s, sourcing business from systematic naive patients as well as Otezla and biologic experience patients.\nInternationally, we are very pleased with the strong launch performance in Japan and recent approval in Europe and look forward to working with individual countries on securing reimbursement through 2023 and beyond. We are very excited about SOTYKTU with nonrisk-adjusted revenue potential of $4-plus billion based on exciting opportunities ahead and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, cirrhotic arthritis and in lupus.\nMoving to our first quarter P&L on Slide 14. I will focus my remarks on a few non-key line items just covered -- as I just covered sales performance. In the quarter, as expected, gross margin was impacted by product mix. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and related hedging settlements that will not repeat in the second quarter.\nOperating expenses, excluding acquired in-process R&D remained largely consistent with prior year. MS&A declined 4%, primarily due to timing of spend which we expect to reverse going into the second quarter as we continue to invest in our new launches. Acquired in-process R&D in the quarter was $75 million, which was partially offset by $43 million of licensing income. Overall, first quarter earnings per share was $2.05, growing approximately 5%.\nTurning to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 15. Cash flow generation and our balance sheet remains strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was approximately $3 billion, with over $9 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand as of March 31.\nAs it relates to capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged, with BD continuing to be our top priority and a focus on balance sheet strength as well as returning capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repaid $1.6 billion in debt with an additional $2.3 billion maturing this year, and we remain opportunistic about share repurchases in the future with approximately $7 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization.\nLastly, turning to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 16. Based on upon performance to date, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP guidance. We expect 2023 revenues to grow approximately 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, which reflects that our in-line and new product portfolio will more than offset recent LOEs.\nRevlimid's sales expectations remain at approximately $6.5 billion, and we will continue to monitor variability from generics and other market dynamics through the year. We remain excited about the promise of our new product portfolio and expect the portfolio to roughly double versus prior year.\nAs we continue to launch these assets around the globe, we expect growth to be more back half weighted as we build momentum during the year. We continue to expect gross margin to be approximately 77%, which reflects a shift in product mix. Accounting for the FX favorability in the first quarter, we expect gross margin for the first half of the year to be approximately 77%.\nExcluding the impact of acquired in-process R&D and our operating expense, guidance remains unchanged and expected decline in the low single-digit range, reflecting efficiency initiatives in MS&A as we continue to up invest in our launch brands. As I mentioned during the results for the quarter, we expect MS&A to increase in the second quarter as we continue to invest in our launches.\nThe operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.2 billion in the second quarter. Our tax guidance of 17% remains unchanged, and we continue to expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7.95 and $8.25.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I just want to acknowledge the work of our colleagues across the globe for the relentless commitment and execution to transform this company into a younger and more diversified business. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks very much, David. Kevin, can we go to our first question, please?",

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Power, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of IR, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call.\nJoining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Chris Boerner, our Chief Commercialization Officer; and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development.\nAs you'll note, we've posted slides to bms.com that you can follow along with for Giovanni and David's remarks.\nBefore we get going, I'll read our forward-looking statements. During this call, we will make certain statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.\nWe'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Giovanni.\n\nGiovanni Caforio\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4. I am pleased to report another strong quarter for Bristol-Myers Squibb, concluding a very successful year.\nLast year was an important year for our company, the first with Revlimid generics. Given that, I am very proud to say that in 2022, we grew our business and made tremendous progress advancing our pipeline, including launching 3 new first-in-class medicines and progressing 6 promising programs into registrational development.\nWhile David will provide additional details on the financials in a moment, I will point out a few highlights. Last year, we delivered revenue growth of 3%, adjusting for foreign exchange. Importantly, growth was driven by our in-line and new product portfolios. So I am pleased to note that we delivered continued strong growth in the fourth quarter for these assets, up 12% adjusting for foreign exchange.\nWe also grew our earnings, including non-GAAP EPS growth of 8% for the full year. As we start 2023, I am confident we have established a strong foundation for Bristol-Myers Squibb. As you will note from our guidance, we expect to grow both revenue and non-GAAP EPS this year. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve the commitments we have made for 2025. Given increasing confidence in our new product portfolio and continued progress with our broader pipeline, we see multiple paths to growth through 2030.\nLet me now provide some perspective on 2022. On Slide 5, you can see our overall pipeline execution last year. I am very pleased with our progress, which further supports renewal of our portfolio. While we advanced on many fronts, I would like to highlight a few accomplishments.\nApproval of 3 first-in-class medicines, including Opdualag, Camzyos and Sotyktu, which address areas of high unmet medical need and have significant commercial potential.\nFurther progress expanding the reach of our new product portfolio, including an important expansion opportunity for Reblozyl in first-line MDS with COMMANDS, positive top line growth of KarMMa-3 based on which Abecma is the first BCMA CAR-T to have demonstrated superiority to standard regimens in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. And initiation of registrational trials for Sotyktu in lupus.\nRemember, in the Phase II study, Sotyktu demonstrated an encouraging profile in this harder-to-treat disease. We believe lupus can be an important expansion opportunity for the brand.\nProgress with the next generation of medicines includes important proof-of-concept data for Milvexian in secondary stroke prevention, enabling the initiation of the Phase III program this year and a positive trial for our LPA1 asset in lung fibrosis.\nThis asset has come into focus only recently and is a prime example of the optionality that comes from having a broad pipeline. We are looking forward to presenting data and starting Phase III trials for this asset later this year.\nOn Slide 6, you can see how we strengthened the outlook for our new product portfolio, which, as you know, is central to our strategy of renewing our portfolio over the coming years.\nOur pipeline execution and strong commercial momentum position us well to achieve $10 billion to $13 billion of risk-adjusted revenue in 2025. And as a result of the strong progress with our pipeline, we have significantly derisked the $25 billion plus of long-term non-risk-adjusted revenue potential. As you can also see on this slide, we continue to see exciting catalysts ahead for these assets.\nSo turning to our scorecard for this year on Slide 7. It's encouraging to observe the breadth of catalysts we see ahead as a company in the near term. I'll point out a few highlights.\nJust last week, we announced our Phase I/II trial for Breyanzi in relapsed refractory CLL met the primary endpoint. In Europe, we expect to launch Camzyos in obstructive HCM and are pleased to have received positive CHMP opinion for our first and only selective TYK2 inhibitor, Sotyktu. Our ROS1 inhibitor, repotrectinib is expected to be filed in the U.S. in lung cancer.\nWe have an important expansion opportunity for Reblozyl in first-line MDS. Along with our partners at Janssen, we have embarked on registrational trials for milvexian, and we expect to move Abecma into earlier lines of therapy.\nFinally, we are further advancing our multiple myeloma CELMoD program with a head-to-head study of iberdomide versus Revlimid in the post-transplant maintenance setting. As we have done in the prior years, we look forward to updating you on our progress as we continue to advance our pipeline and further support our portfolio renewal.\nTurning to Slide 8. I'd like to remind you about what we've accomplished in the past few years and how that prepares us well for the near, mid and long term. When we began the transformation of our company 3 years ago, we told you what we believed we could achieve and we have delivered across the board.\nFinancially, we have grown our company, over delivered synergies, reduced our debt and generated significant cash flows. We have launched all 9 new medicines, including 3 first-in-class products that were approved last year. And we've continued to execute disciplined business development to further support our growth profile in the future. Our record of execution further strengthens my confidence in our ability to renew our portfolio and deliver long-term growth.\nWith all of this in mind, let me move to Slide 9 to discuss our outlook for this year and beyond. As you know, we expect to drive growth through 2025 and sustained strong profitability as we transform our portfolio. And that journey continues this year. We delivered growth through Revlimid generics in 2022. And as you can see from our guidance today, we expect to continue to grow this year.\nWith the focus turning to the second half of the decade, we continue to see multiple paths to growth, driven by growth of the new products, contribution from our advancing late-stage pipeline, including Milvexian LPA1 and the CELMoDs, and significant optionality from our early pipeline, complemented by flexibility for additional business development. All the while, we are transforming our portfolio to be younger, more diversified and more resilient in the face of an increasingly complex pricing environment in the U.S. and internationally.\nBefore I turn to David, let me express my gratitude to our teams across the globe, starting with our research and development organization, which had a stellar 2022.\nAs you will have seen, this week, we announced Dr. Rupert Vessey's decision to retire, effective July 3. I want to thank Rupert for his extraordinary contributions since he joined BMS as a result of the acquisition of Celgene. Rupert led the successful integration of research and the development of a strong pipeline across all stages of development.\nWe are now combining development across early and late stage under Samit's leadership and preparing to transition the research organization to report to Dr. Robert Plenge, who will serve as EVP and Chief Research Officer, when Rupert retires this summer.\nThe focus and the termination of these leaders and all of our teams will enable us to continue to deliver for the patients depending on us.\nI'll now turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Giovanni, and thank you all again for joining our call today. I know this is a busy morning for all of you. .\nAs Giovanni mentioned, 2022 was another solid year of execution for Bristol-Myers Squibb. Let's get started with our top line performance on Slide 11. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are made versus the same period in 2021 and sales performance growth rates will be discussed on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\nWe delivered on our full year commitments with sales of approximately $46 billion with growth of 3%. Demand for our diversified in-line and new product portfolio was strong, with revenue growth of 13% for the year, more than offsetting the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid in the first year of generic entry.\nLet me dive deeper now into fourth quarter and full year performance of our new product portfolio on Slide 12. Global revenues in the quarter were $645 million, up 87%. While full year revenues topped over $2 billion, nearly doubling over 2021. With 9 new product approvals and multiple additional indications coming to fruition, we have an increasingly derisked new product portfolio. This provides us confidence that we are on track to deliver the potential of our new product portfolio with $25 billion of non-risk-adjusted revenue expected at the end of the decade.\nMoving to Slide 13 to discuss our performance of our solid tumor portfolio. Global Opdivo sales reflect strong demand for our newly launched and core indication with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter and the full year. In the U.S., fourth quarter revenue saw full year sales growth strong, growing 13% and 15%, respectively. This growth was primarily driven by demand for our new metastatic and adjuvant indications partially offset by declining second-line eligibility as well as some use of Opdualag in first-line melanoma.\nInternationally, revenues grew 20% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year. Fourth quarter revenue growth was largely driven equally by demand and timing of shipments. Demand was primarily driven to new indications, particularly first-line lung in upper GI cancers. As we look to this year, we expect growth of Opdivo to continue. This growth will come from an expanded indications in both early and late-stage cancers.\nNow turning to our first-in-class LAG-3 inhibitor, Opdualag, which had an impressive first year on the market, approved in the U.S. in late March, Opdualag generated sales of $252 million in 2022. Sales in the fourth quarter had strong sequential growth of 24% versus quarter 3. With first-line melanoma market share now in the high teens, we continue to see room for growth of Opdualag in first-line melanoma, where PD-1 monotherapy share still is approximately 20%. And further potential with pivotal studies in adjuvant melanoma and second-line plus colorectal cancer underway.\nOn Slide 14, let's discuss our growing cardiovascular portfolio, starting with Eliquis, which had another great year. Global revenues in the fourth quarter and the full year grew 6% and 14%, respectively. In the U.S., fourth quarter sales increased 15%, driven primarily by demand and favorable gross to net adjustments.\nInternationally, Eliquis is the leading OAC in many countries. Given high market shares across these countries, demand growth has been offset by pricing measures as well as generic entry in Canada, the U.K. and the Netherlands.\nNow turning to our first-in-class myosin inhibitor, Camzyos. Sales in the fourth quarter were $16 million. We are pleased with the progress we have made since the launch in May of 2022. We laid a strong foundation of REMS certified over 2,600 health care professionals and enabled key centers to get operationally ready to make Camzyos available to patients. We also significantly increased the number of patients on commercial dispensed drug, which provides strong momentum heading into this year. We look forward to continuing this momentum as well as bringing Camzyos to European patients with approval expected by midyear.\nMoving to our hematology portfolio on Slide 15, starting with Revlimid. Global sales for the full year were approximately $10 billion, impacted by generic entry. As we noted last year, we expected variability quarter-to-quarter. And in 2022, we saw slower-than-anticipated utilization of generic lenalidomide in the U.S.\nWith favorability in 2022, an anticipated increase in generic volume this year, we expect Revlimid revenues to be approximately $6.5 billion in 2023. We continue to expect an average $2.5 billion annual step down as a reasonable assumption for 2024 and 2025.\nPomalyst global revenues continue to grow in the fourth quarter and for the full year, driven primarily by demand for triple-based regimens in earlier lines of therapy and extending duration of treatment for patients. As usual, in the first quarter, I would like to remind you of the typical seasonality of Revlimid and Pomalyst experience due to patients entering the Medicare coverage scrap early in the year.\nNow moving to Reblozyl, our first-in-class EMA. Demand for Reblozyl was strong with fourth quarter and full year sales growing over 30%. In the U.S., revenues grew over 20% in both the fourth quarter and full year. We have made great progress since launch by increasing patient adherence, extending treatment durations and accelerating switches when ESAs fail.\nInternationally, Reblozyl continues to launch in different markets across the globe with launches now in 16 markets outside the U.S. Growth continues to be driven by demand in both MDS and beta thalassemia-associated anemia and attaining reimbursement in additional countries.\nTurning to our differentiated cell therapy portfolio, Abecma and Breyanzi, our first-in-class BCMA cell therapy, Abecma, continued its robust performance. Global revenues for the full year were $388 million versus $164 million in 2021. This represents strong growth year-over-year reflecting significant patient demand and the work the company has done to increase manufacturing capacity. We remain focused on continuing to ramp up capacity and believe this will enable us to get Abecma to more patients with highly refractory myeloma as well as preparing to move into earlier lines of therapy.\nLastly, moving to our best-in-class CD19 cell therapy, Breyanzi. Global sales for the year were $182 million, more than doubling over 2021. Sales in the quarter reflect strong demand and hard work of our teams to expand supply. Looking to this year, we continue to expect growth driven by demand for Breyanzi and second-line plus large B-cell lymphoma, and we remain focused on continuing to build manufacturing capacity to further support the uptake and prepare for additional indications.\nNow let's move to our expanded immunology portfolio on Slide 16, starting with our first-in-class S1P agonist, Zeposia. Fourth quarter sales grew 69%, while full year global sales nearly doubled, driven by increased demand in multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Our strategy to expand volume and to improve commercial access is materializing.\nWe've made progress with several plans with either 0 or 1 step edit, which will meaningfully expand access as we move in 2023. We expect continued growth of Zeposia to evolve primarily from MS today to UC over time. And remember, as with any new immunology medicine heading into the first quarter, the typical dynamics of co-pays resetting each year tend to impact the first quarter performance as additional co-pay supports -- affects gross to net adjustments. Internationally, we are continuing to focus on securing reimbursement in additional markets to get Zeposia to more patients living with MS and UC.\nFinally, turning to our first-in-class TYK2 inhibitor for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, Sotyktu. We're extremely pleased with the U.S. launch so far. Still early days, but physician feedback has been outstanding. As of December, we had over 2,000 script equivalents on BRIDGE and commercial drug.\nSince then, we continue to make progress in new scripts and see that the use of Sotyktu is roughly evenly split across systematic naive patients, Otezla switch patients and biologic switch patients. We remain focused on driving demand for this new medicine as the oral choice and ensuring as many patients as possible get Sotyktu to enable broader formulary positions in 2024. Internationally, we are now approved in Japan and Canada with expected European approval by midyear.\nSwitching gears to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 17. Having just covered sales performance, let me walk you through a few non-GAAP key line items. As expected, fourth quarter gross margin was impacted primarily by product mix and higher manufacturing costs. For the full year, gross margin was in line with our prior guidance at approximately 79%. Excluding acquired in-process R&D, fourth quarter and full year operating expenses decreased primarily due to reallocation of investments behind our growth opportunities and the impact from foreign exchange and dilution from the Turning Point acquisition.\nAcquired in-process R&D in the quarter was $52 million, which was partially offset by $16 million of licensing income that benefited OI&E in the quarter. Fourth quarter effective tax rate was approximately 11%, driven by earnings mix and one-time items with the full year tax rate of approximately 15%.\nOverall, fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.82. From a full year perspective, we ended the year at the upper end of our guidance range at $7.70, representing 8% over previous year.\nMoving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 18. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $3.3 billion. The company's balance sheet remained strong with approximately $9 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand as of December 31.\nOur capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Business development remains a top priority to further renew and diversify our portfolio and strengthen our growth outlook while also focused on balance sheet strength and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe have executed several early stage business development deals as well as acquiring Turning Point Therapeutics last year. Our strong balance sheet allows us to be size-agnostic on deals. As it relates to balance sheet strength in 2022, we reduced debt by over $5 billion, and we are committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating.\nAnd finally, as it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we have a long-standing track record of paying dividend for 91 consecutive years and recently grew the dividend for the 14th consecutive year. We remain committed to growing the dividend, subject to Board approval and continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases, with approximately $7 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization.\nLet me close with our 2023 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 19. Due to unpredictable macroeconomic factors and large swings in foreign exchange last year, we are providing guidance on a reported basis as well as an underlying basis, which assumes currency remains consistent with prior year.\nWe expect 2023 revenues to grow approximately 2% on a reported and constant currency basis. This reflects our confidence that our in-line and new product portfolios will more than offset the LOE impact from Revlimid and Abraxane. We expect Revlimid sales to be approximately $6.5 billion, which assumes additional step-up to generic manufacturers later in Q1 as well as continued variability quarter-to-quarter.\nWith the momentum of our new product portfolio, we expect it to roughly double versus last year and will be approximately $4 billion. As it relates to our line item guidance for the year, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 77%, which reflects a shift in product mix. We do not predict acquired in-process R&D.\nSo excluding this, we expect our total operating expenses to decline in the low single-digit range. This reflects a reallocation of cost and efficiency initiatives in MS&A as we continue to invest in our new launches.\nR&D expenses are expected to be largely in line with last year due to our dynamic portfolio of studies reading out and new study starts. We project our tax rate to be approximately 17%, reflecting changes to Puerto Rico tax laws and product mix.\nFinally, we expect to grow our non-GAAP earnings per share, with a range of $7.95 to $8.25. This represents growth of approximately 5%. Excluding prior year acquired in-process R&D, adjusted EPS would grow approximately 2%.\nSo before we move over to Q&A, I want to thank our colleagues around the world for the strong performance in 2022. Our strong execution in 2022 and our commitments for 2023 reflects the resiliency of our business and the renewal of our product portfolio. The performance in the year positions us well for long-term growth.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for questions and answers.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of IR, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThanks very much, David. I know it's a very busy schedule today. So we're going to get into the Q&A. If you could keep questions just to one, that would be very helpful. Dennis, could we go to the first question, please?",

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Power, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of IR, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our third quarter 2022 earnings call.\nJoining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer.

I'm pleased to share that we delivered another good quarter, and we continue to advance our strategy to position Bristol-Myers Squibb for sustainable growth.\nIn the third quarter, our in-line and new product portfolio grew by 13% adjusting for foreign exchange, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 3%, while also making substantial progress advancing our promising pipeline.\nHighlights for the quarter included the approval of Sotyktu, our first-in-class TYK2 inhibitor for psoriasis, and closing of our Turning Point acquisition, which brings another product to our portfolio with repotrectinib expected to launch in the second half of next year.\nOverall, I am very pleased that we have significantly advanced the renewal of our portfolio. We have now launched 9 new medicines with 3 first-in-class products approved this year alone.\nLet me take a minute to discuss our new products on Slide 5. Our strategy is to accelerate a diversified portfolio of innovative medicines to market, to renew our business and grow the company during the period of Revlimid exclusivity loss and beyond.\nSupporting this strategy, we delivered 3 key new products this year: Opdualag, Camzyos and Sotyktu. Each is a first-in-class asset, and these products have the potential to contribute meaningfully to our growth.\nOpdualag marks the second approved I-O combination that we delivered. Its strong launch continued during the quarter, furthering our leadership in delivering innovative cancer treatments to patients well into the next decade.\nWe're also encouraged with the progress we have made towards building our foundation for Camzyos as a specialty cardiovascular medicine. We are seeing increasing numbers of patients initiating therapy, and their feedback has been very positive. David will provide more details on the launch in a moment.\nSotyktu has been approved with a label that reflects its profile, and as an oral of choice medicine for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We are very encouraged by the early days of this launch and see significant benefit to these patients with this important new option.\nCombined with our other launch products, these approvals represent a significant milestone in the renewal of our portfolio, allowing multiple avenues for growth in the second half of the decade and beyond.\nTurning to our scorecard on Slide 6. During the quarter, we made great progress on our pipeline milestones. Abecma is now the first BCMA CAR T to have demonstrated superiority to standard regimens in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma based on the positive top line results of KarMMa-3.\nWe also presented exciting data for Milvexian, which has exhibited an approximate 30% relative risk reduction in recurrent symptomatic ischemic strokes on top of dual antiplatelet therapy. It has also shown a safety profile that is differentiated to existing anticoagulants.\nWe believe this asset has great potential as a next-generation antithrombotic treatment, and we look forward to initiating Phase III trials soon. Samit can provide you with the scientific details during our Q&A.\nTurning to Slide 7. You can see several important pipeline catalysts ahead. These include key approvals as well as important registrational data readouts, including the COMMANDS study for Reblozyl.\nAs you will recall, we've said that our early pipeline would generate multiple proof-of-concept data sets over time. Importantly, we are expecting proof-of-concept data for some exciting assets from our early pipeline in the near-term. This data could support transitions of early-stage assets over to full development, thereby strengthening our mid- to late-stage pipeline.\nSome examples include our BCMA T cell engager for multiple myeloma. We believe this could be a differentiated asset, and we expect to present the data at ASH in December. Our second-generation LPA1 agent for pulmonary fibrosis, the unmet need in this disease is very high and should Phase II data be supportive, this asset could move into Phase III trials next year.\nOur androgen receptor degrader is generating some early promising data, and we hope to transition the asset to full development next year. This highlights the breadth of our protein homeostasis platform beyond cell modes, including in solid tumors.\nThese examples demonstrate the power of our R&D engine with a new wave of innovative and differentiated medicines emerging, which have the potential to treat patients with high unmet medical needs. We look forward to updating you on our portfolio of mid-stage assets going forward.\nWith this in mind, let me move to Slide 8 to give you a perspective on how we are thinking about our business moving forward. With continued strong performance of our in-line business, and our 9 launches now in full commercial execution, our priorities have not changed: delivering the full commercial value of the 9 launch products, expanding the opportunity for these assets through new indications, and advancing our mid-stage pipeline.\nAdditionally, we will continue to leverage our financial strength and flexibility to prioritize business development opportunities. As we deliver on renewing our portfolio and transforming our company with a younger and more diversified business, I am confident in the future of Bristol-Myers Squibb.\nWe now have critical mass across all 4 of our therapeutic areas. Each has foundational in-line brands, exciting new products and a broadening mid- to late-stage pipeline. This is important because we believe that this more diversified business of younger products, supported by constant innovation and focus in therapeutic areas where we have real expertise, best position us to navigate the changing U.S. environment.\nBefore I turn it over to David, I want to thank our employees for their relentless focus on delivering for the patients we serve. I am confident we will continue to deliver for patients and our shareholders.\nI will now turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Giovanni, and thanks again for joining our third quarter earnings call.\nLet's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our top line performance. Unless otherwise stated, I will discuss sales performance growth rates on an underlying basis, which excludes the impacts of foreign exchange.\nRevenues in the third quarter were approximately $11.2 billion, consistent with prior year. Our diversified in-line and new product portfolio grew strongly, up 13%, offsetting the impact of our recent LOEs.\nNow let me touch on our performance of our new product portfolio on Slide 11. Global revenues were over $550 million, up 66% versus prior year, driven by continued demand. Growth over prior quarter was also strong, up 16%. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new product portfolio and its future potential.\nWith 3 new launch brands this year and over $2 billion of annualized revenue so far, our portfolio has been largely derisked, increasing our confidence in the potential to generate greater than $25 billion of nonrisk-adjusted revenues in 2029.\nTurning to Slide 12 to discuss our performance of our solid tumor portfolio, Opdivo sales continue to grow globally, up 13%, driven by demand for our newly launched in core indications. In the U.S., sales were strong.\nWe continue to grow double digits, up 17% versus prior year, driven by demand of our newer metastatic and adjuvant indications, partially offset by declining second-line eligibility as well as some use from Opdualag in first-line melanoma.\nInternationally, revenues grew 8%, primarily due to growth from new indications, particularly first-line lung and GI cancers. Looking forward, we continue to expect growth of Opdivo from our new and expanding indications in both early and late-stage cancers.\nNow let's move to Opdualag. We cannot be more pleased with the launch of Opdualag. The launch is off to a great start, being the first LAG-3 inhibitor to launch in fixed-dose combination with our PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo. Sales in the quarter were $84 million, growing 45% sequentially, and sales of Opdualag are already annualizing to approximately $350 million.\nAt this point in the launch, our share in first-line melanoma is in the mid- to high teens. And as expected, we are seeing use of Opdualag coming from PD-1 monotherapy and Opdivo + Yervoy combinations.\nMoving on to our expanded cardiovascular portfolio on Slide 13. Our leading OAC, Eliquis, had another strong quarter, up 16% year-over-year. In the U.S., sales increased 31% versus prior year, driven primarily by demand and favorable gross-to-net adjustments. As expected, sequential performance was driven by the typical dynamics we experienced each year from higher gross-to-net payments, as patients enter the donut hole.\nInternationally, Eliquis has become a leading OAC across numerous countries. Given the success of the product, pricing pressures, as expected, impede growth. Pricing measures in addition to at-risk generic entry in the U.K., Netherlands, affected growth in the quarter.\nNow turning to Camzyos, a first-in-class medicine to treat underlying disease of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We are continue to be pleased with the progress we are making to bring this life-changing medicine to patients.\nTo date, we have over 2,000 REMS-certified health care professionals, which is a good indicator for intent to treat. And we've received extremely positive feedback from physicians and patients. We are also making progress at large HCM centers to ensure they are operationalized to make Camzyos available to patients. As of the end of Q3, there are over 1,100 patients enrolled in our hub and growing each week.\nAs expected, new patients are generally initiating treatment as part of their regularly scheduled echocardiograms. Based on the time to transition patients to commercially dispense medicine, we expect acceleration of revenue beginning in Q4 and as we move into 2023. Chris can provide more details on the launch during Q&A, but we are pleased with the progress we have made.\nTurning to Slide 14 to discuss hematology's performance, starting with Revlimid. Sales in the quarter were approximately $2.4 billion. Sales were primarily impacted by generic entry, particularly in international markets.\nIn the U.S., we saw slower than anticipated entry by second wave generics in September. We expect to see generic erosion progressively increasing in the coming weeks. And at this point, we expect Revlimid sales to be at the upper end of our $9 billion to $9.5 billion range for the year.\nPomalyst global revenues grew 8% versus prior year, primarily driven by demand for triple-based regimens in earlier lines, extending the duration of treatment for patients.\nMoving to Reblozyl, which had another strong quarter. Sales were $190 million in the quarter, up 22% versus prior year. In the U.S., revenue growth was impacted by a onetime change in distribution model in the prior year.\nExcluding the impact from last year, sales would have been approximately 25% versus prior year. This is being driven by continued progress in increasing patient adherence, and extending treatment duration.\nOutside of the U.S., Reblozyl continues to grow driven by demand in both MDS and beta thalassemia associated anemia. To date, we are now reimbursed in 9 countries, and we'll continue to secure reimbursement in additional countries in the future.\nNow turning to our cell therapy assets, Abecma and Breyanzi. Abecma generated strong revenues in the quarter of $107 million. This represents growth of 59% versus prior year or 22% sequentially.\nIn the U.S., sales growth was driven by strong demand, offset primarily by timing of patient infusions, which we expect to materialize in Q4.\nOutside of the U.S., sales increased due to a onetime step-up of slots in select markets, which is expected to be sustained at this level for the foreseeable future.\nWe are very pleased with the manufacturing progress we've made to ensure Abecma gets to more patients, while we continue to work on further expanding our capacity. As we prepare to move Abecma into earlier lines based upon the positive readout of KarMMa-3.\nFinally, on Breyanzi, sales in the quarter were $44 million, up 50% versus prior year. Demand remains strong, and we continue to work hard expanding capacity in the next year to benefit more patients with large B-cell lymphoma. As we communicated in the past, we expect Q4 sales to be largely similar to Q3 sales.\nNow turning to our expanded immunology portfolio on Slide 15. Starting with Zeposia. Global sales in the quarter was $69 million, up 83% versus prior year, largely due to the expansion of Zeposia in ulcerative colitis.\nSequentially, in the U.S., the sales were impacted by last quarter's favorable gross-to-net and wholesaler buying patterns of approximately $20 million. We continue to see demand growth of 12% over last quarter.\nOur strategy remains focused on further expanding volume so we can continue to improve access in 2023, and we made progress on improving the quality of access as well.\nInternationally, we are continuing to make strides in securing reimbursement in additional markets to get Zeposia to more patients living with MS and ulcerative colitis.\nNow turning to our most recent launch, Sotyktu, our first-in-class selective TYK2 inhibitor for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We're extremely pleased with the U.S. label based upon the strong data.\nWhile early in the launch, we are very encouraged by the feedback we are getting from physicians. Our focus is to ensure many patients as possible get Sotyktu, establishing this medicine as the oral of choice allowing us to secure broader formulary position in 2024.\nInternationally, we are also pleased to have received Japanese approval in September, and we look forward to European approval next year.\nLet's now discuss our third quarter P&L on Slide 16. The I've already discussed revenues, so I'll now focus on other key non-GAAP items in the quarter. Gross margins decreased primarily due to product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and related hedging settlements.\nExcluding acquired in-process R&D, operating expenses were broadly in line with prior year, and affected by the timing of spend. Acquired in-process R&D charges in the quarter were $30 million related to an upfront payment to GentiBio. This was offset by $73 million of licensing income benefiting OI&E in the quarter.\nThe third quarter effective tax rate was 16.9%, driven by earnings mix. And overall, we delivered another quarter of earnings growth with non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3% versus prior year.\nMoving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 17. Cash flow from operations in the quarter were $3.7 billion. The company's balance sheet remains strong with approximately $9 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand as of September 30, which also accounts for the $3.3 billion we paid for Turning Point Therapeutics.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Business development continues to be a top priority, and we continue to execute on this strategy with the closing of Turning Point Therapeutics acquisition as a recent example.\nWe remain committed to continued debt reduction. In the quarter, we repaid $2.8 billion of debt, and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. We executed a $5 billion ASR earlier this year, and have $9.5 billion remaining in our share via authorization, and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases.\nNow turning to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 18. We are maintaining our full year outlook. We continue to expect revenues to be approximately $46 billion with our in-line and new product portfolio growing in the low double-digit range. Our recent LOE guidance and Revlimid guidance remain unchanged.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, we expect Revlimid sales to be in the upper end of the $9 billion to $9.5 billion range. We continue to expect gross margin to be approximately 79%, and our operating expenses, excluding acquired in-process R&D remain unchanged, primarily driven by favorability in FX as well as cost discipline, partially offset by the inclusion of expenses from the Turning Point acquisition.\nPutting everything I just mentioned together, we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance, reflecting the strength of our underlying business and absorbing the approximate $0.06 impact from Turning Point acquisition.\nBefore we move over to Q&A session, I want to express my gratitude to our employees for the performance in the quarter and their continued commitment to our patients.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Giovanni and Tim for a Q&A session.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of IR, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nGreat. Thanks very much, David. Dennis, can we go to the first question, please?",

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Power, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of IR, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our second quarter 2022 earnings call.\nI'm joined this morning with prepared remarks by Giovanni Caforio, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and by David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. And also taking part in today's call are Chris Boerner, our Chief Commercialization Officer; and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development.\nYou'll note that we posted slides to bms.com that you can use to follow along with for Giovanni and David's remarks. But before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statements.\nDuring this call, we will make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should be not relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change.\nWe'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which were adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at bms.com.\nAnd I'll hand it over now to Giovanni.\n\nGiovanni Caforio\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our second quarter performance on Slide 4.\nWe are midway through 2022, and we've made great progress during an important year for the company. We continued to grow our in-line franchises, expand our new product portfolio, advance our pipeline and execute important business development activities. Our foundation is strong and positions us well for growth.\nWith respect to our commercial performance, we delivered continued sales growth, with revenue up 5%, adjusting for foreign exchange, and non-GAAP EPS increasing by 18%. The strong revenue growth was driven by excellent commercial execution, with solid year-over-year growth for our in-line brands, particularly for Eliquis and our I-O franchise and significant momentum from our new product portfolio.\nWithin our new product portfolio, Opdualag, our third I-O agent, is off to a great start, and we are pleased with the team's early execution. Opdualag strengthens our position in I-O and accelerates the sustainability and growth of our I-O franchise.\nWe are also establishing a strong foundation for Camzyos as the first agent that effectively treats the underlying condition of symptomatic obstructive HCM. We see a lot of potential to drive significant penetration in this large underserved and underdiagnosed population.\nWe also made great progress advancing our broad set of pipeline opportunities through regulatory approvals and clinical trial readouts during the quarter. In hematology, we received U.S. FDA approval for Breyanzi, with a best-in-class label in second-line large B-cell lymphoma as well as EMA validation. With this approval, Breyanzi now has the broadest patient eligibility of any CAR T cell therapy in relapsed or refractory LBCL. This reinforces our opportunity for leadership in cell therapy and further strengthens our view of Breyanzi as a key growth driver for the company, with over $3 billion in nonrisk-adjusted revenue potential in 2029.\nIn cardiovascular, we delivered positive Phase II data for milvexian in secondary stroke prevention. And we're looking forward to this data being presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting next month. With this data in hand, we plan to initiate our Phase III program by the end of the year, which provides an important opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and extend our world-leading antithrombotic business into the next decade.\nAnd in oncology, we continue to strengthen the growth outlook for Opdivo with another indication in GI cancers, where it now has a leading position.\nDuring the quarter, our financial results were strong, with growth in our in-line and new product businesses. Our financial strength continues to provide us with significant flexibility to deploy capital in a balanced way, including for business development. And during the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Turning Point Therapeutics, a leading precision oncology company.\nOn Slide 5, let's discuss Turning Point's lead asset, repotrectinib, which is a next-generation potential best-in-class TKI, targeting the ROS and NTRK driver mutations of non-small cell lung cancer and advanced solid tumors. Importantly, as you can see on the slide, the key first-line lung cancer data that has been announced for repotrectinib is differentiated from potential competitors on duration of response and safety profile.\nThis acquisition will broaden our portfolio in precision oncology and in solid tumors, and it is a strategic fit for the company. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of this year and believe it would support our medium- to long-term growth strategy, with accretion to non-GAAP EPS beginning in 2025. We plan to continue to leverage our financial strength to pursue transformational science through business development.\nTurning to our execution scorecard on Slide 6. We know the importance of continued delivery of key pipeline milestones, and we have made tremendous progress across therapeutic areas this year. In addition to the key milestones I already mentioned for Breyanzi and milvexian, we have reached mid- to late-stage pipeline, and we are accelerating the next generation of potential medicines. Over time, we believe iberdomide and CC-480 or mezigdomide have the potential to play an important role in multiple myeloma. In that regard, we made good progress during the quarter, having moved iberdomide into its first registrational trial in the second-line setting of multiple myeloma.\nLooking ahead, I am encouraged by the breadth of opportunities for the rest of this year and beyond. We look forward to the PDUFA date for deucravacitinib in psoriasis in September. We're excited for the opportunity to bring this oral-of-choice medicine to moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients soon. With multiple indications on the horizon beyond psoriasis, we believe that this asset has greater than $4 billion in nonrisk-adjusted revenue potential in 2029.\nIn addition, we also expect to see data to support important expansion opportunities for other key medicines over time. These include key data for Abecma, Opdivo, Opdualag and Reblozyl. We hope that this data will enable these medicines to benefit more patients and further expand their commercial potential. I remain excited about the multiple opportunities we have across our pipeline, and I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress.\nAs I review our performance during the first half of 2022, I'm very proud of the employees of Bristol-Myers Squibb around the world. Together, we have built the foundation for an even stronger company, with a more diversified portfolio of growth products and increased durability across each of our 4 key therapeutic areas. Our performance in the quarter continues to demonstrate the resiliency of our business and our continued financial strength. We believe this positions us well to continue to grow our business in an increasingly complex external environment. This includes macroeconomic factors, such as the strengthening U.S. dollar and accelerating inflation as well as legislative headwinds in the U.S. Given our growing and rapidly diversifying business and our continued financial flexibility, we remain very well positioned for the future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through the financials in detail. David?\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Giovanni, and thanks, again, for all of you joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our solid top line performance. Unless otherwise stated, I will discuss our sales performance growth rates on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\nSecond quarter revenues were approximately $11.9 billion, growing 5% year-over-year. This performance was driven by robust growth of our in-line and new product portfolio of 16%, more than offsetting our recent LOEs.\nLet's now double-click on our new product portfolio performance on Slide 9. Global revenues were nearly $500 million, more than doubling revenue versus prior year. Growth over prior quarter was also very strong, up 38%, primarily due to strong launches of Abecma and Opdualag, which I will touch on in a moment. I'm very pleased with the performance of our new product portfolio and its future potential, with 2 additional launches year-to-date and deucravacitinib's anticipated approval in 6 weeks. Our new product portfolio has significant expansion opportunities and the potential to generate greater $25 billion in revenue on a nonrisk-adjusted basis in 2029. I look forward to updating you on these products as they continue to realize their full potential.\nThe performance of our solid tumor portfolio, shown on Slide 10, was strong. Opdivo sales in the quarter continued to grow globally, driven by demand for our newly launched and core indications. In the U.S., we delivered 12% growth for Opdivo versus prior year, driven by demand in first-line lung, renal and gastric cancer as well as adjuvant esophageal and bladder cancers, partially offset by some -- Opdualag in first-line melanoma.\nInternationally, revenues were also strong, growing 13% primarily due to growth from new indications, particularly first-line lung and renal cancers as we continue to secure reimbursement in many countries. Looking forward, we expect continued growth from Opdivo from our new and expanding indications in both early and late-stage cancers.\nYervoy sales grew 7% globally, and in the U.S., revenues were consistent with prior year as we experienced some variability in RCC and melanoma as well as higher inventory burn and gross-to-net adjustments this year. Importantly, sequential revenues grew 5%, primarily driven by demand in first-line lung cancer, and we continue to expect growth for the brand.\nNow to our strong launch of Opdualag, the first fixed-dose combination of a LAG-3 and PD-1 inhibitor. While still early in the launch, we have already generated $58 million of sales in the quarter, driven primarily by robust demand and $10 million of stocking. The robust demand for Opdualag has mainly been in line with our strategy, taking share from PD-1 monotherapy and, as expected, some use in place of Opdivo-Yervoy combination. Internationally, we are pleased with the recent CHMP positive opinion in Europe and look forward to realizing Opdualag's potential to be a new standard of care in patients with metastatic melanoma around the world.\nTurning to our growing cardiovascular portfolio on Slide 11, starting with Eliquis, our leading OAC globally, with strong revenue growth of 20% year-over-year. In the U.S., sales increased 27% versus prior year, driven primarily by demand growth and favorable gross-to-net adjustments. As a reminder, looking to the third and fourth quarters, we expect the usual dynamics for Medicare coverage gap, with second half revenues being lower than first half as we've seen in previous years.\nInternationally, sales grew 9% versus a year ago. This growth was primarily driven by increased share across key markets as the brand continues to be the #1 OAC in multiple countries. This was partially offset by pricing actions in many markets as demand grows and, to a smaller extent, at-risk generic launch in the U.K. and the Netherlands. For the second half of the year, we expect the impact of at-risk generic launch to be approximately $250 million.\nNow turning to our most recent launch, Camzyos. As you know, the vast majority of patients initiating treatment on Camzyos are starting on a free trial offer for at least 30 days. And then the $3 million recorded in revenue in the quarter was mainly due to stocking. During the second quarter, we have successfully laid the foundation, leveraging our strong CV leadership in REMS to certify over 1,000 health care professionals. We are now focused on broadening our user base and supporting the initiation of patients on Camzyos. We are pleased with the physician feedback thus far and look forward to helping more patients living with symptomatic oHCM.\nMoving on to a few of our hematology products on Slide 12, starting with Revlimid. Sales in the quarter were approximately $2.5 billion. Sales were primarily impacted by generic entry, particularly in international markets. In the U.S., while we did experience demand softness from the volume-limited generic entry in the quarter, we understand that specialty pharmacies are mainly utilizing the current generic for new patients to ensure continuity of treatment. As mentioned in the past, we know there will be variability quarter-to-quarter based on how generics will deploy their volume. As additional entrants will be coming to the market in the U.S. in the third quarter, we expect Q3 revenues to be approximately $2.1 billion. We maintained our full year global sales guidance of $9 billion to $9.5 billion.\nPomalyst global revenues grew 9% versus prior year, primarily driven by demand for triple-base regimens in earlier lines and extending duration of treatment.\nNow moving to Reblozyl, which generated $172 million in the quarter, up a strong 36% versus prior year. In the U.S., we are seeing encouraging trends in patient adherence and extended treatment duration. Outside of the U.S., Reblozyl continues to grow, driven by demand in both MDS and beta thalassemia-associated anemia and as we obtained reimbursement in additional countries.\nFinally, turning to our cell therapy assets, Abecma and Breyanzi. Abecma generated strong revenues in the quarter, equaling $89 million. This represents a 36% sequential increase over last quarter, driven by expanded capacity and vector supply. Though we're encouraged to treat more multiple myeloma patients, demand continues to outpace supply, and we are focused on further expanding capacity, including additional manufacturing sites in the future.\nAs it relates to Breyanzi, sales in the quarter were $39 million. Demand remained strong for the brand, although sales were impacted by lower-than-expected manufacturing success rates, which now have been addressed. Importantly, as Giovanni mentioned, we are very pleased to have received a differentiated broad second-line label in large B-cell lymphoma patients. We are working hard and investing to expand capacity early next year to enable uptake for this indication. As we work through building additional capacity to treat more patients in earlier lines, we expect revenues in the third and fourth quarters to be largely similar to the first quarter of this year.\nMoving on to our immunology product summary on Slide 13. Orencia global sales grew 11% versus prior year due to expanded U.S. sales driven by increased market share as well as demand in international markets.\nTurning to Zeposia, global sales for the quarter were $66 million, more than doubling sales versus last year, primarily due to expansion of Zeposia into ulcerative colitis. Sequentially, in the U.S., sales were primarily driven by a combination of favorable gross to net and wholesale buying patterns of approximately $20 million. Importantly, we're encouraged by the 24% demand growth over the previous quarter, and we remain focused on working to for expand volume, so we can continue to improve access in 2023. Internationally, Zeposia continues to secure reimbursement in other markets for MS and UC.\nClosing out on immunology. We very much look forward to broadening our portfolio with another first-in-class asset, our selective TYK2 inhibitor, deucravacitinib. Our commercial and medical teams are in place, and we're ready for launch.\nNow let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss the second quarter P&L. I've already discussed our revenue, so I'll now focus on the other key line item -- non-GAAP line items. Gross margins decreased primarily due to product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and related hedging settlements.\nOur operating expenses, excluding acquired in-process R&D, were broadly in line with prior year, driven by higher investments around our new product portfolio and pipeline, offset primarily by foreign exchange.\nAcquired in-process R&D charges in the quarter were $400 million, primarily driven by the buyout of a royalty obligation for Camzyos of $295 million as well as a $90 million upfront for BridgeBio. This accounted for a 17% impact to diluted EPS. Acquired in-process R&D charges in the prior year were approximately $793 million, which accounted for a $0.30 impact to diluted EPS.\nThe second quarter tax rate was impacted by earnings mix. And lastly, we delivered strong non-GAAP EPS growth in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. This includes the $0.14 impact of acquired in-process R&D. Excluding acquired in-process R&D, non-GAAP EPS would have grown 7%.\nNow moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 15. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with $13.2 billion in cash and market securities on hand as of June 30. Cash flow from operations in the first half of the year was $6.1 billion. In the quarter, it was approximately $2.3 billion, which is impacted by a cash tax payment, and we expect cash flow from operations to rebound in Q3 and Q4.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Business development continues to be a top priority, and we continue to execute on this priority with the announcement of the planned acquisition of Turning Point Therapeutics.\nWe remain committed to continued debt reduction. In the quarter, we repaid $2.9 billion of debt.\nAnd we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. We executed a $5 billion ASR earlier this year and remain opportunistic about repurchases in the future.\nNow turning to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 16. We are updating our revenue guidance to be approximately $46 billion this year, reflecting the significant appreciation of the U.S. dollar to other global currencies. Excluding the effects of currency, the underlying sales growth for the business is expected to be 2% versus 2021. We estimate the FX impact to full year sales at today's spot rate to be about $1.5 billion.\nWe continue to expect our in-line and new product portfolio to grow in the low double-digit range and reaffirm our LOE guidance, including Revlimid's guidance of $9 billion to $9.5 billion for the year.\nGross margin is expected to be approximately 79%, up 100 basis points from previous guidance due to favorable impact of currency and related hedging settlements.\nOur operating expense guidance, excluding acquired in-process R&D remained unchanged, declining in the low single digits versus prior year. This is primarily driven by favorability in FX as well as cost discipline. In terms of phasing for the second half of the year, we expect a more even phasing of expenses than in prior years.\nAll said, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP adjusted EPS guidance based on the underlying strength of our portfolio, mitigating currency translation from our natural hedges and hedging program.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I just wanted to express my gratitude to all our colleagues around the world for continuing to deliver strong commercial, clinical and financial results. The resiliency of our company and exciting catalysts ahead make me energized by the growth opportunity ahead of us.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of IR, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThanks, David. Sarah, could we go to our first question, please?",

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Power, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTimothy Power\n\nVP & Head of IR, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Sergei, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Chris Boerner, our Chief Commercialization Officer; and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development.\nAs you'll note, we've posted slides to bms.com that you can follow along with for Giovanni and David's remarks. But before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statements.\nDuring this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any future date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements even if our estimates change. We'll also focus our comments on our non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude certain specified items. Reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on bms.com.\nAnd so I'll hand over now to Giovanni.\n\nGiovanni Caforio\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our first quarter performance on Slide 4. This is an important year for Bristol-Myers Squibb, and I'm pleased to share that we've had a strong start to 2022. In fact, just yesterday, the FDA-approved mavacamten or Camzyos. This is a first-in-class medicine for patients living with symptomatic obstructive HCM. It's an important milestone for patients who up until now had no options to treat the underlying cause of this disease. I'm proud that we're giving hope to patients and improving their quality of life.\nIt's also an important milestone for BMS. With U.S. approvals of Opdualag and Camzyos so far this year, we have significantly strengthened our new product portfolio. And we are on track to potentially launch 3 important new first-in-class medicines this year.\nAddition, strong commercial execution in the quarter resulted in solid year-over-year growth from our in-line products and new product portfolio. During the quarter, we saw the first entries of Revlimid generics in the U.S. and Europe. David will comment on our first quarter dynamics. But for the full year, U.S. entry expectations remain the same, while ex U.S. erosion is expected to be faster than previously anticipated.\nOverall, we grew revenue by 5% and delivered double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth compared to the same quarter last year. There is good momentum in our business, and our performance in Q1 validates that we are well prepared for the renewal of our portfolio with multiple catalysts across in-line products and new product portfolio to more than offset upcoming LOEs and drive growth through the decade. Our very strong financial position gives us significant flexibility as we continue to prioritize business development while paying down debt and expanding shareholder distributions.\nNow let me turn to our scorecard on Slide 5 and provide some context around the important achievements of the quarter. We are making good progress against our milestones, which are central to delivering on our long-term strategy and growth as a company. Starting with the milestones we show during the quarter. Opdivo was approved in the U.S. in March as the first I-O agent to treat early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients before surgery. This indication strengthens its profile in line and provides additional tailwind for growth.\nWhile disappointed with the results of the Bempeg program, we are very pleased with the significant progress of our new product portfolio overall. Breyanzi is now approved in Europe, our second CAR T cell therapy approved in the EU. As you know, we've been planning to bring 3 important new products to market this year. So far, 2 of those new products, Opdualag and Camzyos received FDA approval. Many of our new products have significant expansion opportunities. For Opdualag, we recently initiated a pivotal study in colorectal cancer. And for deucravacitinib, we delivered a successful Phase II proof-of-concept result in lupus.\nLooking to the future, the breadth of milestones ahead is exciting. One that we're looking forward to is the Milvexian Phase II data in secondary stroke prevention. We have decades of expertise in cardiovascular disease, and we believe this could be a medicine that treats an even broader population of patients than current oral anticoagulants. We expect to get Phase II data in-house around the middle of the year. And depending on the results, we plan to start Phase III trials later this year.\nTurning to our 3 new products on Slide 6. As I mentioned, in March, we received approval for Opdualag for the treatment of patients with unreceptible for metastatic melanoma. Opdualag is our first-in-class, fixed-dose, dual immunotherapy combination of nivolumab and the LAG-3 blocking agent antibody relatlimab. The combination of relatlimab and nivolumab demonstrated a clinically meaningful PFS and OS benefit. Opdualag marks the second approved I-O combination that we've delivered and demonstrates our continued scientific leadership in I-O.\nWhile we are still in the early days, I can say that the Opdualag launch is going very well. We believe this medicine has the opportunity to become a new standard of care for melanoma patients. In addition to melanoma, Opdualag has the potential for new indications. And we are exploring important opportunities in lung, liver and colorectal cancers.\nTurning now to our just FDA-approved mavacamten or Camzyos. The benefit of Camzyos for patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM were further reinforced with the exciting VALOR data presented at ACC this month. We're launching Camzyos in the U.S. and look forward to receiving EU approval and launching international with future indications to come.\nFinally, we continue to be excited about the opportunity for the deucravacitinib. As you know, we have an FDA PDUFA date in September for psoriasis. We believe that psoriasis patients need better oral options. And this asset has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to the oral standard of care with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.\nDuring the first quarter, we also delivered a successful Phase II proof-of-concept result in lupus, positioning us to start Phase III studies later this year in a disease with a very high unmet need. Importantly, the lupus data continues to show the consistent and differentiated safety profile of a selective TYK2 inhibitor. We plan to share comprehensive data with the scientific community at upcoming congress this year.\nWith our upcoming FDA PDUFA date in the third quarter, Phase III trials already underway in psoriatic arthritis and a proof-of-concept achieved in lupus and additional phase II trials ongoing, including in IBD, our confidence in the potential of this program continues to grow.\nNow turning to Slide 7. Thanks to the hard work, dedication and strong execution by our employees, I am confident in our ability to deliver on our strategy and more than offset key LOEs by continuing the growth of our in-line products with $8 billion to $10 billion in incremental sales and delivering $10 billion to $13 billion of revenue expected from our new product portfolio by 2025. Our strong clinical performance further derisks our launch portfolio. And as a result, we have confidence in our ability to deliver the $25 billion plus in nonrisk-adjusted revenue in 2029. We have a strong foundation in place. And as the renewal of our portfolio gains further traction this year, I am confident in the potential of our company.\nNow I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid V. Elkins\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n\nThank you, Giovanni, and welcome again to our first quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to turn to Slide 9 to discuss our top line performance. Unless otherwise stated, I will discuss sales performance on an underlying basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation.\nTotal company revenues in the quarter exceeded $11.6 billion, growing 7% year-over-year. This was driven by strong double-digit sales of our in-line and new product portfolio, partially offset by our recent LOEs. Let's take a closer look at our new product portfolio performance on Slide 10. In the first quarter, the new product portfolio contributed $350 million in revenue, more than doubling revenue versus prior year. With the combination of factors, including the usual year-end buying patterns impacting sequential performance, we remain confident in the growth potential of the new product portfolio.\nThe first-in-class approvals of Opdualag and yesterday's FDA approval of Camzyos further strengthened our confidence in the new product portfolio. We also look forward to our upcoming PDUFA date for deucravacitinib in September, which would deliver another first-in-class medicine for patients with the opportunity to deliver more than $4 billion in nonrisk-adjusted revenue in 2029. These initial approvals are just the beginning as many of these new medicines have significant expansion opportunities into additional indications.\nNow let's look at our expanded more diversified business by therapeutic area. Turning to our solid tumor performance on Slide 11. Opdivo and Yervoy continued their growth trajectory, growing double digits versus prior year. This is driven by continued demand for our newly launched indications and our core indications.\nIn the U.S., Opdivo grew double-digit versus prior year, driven by demand in first-line lung, renal and gastric cancer as well as adjuvant esophageal and bladder cancers. Outside the U.S., first quarter year-over-year revenues increased double digit. This strong growth was primarily driven by expanded access in emerging markets as well as demand for new indications in developed markets as we continue to secure reimbursement.\nLooking forward, we expect continued growth of Opdivo from our new and expanding indications. With the launch of Opdualag in mid-March, we are pleased to be the only company with 3 approved I-O agents. While early days in the launch, we generated approximately $6 million in sales, half of which was demand and the other half stocking. We are encouraged by the initial feedback suggesting the potential for Opdualag to be a new standard of care for patients with metastatic melanoma, and I look forward to providing more updates as the year progresses.\nNow let's move to our growing cardiovascular portfolio on Slide 12. I'll start with Eliquis, which continues to grow globally, with revenues up 14% year-over-year. In the U.S., sales increased 12% versus prior year, driven primarily by total prescription growth of 10%. Internationally, sales were strong, up 17% versus a year ago. This strong double-digit growth was primarily driven by increased share across key markets, and the brand continues to be the #1 NOAC in multiple countries.\nTurning to our expanded portfolio. I'm really excited about the approval of mavacamten now known as Camzyos for patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or oHCM. We plan to leverage BMS's existing CV leadership, building our strong expertise and relationship, focused initially at top HCM centers. Our field teams are excited to bring this product to patients in the U.S., and Chris can provide more details on our go-to-market strategy in the Q&A session.\nNow let's turn our attention over to a few of our hematology products on Slide 13, starting with Revlimid. Sales in the quarter were nearly $2.8 billion. Revenues were primarily impacted by generic entry. During Q1, we saw generics enter the U.S. later than expected entry and so far at a modest pace. As mentioned last quarter, we expect variability quarter-to-quarter due to the uncertainty of how generic players will enter the market, though there is no change to our outlook for the U.S. Revlimid this year and beyond, we expect favorability we saw in Q1 to reverse in Q2. And internationally, generics launch broadly across Europe in mid-February and erosion has been faster than expected. As a result, we now expect full year global sales to be approximately $9 billion to $9.5 billion. Based upon U.S. phasing and ex U.S. dynamics, we expect second quarter global revenues to be approximately $2 billion.\nPomalyst global revenues grew from 9% versus prior year. Global revenues continued to be driven by volume and market share gains as patients move to earlier lines of treatment and extending duration of treatment.\nNow moving to Reblozyl, which generated revenues of $156 million in the quarter. Sales were up 41% versus prior year, primarily driven by continued demand in ESA refractory MDS patients. In the U.S. to date, we have robust on-label share in RS-positive patients. We're seeing encouraging trends in the reduction of time in the switch from ESA failures, which is also supported by NCCN guidelines. We have also made progress in physicians uptrading a patient's dose to ensure sustained duration and benefit. Our focus remains on patient identification and dose titration for optimal outcomes.\nAnd outside the U.S., Reblozyl continues to grow with increased share in both MDS and beta-thalassemia associated anemia. We have now launched in 6 countries outside the U.S. and expect to launch in more markets in 2022. Moving to cell therapy launches, Abecma and Breyanzi. Abecma generated revenues of $67 million in the first quarter. As expected, sales were largely similar to the fourth quarter of 2021 as demand continues to be robust, and worked hard to expand capacity. We are on track to expand capacity in the middle of this year to be able to help more patients with highly refractory multiple myeloma.\nAs it relates to Breyanzi, sales in the quarter were $44 million. Sales were driven primarily by demand in the U.S., while physicians continue to recognize Breyanzi's best-in-class profile. We are very pleased with the recent EU approval for Breyanzi in third-line plus large B-cell lymphoma and look forward to launching in select markets in 2022.\nAdditionally, we are preparing for the U.S. launch of Breyanzi in second-line large B cell lymphoma in June and are ramping up capacity in order to treat more patients.\nMoving to our immunology product summary on Slide 14. Orencia sales grew 6% versus prior year due to expanded U.S. sales, driven by increased market share in the U.S. As it relates to Zeposia, global sales in the quarter were $36 million, doubling sales compared to prior year. Sequentially in the U.S., we saw encouraging demand growth that was offset primarily by buying patterns from prior quarter and higher gross-to-net impacts related to patient access and ulcerative colitis. We are pleased with the awareness and perception of Zeposia in UC and are encouraged by the strong increase in new patient starts.\nWe continue to work further expanding volume while strengthening access and reimbursement and expect to have increased contribution from UC in the second half of this year and expanding in 2023. Internationally, Zeposia continues to secure reimbursement in other markets for MS as well as obtain additional reimbursement for the newly approved UC indication last quarter. Lastly, as we continue to broaden our immunology portfolio, launch plans are already underway to prepare for deucravacitinib's upcoming PDUFA date in September.\nNow, let's turn to our first quarter P&L on Slide 15. As noted recently, we changed the presentation of our non-GAAP results. Along with other pharmaceutical companies, we no longer exclude significant research and development charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights. These charges have been included in our GAAP results, and there's no impact to the economics of our business. Going forward, we will now include these previously specified charges in both GAAP and non-GAAP results as a new line item called acquired in-process research and development as well as capture the previously specified income in our OI&E line item.\nIn the quarter, operating expenses, excluding acquired in-process research and development increased versus prior year, primarily due to increased MS&A driven by differences in timing of spend in the prior year as well as investments in our new product portfolio. Net charges of $280 million consisting of acquired in-process R&D charges offset by licensing income are primarily driven by upfront milestone payments associated with the Immatics and Dragonfly licensing agreements.\nThe first quarter effective tax rate was impacted by earnings mix. Even with this new financial presentation and the $0.10 impact from the inclusion of acquired in-process R&D and previously specified income, our strong performance in the quarter allowed us to grow non-GAAP EPS 13% versus last year. Excluding this, the new presentation chain of non-GAAP EPS would have grown 18%.\nNow moving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 16. Cash flow generation for the company remained strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was approximately $3.8 billion. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with approximately $15 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. BD continues to be a top priority, and we remain committed to continued debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders.\nAnd in the quarter, we executed a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Approximately 65 million shares or 85% of the $5 billion aggregate repurchase price were delivered to the company in the quarter. The ASR will settle over the next couple of quarters, and we remain opportunistic about future share repurchases.\nNow turning to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance on Slide 17. As you know, we guide based upon prevailing exchange rates at the time we report the results. We're updating our top line guidance to be in line to prior year, primarily due to movements in foreign exchange, reflecting the spot rate of the dollar today and faster erosion of Revlimid outside the U.S.\nRecent LOE product guidance is also being changed to reflect the updated Revlimid outlook in the range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. So FX headwinds impact our entire portfolio. The outlook for in-line products and the new product portfolio remains unchanged. This reflects the strong performance and confidence in our future growth drivers. We now expect total operating expenses, excluding in-process R&D, to decline in the low single digits versus prior year, driven primarily by cost discipline and the impact of foreign exchange.\nExcluding the change in financial presentation that we've adopted for non-GAAP earnings, there is no change to our outlook for non-GAAP EPS for the year. With the impact of certain acquired in-process R&D and licensing income that are now included in non-GAAP EPS, our new range of $7.44 to $7.74. This change is driven by the previously announced $0.10 impact from the actuals in the first quarter, an additional $0.11 related to the buyout of future royalty obligations from mavacamten that occurred in April.\nBefore we move on to Q&A, I want to thank our colleagues around the world to continue to deliver strong commercial, clinical and financial results. And I'm really excited for what lies ahead.\nI'll now turn it back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Power, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\n>>Timothy Power - Head of IR\n\nThank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me this morning with prepared remarks are Giovanni Caforio, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and David Elkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating in today's call are Chris Berner, our Chief Commercialization Officer; and Samit Hirawat, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Drug Development.\nAs you'll note, we posted slides to bms.com that you can follow along with for Giovanni and David's remarks. And before we get started, I'll read our forward-looking statements.\nDuring this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on bms.com.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Giovanni.\n\n>>Giovanni Caforio - CEO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our fourth quarter performance on Slide 4. I'm pleased to report we delivered another strong quarter, building on our very good performance throughout 2021. Our commercial results were strong across the portfolio with robust performance in our continuing business, driven by Eliquis and accelerated growth for Opdivo as well as continued demand growth for our new products.\nThe launch of Zeposia in ulcerative colitis is progressing well in the U.S., and we obtained European approval during the quarter. We are pleased with continued demand growth for Reblozyl in ESA refractory MDS and transfusion-dependent\n(inaudible) And our cell therapies, Breyanzi and Abecma, continue to see significant demand while we remain focused on broadening supply and expanding indications over time.\nWe are advancing our strategy and delivered key pipeline milestones in the fourth quarter. This enables us to help more patients, accelerate the renewal of our portfolio and support our growth outlook.\nLet me highlight some key achievements. We submitted applications for the deucravacitinib in the U.S., EU and Japan, which position us well to grow our presence in immunology. We are excited about the potential of the deucravacitinib as the oral standard of care in moderate to severe psoriasis and various other autoimmune diseases.\nWe are expanding our cardiovascular portfolio and presented exciting data at AHA for Milvexian, which we see as the next-generation anti-thrombotic with a $5 billion-plus non-risk-adjusted revenue opportunity.\nWe presented important updates at ASH on our hematology pipeline. This includes encouraging data for iberdomide S4AG, our exciting new multiple myeloma agents. These have the potential to replace Revlimid and (inaudible) Importantly, the transform data for Breyanzi in second-line B-cell lymphoma showed changing benefit compared to the current standard of care. We continue to see Breyanzi as one of the key growth drivers for the company with over $3 billion in nonrisk-adjusted revenue potential.\nOur strong execution helped drive solid financial performance in the fourth quarter. We reported 8% sales growth and double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. Our strong cash flow and financial strength provide us with significant financial flexibility. This enables us to continue prioritizing disciplined business development opportunities while paying down debt and expanding shareholder distributions.\nWe also introduced our 2022 guidance last month, and I'll let David speak to the details in a moment. What's important is that we are guiding to growth this year, with low double-digit growth from our continuing business, more than offsetting the Revlimid revenue impact from generics in the U.S. and internationally.\nTurning to our 2021 execution scorecard on Slide 5. At the beginning of last year, I outlined a number of milestones that we believe would be important to our future, including opportunities to renew our portfolio and grow our business during the decade. I am pleased to report we've made great progress. We returned Opdivo's growth, successfully launched multiple new products and produced key expansion data sets for several assets. This record of execution across the company further strengthens my confidence in our ability to continue to renew our portfolio and grow in the future.\nWe know we must remain focused on advancing our pipeline to accelerate the renewal of our portfolio. And on Slide 6, you can see there are multiple catalysts ahead during 2022. The 2022 milestones include expected approvals and launches for 3 exciting first-in-class medicines, mavacamten, deucravacitinib and rolazumab. We believe that all of this have the potential to further strengthen the commercial opportunity for our new product portfolio and support our growth outlook. We expect that each of these assets has at least $4 billion of revenue potential at the end of the decade on a nonrisk-adjusted basis. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout the year.\nLooking to the future, Slide 7 summarizes our perspective of how all of this comes together to support the growth of the company moving forward. We expect the growth in our continuing business will enable us to more than offset key LOEs through 2025, with continued growth of our in-line brands and $10 billion to $13 billion of additional sales expected from our new product portfolio.\nIn the second half of the decade, with a broad and expanding product portfolio, we will have multiple paths to achieving our growth objective from 2025 to 2029. As we've said, we expect more than $25 billion in nonrisk-adjusted revenue potential from the current new product portfolio in '29, with additional contributions coming from our pipeline, including assets like Milvexian and our exciting (inaudible) agents.\nAs we continue our journey to renew our business and grow through the impact of LOEs starting this year, I'm increasingly excited about the future of Bristol-Myers Squibb. With that, I'll turn it over to David to walk you through the financials. David?\n\n>>David Elkins - CFO\n\nThank you, Giovanni, and thank you all for joining our call today. I'd like to start with our strong top line performance on Slide 9. We closed out the year with another great quarter across our key franchises. Revenues grew high single digits versus prior year, which was driven primarily by increased demand for our in-line and new product portfolios.\nNow let's turn to some product specifics, starting with Eliquis on Slide 10. Eliquis continues to deliver extraordinary growth with global sales up 20% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In the U.S., fourth quarter sales increased 22% versus prior year, driven primarily by total prescription growth of 13%. Internationally, sales growth continues to be driven by increased share across all key markets, and the brand remains the # 1 OAC in multiple countries. Looking forward, the growth outlook for Eliquis remains strong as we continue to grow the oral anticoagulant class and increase our share within the class. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2021 did experience a onetime favorable true-up in the U.S. of approximately $160 million that will not repeat in Q1 of '22.\nMoving to Optiva's performance on Slide 11. We are very pleased with the accelerated momentum growing 11% globally versus prior year. This is driven by strong demand, particularly for our new launch indications. In the U.S., fourth quarter revenues were strong, up 16% versus prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to demand in metastatic indications, including first-line lung, first-line renal and first-line gastric cancers as well as adjuvant indications with the approvals of adjuvant esophageal and adjuvant bladder cancers in 2021.\nInternationally, fourth quarter revenues grew 5% versus prior year, driven largely by demand for new indications and expanded access primarily in emerging markets. More broadly, we continue to see uptake of our new launches in lung and renal cancer in Germany and Japan. And we secured reimbursement in Italy and Spain in the fourth quarter. As we look forward, we continue to expect further growth for Opdivo as we secure additional reimbursement for recent approvals.\nWe're in a strong position to continue to grow Opdivo and look forward to additional approvals this year and in the years ahead.\nNow let's turn to our portfolio on Slide 12, starting with Revlimid. Fourth quarter revenues grew 1% globally versus prior year and grew 6% for the full year with sales of approximately $12.8 billion. As we enter into the first year of generic entry for Revlimid, I want to remind everyone of our expectations for Revlimid sales in 2022 and beyond. We expect Revlimid sales of $9.5 billion to $10 billion in 2022. Of these sales, we expect roughly 75% to come from the U.S. and the remaining from ex U.S. markets. As we think about generic entry this year, we expect sales variability quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of how generic competitors fulfill their annual volumes. For the first quarter, our best projection for global Revlimid sales is approximately $2.5 billion. Beyond '22 through 2025, although there's still uncertainty due to ongoing litigation, we view an annual stepdown of roughly $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year as a reasonable projection.\nNow on to Pomalyst. Global sales in the fourth quarter were up 2%. Sales were primarily driven by demand for triple-based therapies in ex U.S. markets and fewer selling days in the U. S. We continue to expect growth for Pomalyst as treatments move to earlier lines of therapy and more triplet-based therapies are approved with longer duration of treatment. As it relates to U.S. IP for Pomalyst, we are pleased that there is now no outstanding litigation. At this point, we don't expect generic entry in the U.S. market prior to the first quarter of 2026.\nNow let's move on to our new product portfolio on Slide 13. We are very pleased with the momentum and feedback we're receiving on our new product portfolio. These products contributed over $350 million in the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. Let me provide some color on each launch individually, starting with Reblozyl, which generated global revenues of just over $550 million in 2021, more than doubling its revenues over last year.\nIn the U.S., Full year sales grew 87% versus prior year, primarily due to continued demand in ESA refractory MDS patients. Demand continued to grow in the fourth quarter. Sequentially, revenue was impacted by onetime favorable inventory build in the third quarter of approximately $20 million to $25 million. Our focus remains on treating new patients earlier in their treatment journey upon ESA failure as well ensuring physicians titrate the patients up to receive the appropriate dose for sustained benefit.\nInternationally, we continue to launch in additional countries and expect to continue to do so in 2022, helping more patients and driving additional growth for the brand.\nNow moving to our cell therapy launches of Abecma and Breyanzi. Abecma generated revenues of $164 million since its launch in May of last year. Revenues reflect very strong demand for the first-ever BCMA cell therapy. As noted in the past, demand continues to be very robust, and we're working hard to expand capacity. We expect first quarter revenues to be largely similar to fourth quarter.\nTurning to our CD19 cell therapy, Breyanzi. Physicians continue to recognize Breyanzi's best-in-class profile for relapsed/ refractory patients. We look forward to moving Breyanzi up the treatment paradigm in the second-line setting with remarkable EFS data presented from our TRANSFORM study at ASH, and we look forward to bringing this treatment to second-line patients in the U. S. this year.\nNow moving to Zeposia. Global sales for the year were $134 million, primarily driven by our multiple sclerosis indication. In the U. S., the MS launch continues to go well. Zeposia remains the leading S1P in written prescriptions, and we remain focused on establishing symposium not only is is the S1P of choice, but also the oral treatment of choice.\nWe continue to be pleased with the progress we have made on patient conversion, with significant decrease in time to commercial therapy. Our early UC launch is continuing to gain traction with a leading share of voice and increased overall volume. Physicians are responding well to the profile, and we're encouraged by their intent to prescribe. We are working on building volume and growing access and reimbursement. We expect to have increased contribution from UC in the second half of this year and expanding in 2023.\nInternationally, Zeposia continues to gain momentum in MS as the product gets additional reimbursement in more markets and benefited from year-end stocking. We are very pleased with the recent EMA approval of UC in December and look forward to securing access and reimbursement for this indication to drive further growth for the brand.\nLastly, on (inaudible) the U.S., we continue to make progress on establishing the product for patients with complete remission following intensive chemotherapy. Our focus remains on shaping the maintenance segment and increasing adoption and patient adherence. Overall, I'm pleased with our new product portfolio performance and look forward to 3 additional approvals expected this year. We are launch-ready for ralatinab and mavacamten with PDUFA date in March and April, and we're on track for deucravacitinib's launch in September.\nNow switching gears to our fourth quarter P&L on Slide 14. Having just covered sales performance, let me walk you through a few non-GAAP key line items. Operating expenses increased versus prior quarter due to timing of MS&A investments that shifted from -- to the fourth quarter as noted in October. S&A decreased versus prior year due to some incremental and accelerated investments to support our business in 2020. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was impacted by earnings mix. And as a result, the strong performance in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS increased approximately 25% year-over-year.\nMoving to the balance sheet and capital allocation on Slide 15. We continue to generate a significant amount of cash from operations with approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with approximately $17 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Business development remains our top priority to further renew and diversify our portfolio. And we are also focused on reducing debt and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe have executed several business development deals last year, bringing in differentiated early-stage assets. We have the financial strength to be size-agnostic, but we are particularly interested in early science and midsized bolt-on deals.\nAs it relates to debt in 2021, we reduced gross debt by over $6 billion and remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating. Lastly, as it relates to returning capital to shareholders, we recently grew the dividend by over 10%, which was our 13th consecutive increase. Additionally, we increased our share repurchase authorization by $15 billion and plan to execute a $5 billion ASR this quarter.\nNow turning to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance at current exchange rates on Slide 16. As announced last month, we expect '22 revenues to be approximately $47 billion, representing low single-digit growth over 2021. Growth from our continuing business will more than offset the revenue impact from Revlimid and Abraxane LOEs. We expect key LOE brand sales to be approximately $10.5 billion. And our continuing business, which represents our in-line and new product portfolios, is expected to grow low-double digit and contribute approximately $36.5 billion.\nAs it relates to our line item guidance for the year, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 78% and our total operating expenses to be in line with 2021 expenses, and we project our tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.\nFinally, also communicated earlier this year, we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow faster in sales and be between $7.65 and $7.95. As it relates to our share count, I'd like to provide a little color as we plan to execute the $5 billion ASR. We ended the year with approximately 2.2 billion diluted shares outstanding. We will be executing the ASR later this quarter, which means we will get a majority, but not all of the benefit on diluted share count this year.\nLastly, given this is the first quarter of generic entry for Revlimid, we thought it would be helpful to provide some perspective on revenue for the first quarter. In addition to the approximately $2.5 billion of Revlimid sales I mentioned previously, we are projecting total global first quarter sales to range from $11 billion to $11.5 billion.\nSo before I turn it over to question and answer, I just want to thank our teams around the world for delivering these remarkable results in 2021. These results and our guidance for 2022 demonstrate the financial strength of the business and the renewal of our portfolio, which positions us well for long-term growth.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tim and Giovanni for Q&A.",

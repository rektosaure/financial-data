Welcome to Corning Inc. Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is my pleasure to introduce you Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Corning's Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.\nYou should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nFor the third quarter, differences between GAAP and core EPS include noncash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's translated earnings contracts and foreign denominated debt as well as constant currency adjustments. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.\nA reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported another excellent quarter. Year-over-year sales grew 14% and to $4.27 billion. EPS grew 24% to $0.67, again outpacing sales growth. Operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 19.6%. ROIC increased 160 basis points to 13.4%.\nFree cash flow of $535 million puts us on track for another year of strong free cash flow growth. These results demonstrate the powerful profitable growth outlined in our SpringBoard plan. So I want to put our third quarter results in the context of that plan. In quarter 4 of 2023, we launched SpringBoard, which outlined our plan to significantly increase our sales as we captured important secular trends. We said we already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place to deliver the sales growth and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials.\nTherefore, we expect to deliver powerful incremental profit in cash flow, leading to our earnings growing much faster than sales. So as we approach the 2-year anniversary of Springboard, how are we doing. When we compare our third quarter 2025 results to our launch point, we grew sales 31%. We expanded operating margin by 330 basis points. We grew EPS 72% and more than twice the rate of sales growth.\nWe expanded ROIC by 460 basis points, and we generated strong free cash flow. Now let's compare our results to our upgraded springboard plan. We are tracking well above our high capitate plan, and we're tracking very well on our internal plan. Through the end of the third quarter, we've added $4 billion of incremental annualized sales since the launch of SpringBoard.\nLooking ahead, we expect fourth quarter sales of $4.35 billion, which will add another $30 million to our annualized sales run rate. Of course, this plan is about more than sales growth. Our plan was also to dramatically improve our profitability by improving our operating margin from around 16% to 20% by the end of 2026. Let's see how we've done against that target.\nAs we executed SpringBoard, you can see that our operating margin expanded significantly. As we look to the fourth quarter, we now anticipate achieving the 20% target a full year ahead of plan. So since the beginning of SpringBoard, we have significantly increased our sales. We have grown operating profit at twice the rate of sales, and we have increased EPS and more than double the rate of sales.\nGoing forward, of course, we still expect the effects of seasonality, which you can see on the chart. But this is a powerful enhancement to our profitability that should translate into very attractive returns as we continue to grow sales. Stepping back, as we approach the second anniversary of SpringBoard, the plan has certainly been a tremendous success.\nWe've added $4 billion to our incremental annualized run rate, and we have significantly improved our profitability. Perhaps even more exciting is that we see much more growth and more springs ahead. Let me give you just a few quick examples of the opportunities we expect to add to our sales run rate. In mobile consumer electronics, I'm sure you all saw the recent announcement from Apple that committed $2.5 billion to produce 100% of iPhone and Apple Watch cover glass in the U.S. for the first time at our Harrodsburg, Kentucky facility.\nThis plant will become home to the world's largest and most advanced smartphone production line. And we will open a new Apple Corning innovation center there to deepen our co-innovation and play a key role in future generations of Apple products. In total, this creates a significantly larger longer-term spring for us in mobile consumer electronics.\nIn Optical Communications, we are expanding our innovation and technology leadership in Gen AI. First, in our enterprise business, where we report sales for inside the data center, we grew sales 58% year-over-year. And we'll share more detail. But the primary technical driver behind that growth is what the industry calls the scale out of the network.\nThat basically means that hyperscale customers are scaling out the GPU clusters with more and more connected AI nodes of server racks or simply put larger neural networks. Because each AI node is connected to the others in the cluster by fiber, this creates more volume for Corning. Now you only need to do a brief scan of the news each day to see that the scale-out opportunity is expanding dramatically.\nWe have plenty of growth ahead, and we expect demand for our innovations to continue to accelerate. We are not only the inventor of the world's first low-loss optical fiber in the technology leader in this space. We are also the largest producer by revenue of fiber cable and multi-fiber connectors in the world.\nImportantly, we also have low-cost U.S.-based advanced manufacturing platforms for each of the critical components. This creates a unique Corning opportunity to support our hyperscale AI customers as they seek to build major U.S. data centers using U.S. origin products. There is more to come in this space. We're working to formalize customer agreements are so stay tuned.\nNow let me shift to another significant opportunity we are pursuing in Gen AI driven by what the industry calls the scale up of the network. Hyperscalers are creating more capable nodes that move from less than 100 GPUs per node today to hundreds of GPUs per node in the future. Historically, an AI node has been within a single server rack. As hyperscalers scale up, AI nodes are shifting to stretch across multiple server racks.\nThis causes the distance to link these GPUs with in the node to get longer. This will eventually cause the links to reach about 100 gigabit per second meter what we call the electrical to optical frontier line, which roughly marks the point where fiber connections become more techno-economical than copper creating a large potential opportunity for us.\nTo help understand the size of this opportunity, a single black well life node has more than 70 GPUs with more than 1,200 links using more than 2 miles of copper. As that node scales up, those 2 miles will eventually be replaced by fiber connections. And those miles will grow over time as more and more GPUs are included in the AI node.\nI'm sure you've seen an announcement regarding co-packaged optics or CPO. That is one of the technologies that helps activate this scale up opportunity for us. If we succeed technically, the scale-up opportunity could be 2x to 3x the size of our existing enterprise business. And we are working with key customers and partners on making that future a reality as well.\nAnother opportunity for growth tied to Gen AI is playing out in our carrier business. In the industry, this is referred to as DCI or data center interconnect. We introduced a high-density Gen AI fiber and cable system that enables customers to fit anywhere from 2x to 4x the amount of fiber into their existing conduit. And we have seen tremendous response to this product set.\nWe expect this business to scale rapidly, reaching $1 billion opportunity for us by the end of the decade. DCI also offers the opportunity for new, more radical innovations in this space. We recently strengthened our long-standing relationship with Microsoft announcing a collaboration to accelerate the production of their hollow core fiber.\nOur fiber and cable manufacturing facilities in North Carolina will produce Microsoft's fiber as they seek to advance the performance and reliability of Azure's cloud and AI workloads. With Hollow Core technology, we're talking about cases where the difference between the speed of light through glass and the speed of light through air actually matters. This illustrates how important DCI could become as our customers look to decrease their latency.\nThis offers Corning the opportunity to innovate on new dimensions. Now let's shift to our solar business, where we are pursuing another powerful secular trend and expect to add to our run rate in quarter 4 and beyond. We've been seeking a low-risk, high-return entry into the solar industry for some time.\nFirst, solar power is fundamentally about the efficient use of photons. And low-cost materials conversion platforms. Both are key opportunities for innovation that are right in our wheelhouse. Second, we are already a world leader in semiconductor polysilicon, which is simply a much purer form of the fundamental material used in solar.\nFinally, we anticipated the growing need for a U.S. domestic solar supply chain, which is only accelerating with the advent of Gen AI and global tariff structures. We began this journey in 2020. And since then, we generated over $1 billion in cash in this platform. We funded the expansion of our manufacturing assets, with a growing cash flow generated from assets we acquired for less than $0.10 on the dollar, customer funding and government support all while generating positive cash flow every year.\nAs a result, we now have built a strong foundation for rapidly accelerating growth. We made process advancements to serve a higher-end chip segment in semiconductors, allowing us to drive continued growth in the most advanced segment of semiconductor chips. We activated idle assets to serve the need for domestic solar polysilicon.\nAnd we added the capability to transform our polysilicon into higher value domestically made solar wafers, all integrated together on our campus in Michigan. We've sold out our polysilicon and wafer capacity in 2025 and now have more than 80% of our capacity committed for the next 5 years. And today, we're building on this progress with some excitingness.\nOver the last 18 months, we have built the largest solar ingot and wafer facility in the United States, co-located with our polysilicon manufacturing facility in Hemlock, Michigan. It was a significant undertaking. To give you a sense of scale, the factory contains as much steel as the Salesforce Tower, San Francisco's tallest skyscraper.\nThis site is the equivalent of 60 football fields and the building itself occupies about 1/3 of that. Now we hope we can offer our investors the opportunity to visit the site soon. So you can see this terrific new factory for yourselves. We have grown the Corning family in Michigan. And as we speak, our folks are starting that big factory up. In this quarter, we expect to move from producing thousands of wafers a day to more than 1 million a day.\nSo needless to say, this is an exciting and stimulating time for us. As we've shared, we have committed customers for more than 80% of our capacity for the next 5 years. So our focus will be on our continued ramp to meet their needs. At the same time, we'll be applying our deep material science expertise to bring our more Corning content approach to bear and solar.\nAnd applying our advanced manufacturing capabilities to establish ourselves as the global low-cost producer even as we're based in the U.S. Overall, we are thrilled with our progress in solar. In quarter 1 of this year, we generated $200 million of sales in this map. We expect to triple that run rate by 2027, adding $1.6 billion of new annualized revenue to Corning's earnings power as we march towards our goal of building a $2.5 billion revenue stream by the end of 2028.\nSo altogether, as we approach the second anniversary of SpringBoard, the plan has clearly been a tremendous success, and we have plenty of growth yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Ed for more detail on our results and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. We delivered outstanding third quarter results, reflecting strong sales growth and even stronger profit expansion across multiple businesses. Year-over-year in Q3, sales were up 14%, while EPS grew 24%. Operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 19.6% and ROIC grew 160 basis points to 13.4%, and we delivered strong free cash flow of $535 million.\nFirst, I will provide more color on our Q3 results, then I will cover our Q4 expectations, both in the context of our springboard plan. With that, let me share some details on our Q3 results at the segment level, where you see some of our key springboard initiatives for sales growth and profit expansion hold. In Optical Communications, our growth was led by strong adoption of our new Gen AI products.\nThird quarter sales grew 33% year-over-year to $1.65 billion, highlighted by 58% year-over-year growth in our Enterprise Networks business. Investors continue to ask us to size our Gen AI opportunity for inside the data center. We began to size the opportunity in early 2024 when we provided a 25% CAGR for 2023 to 2027 for our enterprise segment sales.\nWe upgraded the CAGR to 30% in the beginning of 2025. As a reminder, in 2023, we had a $1.3 billion enterprise business and almost half of that business was for hyperscale data centers. In Q3 of 2025, our enterprise business sales were $831 million or $3.3 billion annualized compared with 2023, that's a $2 billion increase in sales.\nAnd essentially, all of that growth is related to the scale out of Gen AI networks. Clearly, we are growing much faster than the 30% CAGR we provided. This demonstrates the excellent response to our new Gen AI products, and we expect the growth to continue. We also saw another quarter of year-over-year sales growth in our Carrier Networks business.\nAs a reminder, we categorize sales of our products used to interconnect data centers in our carrier business. We applied our Gen AI innovations to this space with new high-density Gen AI fiber and cable that enables customers to fit anywhere from 2x to 4x the amount of fiber into their existing economy.\nWe began shipping these products in the first quarter. We doubled sales from first quarter levels in the second quarter, and we saw another significant sequential step-up in sales again in the third quarter. And we're still in the very beginning of this opportunity as we expect it to be a $1 billion business for us by the end of the decade.\nOptical Communications net income for the third quarter grew twice as fast as sales, up 69% year-over-year to $295 million driven by the successful implementation of our springboard plan in both enterprise and carrier. Moving to display. We shared our expectations for the full year net income of $900 million to $950 million in 2025 and net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last 5 years.\nWe continue to expect to be at the high end of the $900 million to $950 million net income range and for net income margin to be at least 25%. In the third quarter, display sales were $939 million, and net income was $250 million, both up slightly from the prior quarter driven by stronger-than-expected panel maker utilization. Q3 price was consistent with the prior quarter. And for the full year, our expectations for the retail market remain unchanged.\nWe expect TV unit sales to be consistent with 2024 and TV screen size growth of about an inch. As a reminder, we successfully implemented double-digit price increases in the second half to ensure that we can maintain stable U.S. dollar net income in a weaker yen environment. We hedged our exposure for 2025 and 2026, and we have hedges in place beyond 2026.\nIn 2025, we reset our yen core rate to JPY 120 to the dollar, consistent with our hedge rate. We did not recast our 2024 financials because we expect to maintain the same profitability in display at the new core rate. Looking ahead, we expect glass market volume to be down slightly versus Q3 and we expect our Q4 glass pricing to be consistent with Q3.\nIn display, overall, we are maintaining our market, technology and cost leadership while benefiting from market growth and a glass supply-demand environment that is balanced to tight. Turning to Specialty Materials. The business delivered a terrific quarter and as you heard earlier, our announcement with Apple creates a larger, longer-term growth driver in mobile consumer electronics through SpringBoard and beyond.\nIn Q3, sales were up 13% year-over-year to $621 million, primarily driven by the successful adoption of our premium glass innovations for our customers' flagship product launches. Net income was up 57% year-over-year to $113 million on the strong incremental volume. Serving as a great proof point of the powerful incrementals outlined in our springboard plans.\nTurning to automotive. As a reminder, in Q1, we graduated our auto glass business and together with our Environmental Technologies business created this segment. Automotive sales were $454 million, up 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by a stronger light-duty vehicle market in China, partially offset by lower heavy-duty diesel sales in North America.\nNet income was $68 million, up 33% year, driven by strong manufacturing performance. Overall, we are focused on executing our more Corning growth strategy in automotive as additional content is required in upcoming vehicle emissions regulations and as technical glass and optics gain further adoption in vehicles.\nTurning to Life Sciences. Sales were consistent with the prior year. Net income grew 7%. Finally, let's turn to Hemlock and emerging growth businesses. You heard an update on our new solar business from Wendell a few minutes ago. As a reminder, that business currently sits in this segment. We plan to build solar into a $2.5 billion revenue stream by 2028.\nWe are commercializing our new Made in America ingot and wafer products. Our new wafer facility came online in Q3, and we are ramping in Q4. We have committed customers for more than 80% of our capacity for the next 5 years. Segment sales were up 46% year-over-year, primarily driven by additional polysilicon capacity coming online and the ramp of our module operations.\nAs expected, net income reflected the ramp costs of our new solar products as we address significant customer demand. Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss operating expenses. In the quarter, was $826 million, which was above our normalized run rate. Included in Q3 OpEx was higher variable compensation expense, including stock compensation. The primary driver of the increase was the significant increase in our stock price in the quarter.\nAnd as a reminder, we pay for performance, and we are performing well. Now let's turn to the fourth quarter outlook. In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver sales of approximately $4.35 billion. Representing year-over-year growth of 12%, driven by strong adoption of our Gen AI products and by solar sales as we ramp wafer production.\nWe expect EPS to once again grow faster than sales to a range of $0.68 to $0.72. Our expectations include approximately $0.03 for the temporary impact of the continued solar ramp. You can clearly see from both our Q3 results and our Q4 outlook, we are significantly enhancing our return profile as we execute SpringBoard.\nAs a powerful proof point, we now anticipate achieving our SpringBoard operating margin of 20% in Q4 and a full year ahead of plan. We are very pleased to see that on strong sales growth, we have grown operating profit at twice the rate of sales. That's a 370 basis point improvement in operating margin from our Q4 2023 starting point.\nWith that, I'll shift from segment results to capital allocation. As we previously shared with you, our upgraded springboard plan includes higher sales and higher profit. We expect to convert that higher profit into more cash flow. And we've told you that as we grow sales, we expect profit to grow even faster, resulting in strong free cash flow generation.\nThe third quarter was another great proof point. We delivered free cash flow of $535 million. We expect full year 2025 free cash flow to be a significant step up from 2024. We expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion in CapEx in 2025. So how do we invest the expected higher cash flow?\nCompanies do capital allocation in different ways. We prioritize investing in organic growth opportunities that drive significant returns, and we grow primarily through innovation. We believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long term. Our investors have confirmed they see the value in this approach as we see high return opportunities in the future, we will invest in those opportunities.\nWe also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. We're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 21 years, and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. Finally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders.\nWe already have a strong dividend Therefore, as we go forward, our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders will be share buybacks. We have an excellent track record. Over the last decade, we've repurchased 800 million shares close to a 50% reduction in our outstanding shares, which at today's share price has created approximately $50 billion in value for our shareholders.\nBecause of our growing confidence in SpringBoard, we started to buy back shares again in the second quarter of 2024, and we have continued to do so every quarter since then. And we expect to continue buying back shares going forward.\nNow before we move to Q&A, I'd like to wrap up by reiterating a few things. When we originally launched SpringBoard in the fourth quarter of 2023, we provided you with a compelling financial plan. And as we approach the second anniversary of the plan, we are delivering compelling results.\nFrom our starting point, we have grown sales 31% and expanded operating margin by 330 basis points on EPS, 72% more than twice the rate of sales growth. Expanded ROIC by 460 basis points and generated strong free cash flow. And in Q4, we expect to achieve our SpringBoard operating margin target of 20%, a year ahead of plan.\nSo we feel great about our progress and most importantly, we are positioned to capture strong growth well into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. We delivered outstanding second quarter results. Our record sales and EPS both exceeded guidance. Year-over-year, sales grew 12% to $4 billion. Earnings per share grew more than double the rate of sales to $0.60. Operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 19%. Return on invested capital grew 210 basis points to 13.1%, and free cash flow grew 28% to $451 million.\nOverall, key secular trends and our More Corning content strategy, drive demand for our capabilities, and we continue to capture the powerful, profitable growth outlined in our recently upgraded Springboard plan. As we look ahead, we expect our strong Springboard performance to continue.\nWe're seeing a remarkable customer response to both our new Gen AI and U.S.-based solar products. and we're driving more Corning content into our mobile consumer electronics, display, automotive and optical communications platforms. We also expect an additional growth driver to emerge in the coming months as new and existing customers seek to leverage our large U.S. advanced manufacturing footprint. Overall, we are well positioned to deliver durable growth through 2026 and beyond.\nBut before we talk about the future, I'd like to take a moment to put our second quarter results in the context of our Springboard plant. We launched Springboard in quarter 4 2023, explaining our plan to dramatically improve our sales and enhance our return profile and to increase our operating margin by 400 basis points to 20% by the end of 2026.\nWe're now at the halfway point of our original Springboard plan. When we compare our second quarter 2025 results to our launch point, we grew sales 24%, adding more than $3 billion to our annualized run rate. We expanded operating margin by 270 basis points to 19% showing strong progress towards our target of 20%.\nWe grew EPS 54% more than twice the rate of sales. We expanded return on invested capital by 430 basis points, and we generated strong free cash flow. Clearly, this progress is impressive. And we expect our strong performance to continue.\nSo let's look at our journey so far. Our original internal Springboard plan, which was the output of the strategic planning process we run with each of our market access platforms, was to add $5 billion in incremental annualized sales by the end of 2026. These were our actual business plans. We set our objectives and our compensation based upon those plans.\nWhen our businesses submit plans to corporate, they factor in a variety of probabilistic outcomes, they try to account for the known unknowns. The business plans aim for a 70% confidence interval. This means that based on their analysis, there is a 70% chance that they will deliver sales greater than or equal to that number.\nWe then provided a higher confidence plan for our investors. At the corporate level, we probabilistically adjusted for factors, including potential macroeconomic slowdowns, changes in government policy and timing of multiple secular trends and our related innovations. Our risk adjustment was $2 billion. This is how we got to our original $3 billion high confidence plan.\nRemember, we purposely do this as a wedge. We weren't trying to guide every quarter for the next 12 quarters. It wouldn't be a straight line. That being said, our quarterly performance through 2024 demonstrates our powerful momentum. This chart illustrates that we are hitting or exceeding our critical milestones as sales tracked well above both our internal and high confidence plans through the first year. Our strategies are working and our customers are loving our innovations.\nGiven our progress in March of this year, we upgraded our internal and high confidence plan by $1 billion, had $6 billion and $4 billion, respectively. So now let's look at our most recent quarter. As you can see, we've added $3.1 billion of incremental annualized sales since the launch of Springbok. Looking ahead, we expect to add another $600 million to our annualized sales run rate in the third quarter.\nAt the halfway point of Springboard, we are on track and expect strong momentum going forward. Now let me share just a few examples of what is driving our growth. Gen AI is clearly a positive for us. First, in our enterprise business, where we report sales for inside the data center, we saw a record $2 billion in sales last year. In quarter 2, we grew enterprise sales 81% year-over-year. The primary technical driver behind that growth is what the industry calls the scale out of the network.\nThat basically means that hyperscale customers are scaling out the GPU clusters with more and more connected AI nodes of server rack or simply put larger neural networks. Because each AI node is connected to the others in the cluster by fiber. This creates more volume for Corning.\nWe also have another significant upside opportunity inside the data center, driven by what the industry calls the scale up of the network. Hyperscalers are creating more capable nodes that move from less than 100 GPUs per node today to hundreds of GPUs per node in the future. Historically, an AI node has been within a single server wrap. As hyperscalers scale up, AI nodes are shifting to stretch across multiple server racks.\nThis causes the distance to link these GPUs within the node to get longer. This will eventually cause the links to reach about 100 gigabit per second meter what we call the electrical to optical [ Frontier ] line, which roughly marks the point where fiber connections become more [ technical economical ] than copper, creating a large potential opportunity for us.\nTo help understand the size of this opportunity a single black well like node has more than 70 GPUs with more than 1,200 links using more than 2 miles of copper. As that node scales up, those 2 miles will eventually be replaced by fiber connections. And those miles will grow over time as more and more GPUs are included in the AI node.\nI'm sure you've seen announcements regarding co-packaged optics for CPO. That is one of the technologies that help activate the scale-up opportunity for us. If we succeed technically, the scale-up opportunity is 2 to 3x the size of our existing $2 billion enterprise business. And we're working with key customers and partners as we speak, on making that future a reality.\nAnother opportunity for our growth tied to Gen AI is playing out in our carrier business. Now we've been studying this space for some time, and we've been seeing that most long-haul routes were approaching their maximum data rate capacity, creating a need for many new high-bandwidth low-latency lengths between cities and data center campuses. And this essentially requires a rebuild of the long-haul networks.\nOur customers consider the long-haul rebuilds as they think about that technically and economically, they see great potential economic benefit from fitting more fibers into a given conduit. This means they prefer denser fiber optic cables. To create a high-density solution, we applied our core innovations from inside the data center to this outside plan challenge. We introduced this new technology package to connect data center campuses.\nIn the industry, this is referred to as DCI or Data Center Interconnect. We shared last year that we reached an agreement with Lumen Technologies to provide our new Gen AI fiber and cable system that enables Lumen to fit anywhere from 2 to 4x the amount of fiber into their existing conduit and the agreement reserved 10% of our global fiber capacity for 2025 and 2026.\nWe've now fully commercialized this product set and we have 3 industry-leading customers adopting the technology. That being said, we are just in the very beginning of this new market. We expect this business to scale rapidly, reaching a $1 billion opportunity for us by the end of the decade.\nNow I'll turn to our growth opportunity in Solar. At our March IR event, we shared our low-risk, high-return strategy to reenter the solar market. We generated over $1 billion in cash from 2020 to 2024 in this platform. We funded the expansion of our manufacturing assets with the growing cash flow generated from the assets we acquired for less than $0.10 on the dollar, customer funding and government support, all while generating positive cash flow every year.\nAs a result, we have now built a strong foundation for rapidly accelerating growth. We made advancements to serve higher end ship segment in semiconductors, and we are on track to double our semiconductor business by the end of the decade. We activated idle assets to serve the need for domestic solar polysilicon. And we added the capability to transform our polysilicon into higher-value domestically made solar wafers, all integrated together on our campus in Michigan.\nWe now have committed customers for 100% of our polysilicon and wafer capacity available in 2025 and 80% of our capacity for the next 5 years. Because we built this platform so quietly while growing our cash flow, our new Solar MAP hasn't garnered much attention from investors relative to the significance of the opportunity. We expect to triple our sales run rate by 2027, adding $1.6 billion of new annualized revenue to Corning's earnings power.\nFinally, we also expect an additional growth driver to emerge in the coming months, as new and existing customers seek to leverage our large U.S. advanced manufacturing footprint. It is still early days but this could become a major trend depending how trade policy turns out. Watch this space, and we'll keep you posted.\nWith that, I'll leave you with this. We delivered outstanding second quarter results that exceeded expectations. We've made great progress to date on our Springboard plan, halfway through the plan. We grew sales 24%, adding more than $3 billion to our annualized run rate. We expanded operating margin by 270 basis points to 19%, showing strong progress on our target of 20%.\nWe grew EPS 54% more than twice the rate of sales. We expanded return on invested capital by 430 basis points, and we generated strong free cash flow. And we're experiencing strong growth drivers that increase our confidence in maintaining our momentum to 2026 and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to Ed for more detail on our results and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. We delivered excellent second quarter results that exceeded the expectations we set in April. Year-over-year in Q2, sales were up 12%, while EPS grew 28%. Operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 19%. ROIC grew 210 basis points to 13.1% and free cash flow grew 28% to $451 million.\nLooking ahead, we expect Q3 to be another strong quarter. We expect double-digit year-over-year sales and earnings growth, with sales of $4.2 billion and profit again growing faster than sales with EPS in the range of $0.63 to $0.67. We expect to continue expanding our operating margin as we march toward our springboard target of 20%.\nWe also anticipate continued strong growth in our enterprise business, driven by our new products for Gen AI, and we're advancing significant growth opportunities across the company, as Wendell just described. Two other points I want to note related to our third quarter guidance.\nFirst, in Q3, our guidance again factors in about $0.01 to $0.02 for the impact of currently enacted tariffs, about the same level we saw in Q2. Our long-standing philosophy to locate our manufacturing operations close to our customers serves as a natural hedge against tariffs and mitigates the financial impact.\nSecond, we shared with you last quarter that we are accelerating our production ramp for new products. given high customer demand for our new Gen AI products for inside and outside the data center and for our new Solar offerings. Our third quarter guidance includes temporarily higher costs associated with these ramps of $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter. We expect the impact of these costs to dissipate as our production and sales increase.\nOverall, we feel great about our Springboard performance to date. As you can see by our guidance, we expect our momentum to continue and we're energized by the tremendous opportunity for value creation we've built for our shareholders. With that, let me share some more detail on what we're seeing in our businesses.\nIn Optical Communications, second quarter sales grew 41% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. Growth was led by strong adoption of our AI products in the enterprise space, which was up 81% year-over-year. We also saw strong growth in our carrier business, which was up 16% year-over-year. This was driven by 2 factors.\nFirst, as a reminder, we categorize our Gen AI products that interconnect data centers in our carrier business. We began shipping these products in the first quarter. We doubled sales from first quarter levels in the second quarter. We're still in the very beginning of this opportunity. And as you heard from Wendell, this could be a $1 billion business for us by the end of the decade.\nAdditionally, carriers have completed drawing down inventory they built during the pandemic, and they are now purchasing at their rate of deployment. This also contributed to year-over-year sales growth in our carrier business. And as noted in recent public statements, carriers are planning to expand their fiber networks going forward. So this sets the stage for additional growth. Net income for the second quarter was $247 million, up 73% year-over-year with strong incremental profit on the additional volumes.\nMoving to display. In the second quarter, sales were $898 million, and net income was $243 million, both consistent with the first quarter. For the full year, our expectations for the retail market remain unchanged. We expect TV unit sales to be consistent with 2024 and TV screen size growth of about an inch.\nAs a reminder, we successfully implemented double-digit price increases in the second half of 2024 to ensure that we can maintain stable U.S. dollar net income in a weaker yen environment. We hedged our yen exposure for 2025 and 2026 with hedges in place beyond 2026. In 2025, we reset our yen core rate to JPY 120 to the dollar, consistent with our hedge rate. We are not recasting our 2024 financials because we expect to maintain the same profitability in display at the new quarry.\nWe guided full year net income of $900 million to $950 million in 2025 and net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last 5 years. Clearly, we are tracking ahead of that guidance in the first half of 2025. We expect our profitability levels to continue in the second half and now expect to be at the high end of the $900 million to $950 million net income range and for margin to be at least 25%. Looking ahead, we expect the Q3 glass market and our volume to be similar to Q2 and for our pricing to be consistent sequentially.\nIn Display overall, we are maintaining our market technology and cost leadership while benefiting from market growth and a glass supply/demand environment that is balanced to tight.\nTurning to Specialty Materials. Sales were up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued adoption of our premium glass innovations in Gorilla Glass. Additionally, some OEM customers purchased in advance of anticipated tariffs. We expect OEMs to adjust their purchases in the second half of 2025 and have factored that into our Q3 guidance. Net income was up 29% year-over-year to $81 million, primarily driven by strong demand for our premium glass innovations.\nTurning to Automotive. As a reminder, in Q1, we graduated our auto glass business and together with our Environmental Technologies business, created this segment. We ended 2023 with a triple-digit automotive glass business, and we expect it to triple by the end of 2026. In the second quarter, Automotive sales were $460 million, down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker light and heavy-duty markets in Europe and North America.\nNet income was $79 million, up 11% year-over-year, driven by strong manufacturing performance offsetting lower sales. We're focused on executing our More Corning growth strategy in automotive as additional content is required in upcoming vehicle emissions regulations and as technical glass and optics gain further adoption in vehicles.\nIn Life Sciences, sales were consistent with the prior year and net income grew 6%.\nAnd finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales were up 31% year-over-year driven by increased solar and semiconductor polysilicon volume. Our new Solar business currently sits in this segment. We plan to build it into a $2.5 billion revenue stream by 2028.\nWe're commercializing our new made in America ingot and wafer products. We expect our new wafer facility to come online in Q3 and we expect to begin shipping later this year. We have committed customers for 100% of our polysilicon and wafer capacity available in 2025 and 80% of our capacity for the next 5 years. As we guided, our Q2 net income reflected the temporarily higher production ramp costs for our new Solar offerings.\nWith that, I'll shift from segment results to free cash flow. We continue making strong progress in 2025. In the second quarter, free cash flow grew 28% year-over-year to $451 million. We continue to expect to generate a significant amount of free cash flow this year, and we expect to invest approximately $1.3 billion in capital.\nMoving to capital allocation. As we previously shared with you, our upgraded springboard plan includes higher sales and higher profit. We expect to convert that higher profit into more cash flow. And as I just noted, we're making nice progress.\nSo how do we choose to invest the expected higher cash flow? Companies do capital allocation in different ways. We prioritize investing in organic growth opportunities that drive significant returns and we grow primarily through innovation. We believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long term. Our investors have confirmed this. As we see high return opportunities in the future, we will invest in those opportunities.\nWe also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. We're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt [ tenures ] in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 21 years with only about $1.5 billion in debt coming due over the next 5 years. and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year.\nFinally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. We already have a strong dividend. Therefore, as we go forward, our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders will be share buybacks.\nAnd we have an excellent track record. Over about the last decade, we repurchased 800 million shares, close to a 50% reduction in our outstanding shares, which at today's share price has created $26 billion in value for our shareholders. Because of our growing confidence in Springboard, we started to buy back shares in the second quarter of 2024, and we've continued to do so since then. In the first quarter of 2025, we invested another $100 million in repurchases. In the second quarter, we continue to buy back shares, and we will expect to continue buying back shares in the third quarter.\nSo I'll quickly wrap up today. We delivered outstanding second quarter results, exceeding guidance with record sales and EPS. We expect Q3 to be another strong quarter with double-digit sales and earnings growth. Since the start of Springboard, we've significantly grown sales. We've grown EPS more than twice the rate of sales, and we are generating strong free cash flow. We've substantially improved our return profile. So overall, we feel great about our progress. With that, I'll turn it back to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Okay. Operator, we're ready for our first question."

First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is my pleasure to introduce to you Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Carmen, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nFor the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS primarily reflected noncash mark-to-market losses associated with the company's translated earnings contracts in Japanese yen-denominated debt as well as constant currency adjustments. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com.\nYou may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. We delivered outstanding first quarter results that exceeded guidance. We grew sales 13% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. We grew EPS more than 3x the rate of sales to $0.54. We expanded operating margin 250 basis points year-over-year to 18%. For quarter 2, we're guiding continued strong year-over-year sales growth. We expect our quarter 2 sales to be approximately $3.85 billion.\nOur quarter 2 EPS guidance of $0.55 to $0.59 includes the financial impact of existing tariffs, which is $0.01 to $0.02 and accelerated production ramp costs for our new products in optical communications and solar of about $0.03. Even including those items, we expect EPS to grow year-over-year about 21%, 3x faster than sales. Ed will explain more about our guidance later.\nOverall, we're coming off a strong year one of our Springboard plan, and our results and guidance show we're off to a great start in year 2. We just held an investor event in March to upgrade our Springboard plan. Normally, I would focus my remarks on our strong progress and upcoming milestones. However, many investors requested that we address 2 questions that are on their minds. What is the financial impact of tariffs on Corning? And can you deliver your springboard plan if there is a macroeconomic downturn during the planned time frame.\nSo I want to start by answering both of those questions. And then I'll go into more detail on each before turning things over to Ed to discuss our quarter 1 results and outlook. Let's start with the financial impact of tariffs on Corning. First, our long-standing philosophy to locate our manufacturing operations close to our customers serves as a natural hedge against tariffs and mitigates the financial impact. Second, the direct financial impact of existing tariff structures, which are primarily between the U.S. and China is only $0.01 to $0.02 per quarter.\nWe've included that in our second quarter guidance. Third, based on our significant U.S. advanced manufacturing footprint, we're seeing early signs of stronger demand for our U.S.-made innovations. Next, can we deliver our springboard plan in a macroeconomic downturn? The simple answer is yes. And today, we reiterate our confidence in our ability to deliver our recently upgraded high confidence springboard plan to add more than $4 billion in annualized sales and to achieve operating margin of 20% by the end of 2026.\nOur growth is primarily driven by powerful secular trends and more Corning content in our customers' offerings. And in order to provide you with a high confidence plan, we already applied a risk adjustment that accounts for multiple factors, including a potential macroeconomic slowdown. With that, let's dive into each answer, starting with tariffs. As I said a moment ago, our company has a long-standing philosophy to locate manufacturing operations close to our customers.\nWe find that geographic proximity leads to better innovation and more delighted customers. This also has the benefit of serving as a natural hedge against global trade tensions and tariff structures. We apply this philosophy globally. As a result, the direct impact of current tariffs for us is minimal. To illustrate the point, let's take a look at the impact of the tariffs between the U.S. and China. In the U.S., we have a large advanced manufacturing footprint.\nThis includes our optical communications business, where we have the largest fiber factory in the world in North Carolina. We also manufacture products for our automotive, life sciences, mobile consumer electronics and solar businesses in the U.S. Almost all the products we sell in the U.S. originate from our 34 advanced manufacturing facilities in the U.S. In fact, nearly 90% of our U.S. revenue comes from products of U.S. origin.\nThe majority of the remainder is generated from products that are fully compliant with USMCA rules. Only 1% of the products we sell in the U.S. come from China. Now let's look at our approach for our customers in China. 80% of our sales in China, we make in China or process in customs approved tax and duty-free zones. 15% is made in region, for example, in Korea, in Taiwan.\nOnly about 5% of our China sales are imported from the U.S. and subject to China tariff structures. And we will mitigate the impact of that exposure primarily by optimizing our supply chain to minimize tariffs and adjusting price where necessary. In total, we expect a direct impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million or $0.01 to $0.02 for currently enacted tariffs in the second quarter. That is included in our guidance. Now of course, we will seek to improve this through additional mitigation strategies.\nEd will provide more detail on guidance. Bottom line, the direct impact of currently enacted tariffs is not significant for Corning. Interestingly, we are seeing early signs of stronger demand for our U.S.-made innovations from our large advanced manufacturing footprint in the U.S. Our customers in optical communications, in solar, in mobile consumer electronics and in life sciences are seeking to leverage our U.S. manufacturing footprint. And we expect to close and potentially announce commercial agreements in the coming months.\nNext, can we deliver the springboard plan in a macroeconomic downturn? As I previously stated, the simple answer is yes. Today, we reiterate our confidence in our ability to deliver the recently upgraded Springboard plan. Let's walk through why. Our internal Springboard plan is to add $6 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2026. We have a significant sales opportunity, and our growth is fueled by powerful secular trends that I'll discuss in a moment.\nAs a reminder, our Springboard base is quarter 4 of 2023 when sales were $3.27 billion or $13.1 billion annualized. Adding $6 billion in incremental annualized sales brings us to a $19 billion sales run rate by the end of 2026. That is the sales level we would expect to achieve if we deliver our internal springboard plan. Our internal plan is the output of the strategic planning process we run with each of our market access platforms. These are our actual business plans. We set our objectives and compensation based upon those plans.\nWhen our businesses submit plans to corporate, they factor in a variety of probabilistic outcomes. They try to account for the known unknowns. The business plans aim for a 70% confidence interval, which means that based on their analysis, there is a 70% chance that they will deliver sales greater than or equal to that number.\nWhat we wanted to do with Springboard was to provide an even higher confidence plan for our investors. So we take that internal plan and translate the opportunity into an investable thesis for all of you. At the corporate level, we seek to probabilistically adjust for factors, including macroeconomic slowdowns, changes in government policy and timing of multiple secular trends in our related innovations.\nOur corporate level risk adjustment is $2 billion. This is how we get to our $4 billion high confidence plan. Annualized, that is a $17 billion sales run rate by the end of 2026. So let's unpack the macroeconomic component of that corporate level risk adjustment. We use third-party forecast of potential macroeconomic slowdown scenarios. And we apply that to our demand planning model that underpins our $19 billion internal springboard plan.\nThat economic slowdown scenario would result in a sales run rate by the end of 2026 of a little less than $18 billion, well within our $2 billion risk adjustment. We also run a shock case using the worst downturn over the last 25 years. That scenario results in an adjustment to our plan that is still within our $2 billion risk adjustment. In other words, when we constructed the high confidence plan, the impact of a potential economic slowdown was already built in.\nThat being said, remember, we're innovators. We're not macroeconomists. We are not projecting a macroeconomic slowdown. We're simply providing this context for you to make your own decisions. I hope that's helpful to understand our risk adjustment as it pertains to a potential economic downturn. And that's one of the reasons that today, we reiterate our high confidence plan to add more than $4 billion to our annualized sales run rate by the end of 2026.\nWe feel good about our innovations and the secular trends driving our growth. So now let's turn to those trends. We continue to see and hear reconfirming evidence that our secular trends are intact and remain relevant. We see it in our results, and we see it in our order books, and we hear it in our detailed dialogues with our customers.\nIn Optical Communications, we are seeing remarkable customer response to both our products used inside Gen AI data centers as well as our innovations to interconnect AI data centers across the country. We shared some of our new products with you at our March investor event. These products are driving positive customer response and rapid adoption.\nIn our enterprise business, where we capture sales for inside the data center, adoption of our products drove a record $2 billion in sales last year. At our March IR event, we upgraded our 4-year enterprise sales compound annual growth rate from 25% to 30% based on strong customer demand.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to outperform with sales growth of 106% year-over-year. We've just completed detailed reviews with our major hyperscale customers that reconfirmed our growth expectations. And as you've also seen in recent public announcements from the top hyperscalers, they've reaffirmed their capital plans, and they expect to continue to spend significant amount of capital in this space. Another way Gen AI is fueling our growth is reflected in our carrier business.\nLast year, we introduced a set of innovations to interconnect AI data centers. We shared that we reached an agreement with Lumen Technologies to provide our new Gen AI fiber and cable system that enables Lumen to fit anywhere from 2 to 4x the amount of fiber into their existing conduit, and the agreement reserved 10% of our global fiber capacity for 2025 and 2026.\nLast month, we announced that we have fully commercialized this product. We now have 3 industry-leading customers adopting the technology and our production tripled every month in the first quarter. So this innovation is now turning into a revenue stream to make a positive difference in our financials this year. We continue to field strong positive customer response to our innovations. And as a result, we're accelerating our ramp plans in the second quarter to meet growing demand.\nAdditionally, in our carrier business, as you've seen from recent telecom earnings calls, our key customers have stated they like the economics of fiber, and they remain committed to their fiber deployment plans. We believe they have completed drawing down inventory they built during the pandemic and the conditions are now in place for our carrier business to spring back to growth later this year.\nWe saw the beginning of that in the first quarter. Turning to solar. In March, we said we expect our new market access platform to grow from a $1 billion business in 2024 to a $2.5 billion business by 2028. Drivers include increased energy demand, favorable economics government policy focused on energy independence. We are commercializing our new Made in America ingot and wafer products this year.\nOur production will come online in the back half of this year. We said in March that for our air platform, we had committed customers for 100% of our capacity available in 2025 and 80% of our capacity for the next 5 years and recent trade actions are increasing new customer engagement. The goal of U.S. policy is to ensure domestic energy security. So our U.S. solar assets just became even more valuable.\nWe're experiencing increasing demand for U.S. source solar. As a result, we're accelerating our ramp of U.S. advanced manufacturing in our Midland, Michigan wafer facility. We're increasing our workforce to 1,500 manufacturing jobs for our previously announced 1,100-person level.\nSo recent events continue to validate our low-risk, high-return entry into the solar market. In display, we continue to expect TV screen size growth of about 1 inch a year. In March, we said that the price increases we implemented last year will help us deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million in 2025 and to deliver net income margin of 25%.\nIn the first quarter, the business marked net income of $243 million and net income margin of 26.9%. In automotive, we expect almost triple sales in our automotive glass business by 2026. Our growth comes from more Corning as automakers add more in-vehicle content, for example, larger, shaped, immersive and high-resolution displays.\nGiven the milestones we've achieved in our automotive glass business, we're graduating the business this quarter out of the Emerging Innovations group and into operations. It will be managed along with environmental technologies forming a new segment called Automotive. In mobile consumer electronics, our growth will be driven by demand for more Corning content as customers adopt our new higher-value innovations.\nIn the first quarter, our major innovation streams remain on tap, and we remain optimistic about adoption of our new technologies. We expect those innovations to drive growth as we enter 2026. In total, our secular trends remain consistent with our recently upgraded Springboard plan.\nIn summary, our growth trends remain intact. The direct impact of current tariffs to Corning is not significant, and our $2 billion risk adjustment should provide a sufficient buffer against potential economic downturns. So now I'll turn it over to Ed to get into more detail on our results and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, our results and guidance show we're making great progress on our high confidence springboard plan to add more than $4 billion in annualized sales and achieved an operating margin of 20% by the end of 2026. And as we successfully execute the plan, we continue to improve our return profile Year-over-year, in the first quarter, we grew sales 13% to $3.7 billion. We grew EPS 42% to $0.54 we expanded operating margin by 250 basis points to 18%, and we expanded ROIC by 300 basis points to 11.6%.\nLooking ahead, we expect our momentum to continue. For the second quarter, we expect continued strong year-over-year sales growth with sales of approximately $3.85 billion, and EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. Again, growing significantly faster than sales. We expect to continue expanding our operating margin as we march toward our Springboard target of 20% by the end of 2026.\nAnd we anticipate continued strong growth in our [indiscernible] business driven by our new products for Gen AI. Two other things I want to note related to our second quarter guidance. First, our guidance factors in $0.01 to $0.02 for the expected direct impact of currently enacted tariffs. We plan to further mitigate this impact going forward, primarily by optimizing our supply chains, and adjusting price where necessary.\nSecond, we shared with you that we are accelerating our production ramp for new products, given high customer demand in both optical communications for our new Gen AI products for both inside and outside the data center and in solar for our new solar wafers.\nOur second quarter guidance includes temporarily higher costs associated with these ramps of about $0.03. We expect the impact of these costs to dissipate as our production and sales increase in the second half of the year. Now I'd like to share some more detail on what we're seeing in our businesses and then I'll review our capital allocation priorities as we expect to generate significant cash over the Springboard time frame. In Optical Communications, first quarter sales were $1.4 billion, up 46% year-over-year.\nNet income for the first quarter was $201 million, up 101% year-over-year reflecting strong incremental profit on the higher volume. Enterprise sales were $705 million for the quarter up 106% continued strong demand for our new Gen AI products for inside the data center. We're tracking ahead of our 2023 to 2027 enterprise sales CAGR of 30%.\nWe also grew 11% year-over-year in our carrier business. The growth included sales of our new data center interconnect products. Additionally, our carrier customers have completed drawing down inventory during the pandemic and the conditions are now in place for our carrier business to return to growth in 2025.\nAnd we are seeing the beginnings of that in the first quarter. Moving to display. First quarter sales were $905 million, up 4% year-over-year on both volume and price increases. Net income was $243 million, 26.9% of sales. We successfully implemented double-digit price increases in the second half of 2024 to ensure that we can maintain stable U.S. dollar net income in a weaker yen environment. Our first quarter results provide the first proof point that we have achieved our objective.\nAs a reminder, we hedged our yen exposure for 2025 and 2026 with hedges in place beyond 2026. In 2025, we reset our yen quarry to JPY 120 to the dollar, consistent with our hedge rate. We are not recasting our 2024 financials because we expect to maintain the same profitability in display at the new core rate. We remain confident that we can deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million in 2025 and net income margin of 25% consistent with the last 5 years.\nOverall, we are maintaining our market technology and cost leadership while benefiting from market growth and a glass supply-demand environment that is increasingly balanced to tight. Turning to Specialty Materials. First quarter sales were $501 million, up 10% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand for premium glass for mobile devices. Net income grew 68% year-over-year to $74 million, reflecting strong incrementals on higher volumes as well as strong demand for our premium glass innovations.\nNow I'd like to take a moment to elaborate on our new Automotive segment. Our Automotive Glass Solutions business has been part of our Hemlock and emerging growth businesses. which is designed to launch early-stage projects and growth opportunities. This is where our solar business currently resides. Beginning in Q1, we graduated our auto glass business and together with our Environmental Technologies business, created a new segment named Automotive.\nWe recast the comparative segment results for prior periods to align with our current reporting. Our environmental business has been an established leader in the industry for more than 50 years. Now we're leveraging that market access to drive more Corning automotive glass into the market. We have several recent partnership and project announcements tied to automotive interiors, and adjacencies and are making nice progress.\nWith that, let me provide some color on what we're seeing right now in automotive. In the first quarter, automotive sales were $440 million down 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued softness in light and heavy-duty European markets as expected. The North America Class 8 market also continues to lag year-over-year following a strong Q1 2024. We remain confident that the underlying secular trends in automotive will be strong growth drivers for Corning as demand for more larger scaled immersive and higher resolution displays grows.\nOur segment change reflects our continued confidence. Turning to Life Sciences. On a year-over-year basis, first quarter sales of $234 million were down 1% and net income of $13 was consistent. Finally, in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses, first quarter sales were $244 million, down 25% sequentially on normal seasonality. As I just explained, these results no longer include automotive glass solutions and we recast 2024 for this change.\nWe're still reporting our solar business results in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses for the moment as we continue to ramp production for our new solar wafer products. We expect to grow our new solar map to a $2.5 billion revenue stream by 2028, and we expect a positive incremental impact on Corning's sales profits and cash flow starting in the second half of 2025.\nWe are commercializing our new Made in America ingot and wafer products this year. We have committed customers for 100% of our capacity available in 2025 and 80% of our capacity for the next 5 years. We plan to update you on our solar sales and profits as we continue to made progress. With that, I'll shift from segment results to free cash flows.\nThe first quarter was essentially breakeven. Normally, Q1 is negative, a seasonal low, driven by our typical compensation and capital cycles. So we're actually off to a great start in 2025 and expect to generate a significant amount of free cash flow this year and we expect to invest approximately $1.3 billion on CapEx.\nAnd finally, let's move to capital allocation. As we shared with you in March, the upgrades to our internal and high confidence plans include higher sales and higher profit. We expect to convert that profit into more cash flow. As an early proof point in year one of the plan, we grew free cash flow 42% for the full year 2024 versus the prior year.\nAlways front and center to us is capital allocation. How do we choose to invest expected higher cash flow? Companies do capital allocation in different ways. We prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities that drive significant returns, and we grow primarily through innovation. We believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long term.\nOur investors have confirmed this average debt maturity is about 23 years with only about $1.2 billion in debt coming due over the next 5 years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. Finally, we expect to continue our strong track record opening excess cash to shareholders. We already have a strong dividend. Therefore, as we go forward, our primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders will be share buybacks.\nWe have an excellent track record over about the last decade, we repurchased 800 million shares, close to a 50% reduction in our outstanding shares which in today's share price has created $17 million in value for our shareholders. Because of our growing confidence in Springboard we started to buy back shares in the second quarter of 2024, and we have continued to do so since then. In the first quarter of 2025, we invested another $100 million in share repurchases, and we expect to continue buying back shares in the second quarter.\nSo as I wrap up today, I'd like to reiterate the important points we've shared with you this morning. In Q1, we exceeded our guidance on both sales and EPS and continued to deliver strong sales growth while continuing to improve our return profile and we expect another strong quarter as evidenced by our second quarter guidance, which factors in the expected direct impact of currently inactive tariffs and temporarily higher costs as we accelerate production ramps for our new Gen AI products in Optical Communications and our new solar wafer products.\nStepping back, we feel great about our progress on SpringBoard and we're energized about the tremendous opportunity for value creation we've built for our shareholders. Our internal springboard plan adds $6 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2026. The expected growth is driven by powerful secular trends, in particular, Gen AI and solar. And our risk-adjusted high confidence plan adds more than $4 billion in annualized sales and we continue to expect operating margin to improve to 20% by the end of 2026.\nTherefore, we expect to continue improving ROIC growing EPS and strengthening cash flow. Our $2 billion risk adjustment provides a sufficient buffer for a macroeconomic downturn. I look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ed. Okay, Carmen, we're ready for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nIt is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.\nYou should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and core primarily reflected noncash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's translated earnings contracts and Japanese yen-denominated debt as well as constant currency adjustments and other noncash charges. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.\nA reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone.\nToday, we announced fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 18% year-over-year to a record $3.9 billion and grew EPS 46% to $0.57. We expanded operating margin by 220 basis points to 18.5%. We also expanded return on invested capital 390 basis points to 12.7%. Additionally, for the full year, we generated strong free cash flow, delivering $1.25 billion for 2024, up 42%.\nOverall, these results capped off a terrific first year of Springboard. So I want to review our performance in the context of our Springboard plan. As we've laid out to you, we're pursuing growth across the company of $8 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2028, driven by the convergence of upward cyclical and secular trends in our markets.\nAnd we've taken this internal nonrisk-adjusted plan and created a high confidence plan for investors. First, we focused on a 3-year time period, which reflects a $5 billion nonrisk-adjusted opportunity by the end of 2026. Second, we probabilistically adjusted for different potential outcomes, including market dynamics, timing of secular trends, successful adoption of our innovations as well as volume, pricing and market share across all of our businesses and the potential that some of our markets may go through down cycles.\nAnd this is how we formulated our high-confidence Springboard plan to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales and to achieve operating margin of 20% by the end of 2026. However, it's important to remember, we purposely drew the $3 billion Springboard plan as a wedge. We weren't trying to guide every quarter for the next 12 quarters.\nSo as you can see, we're off to a great start. Our quarter 4 sales were $3.9 billion. So in year 1 of the plan, we added $2.4 billion to our annualized sales run rate from our Springboard base. And on that strong sales growth, we demonstrated the powerful incrementals that are embedded in our plan.\nYear-over-year, in the fourth quarter, we expanded operating margin by 220 basis points to 18.5%. We grew EPS 46% to $0.57, we expanded ROIC 390 basis points to 12.7% and we closed out a strong year of free cash flow generation, delivering $1.25 billion in 2024, up 42%.\nSo what's driving our outperformance versus a high-confidence plan? When we introduced Springboard, we told you that it was a milestone-based plan. In 2024, we hit key strategic milestones in Display and Optical.\nIn Display, our Springboard plan is centered on maintaining stable U.S. dollar net income. To achieve this in a weaker yen environment, we raised glass prices in the second half of 2024 to deliver consistent profitability in the segment. We expect to deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million this year and to deliver net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last 5 years. Overall, we're providing a strong base in Display for our Springboard growth.\nIn Optical Communications, our Springboard plan is about revenue growth, as upward cyclical and secular trends converge to drive demand for our unique capabilities. We introduced new Gen AI products in June of 2024. And we said we expected to grow our enterprise business at a 25% compound annual growth rate through 2027.\nDemand for our new Gen AI products grew each quarter, and sales in the enterprise portion of our Optical business grew 93% and year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, Enterprise grew to a record $2 billion, up 49% year-over-year. That growth reflects the Gen AI opportunity inside the data center.\nWe've also introduced a set of innovations to help our customers build a new network to interconnect AI-enabled data centers between the cities. As part of an agreement with Lumen Technologies, which reserves 10% of our global fiber capacity for 2025 and 2026, we launched the first outside plant deployment of Corning's new Gen AI fiber and cable system that enables Lumen to fit anywhere from 2 to 4x the amount of fiber into their existing conduit. And just this month, we started shipping, and Lumen has begun deploying our new data center interconnect products. Overall, strong customer response to our new products drove sales of $1.4 billion in Optical in the fourth quarter, reflecting 51% year-over-year growth. And we expect continued growing demand in Optical in 2025 and beyond.\nSo I've highlighted just 2 of the key milestones that are contributing to the outperformance of our Springboard plan in year 1. We're pursuing a rich opportunity set that extends across our portfolio, including solar, automotive and mobile consumer electronics. And the progress we've made increases the probability that our sales will be above our high-confidence sales run rate by the end of 2026. As a result, we are planning to upgrade our $3 billion Springboard plan at our March investor event.\nSo let's take a moment to help you understand how we're thinking about it. First, I've already shared with you that our businesses are collectively pursuing a nonrisk-adjusted plan to add $8 billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2028 and $5 billion by the end of 2026. Now we've just completed our strategy planning cycle, and we remain comfortable that those targets are appropriate. So we're not changing our nonrisk-adjusted plan at this time.\nOf course, our internal plans won't be exactly right on everything, including timing, because that's just not how the future works. But the benefit of our balanced portfolio is that we know many of our exciting opportunities will come to fruition. We translated our nonrisk-adjusted plan into a high-confidence investable thesis for you by accounting for multiple potential outcomes, and we provided you our high confidence plan to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026.\nSo where do we stand today? Even though we're only 1 year into the 3-year high-confidence plan, our progress against key milestones increases the potential for positive outcomes and therefore, our likelihood of success. For example, the tremendous response to our Gen AI products puts us on the positive side of that distribution. Our display pricing also puts us on the positive side. And you're seeing that positive momentum in our numbers. So as I just shared with you, as a result of our progress across our portfolio, we will upgrade our $3 billion high-confidence plan at our March investor event.\nBefore I turn things over to Ed, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. Our quarter 4 was an outstanding quarter that capped off a terrific first year of our Springboard plan. We added $2.4 billion to our annualized sales run rate in quarter 4. And as we grow sales, we're growing profitability at a significantly faster rate. Overall, we positioned our businesses to benefit from a convergence of cyclical and secular trends to drive growth across the company through 2026 and beyond. We've got many more milestones ahead, and I look forward to sharing more detail with you on the strong progress we're making when we get together in March.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ed.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone.\nAs you just heard, we had another outstanding quarter and completed a strong first year of our Springboard plan. Cyclical and secular trends are driving demand for our products. We have the capacity and technical capabilities in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026, and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. So this means that, as we grow, we expect to grow profit significantly faster than sales.\nAnd that's exactly what you saw in the fourth quarter. Sales grew 18% year-over-year to $3.9 billion and EPS grew 46% to $0.57, more than 2x the rate of sales. Operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 18.5%, marking strong progress on the target we've shared to achieve 20% operating margin by the end of 2026. Overall, it was a terrific quarter, and we expect our momentum to continue in 2025.\nIn the first quarter, we expect sales to grow 10% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion, with core EPS growing approximately 30% to a range of $0.48 to $0.52. Based on our strong performance, we continue to track ahead of our Springboard plan. So this morning, I want to share more details and perspective on our quarter and full year results.\nFor the full year, we grew sales 7% to $14.5 billion. At the same time, EPS grew 15% to $1.96. Gross margin expanded 190 basis points to 38.2% and operating margin expanded a full percentage point to 17.5%. We increased free cash flow by $373 million versus the prior year to $1.25 billion.\nMoving to the segments. In Optical Communications, fourth quarter sales were $1.37 billion, up 51% year-over-year. Full year sales grew 16% to $4.66 billion. In our enterprise business, sales were $686 million for the quarter, up 93% year-over-year, driven by the continued strong adoption of our new Gen AI products. This marks another record quarter of growth in this business. And for the full year, Enterprise grew 49% to $2 billion.\nWe also grew year-over-year in our carrier business in the fourth quarter as customers continue to buy closer to their rates of deployment. Net income for the full year and fourth quarter reflected strong incremental profit on higher volume. For the fourth quarter, net income for the Optical Communications segment grew 120% year-over-year to $194 million. And for the full year, net income grew 28% to $612 million. Overall, we expect our unique capabilities in Optical Communications to drive continued growth in 2025 and beyond.\nIn carrier, we expect deployments to increase in 2025 as indicated by carrier customer conversations and public announcements. We also expect growing demand for our connectivity products for Gen AI, and we're just beginning to ship our new data center interconnect products to Lumen in the first quarter.\nMoving to Display Technologies. Fourth quarter sales were $971 million, up 12% year-over-year. Net income was $262 million. Full year sales grew 10% to $3.87 billion. Net income was up 19%. The retail and glass market grew year-over-year as measured in square feet driven by larger average screen size. Late in the quarter, panel makers increased their utilization rates as set makers upped their orders driven by government stimulus in China. We expect panel makers to continue at these utilization rates in the first quarter of 2025.\nAs we shared with you in September and on our third quarter earnings call, we raised glass prices to deliver consistent profitability in the segment. We've successfully implemented double-digit price increases in the second half of 2024 to ensure we can maintain stable U.S. dollar net income in a weaker yen environment. We continue to expect to deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million in 2025 and net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last 5 years.\nTurning to Specialty Materials. In the fourth quarter, sales were $515 million, up 9% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. Full year sales grew 8% to $2 billion, as we advanced our More Corning content strategy in both Gorilla and Advanced Optics. Net income grew 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $81 million and was up 29% for the full year to $260 million, reflecting strong incrementals on higher volumes as well as strong demand for our premium glass innovations.\nIn Environmental Technologies, our fourth quarter sales were $397 million, down 7% year-over-year, driven by weaker light-duty and heavy-duty markets in Europe. Full year sales were down 6% year-over-year as we continued to experience weaker global heavy-duty markets, particularly in Europe. Net income of $81 million for Q4 was down 17% year-over-year, reflecting lower volume. Net income for the full year was $358 million, down 7% on lower sales. In 2025, industry analysts expect the global light-duty market to remain flat and for the heavy-duty market to be down slightly, primarily in North America.\nIn Life Sciences, fourth quarter sales were $250 million, up 3% year-over-year, and net income grew 6% year-over-year. Full year sales were $979 million, up 2% as the market stabilized throughout the year. Net income grew 26%, significantly faster than sales.\nAnd finally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, fourth quarter sales were $373 million, up 5% year-over-year. Full year sales were $1.28 billion. As you can see, we're making strong progress on Springboard. And as we enter 2025, we expect our momentum to continue. In the first quarter, we expect sales to grow 10% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion, with core EPS growing approximately 30% to a range of $0.48 to $0.52.\nAdditionally, we have hedged our yen exposure for 2025 and 2026. We also have hedges in place beyond 2026. In 2025, we will be resetting our yen core rate to JPY 120 to the dollar, consistent with our hedge rate. We have reflected the JPY 120 core rate in our Q1 guidance. We do not plan to recast our 2024 financials because we expect to maintain the same profitability in Display at the new core rate. And as I said earlier, in Display, we expect to deliver net income of $900 million to $950 million in 2025 and net income margin of 25%, consistent with the last 5 years.\nNow I'd like to spend a minute on capital allocation. I told you that we have the capacity and technical capabilities in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026. So we expect to deliver strong incremental profit and cash flow as we capture the sales growth opportunity outlined in our Springboard plan. One proof point from the first year of the plan is that we grew free cash flow by 42% in 2024 to $1.25 billion. And as our execution of Springboard continues, we expect to generate significant cash in 2025.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain the same. We prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities. We believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long term. In 2025, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $1.3 billion. We also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. We're in great shape here. We have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years, with only about $1.2 billion in debt coming due over the next 5 years, and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year. And finally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. We started to buy back shares in the second quarter, and we have continued to do so throughout 2024.\nSo as I wrap up today, I'd like to reiterate that we had an outstanding fourth quarter that capped off a strong first year of Springboard. Compared with Q4 2023, our starting point for Springboard, sales grew 18% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, EPS grew 46% to $0.57 and operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 18.5%, marking strong progress on the target we've shared to achieve 20% operating margin by the end of 2026. Looking ahead, we expect 10% year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter, with EPS growing about 3x faster. And we expect to sustain our momentum throughout 2025.\nIn total, we're tracking ahead of our high-confidence plan to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales by the end of 2026, and we look forward to our March investor event when we plan to provide you with an update to our high-confidence Springboard plan.\nThank you, everyone. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Okay. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data.\nOur core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS primarily reflected constant currency adjustments, translated earnings contract gains and translation gains on Japanese yen-denominated debt as well as restructuring and primarily noncash asset write-off charges.\nAs a reminder, GAAP mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. We are also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. And good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong second quarter 2024 results. We returned to year-over-year growth, and we exceeded the sales and EPS guidance we shared going into the quarter in April. The outperformance was driven primarily by the strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for generative AI. So why don't we start today with a quick explanation of why this application provides a great growth opportunity for our shareholders.\nOur traditional data centers contain a network of interconnected switches and CPUs. Gen AI requires a second network within data centers to connect every GPU to every other GPU in the cluster, creating a neural network. Now because GPUs have more processing capacity than CPUs, they need higher bandwidth links connecting them. The result is about 10x the number of fiber connections in this new network versus a traditional data center.\nNow this not only provides volume, which is great, but also the opportunity to innovate with the major players in this space. Over the past 4 years, we've helped key customers design the optical links needed for this second network in their next-generation AI data centers. We invented new to the world, fibers, cables, connectors and custom integrated solutions.\nThese new products dramatically reduce installation time and on-site labor, save space and lower embodied carbon. All while reducing installed cost and increasing the overall reliability of the network. As I noted, strong adoption of these Gen AI products primarily drove our outperformance in the second quarter. In fact, it drove record sales in the enterprise portion of our optical business. which grew more than 40% year-over-year.\nI've been talking about the Gen AI opportunity inside the data center. Gen AI also increases bandwidth requirements between data centers. We've reached an agreement with Lumen Technologies that reserves 10% of our global fiber capacity for each of the next 2 years to facilitate Lumen's build of a new network to interconnect AI-enabled data centers.\nThis will be the first outside plant deployment of Corning's new Gen AI fiber and cable system that will enable Lumen to fit anywhere from 2x to 4x the amount of fiber into their existing conduit. Now Gen AI is just one of the many growth opportunities we've included in the plan we call SpringBoard, which adds more than $3 billion in annualized sales with strong incremental profit and cash flow within the next 3 years.\nWe've been sharing some of the key points on springboard for the last few quarters. But today, I want to outline our plan in a more comprehensive way. We've built a tremendous opportunity for our shareholders, and we want to help you understand how we think about Springboard. Let's start with the core components. First, we previously shared with you that the first quarter would be the low quarter for the year. And as our results show, we began our march up. Sales grew 11% sequentially to $3.6 billion in the second quarter, and we returned to year-over-year growth. And the third quarter guidance we provided in our release this morning shows that we expect to continue growing in the third quarter with sales of approximately $3.7 billion.\nSecond, we expect to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next 3 years as cyclical factors and secular trends converge and drive demand for our capabilities. Our market positions are strong, and we're seeing encouraging signs of markets improve. And we continue to innovate new product sets tied to secular trends to drive growth above market levels.\nThird, as we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incremental profit and cash flow. We have the required capacity and technical capabilities in place to service that $3 billion in the 3-year window, and the cost and capital are already reflected in our financials. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance serve as a strong proof point of our powerful incrementals.\nWe grew EPS 24% sequentially, more than double our sales growth rate. And as you can see in our guidance, we expect EPS to grow about 3x faster than sales in the third quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially and year-over-year by 110 and 170 basis points, respectively. Operating margin expanded 190 basis points versus quarter 1.\nWe also generated strong free cash flow and with the success of SpringBoard, we expect to be able to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders. In fact, due to our growing confidence in the plan, we began buying back shares in the second quarter and will do so in the third quarter.\nSo I'd just walk through the core components of Springboard. Now I want to provide more context on our sales opportunity because this is an extraordinary time for the company. I've had a chance to talk with many of you recently, and you've probably heard me say material science is really slow until it gets wicked fast.\nYou hit these moments of inflection. For example, I just noted, our new product suite for Gen AI. To do all that, we had a dedicated team that I've been part of for the last 4 years, capitalizing on our deep insight and customer relationships to develop these products long before they become a seemingly overnight success. Some strategies take even longer to come to fruition.\nMeaningful innovation takes time. And then you hit these critical milestones and everything starts happening in quick succession. We are one of these moments. Over the next several quarters, we expect to share a number of customer announcements. You'll see more commercialized innovations and a steady march up in our quarterly performance. So I want to give you a structure to help you put those coming milestones into the context of our total Springboard plan as they happen.\nI'm going to use this chart to explain our incremental sales opportunity. We introduced SpringBoard in quarter 3 last year using our quarter 4 projected sales of $3.25 billion as the starting point, which put us at a $13 billion annualized run rate. The Y axis represents incremental sales above our quarter 4 2023 run rate. And the X axis simply represents time for the following 5 years.\nNow let's fill in some numbers. Here is our internal nonrisk-adjusted plan. Now there is a lot to take away from this slide. The first is we have a significant sales opportunity. We're looking at potential growth of billion in annualized sales run rate by the end of 2028 with $5 billion by the end of 2026. We expect growth across all our market access platforms, driven by a combination of upward cyclical and secular trends, and we'll provide insight behind the springs or drivers of that growth.\nNow this is our internal plan. When we say it's not risk adjusted, what we mean is that the projections are based on a number of assumptions, including markets recovering back to historical trend lines with continue thereafter. Successful adoption of new innovations across a number of markets and platforms and successful execution of all our operational milestones for productivity and for price.\nThat said, we've taken this opportunity and translated it into a high confidence plan to help inform investors. To do that. First, we focused on the next 3 years. Second, we probabilistically adjusted for different potential outcomes in each of our market access platforms, including market dynamics, timing of secular trends, successful adoption of our innovations as well as volume and market share across all our businesses and the potential that some of our markets may go through down cycles.\nAnd this is how we come to the high confidence springboard plan for our shareholders to help inform their investment decisions. It's also important to note that we purposely drew this as a wedge. We weren't trying to guide every quarter for the next 12 quarters. It obviously won't be a straight line. But we are also not dealing with a hockey stick when we built the plan, we expected to see strong growth this year.\nSo how are we doing so far? We are off to a terrific time. Let me explain the $1.3 billion dot point you see on the chart here. Our quarter 2 2024 sales were $3.6 billion. Our quarter 4 2023 sales were $3.27 billion the difference is $330 million. And when you annualize that, you get to $1.3 billion. And that trend continues into quarter 3.\nThe additional sequential growth increases our run rate in the third quarter by $1.7 billion. As you can see, we are running well ahead of our springboard plan run rate. That being said, please remember, we're only 2 quarters into a 12-quarter plan. SpringBoard is a milestone-based plan evolving over the next 3 years. We have plenty of opportunity ahead of us, a lot of springs yet to activate.\nWe'll update you as we hit significant milestones. Clearly, we're off to a very strong start, well above the run rates we need to deliver. So as I wrap up this morning, I think you can see why we're energized about SpringBoard. And we're pleased with our early progress, including, of course, the encouraging response to our Gen AI Products. We expect to have a lot more news over the next few months as milestones start to hit and we're scheduling around those.\nWe're planning another investor event in September as well as a full Investor Day in early 2025. Also, it is important to note that as we [indiscernible] forward with SpringBoard, we'll continue to seek the guidance of our Board of Directors. To that end, we will be refreshing our Board composition to more closely align the skill set profiles of the Board with our springboard plan.\nNow let me turn it over to Ed for some more detail and perspective on the quarter and on SpringBoard.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start. We believe our second quarter results are a strong proof point of both the sales and the incremental profit and cash flow opportunity in our SpringBoard plan. So before I dive into the results, I'd like to share some of the major growth drivers we see across our market access platforms.\nWendell shared with you our internal nonrisk-adjusted plan, which is $8 billion in incremental sales by the end of 2028 and $5 billion by the end of 2026. I'm going to share some of the cyclical and secular drivers of this growth while focusing in on the 3-year window. Let's start with Optical Communications. The Gen AI opportunity, Wendell spoke about, adds a significant amount of growth.\nWe expect our enterprise business the 25% compound annual growth rate from 2023 to 2027, driven by the adoption of our connectivity solutions for generative AI. And this is already underway. We delivered record sales in enterprise in the second quarter, which grew more than 40% year-over-year.\nIn our carrier business, customers are reaching the end of their inventory drawdowns and beginning to order closer to their current deployment levels. Additionally, government efforts bring high-speed Internet to rural communities through the broadband equity access and deployment program will contribute to growth beginning in 2025 and add significant sales over the next several years. In display, we're not counting on TV unit growth. Instead, we expect to capitalize on the trend of larger screens with about an inch of screen size growth per year to add low to mid-single-digit volume growth.\nAdditionally, as we've previously explained, we're currently undertaking currency-based price adjustments to maintain appropriate returns in our display business. In automotive, we have a triple-digit automotive glass business today, and we expect sales in that business to almost triple by 2026.\nRecently announced U.S. EPA regulations will require the adoption of GPFs in the U.S., starting with model year 2027. This adoption offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the U.S. alone. Even in the face of BEV adoption, we expect sales to start in 2026. And finally, we expect to build an entirely new map as we leverage the inflation reduction Act to support the build-out of a U.S. solar supply chain.\nThese are just some of the growth drivers in our $5 billion opportunity. As Wendell shared, we probabilistically adjusted this opportunity to the $3 billion high confidence springboard plan we've been sharing with you since the third quarter of 2023. We expect to have strong incremental profit and cash flow as we capture the growth, and we're starting from a strong operating base.\nOur productivity ratios are at best demonstrated levels and we've raised price to more appropriately share inflation with our customers. Our improvement in gross margin is a great proof point. In the second quarter of 2024, gross margin was 37.9% up 430 basis points from 33.6% in the fourth quarter of 2022 on the same level of sales.\nWith that, let me share some highlights from our second quarter results. Sales grew 11% sequentially reaching $3.6 billion in the quarter, returning us to year-over-year growth. The outperformance versus our April guidance of $3.4 billion was primarily driven by the strong adoption of our new optical connectivity products for Gen AI.\nEPS grew 24% sequentially and more than twice as fast as sales, coming in at $0.47, also above our April guidance range. Gross margin improved sequentially and year-over-year by 110 and 170 basis points, respectively. Operating margin expanded 190 basis points versus the first quarter, and we generated strong free cash flow of $353 million. Next, let me turn to our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the second quarter were $1.1 billion, up 20% sequentially, reflecting a return to growth for the segment.\nYear-over-year, sales increased 4%. Enterprise network sales were up 42% driven by AI reconnectivity solutions. Carrier sales were actually down 10% as customers continue to draw down their inventory. Encouragingly though, Carrier network sales grew sequentially as customers began to order closer to their current deployment levels. We delivered strong incremental profit in Optical with net income for the quarter at $143 million, up 43% sequentially on the 20% sales growth.\nMoving to display technologies. Second quarter sales were $1 billion, up 16% sequentially as panel makers ran at higher utilization rates in the second quarter to support midyear promotions. Glass price was consistent with the first quarter. Net income was $258 million, up 28% sequentially. Year-over-year, sales were up 9% and net income was up 24%, driven by higher volume and price.\nNow let me spend a minute on our approach to display price going forward. As we've said before, we plan to make currency-based price adjustments to maintain appropriate returns in our display business. We're in the midst of doing just that and we will update you on our progress at an appropriate time. With respect to the yen, we have hedges in place for 2025 and beyond.\nThey're not at the 2024 core rate of 107 and but they're much better than the current spot rate. We expect the combination of our currency-based price adjustments and our hedges to deliver an appropriate level of profitability for the display business. For your modeling purposes, you can think about appropriate profitability as being the average of the last 5 years of net income margin from our segment reports.\nTurning to Specialty Materials. Sales in the second quarter were $501 million, up 18% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand for premium glasses for mobile devices and semiconductor-related products. Net income was $63 million, up 91% year-over-year, reflecting volume and manufacturing. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter sales were $431 million, down 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Class 8 truck down cycle in North America as anticipated.\nNet income was $97 million, down 9% year-over-year on decreased volume. We expect the heavy-duty market weakness to continue in the second half of this year and sales and environmental to be down sequentially in the third quarter. In Life Sciences, sales in the second quarter were $249 million, up 8% year-over-year. Net income was $17 million, up 55% year-over-year. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the quarter were $296 million, down 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pricing for solar-grade polysilicon.\nNow let me turn to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect sales to grow to approximately $3.7 billion, driven primarily by our optical communications business including the continued adoption of our new optical connectivity solutions for Gen AI products, which we expect will more than offset the expected slowdown in the U.S. Class 8 truck market.\nWe expect EPS in the range of $0.50 to $0.54, with EPS growing 3x the rate of sales. As we previously shared, our sales are running well ahead of our springboard plan. And our incrementals are strong, in fact, if you compare our projected Q3 sales and EPS guide to Q4 2023, which is our springboard base, sales are up approximately 13% and EPS is up approximately 33%.\nAdditionally, in Q3, we anticipate another quarter of strong free cash flow. As it relates to cash, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities, we believe this creates the most value for our shareholders over the long term.\nAs we've shared today, in the midterm, we have the technical capabilities and capacity in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with minimal cash investment. And you can see that reflected in our CapEx expectations for 2024 of $1.2 billion. We also seek to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet. We're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with about only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next 5 years and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year.\nAnd finally, we expect to continue our strong track record of returning excess cash to shareholders. Since 2013, we bought back half of our outstanding shares for almost 800 million shares. This generated about $15 billion of value for our shareholders. Because of our growing confidence in SpringBoard, we started to buy back shares in the second quarter, and we expect to continue share buybacks in the third quarter.\nIn summary, we're off to a great start on our springboard plan. We're well on track to deliver on our $3 billion plus sales opportunity. Our second quarter results and our third quarter guidance our strong proof points of the incremental profit and cash flow we expect to deliver as we capture the sales growth.\nI look forward to sharing more in the coming months as we make progress on our springboard plan and continue to create value for shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Okay. We're ready for our first question."

Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nIt is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Corning's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ed Plessinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Relation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nThese factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the first quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS primarily reflected constant currency adjustments, translated earnings contract gains and translation gains on Japanese yen-denominated debt. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com.\nYou may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along, and they're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we announced first quarter 2024 results. Sales were nearly $3.3 billion and EPS was $0.38. Year-over-year, gross margin grew 160 basis points to 36.8%, and free cash flow improved by $300 million. These results were at the high end of our guidance. More importantly, but we're seeing encouraging signs of improving market conditions. We continue to expect that the first quarter will be the low quarter for the year.\nWe are executing our plans to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next 3 years. And we already have the required capacity and capabilities in place. As a result, we're poised to deliver powerful incremental profit and cash flow and generate substantial shareholder value. Last quarter, we outlined a framework under which we expect to drive stronger returns on our existing innovation and capacity investments and we shared our expectation that these returns will begin in 2024.\nThe framework has 3 primary components: First, we believe that the first quarter will be the lowest quarter for the year. We will improve from here. Second, we expect to grow by more than $3 billion in annualized sales in the midterm, which we define as within the next 3 years. The outlook in each of our markets remains positive, and our market positions are quite strong. Third, as we capture this growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals. We already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place, and the cost and the capital are already reflected in our financials. This is a tremendous opportunity for our shareholders.\nIn the 3 months since our last call, our confidence in these 3 components has only increased. We expect our sales to grow from here and we have reflected this in our second quarter guidance. Today, I'd like to review each component of the framework and share some of the reasons why our confidence has grown. Let me begin with the first component. Our expectation that quarter 1 will be the lowest quarter of 2024. Near term, we expect optical and display to be the biggest drivers of our improvement. In Optical Communications, carrier inventory drawdowns have been the primary source of our below-trend sales. Once carrier inventory starts returning to more normal levels and our customers resume purchasing to support their deployment rates, we would expect to see our order book grow. And that's exactly what is happening.\nOur order book grew nicely from fourth quarter levels. This and our regular conversations with large carrier customers indicate that the gap between our sales and customer deployments is moderating. As a result, we expect carrier sales to increase from first quarter levels. Additionally, in the enterprise portion of our optical business, we expected our recent wins for AI data centers will translate into orders and sales during the year. In display, panel makers increased their utilization rates late in the first quarter, and we expect the higher utilization to continue into the second quarter, driven by expected growth in retail demand resulting from midyear promotions.\nFor the full year 2024, our expectations for the retail glass market remain unchanged from our January view and consistent with industry expectations. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of television screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This leads to mid-single-digit percent growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. As a result, we expect our financial performance in display to improve significantly from our first quarter run rate. Ed will share more details on that in just a few moments.\nNow let's move to the second component of our framework. Our expectation that we will add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next 3 years. Our positive outlook for each of our market opportunities, results from our leadership positions and the power of the secular trends that we're addressing through innovation and close collaboration with customers. There's a lot more Corning to be had in our markets.\nIn Optical Communications, fiber is the ascendant technology, and we're the clear market leader. As I've covered in the last 2 calls, fiber shipments are more than 30% below trend. We fully expect that gap to close, adding more than 40% to our overall optical communication sales. In conversations with our large carrier customers during the quarter, they reinforced their commitment to increasing fiber deployments in 2024 and beyond. Additionally, we expect Bead-related projects for network builds in underserved areas to add to our addressable market for the next several years. The industry expects funding approvals to begin late this year, leading to spending in 2025.\nNext, generative AI is an especially attractive opportunity for us, it creates significant demand for passive optical connectivity solutions and strengthens our value proposition and our competitive advantages. All data centers consist of a front-end network, connecting racks of CPUs. To meet the computational demands of AI, customers are building a new fiber-rich second network to connect GPUs, which increases our market opportunity.\nNow we'll see this in our financials as customers begin to build large GPU clusters and adopt our latest high-density innovations. Customers want fast deployment. Our preconnectorized structured cabling solutions offer big installation time advantages. And the GPU clusters, which pack a very large amount of computing power per rack require smaller, tensor cables, making connector size and cable diameter, important requirements. To meet these high-density requirements, we've introduced new-to-the-world fiber cable and connectivity products.\nAt OFC a few weeks ago, we introduced Rocket ribbon cable with Flow Ribbon technology that can reduce cable diameter by 60% with fibers per cable approaching A key part of delivering this innovation is our Contour optical fiber, which has a 40% smaller cross-sectional area than legacy fibers. Now our ability to integrate innovations across fiber, cable and connectors, to create end-to-end solutions is a unique competitive advantage, and we're accumulating significant customer wins for upcoming AI data center builds. In our recent customer wins, our revenue is low single-digit hundreds of dollars per GPU.\nWe believe the customer density needs combined with our technology superior performance will sustain these attractive sales attach rates long term. Let's turn to automotive. The U.S. EPA announced new multi-pollutant standards last month. They include a strong particulate emissions limit that will require gasoline particulate filter adoption on U.S. gasoline vehicles, including hybrids, as early as 2026 for model year 2027. We are the inventor and the clear market leader in GPF and these standards increase our environmental technologies content opportunity by 2 to 3 times per U.S. ICE vehicle. This adoption offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth for us in the U.S. alone, even in the face of BEV adoption. Keep in mind, we're also pursuing additional more Corning content opportunities in the automotive industry by introducing our automotive glass solutions, which are building success and momentum and are being adopted by both ICE and BEV platforms.\nIn Mobile Consumer Electronics, our goal is to outpace the market by increasing the content we provide for each device. Our sales have consistently outpaced the market over the last decade, and we expect that to continue to be the case going forward. We've done this by advancing the state of the art for cover materials and adding more content per device, a classic more Corning play. We have a strong innovation portfolio in support of our close collaborations with leading OEMs, and we expect to continue delivering new products that increase our value per device.\nIn display, we expect volume growth at retail to be driven mainly by television screen size growth. In fact, in the first quarter, sales of 85-inch TVs increased by more than 50% year-over-year. Overall, we expect to capture growth in display because we are the undisputed technology leader. Our successful development of Gen 10.5 and advanced capabilities aligned with the continued move to larger-sized TVs produced on the lowest cost platforms for large displays.\nFinally, we continue to build entirely new product platforms to capture opportunities in new categories. Examples include automotive glass solutions to support high autonomy systems, the growing opportunity to localize U.S. solar supply and pharmaceutical packaging. In sum, we expect the power of our market leadership positions and more Corning innovations to allow us to grow faster than our markets in advance our $3 billion plus opportunity.\nNow I'd like to move to the third component of the framework. Our expectation for powerful incrementals as we add sales. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a set of actions to restore historic productivity ratios and also to raise price to share the impact of inflation more equitably with our customers. Since we initiated these activities we have expanded our gross margin by 320 basis points despite sales being down almost $400 million.\nOur actions have established a significantly stronger profitability and cash flow base even while our P&L includes the costs and technical capabilities necessary to support $3 billion plus in additional sales. Importantly, we have put processes and governance mechanisms in place to generate operating leverage as we grow sales. So as I close today, here's what I'd like to leave you with. Our first quarter results show encouraging signs of improving market conditions. We continue to expect this quarter will be the lowest quarter for the year. Additionally, we've established a higher profitability and cash flow base.\nFinally, as our markets improve, we have the opportunity to increase our annualized sales by more than $3 billion as we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals because they require capacity technical capabilities are already in place and the costs are already in our financials. This represents a terrific opportunity for our shareholders. Our second quarter guidance reflects higher sales and strong incremental profit. And you'll hear more about this from Ed.\nWe will continue making progress on this opportunity in 2024. Think of us as continuing to march up. I look forward to updating you at investor conferences in the next few months. Now before I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, who will retire from Corning at the end of May.\nI want to thank Jeff for his 13 years of outstanding leadership at our company. During his tenure, he's helped grow the company, develop frameworks that define our priorities and guide our actions and raised awareness of glass as a key enabling material. He also increased Corning's focus on sustainability. Jeff, we wish you the very best. With that, I'll turn things over to Ed.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter sales were $3.26 billion, and EPS was $0.38, at the high end of our guidance. Our actions to increase price and improve productivity ratios are paying off. In the first quarter, despite lower year-over-year sales, we grew gross margin by 160 basis points. We also grew free cash flow by more than $300 million versus the first quarter of 2023. Overall, we have established a significantly stronger profitability and cash flow base, and we expect to grow from first quarter levels.\nIn the second quarter, we expect sales of approximately $3.4 billion, with strong incremental profit and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. Let's take a closer look at our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the first quarter were $930 million, down 17% year-over-year, reflecting temporarily lower carrier demand as customers continued to draw down inventory. Net income for the quarter was $100 million, down 37% year-over-year, reflecting the lower volume.\nWe are seeing clear signs of improving market conditions, and we think Q1 represents an inflection. Sequentially, sales grew in both carrier and enterprise in the first quarter, which is more favorable than normal seasonality. And our order rates are steadily increasing as some of our carrier customers are reaching the end of their inventory drawdowns. We believe we're well positioned to take advantage of the industry's long-term growth drivers, specifically broadband, 5G, cloud computing and AI. We will also benefit from public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the U.S. population.\nMoving to Display Technologies. As we shared with you in January, panel makers reduced their utilization levels in the fourth quarter in response to a softer retail selling season. Additionally, as expected, panel makers utilization levels remained low in the first quarter to align supply to demand. Our first quarter sales were $872 million, up 14% year-over-year and net income was $201 million, up 26% year-over-year. The increase in net income was primarily driven by higher volume and pricing actions taken in the second half of 2023.\nFirst quarter glass price was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023 as expected. Now it's worth noting that first quarter net income was negatively impacted by our decision to reduce our production to align to the lower volume we experienced in the fourth and first quarters. Our profitability will be higher in the second quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect panel makers to run at higher utilization rates, driven by growth in retail demand resulting from midyear promotions, and we will return our production volume to more normal levels. We expect the second quarter glass market and our volume to increase sequentially as a result of higher panel maker utilization, and we expect glass price to be consistent with the first quarter.\nFor the full year, our expectations for the retail market remain unchanged from our January view and are consistent with industry expectations. Specifically, we anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth, and some recovery in PC demand. This adds mid-single-digit percent growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. Overall, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable.\nBefore I move on, I want to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and protect shareholder returns. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. And we've received more than $2.5 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.\nOur most significant hedge contracts are for the Japanese yen, which support our yen core rate of 107 through the end of 2024. As we look beyond 2024, our goal is to maintain an appropriate return on our display business through a combination of currency hedges and industrial solutions like price increases. First, on hedging, we are actively working to improve our hedge coverage for 2025 and into the future. The yen forward curve works in our favor. So if you go out a year, the forward rate is about JPY 8 stronger than today's spot rate out 2 years, it's approximately 14 and so on.\nThe current yen spot rate is significantly weaker than the 30-year average of approximately JPY 110. We have made some progress on our hedges and are now partially hedged for 2025, and we'll continue to look for attractive opportunities to increase our hedges. Second, our customers sell panels in U.S. dollars, and they buy glass from us in yen. They are benefiting from the current weak yen rate. We plan to share the economics more appropriately with our customers by raising glass prices in yen.\nWe successfully took a first step in this direction in the second half of 2023. We will continue to keep you updated as we make progress. Moving to Specialty Materials. Sales in the first quarter were $454 million, up 12% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our premium smartphone cover materials as well as semiconductor-related products. Net income was $44 million, up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher volume. Our more Corning approach will continue to help us win as handheld and IT markets recover.\nAdditionally, over time, we anticipate growth from new innovations such as bendable glass and augmented reality as they are adopted more broadly. Environmental Technologies first quarter sales were $455 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by increased GPF adoption in China which more than offset a decline in heavy-duty diesel in North America and impact we expect to continue through 2024. Net income was $105 million, up 28% year-over-year, driven by higher volume and improved operating performance. In Life Sciences, Sales in the first quarter were $236 million, down 8% versus the first quarter of 2023 as customers in North America and Europe continue to draw down their inventory.\nNet income was $13 million, up 44% year-over-year, reflecting improved productivity. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the first quarter were $311 million, down 19% year-over-year, reflecting lower pricing for solar grade polysilicon and lower sales in pharmaceutical technologies from the completion of volume commitments for COVID-related products.\nNow let's turn to our outlook. Last quarter, we shared our expectation that the first quarter would be the low quarter of the year, and we're even more confident that, that is the case. In the second quarter, we expect sales to grow sequentially to approximately $3.4 billion with strong incremental profit and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. We also anticipate free cash flow to grow sequentially by approximately $300 million in the second quarter, and we expect CapEx of approximately $1.2 billion for the year.\nWendell outlined our framework to drive strong returns on our existing innovation and capacity investments and shared our expectations for powerful incremental profit and cash flow. Given this opportunity, we've begun to think about our approach to the allocation of that cash going forward. As a reminder, we prioritize investing for organic growth opportunities.\nAnd as we've shared today, in the midterm, we have the capabilities and capacity in place to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales with minimal cash investment. You can see that reflected in our CapEx expectations for 2024. This contributes to the strong free cash flow we expect to generate. Additionally, we maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet, and we're in great shape. We have one of the longest debt centers in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is about 23 years with about only $1 billion in debt coming due over the next 5 years, and we have no significant debt due coming due in any given year.\nSo as our cash flow increases, we remain committed to providing returns to our shareholders. We have grown our dividend 40% since 2019 and our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500, and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases. I look forward to sharing more in the coming months as we continue to make progress building a solid foundation for durable, profitable long-term growth. Now I'll turn things back over to Anne.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Ed. We're ready for our first question."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shannon, and good morning, and welcome to Corning's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nFor the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS primarily reflected constant currency adjustments, realized gains and unrealized noncash mark-to-market losses on translated earnings contracts, and noncash translation losses on Japanese yen-denominated debt as well as restructuring and asset write-off charges. As a reminder, these mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com.\nYou may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, and we encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Anne. Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Sales for the fourth quarter were $3.3 billion, and EPS was $0.39 in line with expectations. Free cash flow was $0.5 billion. Gross margin was 37%, consistent with the third quarter despite lower sequential sales. As I shared with you last quarter, demand in most of our markets is temporarily depressed due to supply chain corrections and macroeconomic factors. Therefore, our sales are well below long-term trends.\nNevertheless, the actions we took to improve our profitability and cash flow generation throughout 2023, are evident in our financial performance. And based on detailed assessments, we are confident that we have extended our leadership positions across our markets. While our current sales are below trend, we expect that to change in the midterm as our markets begin to normalize. This creates an opportunity for us to increase our sales by more than $3 billion when that happens.\nAs we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals because we already have the required production capacity and technical capabilities in place and the cost is already reflected in our financials. The incremental profit and cash flow annuity created by increasing sales by $3 billion plus is a terrific opportunity for our shareholders, and we expect to start making progress towards realizing that opportunity in 2024.\nNow it's difficult to call the specific timing of a recovery but we continue to see signs that it will occur in 2024. As a result, we expect the first quarter to be our low quarter of the year. So that's a summary of where we are and how we seek to create value in the medium term. I'd like to provide some additional facts and perspective. At the start of 2023, we introduced plans to improve profitability and cash flow in this lower demand environment. Throughout the year, we took action to restore our productivity ratios to historical levels and to raise price to more appropriately share inflation with our customers.\nI'm happy to report we delivered on our plans. When you look at our fourth quarter results on a year-over-year basis, the evidence of our progress is quite clear. We increased gross margin by 330 basis points and free cash flow by $110 million to $0.5 billion despite sales being down by more than $350 million. Our profitability and productivity improvements led to significantly improved free cash flow conversion, and we expect to continue converting profit to cash at attractive rates going forward.\nOverall, our results in the quarter and throughout 2023, demonstrate that we continue to make solid progress advancing our market leadership strengthening our profitability and improving our cash flow generation even in the lower demand environment we're experiencing. As a result, we're entering this year operationally strong. Now we intend to build on this strength. As I previously mentioned, we have an opportunity to increase our sales by more than $3 billion in the medium term.\nLet's take a deeper look as to why we believe this. I shared a bit of how we're thinking about optical communications on the last call. I'll start there again today because it's a significant part of our opportunity. We anticipate Optical Communications sales will spring back because we believe and our carrier customers have confirmed that they purchased excess inventory during the pandemic and that they've been utilizing this inventory to continue deploying their networks.\nWe believe these carriers will soon deplete their inventory and execute on the increased broadband deployment plans they've communicated to us over the last several months. As a result, we expect them to return to their normal purchasing patterns to service their deployments. We also continue to expect speed funding for network builds in underserved areas to begin in the second half of 2024 and continue adding to our addressable market for several years.\nAdditionally, we expect to grow hyperscale sales in support of the growing role of cloud computing and the need to build the second optical network necessary to directly connect the GPUs that drive artificial intelligence. Last quarter, I shared trend lines for fiber shipments, which showed that we are significantly below trend and outline why we expect our sales to get back on track. I'd now like to update you on progress during the fourth quarter.\nHere, you see Corning's fiber shipments measured in fiber kilometers since the beginning of 2007. The trend line shows a 7.3% compound annual growth rate over the last decade compared to a 6.6% CAGR for industry fiber shipments over the same period. As I explained during our third quarter call, our fiber shipments in quarter 1 of 2023 were basically in line with expected market trends, but started to drop below our trend line in quarter 2 and even more so in quarter 3, with our shipments more than 30% below trend line, primarily due to elevated carrier inventory levels.\nWe now have another quarter of data to share. In the fourth quarter, we saw a small uptick in fiber shipments, but they remain more than 30% below trend. More importantly, our regular sit-downs with key customers indicate that they are deploying at a higher rate than they are purchasing as they continue to make progress on drawing down inventory. Additionally, they have plans to increase deployments in 2024. We look forward to updating you on takeaways from our next round of sit-downs. We're also seeing encouraging signs in hyperscale.\nOverall orders grew in the fourth quarter, and we're seeing the earliest edge of AI-related network builds in our order books. Returning to trend adds more than 40% to our revenue run rate for optical communications, and we are laser focused on doing just that. Beyond that, we expect the strong underlying growth trend to continue far into the future and our sales to grow faster than the market through more Corning innovations.\nOptical fiber remains the ascendant technology with growing applications in wireless, cloud computing, including AI and broadband efforts to connect the unconnected. As those applications grow, we have new product innovations in each that will increase our revenue per installed fiber. Government incentives to ensure everyone has Internet access also extend the long-term trend line. Display provides another example of how our sales will spring back. Retail sales during the fourth quarter selling season, were softer than industry expectations. Panel makers responded by reducing their fourth quarter utilization levels.\nAdditionally, industry reports indicate the panel makers plan to run at lower utilization levels in the first quarter as they continue to align panel supply to demand with fab shutdowns planned during the Lunar New Year holidays in February. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage sequentially. For the full year of 2024 our expectations are in line with the industry.\nWe anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth and some recovery in PC demand. Combined, this adds mid-single-digit growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. We expect panel maker utilization to increase after the first quarter to meet the expected retail demand. As a result, we expect our financial performance to significantly improve from our first quarter run rate.\nLonger term, we expect continued volume growth in retail to be being driven by television screen size growth as it has the past several years. And for some improvement in units as consumer demand normalizes. We expect to win in this market because we are the undisputed technology leader our successful development and capability in Gen 10.5 aligns with the continued move to larger-sized TVs produced on the lowest cost platforms for large displays. Life Sciences is another segment where market normalization contribute significantly to our expected growth. Customers in North America and in Europe are completing their inventory drawdowns.\nWe are continuing our productivity and operations improvements, and we're refocusing our commercial and production efforts on drug discovery and production as the market returns. We also continue to evolve our products and business model for vials in our Pharmaceutical Technologies business. In addition to markets returning to normal, we continue to execute our more Corning content opportunities across the company.\nIn mobile consumer electronics and automotive, we see more Corning as the primary growth mechanism. Let's look first at Mobile Consumer Electronics. Since 2016, handhelds have declined 21% while our sales of Gorilla Glass have increased 41%. Now we've done this by advancing the state of the art for cover materials. And this is just a classic more Corning play. We have a strong innovation portfolio in support of our close collaborations with leading OEMs. And we expect to continue delivering new products that increase our content per device.\nYou saw a great example of this earlier in January in our announcement with Samsung about Corning Gorilla Armor which dramatically enhances sunlight readability and scratch resistance. Extreme ultraviolet lithography, or EUV a market we serve with our advanced optics products is another great more Corning opportunity. We are the market leader for the photomask and mirror materials of choice for GPUs and other advanced semiconductors.\nIn automotive, proposed U.S. EPA regulations would require adoption of gasoline particulate filters and provide an incremental driver of demand for our market-leading GPF offerings. In terms of more Corning, GPF adds 2x to 3x the content opportunity in ICE vehicles. This would meet significant growth in our environmental business even in the face of global BEV adoption.\nAdditionally, we're winning both interior and exterior auto glass business as customers increasingly view our solutions to be system-enabling components. As I wrap up, here's what I'd like to leave you with. A majority of our markets are operating below trend. And as a result, our 2023 full year sales are down from the prior year. In this lower demand environment, we have successfully taken actions to improve our profitability and cash flow, and we believe we have extended our leadership positions across our businesses. We are confident that our markets will normalize and as they do, we have an opportunity to increase our annual sales by more than $3 billion.\nAs we capture that growth, we expect to deliver powerful incrementals. Since the required capacity and technical capabilities are a rent in place and the costs are already in our financials. This represents a terrific opportunity for our shareholders. We expect to make progress on this opportunity in 2024, and we believe the first quarter is a low quarter of the year. It's difficult to call the specific timing of a recovery. We will continue our regular engagements with our large optical customers to review their recent deployments in detail and better understand their plans for deployments in 2024 and beyond.\nFollowing the Lunar New Year, we'll have similar meetings with our display customers. And we look forward to updating you in the next few months at investor conferences on our learnings. And our progress. As I conclude, I'd like to remind you that the essence of what we do here at Corning is invent, make and sell. We drive durable multiyear growth by inventing category-defining products, developing scalable manufacturing platforms and building strong trust-based relationships with our customers who are the leaders in their industries.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed so that he can get into the details of our results and our outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. I will start by summarizing a few key takeaways, and then I'll move to the fourth quarter results. Our full year sales were $13.6 billion, down 8% and reflecting our markets being well below long-term trends. Despite the lower sales, we improved profitability and cash flow by restoring productivity ratios back to historical levels, and offsetting inflation by raising prices.\nAs a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we expanded gross margin by 330 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2022, despite sales being down by more than $350 million, and we grew free cash flow sequentially every quarter from first quarter levels. As you heard from Wendell, we have an opportunity to increase our sales by more than $3 billion in the medium term as our markets normalize. And we have in place the necessary production capacity and technical capabilities to service that growth. Our operations and finance teams are collaborating closely on processes and tools to ensure that we capture the growth and operating leverage required to deliver significant incremental profit and cash flow.\nWe expect to make progress during 2024. Moving to fourth quarter results. Sales were $3.3 billion. Gross margin was 37%, EPS was $0.39 and free cash flow was $487 million. Now let me provide some details on our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales for the fourth quarter were $903 million, down 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting temporarily lower demand from carrier customers as they continue to draw down inventory. Net income for the quarter was $88 million, down 3% sequentially on the lower volume.\nLonger term, we remain confident that optical communications market will normalize. We believe that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact, specifically broadband, 5G, and cloud computing and advanced AI. We will also benefit from public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the U.S. population.\nAnd from an order rate perspective, we are beginning to see green shoots in the hyperscale data center space. Moving to Display Technologies. Fourth quarter sales were $869 million, down 11% sequentially. The remainder of our second half price increases partially offset a sequential volume decline that assisted with the market. Results -- retail results during the fourth quarter selling season were softer than industry expectations.\nPanel makers responded by reducing their fourth quarter utilization levels. Additionally, industry reports indicate that panel makers plan to run at lower utilization levels in the first quarter as they continue to align panel supply to demand with fab shutdowns planned during the Lunar New Year holidays in February. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage sequentially. For the full year of 2024, our expectations are in line with the industry. We anticipate relatively flat television unit volume, another year of TV screen size growth and some recovery in PC demand.\nThis adds mid-single-digit growth in glass volume at retail versus 2023. We expect panel maker utilization to increase after the first quarter to meet the expected retail demand growth. As a result, we expect our financial performance to significantly improve from our first quarter run rate. Moving to pricing. We successfully executed a double-digit price increase at our customers in the second half of 2023.\nWe expect the pricing environment to remain favorable with glass supply balanced to demand as display glass makers reduced capacity in 2023. We expect our Q1 2024 glass prices to be consistent with Q4 of 2023. In Specialty Materials, Sales in the fourth quarter were $473 million, down 16% sequentially, following strong third quarter sales of our smartphone cover materials in support of customer product launches. Net income was $58 million, down 19% sequentially, reflecting the lower volumes.\nIn Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $429 million, down 4% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality. Net income was $98 million, consistent sequentially. For the full year, sales increased 11% to $1.8 billion, outpacing the automotive market recovery. Our content-driven growth strategy and increased GPF adoption due to midyear implementation of China 6b regulations led to our outperformance. In Life Sciences, sales in the fourth quarter were $242 million, up 5% sequentially. Customers in North America and Europe are completing their inventory drawdowns, additionally, productivity improvements allowed us to improve service levels to better supply the market as it normalizes.\nNet income improved sequentially to $17 million, up 31% and resulting from higher volume and productivity improvements. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the fourth quarter were $356 million, up 9% sequentially and primarily reflecting higher semiconductor polysilicon volume. Now let's turn to our outlook. We expect sales in the first quarter of approximately $3.1 billion. We expect EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.38.\nThe improvements we made in profitability and cash flow will continue to deliver benefits in 2024. And we expect gross margin in the first quarter of '24 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2023 despite lower sales and to improve first quarter free cash flow by $200 million to $300 million versus the first quarter of 2023. We expect the first quarter to be our low quarter. We believe we are going to grow from these levels for the following reasons: in optical communications, we expect carriers to complete inventory drawdowns and increased deployments throughout the year.\nWe also see orders increasing from hyperscale data center customers. In display, we expect panel maker utilization to increase from first quarter levels to meet expected full year retail demand. In Life Sciences, we expect markets to continue normalizing. And we plan to deliver more Corning content opportunities in mobile consumer electronics and environmental technologies. Now I'd like to take a minute to address currency exchange rates.\nAs a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and protect shareholder returns. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We have received more than $2.5 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception. Our largest exposure is the Japanese yen. As we've previously shared, investors, we have most of our 2024 exposure hedged. We plan to keep our yen core rate at 107 through the end of 2024. As we look ahead, we are actively working to improve our hedge coverage for 2025. The yen forward curve works in our favor.\nIf you go out one year, the forward yen rate is about JPY 7 stronger than today's spot rate, out 2 years, it's about JPY 12 stronger and so on. Also, the current yen spot rate is significantly weaker than the 30-year average of approximately JPY 110. So we believe there will be an opportunity to place additional long-term hedges at more attractive rates. And in combination with hedging, we can institute an industrial solution. like price increases for display glass.\nThe first step of which we took in 2023. So that's how we think about it. It will either solve in the currency markets in a reasonable time frame or will move to an industrial solution. Now before I wrap up, I want to spend a minute on our priorities to maintain a strong and efficient balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders. We ended the year with $1.8 billion in cash. We've created one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is 23 years with only $1.4 million in debt coming due in the next 5 years and no significant debt coming due in any given year and essentially all of our debt instruments are fixed rate.\nAdditionally, we prioritize returning excess cash to shareholders. We have consistently done this, including throughout the pandemic. And one of the ways we do that is through dividends. We have grown our dividend 40% since 2019, and our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500. We will propose that our Board maintains a quarterly dividend of $0.28 in the first quarter, and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases.\nNow here's what I want to leave you with today. We are entering the year operationally and financially strong. We expect the first quarter to be the low quarter of the year. We have an opportunity to capture $3 billion plus in sales over the medium term as markets normalize and we capture more Corning content opportunities. As we do, we are positioned to capture significant incremental profit and cash flow because we have the capacity and capabilities in place and the costs are already in our financials.\nI look forward to updating you on our progress. And now I will turn things back over to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Shannon, we're ready for our first question."

Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported our third quarter results. As expected, sales were $3.5 billion, and EPS was $0.45. Gross margin expanded sequentially to 37% and free cash flow improved to $466 million. Our results demonstrate solid progress on the programs that we've put in place to increase price and improve productivity while lowering inventory.\nThese initiatives led to improved gross margin and cash flow in the quarter despite volume coming in at the low end of our expectations in Optical Communications as carriers continue to draw down inventory and in display technologies as panel makers lowered utilization at the end of the quarter.\nNow let me share a couple of highlights for the quarter. I'll start with gross margin. We drove an 80 basis point sequential expansion to 37% and on consistent sales, driven primarily by our pricing actions in display. Additionally, if you compare the third quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year, when we launched our comprehensive plan, sales are down almost $200 million, yet we've expanded gross margin percent by 340 basis points.\nLooking to the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to be similar even with sales down sequentially. Moving to cash generation, free cash flow of $466 million grew sequentially by $156 million and grew year-over-year by $211 million, up 83% on lower sales.\nOur gross margin improvements and our ability to run with lower inventory levels as well as lower CapEx levels are driving these results. Now this all leads to significantly improved free cash flow conversion, and we expect to convert profit to cash at a strong rate going forward.\nOverall, our results in the quarter illustrate that we continue to make solid progress to reset our price and cost levels to enable an even stronger profit and cash flow cycle as our market volumes revert to me. We also continue to demonstrate progress on our more Corning technology efforts.\nWe extended our market leadership by collaborating with Apple to deliver durable glass with infused color, a first for any smartphone for the back of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus devices. These devices also feature Ceramic Shield, which we collaborated on with Apple to deliver a cover material, with unparalleled smartphone performance.\nWe also recently announced Corning Viridian Vials. This new technology can improve filling line efficiency by up to 50% while reducing vial manufacturing carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by up to 30%. And just yesterday, we announced an expanded collaboration with long-time customer AUO to accelerate the production of their industry-leading large-format curved automotive display modules using our patented call form technology.\nStepping back, we're on the right track, enhancing profits, improving cash generation and delivering new products that capture more Corning content opportunities, all while maintaining our leading market positions. The area that continues to be problematic is our customer demand, especially the weaker carrier sales in optical. So although we've hit our guidance to you for 11 consecutive quarters, weak customer demand has put us consistently at the lower end of our sales expectations over the last year even as outperforming on price and productivity plans.\nMore importantly, we are well below the trend line for our operations profile. We have the capacity and the capability to deliver $3 billion-plus in additional sales with minimal additional cash investments. As a result, this revenue will have powerful incrementals as it returns as long as we keep our capacity and our capabilities vibrant and ready to go.\nSo as we sat our operations profile, we ask ourselves two broad questions, will our revenue return? And when? The first question is relatively straightforward to address. We simply ask ourselves, what are the long-term trends in our markets and where are we now versus those long-term trends. And then, of course, we need to feel confident that we will win in those markets.\nAre we the clear market leaders with superior technology offerings, lowest-cost platforms? And are we advancing more Corning opportunities to increase our value capture for the same volume. So first, let's look at the trends in our markets. We build our capacity and capabilities around long-term trends. We then modulate our operations and staffing around current volume run rates.\nSo we must understand where our volume run rates are versus trend at all times. We do this for each of our businesses. Let me give you just one example. Optical fiber as a good illustration. Here, you see industry shipments measured in fiber kilometers since the beginning of 2004. The trend line shows a 6.6% compound annual growth rate over the last decade. As you can see, the industry has been operating below trend line in the first half of 2023.\nBecause industry shipments are reported with at least a quarter or 2 delay, I'm going to switch to our own shipment data so that we can bring you up to real time. what we saw over the last few quarters and what we're projecting for quarter 4. First thing to notice is the trend line for our shipments has a 7.3% CAGR over the same 10-year period.\nWe've been growing faster than the market. Now this just makes sense with everything we've shared with you about our more Corning strategy. Quarter 1 of 2023 was basically on track, and our shipments started dropping away from the 7.3% CAGR line in quarter 2 and even more so in quarters 3 and 4. Currently, our shipment run rate is at least 30% below trend line.\nYou can think about the 30% plus gap is carrying through all of our optical revenues. Remember that fiber accounts for only a portion of our sales, we have significant value to our fiber with our cabling and connectivity solutions. So this gap to trend ripples through our entire optical product portfolio. We feel the demand drop in our fiber sales cable sales and equipment sales.\nWe're confident that we will return to the long-term trend line. We believe that as customers deplete their inventories the industry and our sales will resume growth. Just returning to trend adds more than 40% to our revenue run rate for optical communications.\nSo that's what we mean when we say we'll revert to mean. And fiber is just one example, we use a similar methodology for key product lines in each of our maps, automotive, display, mobile consumer electronics and life sciences, all of them. are showing a gap versus long-term trend lines. Right now, because we're operating well below long-term trend lines, we see an enormous opportunity as our markets refer to me.\nNow as I noted a moment ago, because we anticipate this recovery across our markets, we need to know we'll win as they bounce back. Are we maintaining our leadership position in advancing opportunities to grow faster? In short, yes, we've built a more advantaged position for 80% plus of our revenues over the last few years. We are the technology leader as well as the lowest cost producer.\nAnd we have built more opportunities to capitalize on growth in our markets, increasing our value capture with our more Corning approach. Let's look at a few examples. In Optical Communications, Fiber Optics remains the ascendant technology growing applications in wireless, cloud computing, including AI and government efforts to connect the unconnected.\nWithin each of these applications, we have new product innovations that will increase our revenue per installed fiber as those applications grow. We're building on our undisputed global cost and technology leadership position, along with our market leadership in North America. In automotive, new U.S. EPA regulations go into effect starting in 2027.\nThese new regulations force adoption of gasoline particulate filters. And we are the inventor and clear market leader in GPS. We expect to see sales as early as 2026. In terms of more Corning, this adds 2 to 3x the content opportunity for ICE vehicles in the U.S. This means significant growth in our environmental business even in the face of global BEV adoption.\nIn fact, we'll still grow environmental sales up until [indiscernible] reaches 40% of all vehicles globally. And that is not forecast to happen until the next decade. Keep in mind, we have also built new revenue platforms with the successful introduction of our auto glass for interiors, which is being widely adopted in [indiscernible] and offers hundreds of millions of dollars of growth opportunity for us.\nDisplay, we have been and continue to be the undisputed leader in technology, quality and cost. Our successful our successful development and capability in Gen 10.5 technology aligns with the continued move to larger size TVs with the lowest cost platforms for large displays. We continue to improve productivity, which allows us to free up assets to serve Gorilla Glass, Glass Ceramics and our growing automotive glass business.\nFinally, we continue to build entirely new product platforms that allow us to enter new categories for growth, examples include pharmaceutical packaging, automotive exterior glass for high autonomy systems and the rapidly growing opportunity to reassure U.S. oiler capacity. In total, this amounts to a $3 billion-plus incremental sales opportunity with minimal cash investment.\nTaken together, that's why we believe our revenues will recover. The next question is, when? The answer to this question is less clear. Conventional wisdom is that customer demand in telecom display, semiconductor, smartphones, tablets and notebooks, bounces back in the second half of 2024. That seems plausible to us. But rather than trying to predict the timing of the recovery, we'll continue to guide one quarter at a time based on our order entry models until visibility improves.\nWe'll continue our programs to improve price, productivity and cost so that we improve profitability and cash flow despite our muted sales outlook. This serves both the purpose of providing enhanced performance near term, and more importantly, providing a better price and cost springboard for profitability as our volume reverts to trend.\nSimply put, we have the ability to deliver another $3 billion-plus in sales with powerful incrementals and minimal cash investments. This represents such a significant opportunity for our shareholders that will maintain this powerful platform throughout this down cycle, all while we continue to improve our near-term profitability and cash flow.\nThis is how we're steering our way through this period. And I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed so we can get into the details of our results and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our sales were $3.5 billion. Gross margin was 37%, EPS was $0.45 and and free cash flow was $466 million. This was in line with our expectations. However, I want to point out that volume in both optical communications and display technologies was below our expectations.\nThis was offset by strong sales in Specialty Materials. Our gross margin was up 80 basis points sequentially on consistent on sales consistent with the prior quarter and 340 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was up $156 million sequentially and $211 million year-over-year. The increase in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability and inventory reductions.\nWe also lowered capital expenditures in the quarter. Our improving profitability and cash, despite muted sales, demonstrates execution of our programmatic approach. Let me provide some details on our segment results. In Optical Communications, sales declined 14% sequentially to $918 million, reflecting lower order rates from carriers as they continue to draw down inventory.\nNet income was $91 million, down sequentially, reflecting lower volumes. Looking ahead, we are not counting on improvements in our orders over the next 6 months. Longer term, we expect our growth to resume as customers complete the drawdown of their inventory. Additionally, we remain confident that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact, specifically, broadband, 5G, cloud computing and advanced AI.\nThere are also public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the U.S. population. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $972 million, and net income was $242 million. Volume in the quarter was lower than our expectation.\nNet income grew 16% sequentially, reflecting the progress on our previously announced price increases. Here's an update on what we are seeing in the business. In line with what we told you last quarter, we are on track to achieve double-digit price increases at our customers in the second half.\nThe impact of these complicated agreements flow through our financials in both the third and fourth quarters. These pricing actions resulted in net income margin of 25% in the third quarter, up 3 percentage points from 22% in the second quarter. On average, our customers are experiencing double-digit price increases with the majority of the impact in the third quarter.\nYear-over-year sales and net income were up 42% and 81%, respectively. Panel maker utilization declined as we exited the third quarter. And looking ahead to the fourth quarter, in line with industry reports, we expect panel makers to reduce utilization further from these levels, and we expect the glass market and our volume to be down sequentially as much as low teens.\nDisplay industry analysts attribute the panel maker utilization decline to a wrestling match between panel makers and set makers over the significant panel price increases during 2023. This dynamic is expected to maintain a healthy supply chain exiting 2023, setting the stage for panel maker utilization to recover in the first half of 2024. However, despite lower sequential volume, we expect to maintain or improve our profitability levels in the fourth quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our pricing actions. For 2024, we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable as we expect glass supply to be balanced to demand and multiple display glass makers have announced capacity reductions earlier this year.\nIn Specialty Materials, sales in the third quarter were $563 million, up 33% sequentially. The improvement was driven by higher Gorilla Glass sales resulting from customer product launches in the quarter, which helped offset overall end market softness and continued solid demand for semiconductor optics drove another strong quarter for advanced optics.\nNet income was $72 million, up sequentially, primarily driven by higher volume and the adoption of premium cover materials. Moving to Environmental Technologies. Sales in the third quarter were $449 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by ongoing growth of gasoline particulate filter adoption in China, which offset expected softness in heavy-duty markets in North America.\nProductivity improvement actions helped net income grow faster than sales to reach $99 million, up 14% year-over-year. In Life Sciences, sales in the third quarter were $230 million, consistent with the second quarter. Sales were down year-over-year, reflecting significantly lower demand for COVID-related products in China, and the impact of customers drawing down inventory.\nNet income increased sequentially to $13 million, driven by productivity improvement actions. Turning to Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses. Sales in the third quarter were $327 million, down 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, reflecting a decline in solar grade polysilicon prices and lower sales in pharmaceutical technologies as we completed the last of our volume commitments for COVID-related products in the second quarter.\nWe are seeing continued strong demand for our solar grade polysilicon, which meets the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. As a reminder, we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with our customers that have floor pricing mechanisms built in to help mitigate the impacts of spot market dynamics.\nNet income was a loss of $8 million, down sequentially driven by lower sales. Now let's turn to our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately $3.25 billion, driven by continued weak demand in optical communications, sequentially lower volume in our display business, reflecting lower panel maker utilization.\nTypical sales patterns in Specialty Materials following significant customer product launches in the third quarter, and the possibility that the labor issues in the automotive industry could impact our automotive business more in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.\nWe remain focused on our actions to improve profitability and cash flow during this low volume period. As a result of our continued execution we expect to deliver another quarter of strong free cash flow and a gross margin percentage similar to the third quarter despite lower sequential sales.\nWe expect EPS of $0.37 to $0.42. Before I wrap up, I'd like to reiterate our commitment to strong financial discipline. We're maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet. For example, we have one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is approximately 25 years with only a little more than $1 billion in debt coming due in the next 5 years, and we have no significant debt coming due in any given year.\nLet me leave you with a few final thoughts. In the near term, we will continue our focus on improving profitability and cash flow despite the muted sales outlook for the quarter. At the same time, we remain well positioned to capture significant additional sales with minimal cash investment. And longer term, we remain confident in our ability to outperform our markets as they recover and to grow beyond prior peak sales run rates with strong incremental leverage. I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I'll turn things back over to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ed. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you. And good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the second quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS stemmed primarily from restructuring charges and from noncash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and Japanese yen-denominated debt.\nIn total, these decreased core earnings in the second quarter by $19 million. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter results to demonstrate strong progress on the priorities we've outlined to improve profitability and cash flow in the current week end market environment. Sales were $3.5 billion. EPS was $0.45. Gross margin and operating margin increased sequentially to 36.2% and 17.5%, respectively.\nAnd free cash flow improved to $310 million. Ed will give you the details on each of these in just a few minutes. Our results reflect solid execution on our plan to deliver financial and operational improvements in response to the significant after effects of the pandemic still rippling across the global economy. Now we've been discussing this plan with you for several quarters. So let me just briefly recap the primary factors we've been addressing.\nFor one, supply chain disruptions caused higher logistics, freight and input costs. Additionally, inflation led to interest rate hikes than a spike in the U.S. dollar. And consumers shifted spending from goods to services as the pandemic abated. Against this backdrop, demand grew below historic trends in end markets that constitute the vast majority of our sales. Further, as supply chains started to normalize again over the last year, our customers began to draw down inventory to facilitate their transition from just in case, back to their typical just-in-time approach.\nConsequently, we're seeing a synchronization of lower sales across our portfolio that is highly unusual. Now this is because while our 3 core technologies and 4 manufacturing platforms do apply to all of our markets, the demand drivers in the different markets we serve are fundamentally uncorrelated, TV sales don't move with automotive production. The life sciences market isn't correlated with fiber optic deployments and so on. Over the past several quarters, I've noted how all the factors I just outlined have taken a toll on profits and cash. And that's why we introduced a comprehensive plan to improve both profitability and cash flow at our current sales run rate.\nWhile also innovating to generate additional near- and longer-term revenue streams. I would like to now walk you through the elements of our plan and the strong results we're delivering. We're taking pricing actions most recently in display. We expect these actions will contribute to overall profitability improvement in the third quarter. We've reduced our staffing levels to align with demand, and we are returning our productivity ratios to historic levels.\nAnd we're bringing inventory down across the company because we no longer require buffer inventory and supply chains are improving. These sets of actions are delivering the intended results. In the first quarter, we improved gross margin by 160 basis points. And in the second quarter, we improved by another 100 basis points. Collectively, we've improved gross margin by 260 basis points to 36.2% versus where we ended 2022. As I said earlier, we also improved our free cash flow to $310 million in the quarter.\nAs we move into the second half, we're not counting on a strong recovery in our end markets or a significant increase in our sales, but we do expect our profitability and cash generation to continue going up. Importantly, our actions will further improve profitability and cash generation when our markets recover. Our volume returns and our sales increase. The products and services we enable smartphones, cars, TVs, broadband. These are central to many facets of daily life. So we're confident that volume in our markets will recover to historical trend lines.\nIn display, for example, we believe the volume recovery has already begun. When we last spoke, panel makers had started to increase utilization at the end of the first quarter. Improvement continued in the second quarter, and we grew sales more than 20% sequentially and driven by higher volume. When we couple this volume return with the display pricing actions I mentioned earlier, we expect to show additional profitability improvement in the third quarter.\nNow our goal is to return display to pre-pandemic profitability levels as we exit the third quarter. Let me now turn to how we intend to increase our profitability and grow our sales beyond our pre-pandemic run rates. Across our markets, we expect demand to normalize and our volume to return. As we drive more Corning content into those markets, we will further increase our profit as we create additional revenue streams. Now here are just a few exciting examples of more Corning innovations that are arriving in the near term.\nIn Optical Communications, leaders in large language models are building data centers with what is essentially a second optical network, which is increasing connectivity by up to 5x within individual data centers. So we're commercializing a Gen 2, high-density, high-value optical interconnect system designed to enable the requirements and capture the growth driven by AI. In mobile consumer electronics, we're launching 2 products this fall and next year, featuring innovations that significantly increase our value per device.\nIn automotive, we continue to increase the amount of Corning content in vehicles across the industry as we pursue our $100 per car content opportunity. We recently commercialized a solution in our auto glass exterior business that takes a significant step to achieving this goal in electric vehicles. And for ICE vehicles, adoption of our gasoline particulate filter technology is now expanding to India. And the U.S. EPA has proposed regulations that would boost our content in the very large domestic market. In Life Sciences, we just launched Viridian vials to address the growing need for sustainable products in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Viridian cuts the CO2 emissions from biomanufacturing by about 1/3 and reduces glass by 20%, all while improving filling line efficiency by 50%.\nWe're expanding our collaboration with West Pharmaceuticals, a leader in drug packaging to accelerate adoption. Now these are just a few examples of innovations and new product sets that you can expect to see in the near term. Additionally, we're scaling our solar business which we expect to add hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits and cash flow beginning in a couple of years. We expect all of these opportunities to further increase our profits as we create additional revenue streams across our markets.\nWhether it's in automotive, cloud computing, broadband, 5G, solar pharmaceutical packaging, next-generation displays and cover materials, augmented reality or semiconductors. Our role in key secular trends is material and compelling. We've built a robust opportunity set that will drive durable long-term growth. So before I turn things over to Ed, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. The world is working through some significant after effects of the pandemic, and they're not trivial for our company.\nOur approach in this environment is not the count on conditions in our end markets or our sales improving significantly from the second quarter. And that's why we're guiding based on our current order rates. When we see our orders increase, will reflect these developments in our operating plans and, of course, our guidance. For now, Corning is executing well on a comprehensive plan to improve profitability and cash flow throughout this low volume period and to emerge stronger.\nOur efforts are already demonstrating significant results. In the first half of the year, we improved profitability in cash flow despite lower sales. Even in a muted sales environment, our pricing and productivity actions will continue to drive improvement in the second half. At the same time, our more Corning approach is driving new product launches that will create additional revenue streams.\nAltogether, as our end markets recover, and our volume returns to historic levels, we're positioned to deliver improved profitability and cash flow with significant operating leverage on sales that will grow faster than our markets. In total, we feel good about our execution. We're taking the right steps to improve our performance today and further improve our results when volume returns. And I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed, so he can get into the details of our results and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nAll right. Thank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. As expected, in the second quarter, we improved profitability and cash flow in an overall weak demand environment. Second quarter sales were $3.5 billion, up 3% sequentially. EPS was $0.45, increasing $0.04 from the prior quarter. Gross margin and operating margin increased sequentially by 100 basis points to 36.2% and 200 basis points to 17.5%, respectively, reflecting progress on our pricing and productivity improvement actions.\nThese results demonstrate the progress on and benefits from our comprehensive approach to improve profitability and cash flow, including continued actions to offset inflationary costs, return productivity levels to return productivity ratios to historical levels and reduce inventory. Now let's turn to our segment results. Let me start with Optical Communications. I shared with you back in May that we were not seeing the typical seasonal uptick in our orders.\nNear-term demand for passive optical network products remains weak. And as the quarter progressed, orders came in at the low end of our expectations. As a result, Sales in the second quarter were $1.066 billion, down 5% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. As I'm sure you're hearing across the industry, carriers and enterprise operators are pushing projects into 2024 due to high inflation and rising interest rates. For now, we are sizing our operational plans based on the orders in our books.\nNet income was $140 million, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. The decline on lower volume was moderated by productivity improvements, as I shared in the first quarter. We raised price in this segment to more appropriately share inflationary costs with customers. While the demand for passive optical network products remains weak, longer term, we remain confident that the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact. We're pursuing 4 significant secular trends: broadband, 5G, the cloud and the paradigm shift in computation necessary to train large language models and other advanced AI.\nWe've got major innovation programs underway for each category. And our connectivity solutions offer economic advantages for a broader range of customers than ever before and demand for optical networks is strongly supported by trends in computation as well as by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population. Turning to Display Technologies. Sales in the second quarter were $928 million, up 22% sequentially and 6% year-over-year.\nNet income was $208 million, up 30% sequentially, primarily driven by higher volume. Second quarter panel maker utilization played out in line with the expectations I described 3 months ago. After reaching historic lows in 2022 and as recently as January, panel maker utilization has increased consistently, driving significant sequential volume increases. We believe that the display industry recovery is underway. Now let me update you on what has happened since our display price increase announcement in May.\nSince then, we've engaged with our customers and they understand our need to offset elevated costs. We expect to finalize agreements for double-digit price increases that will begin to go into effect in the third quarter. We expect our profitability to improve and to return to pre-pandemic levels as we exit the quarter. Moving to Specialty Materials. Second quarter sales were down 13% year-over-year. This reflects continued end market softness. Sales increased 4% sequentially on higher Gorilla Glass sales. Net income was $33 million, down 15% sequentially, impacted by continued development costs for new product launches.\nLooking ahead, we believe that there are new innovation opportunities for us in emerging trends like augmented reality, vendable devices and AI that will extend our more Corning opportunities far into the future. For example, our world-leading optical materials and systems in our advanced optics business power EUV lithography technology. We enable the manufacturing of smaller, faster, more powerful chips, including GPUs. Global AI initiatives are accelerating demand for GPUs and for our EUV-related products. In Environmental Technologies, second quarter sales were $457 million, up 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year.\nNet income increased to $107 million on stronger sales and improved productivity. In automotive, our sales were up 8% sequentially driven by the ramp of GPF sales in China based on regulations that are now in effect. We do not expect to see this level of GPF sales in China in the third quarter. Auto production levels remained steady quarter-over-quarter in North America and Europe. Year-over-year, our automotive sales were up 40%, driven by the GPF ramp in China that I just mentioned and versus low auto sales in China during the 2022 COVID shutdowns and 2022 supply chain issues for automakers globally.\nIn diesel, our sales were up 13% year-over-year, driven by heavy-duty demand in North America and Europe which more than offset languishing demand in China. Turning to Life Sciences. Second quarter sales were $231 million, down 10% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Both the sequential and year-over-year sales declines resulted from lower demand for COVID-related products in China and by customers continuing to draw down inventory. Net income increased sequentially to $11 million, with productivity improvements more than offsetting lower sales. We expect our sales and profitability to improve as the industry corrects and as we continue to restore productivity ratios back to pre-pandemic levels.\nFinally, in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses, Sales in the second quarter were $377 million, consistent with the first quarter. Sales were down 10% year-over-year partly associated with a decline in solar grade polysilicon spot prices. We are seeing continued strong demand for solar-grade polysilicon required to meet the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. And we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with our customers that have floor price mechanisms built in to help mitigate the impacts of spot market dynamics.\nNet income increased sequentially to $26 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements. Now let me spend a minute on our outlook for the third quarter. As we've been sharing with you, we are planning our operations based on our current order run rate. And we're continuing to take pricing and productivity actions to improve profitability and cash flow. We're adopting the same philosophy for our guidance. Based on our current order run rate, we expect our sales to come in roughly in line with quarter 2, approximately $3.5 billion orders begin to increase, we'll let you know.\nOn roughly flat total company sales, we expect improved profitability and cash flow. We expect EPS to come in about the same or slightly better than the second quarter, and this factors in sequentially higher interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate. Of course, there are differing dynamics in each of our businesses. At a high level, we expect improvements in display and specialty materials to be offset by declines in Optical Communications, driven by the dynamics I previously mentioned as well as declines in environmental where we expect lower sales for GPF in China as the ramp is largely complete, and we expect lower demand for heavy duty.\nWe continue to expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be slightly lower than 2022. Now I'd like to wrap up with a few key takeaways. As CFO, I am pleased with our execution on many dimensions. Our second quarter results demonstrate the benefits of our comprehensive approach to address after effects of the pandemic. We're sharing inflationary costs with our customers. We're returning our productivity ratios to pre-pandemic levels and we are on track to normalize inventory. Additionally, we're undertaking initiatives to capture our next wave of growth opportunities. In the near term, to enhance shareholder value we remain focused on improving cash flow and profitability in the second half even at our current sales run rate and advancing innovations to outperform our end markets.\nWe're seeing the recovery play out in display, and we expect to see it play out across our other markets because the underlying fundamental drivers remain intact. Longer term, we are well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends and expect to grow faster than our markets, driven by our more Corning approach. So I look forward to updating you on our progress. Now I'll turn things back over to Ann.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Operator, we're ready for our first question."

[Operator Instructions] It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. I'd like to remind you that today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nFor the first quarter, the primary differences between GAAP and core EPS stemmed from restructuring charges and from non-cash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and Japanese-yen-denominated debt. In total, these increased core earnings in Q1 by $97 million. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.

Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Corning, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Last quarter, we told you that markets constituting about half of our sales. We're experiencing recession-level demand that are first quarter sales would decline by greater-than-normal seasonality due to pandemic-related disruptions, China that we would raise prices again to offset additional inflation and also begin to restore our productivity ratios to pre-pandemic levels. And as a result, our margins would increase 1 to 2 percentage points sequentially despite lower sales. And that is exactly how the first quarter played out.\nFirst quarter sales were $3.4 billion, and EPS was $0.41. Our actions to raise prices and restore productivity ratios began delivering notable results. Despite a 7% sequential sales decline. Gross margin expanded 160 basis points sequentially to 35.2%. And operating margin expanded 150 basis points from the prior quarter to 15.5%. Although conditions remain weak in multiple markets, we expect our results to improve in the second quarter.\nWe remain focused on profitability and cash flow, and we will continue to align our cost structure to demand. Now I wanted to provide some context on the dynamics we're experienced in our key markets. And then I'll discuss how we're continuing to build our long-term growth opportunities across our business. So let's dive in.\nIn Display Technologies, sales declined 3% sequentially as both volume and glass price declined slightly. In March, panel maker utilization increased, and we expect our volume in the second quarter to increase significantly from the first quarter.\nAs conditions continue to improve, we're optimistic the panel maker utilization is beginning to move beyond correction levels and little return to more normal levels in the coming quarters. In Optical Communications, sales declined 6% sequentially.\nOur pricing actions partially offset a greater-than-normal seasonal volume decline in connectivity solutions, which is associated with the pacing of several large customer projects. Our pricing and productivity actions resulted in net income improving 22% sequentially despite the lower sales.\nGovernment commitments to connect the unconnected are contributing to robust cable and fiber demand, and we continue to advance our leadership. Last month, we officially opened an optical cable manufacturing campus in North Carolina to help provide U.S. network operators with the cable they need to bring high-speed optical connectivity to underserved communities, particularly in rural America. Commerce Secretary, Gina Raimondo said, \"It is past time that every American be connected with affordable Internet no matter where they live. We could not do it without the folks at Corning. We wouldn't have the fiber, the innovation or the cable.\"\nFinally, in Environmental Technologies, we saw increased adoption of gasoline particulate filters in the quarter, which helped drive a 9% sequential improvement in sales despite the languishing car market. Net income grew 19% in the segment based on our productivity actions and growing sales.\nTo sum up the short term, we're seeing improvement in some of our markets, but a series of challenges continues to ripple across the global economy. Nevertheless, we expect to grow sequentially in the second quarter and to improve our key financial metrics.\nFor the back half of the year, I'd be disappointed if we didn't grow from second quarter levels. Longer term, we will continue to innovate and capture growth opportunities as they materialize. We're energized about Corning's future. And I'd like to review some of the reasons why. It all starts with our focused and cohesive portfolio.\nWe maintain clear leadership in three core technologies, and four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms that are viable to solving a broad range of significant challenges in shaping to industries. We apply new combinations of our assets and capabilities to advance important secular trends in tandem with our customers.\nAnd by reapplying and repurposing our insights and assets across multiple opportunities in markets, we increase our profitability. In Optical Communications, we've been leading in the industry for more than 50 years. This business is the most fully evolved example of Corning's focused portfolio using all three of our core technologies and four of our manufacturing and engineering platforms. And we will continue to apply these capabilities to help build the more connected world over the next 50 years.\nIn display, by leveraging all three of our core technologies and evolving our fusion platform, we have achieved large scale and broad capabilities that have advanced our leadership position. As our customers evolve, we're helping them create a world with richer and more lifeline in ubiquitous displays. In mobile consumer electronics, we invented the cover glass category and redefine it by integrating glass with ceramics and by combining fusion with vapor depiction.\nWe continue to advance the state-of-the-art with our leading cover materials, which have been deployed on more than 8 billion devices to date. And we've recently entered new product categories that provide opportunities for more of our content. For example, the camera lens covers on devices like the Samsung Galaxy S22 and S23 series. These advancements are excellent examples of our more Corning approach.\nWe're also innovating in emerging technologies like augmented reality bendable devices, which we expect to contribute to long-term growth. In automotive, we're helping build the world where vehicles are increasingly green and where software and displays are enabling new and vehicle experiences.\nOur inventions are enabling industry leaders to meet stringent upcoming EU7 emissions regulations and achieve near 0 emissions levels. And we're collaborating with LG Electronics, a global technology and vehicle component solutions innovator to advance in-car connectivity.\nOverall, we're helping to solve more and more of our customers' challenges in design, connectivity and autonomy. And at CES, we continue to generate strong industry excitement about how our technical glass and optics capabilities can expand the boundaries of what's possible.\nFinally, in Life Sciences, we're using Corning's core glass and optical physics technologies along with our expertise in vapor deposition, precision forming and extrusion to help support the discovery and delivery of new medicines, including biological treatments, that are personalized, effective and safe.\nSo as you can see, our investments in distinctive capabilities have placed us at the center of secular trends putting many facets of baseline. And we believe we will continue to develop category defining products to transform industries and enhance labs.\nI'm also excited by our growth opportunities in the renewable energy industry, where I believe we can make significant additional contributions to a sustainable U.S.-based solar supply chain. We're proud to make the world here is still a little bit better wherever we can, and that extends to all of our stakeholders, especially in these uncertain times.\nWe recently released our DE&I and sustainability reports, which capture the great progress we've made and underscore our commitment to helping move the world forward.\nSo as I wrap up my remarks, here is what I'd like to [indiscernible] today. Moving forward throughout 2023, we'll continue to focus on operating each of our business as well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment, including aligning our cost structure to the demand environment.\nAt the same time, we're advancing growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive long-term success. We remain well positioned to continue capturing a very rich set of long-term opportunities that we've built across our market access platforms. I look forward to updating you on our progress.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed, so he can get into the details of our financial priorities, along with our results and outlook. Ed?\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Morning, everyone. For the first quarter, we delivered results at the higher end of our expectations. Sales were $3.4 billion and EPS was $0.41. Gross margin was 35.2% and operating margin was 15.5%, both meaningful improvements from the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow for the quarter was negative $383 million.\nThe first quarter is typically negative due to cash flow cyclicality. This quarter, free cash flow was also impacted by lower sales, reflecting the recession-level demand we saw several of our markets and overall weakness in China.\nLooking forward, we expect positive free cash flow starting in the second quarter and for the remainder of 2023. Overall, our team demonstrated operational rigor during the quarter. We continue to make progress on improving our profitability by raising prices to help offset inflation and by adjusting our productivity ratios closer to historical levels, and we will continue to align our cost structure to successfully weather the demand environment.\nWe remain confident in our relevance to long-term secular trends and our more Corning approach, and we are well positioned to capture durable profitable growth as the global economy improves. Now let's turn to our first quarter segment results.\nIn Optical Communications, sales were $1.1 billion, down 6% sequentially as price increases partially offset a greater-than-normal seasonal volume decline associated with the pacing of customer projects.\nDespite the decline in sales, net income grew 22% sequentially to $159 million, primarily driven by pricing in productivity actions taken in late 2022. We continue to believe the industry's underlying growth drivers are intact.\nLong-term demand for optical networks is strongly supported by trends in computation and by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect beyond connected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population. We're pursuing three significant secular trends: Broadband, 5G and the cloud. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category, and our connectivity solutions offer economic advantages for a broader range of customers than ever before.\nDisplay technology sales in the first quarter were $763 million, down 3% sequentially as both volume and glass price declined slightly. Net income was $160 million, down 6% sequentially on lower sales. On our last call, I updated you on panel maker utilization dynamics.\nAt the beginning of Q4, utilization began to increase from its low point, but it leveled off in December due to pandemic-related disruptions in China. And in January, the disruptions persisted driving utilization back down and below retail demand.\nSubsequently, conditions in China improved. In March, panel makers increased their utilization. And as a result, our volume increased from January and February levels. We're expecting panel makers to run at higher utilization levels in the second quarter than they did in the first quarter. And therefore, we anticipate our sequential glass volume to increase significantly. Favorable pricing is primarily driven by two factors.\nThe first factor is the improving [ glass ] flash supply and demand balance. Glass makers have been taking additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs. As we've noted previously, we are taking this opportunity to upgrade our fleet with our latest technology, and we're actively managing the timing of tank restarts to align our supply to demand.\nThe second factor is glassmakers profitability. In Q4, our two major competitors reported net losses, reinforcing our view that it is challenging for glassmakers who have high costs to remain profitable at current pricing levels.\nMoving to Specialty Materials. Demand for our long lead time semiconductor equipment products remains strong. However, smartphone and IT end market demand remains weak. First quarter sales were $406 million, down 20% sequentially, consistent with typical seasonality. Net income was $39 million, down sequentially due to the lower sales. We expect the continued adoption of our latest glass innovations such as Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and the introduction of new glass formulations in the second half of 2023 to help offset continued softness in the smartphone and IT markets.\nAdditionally, we believe that new innovation opportunities and emerging technologies like augmented reality and bendable devices will contribute to long-term growth. Environmental Technologies, first quarter sales were $431 million.\nWe saw increased GPF adoption in the quarter, which helped drive a 9% sequential improvement in sales. Net income increased 19% sequentially, driven by higher sales and improved productivity.\nWe are not projecting a recovery in the automotive market in the second quarter and our current view of the full year is that auto sales remain below pre-pandemic levels, but our content-driven growth strategy continues to help us outperform the market.\nTurning to Life Sciences. First quarter sales were $256 million, down 13% sequentially, driven by lower demand for COVID-related products and the impact customers drawing down their inventory. Net income was $9 million, driven by lower sales and our actions to reduce production levels in the quarter.\nLet me take a minute to describe the market dynamics impacting this business and what we expect for the year. In 2021 and the first half of 2022, growth was largely driven by pandemic-related demand and customers over ordered due to supply chain challenges.\nPandemic-related demand began tapering in the second half of 2022 and the industry was left with elevated inventory levels. We expect our sales and profitability to improve as the industry corrects, and we restore productivity ratios back to pre-pandemic models. Finally, in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses, sales in the first quarter were $386 million, up year-over-year and down sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally lower volumes in semiconductor polysilicon. Net income increased sequentially.\nWe are seeing continued strong demand for solar-grade polysilicon to meet the need for a transparent, sustainable and traceable solar supply chain in the U.S. market. And we continue to see strong growth in automotive glass solutions and additional opportunities in pharmaceutical technologies.\nNow let's turn to our outlook. For the second quarter, we expect total company sales to grow sequentially led by display as the industry continues to recover. We're not planning on strong second quarter sales sequential sales improvements in optical communications, web sciences or specialty materials.\nTurning to profitability. We expect to build on our progress from the first quarter and further improved profitability driven by our efforts to offset inflation and return productivity ratios to historical levels. We expect sales in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion and EPS in the range of $0.42 to $0.49. And free cash flow will improve strongly due to normal cyclicality and higher sales. And as I said earlier, we expect positive free cash flow in the second quarter.\nThe most likely case for the second half is that sales and earnings increase versus the second quarter. Although it's too early to be definitive, given continued global economic uncertainty, and its impact on consumer demand and infrastructure spending.\nI'd also like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. We prioritize organic growth through research and development and capital expenditures. The investment opportunities we target generate a 20% ROIC or greater.\nWe expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be slightly lower than 2022. We are also prioritizing rewarding shareholders with our excess cash in two ways: First is dividends, which we've raised for 13 years in a row. Second is share buybacks. We bought back about 5% of our outstanding shares in 2021, and we'll continue to be opportunistic. Preserving the financial strength of the company is always a top priority. We maintain a strong balance sheet that provides appropriate durability and flexibility.\nAnd I'm proud to say Corning maintained one of the longest debt tenants in the S&P 500. Our average maturity is about 25 years with no significant debt [indiscernible] in any given you. In some the actions we are taking position us to come out of this period of uncertainty, financially strong and well positioned for a return to growth. Now I'd like to wrap up with a few key takeaways.\nIn the second quarter, we expect sales, profitability and cash generation to improve, driven by our profit improvement actions, cost controls, and continued recovery in display technologies.\nWe're executing a highly disciplined approach to our investment decisions while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're particularly focused on aligning our cost structure to the demand environment while maintaining the flexibility to address changing market conditions and capture upside as it occurs.\nOur long-term growth drivers all remain intact, and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends such as those playing out in the optical communications and solar markets. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nDivision Vice President, Investor Relations, Corning, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Hey, operator, we are ready for our first question."

(Operator Instructions) It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Crystal, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.\nYou should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments are related to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nFor the fourth quarter, the difference between GAAP and core EPS stemmed primarily from restructuring charges as well as noncash mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and foreign debt. In total, these increased core earnings in the fourth quarter by $256 million. As a reminder, the mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.\nA reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, and we encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman & CEO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. Throughout the year, a series of pandemic-driven effects continued to ripple across the global economy. Nevertheless, we executed well to grow sales and advanced strategic initiatives, while addressing the implications that the current environment poses for margins and cash generation.\nFor the fourth quarter, sales of $3.6 billion and EPS of $0.47 were both at the high end of our guided range. And for the full year, building on our strong 2021, we grew sales by 5% to $14.8 billion and EPS by 1% to $2.09. Gross margin was 36%. Free cash flow was $1.24 billion.\nI'm pleased with the sales growth we continue to deliver, despite confronting what is essentially recession level demand in markets that constitute about half of our sales. Cars, televisions, smartphones, laptops and tablets are all well below what we estimate as the normal range.\nNow we've offset this weak consumer demand with the strength of our positions in the growing optical communications and solar markets as well as ongoing outperformance by our businesses versus our end markets. That said, profitability and free cash flow are not where we need them to be.\nSo I'd like to deviate from our usual format for these calls, in which I focus on our progress across our market access platforms. Today, I want to give you some insight and perspective on the external dynamics driving our financial results, and I'll discuss what we're doing to address those dynamics.\nSince 2020, the external environment has been characterized by the sweeping impact of the pandemic, including supply chain disruptions, depressed productivity, large swings in consumer spending and inflation. When the pandemic hit, our core priorities were protecting our people and delivering for our customers.\nSo throughout 2022, we operated with elevated staffing and higher-than-normal inventory levels. In addition, persistent and sometimes quite unpredictable, inflation added to the cost of raw materials we purchased, the cost to produce and ship our products and the inventory we maintained. As a result, our growth in profitability and cash flow have lagged our sales growth.\nWhile we took action to improve profitability and cash generation throughout 2022 and made good progress during the first half of the year, it became clear that more was needed. So we took additional and significant actions in the fourth quarter, including raising prices, again, in optical communications and life sciences to more appropriately share the inflationary cost with our customers.\nAdjusting our productivity ratios to get closer to historical metrics without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth and normalizing inventory. Because our productivity and supply chains have improved, in the near term, we expect to maintain reliable supply for our customers at current inventory levels or below. Now all of these actions will improve our margins and cash flow throughout 2023.\nNow as you may have already inferred from our press release this morning, we expect both first quarter sales and profitability to be anomalous from a historical perspective. Typically, our first quarter sales declined about 5% sequentially and margins declined about 1 to 2 points. This year, we expect first quarter sales to decline by more than normal seasonality. In contrast, we expect our margins to increase sequentially due to the benefits of our recent actions.\nWhat's driving our below seasonal outlook for the first quarter sales is the situation unfolding in China, where consumer sentiment was already low. In December, China shifted its approach to the pandemic and a significant wave of COVID outbreaks ensued. This resulted in lower consumer spending and workforce shortages, which have, in turn, impact the demand for our products as well, particularly in Display, Environmental and Specialty Materials. We expect China to overcome these issues and demand to improve, but it's too early to call the specific timing of improvements in consumer sentiments and demand. We'll keep you posted as we learn more.\nIn the interim, we continue to be well positioned to capture growth and drive innovation. And as our sales grow, we expect to benefit from operating leverage and our profitability to improve further. Given -- I think it's too early to call the rebound in China, it's difficult to be definitive on our full year results. Here's what I can say.\nFirst, our quarter 1 sales are not an indication of our 2023 run rate. Second, I'd be disappointed if sales didn't grow sequentially in the second quarter, and we didn't see year-over-year growth in the second half. Finally, the benefits of our fourth quarter profit and cash flow actions will be significant throughout 2023. As we see consumer demand return and our revenues increase, we expect to see our profitability increase.\nNow having shared our near-term perspective, I want to underscore how great we feel about our focused portfolio and long-term prospects. As we evaluate our trajectory, given the uncertainties, and there are a lot of them, one thing that is certain is the relevance of our leadership capabilities to secular trends. Across each of our markets, we are capturing a compelling set of long-term growth opportunities with more to come.\nIn Optical Communications, we're building on a record $5 billion 2022. And we believe we are still in the early phases of a multiyear build cycle driven by broadband, 5G densification and cloud computing. Cable and fiber demand remains especially robust. If we could make more, we could sell more.\nIn solar, we continue to capture significant upside tied to growth in the renewable energy industry, and we see excellent growth potential as we contribute to a sustainable U.S.-based solar supply chain and benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. In display, we maintained stable price and a very strong market position throughout the ongoing industry correction. We expect to emerge from the correction with strengthened customer relationships of refreshed manufacturing fleet and increasing sales and profit.\nIn mobile consumer electronics, we anticipate ongoing strong adoption of our innovations, and we expect to continue outperforming the markets we serve through our product leadership, our more Corning approach and our ongoing collaboration with industry leaders.\nMoving to automotive. We've been outperforming the market throughout a period of industry constraint. We remain focused on building our $100 per car content opportunity, and we're pleased by our progress as evidenced by our strong growth in Automotive Glass Solutions in 2022. And we'll be ready to capture even more growth as adoption of our technology continues and car sales return.\nFinally, in Life Sciences, we're focused on delivering differentiated tools to support the discovery and delivery of cell-based medicines and modern drugs. Our operations are improving as the industry completes its correction from the unprecedented demand shifts caused by COVID.\nSo now I've gone through the macro uncertainty that characterizes the near term, and I've told you what we're doing to deal with those uncertainties. I also outlined the rich set of growth opportunities we're capturing over the long term. And I believe our progress so far is a testament to what we can achieve going forward.\nLet's take a look back at the 2020 to 2023 strategy and growth framework that we introduced in 2019, shortly before the onset of the pandemic. Our goals included sales growth at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. From 2019 through 2022, we grew at greater than 8% CAGR, even in the face of the ongoing and universally experienced external challenges.\nOver the past 4 years, we've advanced significant strategic initiatives. We delivered key fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions to meet surging demand and facilitate a period of strong growth in optical communications. We delivered on our gasoline particulate filter content opportunity in automotive, and we introduced ceramic shield with Apple, both of which have driven strong outperformance versus depressed end markets.\nWe [ran] our Gen 10.5 plants to extend our leadership in the glass for large televisions, and we made major progress on our emerging innovations. We gained significant traction in our Automotive Glass Solutions business, and our pharmaceutical packaging portfolio leaped forward to play a central role in the global health fight over the past 3 years. Our vials and tubing have supported the delivery now of more than 8 billion COVID-19 doses in more than 50 countries.\nIn sum, we've delivered multiyear sales growth in a challenging environment. We've extended our leadership position across our markets, and we have paved the way for future growth. I think these are outstanding achievements.\nNow as I wrap up my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. Since the start of the pandemic, we protected our people and, as evidenced in our sales growth, delivered for our customers. We've now completed significant additional actions to improve our profitability and cash generation.\nThe unfolding situation in China certainly impacts our sales in the short term. But despite this, we expect to see the benefits of these recent pricing and productivity actions take hold in the first quarter.\nOverall, we will continue to focus on operating each of our business as well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment, while simultaneously advancing growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive success as the global economy stabilizes. Our focused and cohesive portfolio provides strategic resilience that is evident in our results even in the current environment. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver durable, multiyear growth with improved margins and cash generation.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed so he can get into the details of our financial priorities, along with our results and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. Building on last year's strong performance, we grew full year sales 5% to $14.8 billion and EPS 1% to $2.09. We outperformed our consumer-facing end markets, we continue to capture growth in solar and we delivered record sales of $5 billion in optical communications. In total, we had a solid year, and our results reflect our resilience in the face of ongoing external challenges.\nAs you heard from Wendell, our profitability and cash flow have lagged our strong sales growth. To address this, we took further actions, including raising prices again in Optical Communications and Life Sciences to more appropriately share the inflationary costs with our customers, adjusting our productivity ratios closer to historical metrics without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth and reducing inventory by $115 million in the fourth quarter. We will start to see the benefits of these actions in the first quarter despite suppressed sales from the disruption and low consumer sentiment in China that Wendell described.\nWith that, I will turn to our fourth quarter performance. Sales in the fourth quarter were $3.6 billion and EPS was $0.47, both coming in at the high end of our guidance. Fourth quarter gross margin was 34%, down 250 basis points sequentially. And operating margin was 14%, down 290 basis points sequentially, both including the impact of reducing inventory. EPS was favorably impacted by $0.03 due to a tax adjustment. Through the third quarter, our estimated tax rate was 20.5%. Our actual 2022 tax rate was 19.3%. The required adjustment resulted in an unusually low 15% core tax rate in the fourth quarter.\nNow let's take a closer look at our segment results for the fourth quarter and full year, beginning with Optical Communications. Fourth quarter sales were $1.2 billion, down $122 million sequentially, reflecting the slower pacing of customer projects that we discussed on our last call. Net income was $130 million, down $53 million sequentially on lower volume and the impact of reducing inventory. The strength of the first 3 quarters of 2022 drove annual sales to an all-time high of $5 billion, reflecting a 15% increase, while net income grew 20% year-over-year to $661 million.\nMoving to Display. On our last call, we said we believed panel maker utilization had reached bottom in September, but it was too early to call the timing or the shape of the recovery. We were then very encouraged to see panel maker utilization levels climbed in October and then again in November, indicating a recovery had begun. However, in December, China reopened and a significant wave of COVID outbreaks ensued, panel maker utilization leveled off in December and has since decreased in January. We believe that panel maker utilization will resume its recovery.\nIn January, panel makers are operating below the current reduced rate of demand. I'll cover more on our Display outlook in a moment. Display sales in the fourth quarter grew 14% sequentially to $783 million. Net income was $171 million, up 28% sequentially on strong execution and the additional volume. Fourth quarter glass price was consistent with the third quarter as expected. For the full year, sales were $3.3 billion and net income was $769 million, both down year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the industry correction in the second half. Glass price for the full year was consistent with 2021.\nWe anticipate glass price in the first quarter of '23 to be consistent with the fourth quarter, and we expect the favorable glass pricing environment we experienced over the last few years to continue, driven by 2 factors: first, glass makers continue to align supply to demand. Corning and other glass makers have been taking additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness. As we've told you before, we are taking this opportunity to upgrade our fleet with the latest technology, and we are actively managing the timing of tank restarts to align our supply to demand.\nAnother factor is glassmakers profitability. It is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during this period of low volume and high inflation. We have maintained stable price and market position through this industry correction and as demonstrated in the fourth quarter when the market recovers, incrementals from our increased volume will be meaningful.\nIn Specialty Materials, fourth quarter sales of $505 million were down 3%, but we outperformed our markets driven by customer product launches and continued strong demand for premium glasses and advanced optics products. Full year sales were $2 billion, flat year-over-year. Gorilla Glass sales were down 5%, outperforming the smartphone market, which was down 11% and IT market, which was down 15%. Advanced Optics grew sales 12% driven by the strength of our next-generation semiconductor equipment materials.\nFull year net income was $340 million, down 8% year-over-year due to continued investment in next-generation materials for consumer electronics and semiconductor equipment as well as new markets, such as bendable devices and augmented reality.\nIn Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $394 million, up 12% year-over-year. And net income was $69 million, up 28% year-over-year. Sequentially, fourth quarter sales were down 7%, impacted by a decline in China OEM production levels in December, driven by similar COVID dynamics I mentioned in Display.\nFull year sales of $1.6 billion were flat versus 2021 as light and heavy-duty markets in China remain weak and global auto market growth was restricted. Net income for the full year increased 9% to $292 million as we improved our productivity and raised prices.\nTurning to Life Sciences. Fourth quarter sales were $294 million, down sequentially and year-over-year, impacted by lower demand for COVID-related products. Fourth quarter net income was down, driven by lower sales and the impact of reducing inventory.\nFull year sales of $1.2 billion were consistent with a strong 2021, while net income was $153 million, down 21% as the unexpected shift in demand away from COVID-related products led to a significantly lower productivity in our manufacturing operations.\nAnd finally, in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses, sales in the fourth quarter were $462 million, up 22% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. And full year sales were $1.7 billion, up 34% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for polysilicon as we continue to see robust demand for both semiconductor and solar grade polysilicon. We also saw strong growth in Automotive Glass Solutions and Pharmaceutical Technologies.\nTo close out my segment recap, we're pleased that our more Corning approach and secular trends in optical and solar enabled us to grow sales and outperform our markets.\nTurning to our outlook. We maintain an attractive long-term trajectory and are well positioned to capture growth. Looking at the near term, typically, in the first quarter, our sales declined about 5% sequentially and margins declined about 1 to 2 points. This quarter, we expect a sequential sales decline of 6% to 11%. In contrast, with the recent price and productivity actions we've taken, we expect about a 1- to 2-point margin improvement in the first quarter.\nIn total, for the quarter, we anticipate core sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion and EPS in the range of $0.35 to $0.42. Our first quarter sales outlook reflects the current dynamics in China since COVID restrictions were lifted in December. The situation has impacted consumer sentiment and labor availability, which is playing out across some of the industries we serve.\nFor example, in Display, as I mentioned, we saw panel maker utilization decline in January back to October levels. With that, we now believe the display industry recovery has been delayed by at least a quarter. And in environmental, we expect the lower OEM production levels we saw in December to remain in the first quarter.\nWe will have a better feel for the situation in China after the Lunar New Year, and we'll share more with you as we go through the quarter. As a reminder, the first quarter is usually our lowest volume quarter of the year. So we expect sales to grow sequentially in the second quarter. And I'll also note that we expect 2023 full year capital expenditures to be consistent with 2022.\nBefore I close, I want to cover 2 other topics. First, I want to take a minute to address currency exchange rates. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and protect shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is the Japanese yen.\nAs we've previously shared with investors, we have most of 2023 hedged. We now also have most of 2024 hedged. We expect to keep our core rate at 1-0-7, at least through the end of 2024. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.\nSecond, as CFO, in addition to investing for organic growth, my top priorities include maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet and returning excess cash to shareholders. Examples include creating one of the longest debt tenors in the S&P 500. Our current average debt maturity is 25 years, with only $1 billion in debt coming due in the next 5 years and no significant debt coming due in any given year. And our interest rate exposure is very low because essentially all our debt instruments are fixed rate.\nAdditionally, over the last 4 years, we have consistently returned excess cash to shareholders even throughout the pandemic, and one of the ways we do that is through dividends. We have grown our dividend 35% since 2019, and we have increased our dividend for 12 consecutive years. Our dividend yield is top quartile in the S&P 500 at 3%. As we enter 2023, we will recommend that our Board approve an increase in the quarterly dividend, raising the annual rate from $1.08 to $1.12 per share.\nStepping back, our long-term growth drivers all remain intact. As markets recover, sales growth will resume and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends, such as optical and solar. In the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we grew our sales 5% in 2022 and delivered a CAGR of greater than 8% since 2019. We have adapted to meet near-term needs, taking actions throughout this period. And while our profitability and cash flow have been impacted, we expect to see the benefits of additional actions we took in Q4, in our Q1 results and throughout the year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions)\nIt is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's Q3 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Weeks\n\nChairman & CEO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported solid third quarter results that demonstrate strong execution. We continue to operate each of our business as well and our focus on leadership and distinctive capabilities allow us to capitalize on important secular trends and drive our More Corning approach. Sales were $3.7 billion, up slightly versus a strong third quarter last year, and EPS was $0.51. We were able to offset a sales decline in display technologies with growth in optical communications and solar. While we believe that display panel maker production bottomed in September, we would like to see additional positive evidence before guiding a significant recovery in glass demand.\nIn total, we performed well despite the economic environment.\nBefore we get into the details, I wanted to set some context on what we're facing across our markets. On our last call, we told you that end markets in multiple businesses were down. A smartphone sales in the second quarter declined 8% year-over-year, panel maker utilization in June 2022 was at its lowest level since 2009. And yearly, automotive production was 10 million to 15 million vehicles below its pre-COVID rate.\nSeveral of these dynamics continued or even intensified in the third quarter. A smartphone unit sales declined 14% year-over-year in the quarter, with tablet and notebook demand down 17%. Panel maker utilization decreased even further from its June level with September being the lowest month of the quarter and annual automotive production is still 10 million to 15 million cars short due to continued component shortages.\nNevertheless, we delivered results within our guidance range and expectations. We continue to benefit from infrastructure investments in broadband and clean energy, two secular trends we're strategically positioned to address. We delivered 16% year-over-year growth in Optical Communications, and we captured ongoing demand in the solar market, which contributed to 33% year-over-year growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses.\nSo let's take a deeper look. What we're seeing in some of our key markets, how we're responding. And why we're confident that our strategy continues to position us to deliver profitable multiyear growth. I'll start with display. In the third quarter, the glass market and our volume both decreased almost 25% sequentially and which significantly reduced our sales and profitability. In September, panel maker utilization reached the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008.\nMore than a year ago, we said we expected a correction in the display industry during 2022. In the second quarter, panel makers began reducing production levels with accelerated reductions in June. In the third quarter, panel maker production reached an even lower level. And we believe that panel maker production reached the bottom in September.\nSo now the question is, when will the glass market recover? Now our answer is that we would like to see additional positive evidence before we guide a robust recovery in glass demand. We've maintained stable price and market position during this whole correction. Consequently, we expect our volume and profitability to increase sharply when panel maker utilization rebounds and we expect to exit the correction with strengthened customer relationships and importantly, a refreshed manufacturing fleet. As always, we will keep you informed as we progress.\nOverall, we feel very good about our execution in display. In mobile consumer electronics, customer product launches and strength in semiconductor drove sequential growth in Specialty Materials. As I noted, smartphone and IT retail unit sales declined significantly in the quarter. We now expect smartphones to be down about 12% for the year. And we expect notebook and tablet demand to decline 15%. We expect the year-over-year decline in smartphones, notebooks and tablets to be greater in the second half than in the first half. This will limit the growth we normally see in our second half sales relative to the first half.\nNow that said, we continue to outperform the market through our product leadership, our more Corning approach and our ongoing collaboration with industry leaders.\nOver the long term, our content strategy in mobile consumer electronics will help us grow. As we continue to develop and launch premium glasses and optical treatments,for existing and new form factors.\nAdditionally, we're executing our more Corning approach in the semiconductor industry. In July, Senator, Chuck Schumer and New York Governor, Kathy Hochul, joined us to announce government funding that supports an expansion of our advanced optics facilities, which made equipment and materials vital to semiconductor manufacturing. Of course, semiconductors are fundamental to virtually all technology we interact with today. We've helped advance the industry for more than 50 years, and our expansion will keep us well positioned to support nearly every step of the chip manufacturing process and to respond to new customer needs, including products for EUV technology.\nLet's turn to automotive. In Environmental Technologies, we delivered sales and profit growth despite the constraints on vehicle production, and we're outperforming the market for the year. We continue to adjust our operations to effectively navigate the variability in auto production and we are prepared to meet demand when industry production increases to normal rates.\nWe're also generating significant wins in our Automotive Glass Solutions business. Pull is strong for our technical glass and optics innovations.\nDuring the quarter, CarUX, a leading car display company owned by Innolux, announced its use of our patented cold-form technology to help drive the future of auto interior displays. Corning continues to be well positioned to further grow its automotive business as the industry offers more advanced, designed-oriented cabins and enhanced driver assistance features.\nLet's move to Optical Communications, which was the largest contributor to third quarter sales. The industry continues to experience a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks, and we continue to increase our capacity to support this growth.\nIn August, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, joined AT&T CEO, John Stankey, and me to announce a new manufacturing facility in Arizona. You may recall Secretary Raimondo's leadership helped pass infrastructure legislation dedicated to the idea of Internet for all. Our new plant will boost optical cable capacity to meet record demand.\nIn September, we opened a new optical fiber manufacturing plant in Poland to serve committed demand. And we're innovating to support every phase of broadband deployment as network access is increasingly viewed as a fundamental human right.\nIn the quarter, we announced additions to our Evolv connectivity portfolio which helps operators streamline permitting, accelerate field installation and optimize network testing. Optical sales have grown 22% and for the first 3 quarters of the year, setting us up for another strong year of growth. However, we expect fourth quarter sales to be down sequentially due to the timing of customer projects.\nTurning to solar. The renewable energy industry is evolving rapidly, and our ongoing growth continues to indicate that the market's behavior is more closely tied to a global imperative than the current economic trends. We reenergized our participation in the solar market by starting up idle capacity and securing customer commitments through new long-term take-or-pay contracts for solar grade polysilicon. Third quarter sales grew significantly year-over-year, and we will benefit from the state of Michigan's infrastructure investment program, which will help us expand operations to meet increasing global demand for polysilicon. We believe that Corning's broader technical and manufacturing capabilities, our 3 and 4, will prove to be highly relevant and helping advance the renewable energy industry, and we see excellent growth potential in solar.\nNow as I conclude my remarks, here's what I'd like to leave you with today. We remain very well positioned to deliver profitable multiyear growth and we'll continue to execute with discipline. We'll invest where we see strength and will pace to meet demand. Our cohesive and focused portfolio provides strategic resilience that is playing out well in this current environment. We've established a deep relevance to secular trends along with the ability to drive more content into our markets over time. We've been leading in the automotive and life science markets for 100 years, display for 80 years, telecommunication for 50 and mobile consumer electronics since the inception of smart devices.\nThe basis of our ongoing success is our distinctive set of capabilities and long track record of life-changing and even life-saving inventions.\nIn the past, what enables us to power through moments like the present while maintaining an attractive long-term growth trajectory.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThanks, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by emphasizing that we're executing well in a challenging environment. Our performance in the third quarter was a proof point of the inherent balance of our cohesive portfolio and the fact that our More Corning approach is working. We're built to be resilient even in a downturn.\nNow let's look at our financial results for the third quarter. Sales were $3.7 billion, up 1% from a strong third quarter in 2021. Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses all delivered year-over-year growth.\nIn September, Display Technologies experienced the lowest panel maker utilization levels since 2008, resulting in a 28% year-over-year decline in sales for the segment in the third quarter.\nIn Specialty Materials, we outperformed the smartphone market, which was down double digits year-over-year.\nTurning to profitability. Gross margin was 36.1% and operating margin was 16.9%, down sequentially 140 and 190 basis points, respectively, driven by the lower volume in display technologies.\nIn the third quarter, free cash flow was $255 million, and year-to-date, it was $866 million, keeping us on pace for another year of healthy cash generation. And despite the challenging environment during the quarter, we were able to offset significantly lower volume in display technologies, and we outperformed our underlying markets overall.\nNow let's turn to the segment results. In Optical Communications, sales grew 16% year-over-year, reaching $1.3 billion. Our year-over-year growth was driven by network operator investments in 5G, broadband and the cloud. Net income was $183 million, up 32% and year-over-year, driven by leverage from strong incremental volume. Passive Optical Networks continue to experience a large multiyear wave of growth. We believe that this demand is strongly supported by private and public infrastructure investments to help connect the unconnected and bring broadband to a much larger share of the population. We continue to secure customer commitments, and we're investing to appropriately scale production to serve our incremental demand from current and new customers. And we're also taking further pricing actions to more appropriately shared recent cost increases in energy and certain raw materials with our customers.\nAs we've mentioned in the past, this business can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, and you'll see that play out in the fourth quarter as we expect optical sales to be down sequentially based on the timing of customer projects.\nNow moving to Display. As we updated you in September, panel makers reduced their production levels below our already low expectations. The lower volume resulted in display sales declining 28% year-over-year and 22% sequentially, and we saw a 46% year-over-year and 41% sequential decline in net income due to the high fixed cost nature of glass manufacturing. In the third quarter, glass price was once again consistent sequentially. And we believe the glass pricing environment will remain favorable and factors that continue to drive that favorable pricing include glass supply-demand balance as panel makers reduce production, Corning and other glass makers took additional tanks offline for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness.\nAnd we're also taking this opportunity to upgrade some of our fleet with our latest technology which enables us to reduce cost and extend the life of new tanks.\nAs we continue to work through these upgrades, we are actively managing restarts to align our supply to demand.\nAnother factor is glass maker profitability. It is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during periods of low volume and the current inflationary environment amplifies that challenge. We expect fourth quarter glass prices to be consistent with the third quarter and glass prices to be stable or up in subsequent quarters.\nSo overall, we continue to operate from a position of strength in the display market. And as Wendell noted, while we believe that panel maker utilization reached the bottom in September, we would like to see more evidence before we got a significant recovery in glass demand. But when glass demand grows, we expect our volume to increase and our profitability to improve.\nIn Specialty Materials, the market for smartphones was down 14% and tablets and notebooks were down 17%. We outperformed the market with sales down only 7% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for premium glasses, and strength in semiconductor materials. Third quarter sales were up 7% sequentially, driven by demand for our premium cover materials to support customer product launches.\nAnd adding to our resilience in the segment, Advanced Optics delivered record sales for the second quarter in a row, and we are bringing additional capacity online at our facilities in Fairport and Canton, New York.\nNet income for the segment was $96 million, down 10% year-over-year due to lower volume and continued development expense related to next-generation products. The weakness in the smartphone tablet and notebook markets intensified in the quarter, and we expect fourth quarter sales and profitability to be down sequentially and year-over-year.\nLong term, we expect to outperform the market as we continue to develop and launch new premium glasses and optical treatments.\nTurning to Environmental Technologies. In the third quarter, sales were $425 million, up 10% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. The Automotive production improved from a very low second quarter as China demand recovered after second quarter COVID lockdowns. However, vehicle production remains constrained due to the continued component shortages.\nIn addition to our sales growth, we improved profitability with net income up 45% year-over-year. Our content-driven strategy is working, gasoline particulate filters remain a critical component of that strategy, driving revenue even in a weakened market. Our next-generation filters are now shipping to customers as emission standards reach near 0 levels and require enhanced filtration performance.\nIn Life Sciences, sales were $312 million, consistent sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. Lower demand for COVID-related products was offset by growth in research products. Net income was $43 million. We continue to commercialize innovations, including the new cell and gene therapy production platform. And looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth in both research and bio process.\nFinally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth businesses, sales were $407 million, up 33% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. We continue to see increased demand for semiconductor grade polysilicon and strong demand for solar materials, and we continue to ramp solar capacity and sign up new customers with long-term take-or-pay contracts.\nIn September, Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies announced that it was awarded $104 million in additional funding from BARDA to support our planned capacity expansion for advanced, high-quality pharmaceutical glass tubing and vials. These expansions are designed to help the health care industry rapidly scale manufacturing to address current and future public health challenges.\nNow I want to take a minute to talk about currency exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has been strengthening over the past year. As a reminder, we have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect our cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and provide shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is the yen, and we have most of next year hedged. We expect our core rate to remain the same in 2023.\nWe're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.\nNow let's turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect sales in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.65 billion and EPS in the range of $0.41 to $0.47.\nNow our fourth quarter guidance reflects several factors. In Optical Communications, pacing of customer projects will impact sales for the quarter. In Specialty Materials, we expect a sequential decline driven by lower demand in the smartphone, notebook and tablet markets. And of course, the biggest element in our guidance is Display. As I noted, we do not yet have enough positive evidence to guide significant improvement in glass demand from September levels. We expect free cash flow to be strong in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.\nNow I'd like to wrap up with a few key takeaways. As I noted at the opening of my remarks, we're executing well. And because of our inherent balance of our cohesive portfolio and our More Corning approach, we're built to be resilient even in a downturn as evidenced by the performance of Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies this quarter. Our long-term growth drivers all remain intact, and we're well positioned to continue capturing growth tied to key secular trends such as Optical Communications and solar.\nIn the meantime, we will continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and employ a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation. Given the external environment, we're taking actions to preserve profitability, tightly manage capital expenditures and prioritize cash flow.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThanks, Ed. Crystal, we're ready for the first question."

(Operator Instructions). It is my pleasure to introduce to you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's Q2 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that followed in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nFor the second quarter, the largest difference between GAAP and core results stems from nonmarket noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. This increased GAAP earnings in Q2 by $203 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. They're also available on our website for downloading.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman & CEO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong second quarter results. We captured additional content opportunities across our markets despite an extremely challenging external environment, and we delivered on growing demand in Optical and Solar. Sales were $3.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.57, up 8% year-over-year.\nFree cash flow was $440 million, and total first half free cash flow was $611 million. Gross margin and operating margin expanded 90 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, from the first quarter 2022 levels.\nNow our improved profitability was primarily driven by the benefits of pricing actions that we took to more appropriately share the impact of inflation with our customers. In total, we delivered in line with our expectations even though dynamics in 3 of our largest markets played out at the lower end of our assumptions.\nIn the last month of the quarter, panel maker utilization rates declined to the lowest levels since the first quarter of 2009 when we were at the height of the financial crisis. Auto production continued significantly below normal with virtually no cars sold in Shanghai in April due to COVID-19 restrictions and with European new car registrations for June at the lowest levels since 1996.\nIn the second quarter, smartphone sales declined 11% year-over-year, primarily stemming from COVID lockdowns in China. In the face of these industry dynamics, we delivered outstanding results in line with our guidance. We did what we said we were going to do, including continued growth and improved profitability. We view the resilience we've demonstrated as a strong proof point that our strategy is working.\nIn the third quarter, we expect the challenges in these 3 markets to continue. At the same time, we expect an ongoing benefit from secular trends in Optical and Solar. Both factors are reflected in our guidance. We now expect third quarter sales to be roughly consistent sequentially and to grow year-over-year.\nWe expect full year sales to slightly exceed $15 billion and to grow in a range of 6% to 8%. Now Ed will elaborate more in just a moment.\nNow with that in mind, I want to expand on our path to $15 billion and look at the dynamics playing out in 4 critical markets: Display, Optical Communications, Solar and Mobile Consumer Electronics. And I'll address what we're experiencing, how it is reflected in our financials and how we're driving outperformance.\nLet's start with Display. We are executing well against our strategy. We have been updating you on the panel maker utilization correction for a year now. Panel makers accelerated reductions in the second quarter. The sharpest reduction was in June, and our volume declined in line with panel maker utilization and the market. We expect June's low production level to continue throughout the entire third quarter and our volume to again decline in line with the market.\nOur guidance reflects our view of panel makers second half production, and we expect our second half volume to be lower than the first half. At the same time, we have always said we expect to maintain price stability through this correction. That is exactly what happened in the second quarter. As expected, price was up sequentially, and we expect third quarter price to be consistent with the second quarter.\nAs panel makers lower utilization, we are seeing glass makers idle their tanks to perform maintenance and repairs and thereby lower capacity. We are managing our own tank repairs and restarts to align our supply to demand after running flat out for a very, very long time. As a result, we expect glass supply and demand to remain in balance. We feel good about our execution and strategy in display as we continue to operate from a position of strength. We are the industry leader with a global manufacturing footprint, cost advantages, distinctive capabilities and leadership in Gen 10.5 where we are well positioned to capture long-term growth in large-sized TVs.\nLet's move to Optical Communications, which was the largest contributor to our second quarter growth. We believe the industry is at the beginning of a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks, and we're well positioned to capture that growth. We're pursuing 3 significant secular trends: broadband, 5G and the cloud. We've got major innovation programs underway for each category, and we're seeing robust traction with our customers.\nMomentum continues to build in this business. And you can see this in our financials. Second quarter sales grew 10% sequentially, faster than we expected, and 22% year-over-year to reach $1.3 billion. And we expect to grow year-over-year again in the third quarter and even faster than the market for the full year due to growing demand for our innovations. Take, for example, our edge preengineered systems for cloud operators.\nNow this product had its biggest quarter-to-date in the second quarter. These solutions, much like FlexNAP for broadband, provide customers with a simpler greener solution that minimizes the number of cables, cable trays and hardware needed.\nThe simple value prop is speed. We're helping get capacity installed much faster, eliminating labor bottlenecks in the industry. Our innovative manufacturing process, which completes splicing at a fraction of the cost and a much higher quality, dramatically reduces on-site labor. So we're accelerating our customers' ability to scale their networks and build cloud capacity, all while driving more Corning solutions into the market.\nOur visibility and confidence in the adoption of edge products is high because network planning decisions happen well ahead of deployment and we are winning now.\nTurning to Solar. The renewable energy industry is evolving rapidly. And our ongoing growth suggests that the market's behavior is more closely tied to a global imperative than simply current economic trends. We recently reenergized our participation in the solar market by turning on idle capacity and securing customer commitments through new long-term take-or-pay contracts for solar-grade polysilicon. In the quarter, sales grew significantly, which is reflected in our top line growth.\nLooking ahead, we believe that Corning's broader technical and manufacturing capabilities, R3 and R4, will prove highly relevant in helping advance the industry. We expect year-over-year growth to continue in the second half, and we see excellent growth potential in this business.\nIn Mobile Consumer Electronics, smartphone and IT retail unit sales were down. However, we're outperforming in this market through our more Corning approach, product leadership and ongoing collaboration with true industry leaders. The benefits of our strategy are evident in our results. Specialty Materials sales were consistent with the strong second quarter of 2021. And net income grew 12% year-over-year. We expect to deliver growth in the back half in this down market as customers adopt our innovations for their product launches.\nOverall, Corning is executing very well commercially and technically. Despite all the temporary macro challenges, we delivered a solid quarter. We've added more than $700 million in sales in the first half, reflecting an increase of more than 10% year-over-year. And EPS has grown even faster, up 14% in the same time period from $0.97 to $1.11. So, you can see that strong secular growth in Optical and Solar and our more Corning approach is offsetting weakness in the display, automotive and mobile consumer electronics markets.\nWe expect to continue performing well in a challenging environment to close out another strong year. Our cohesive and focused portfolio provides us with a strategic resilience that is playing out well in the current environment and will serve us well in the future.\nStepping back, we've been leading in the automotive and life science markets for 100 years, display for 80 years, telecommunications for 50 and mobile consumer electronics since the inception of smart devices. The basis of our ongoing success is our distinctive set of capabilities and long track record of life-changing and life-saving inventions. Now this is particularly important in times like the present.\nWe've made great progress building a more balanced and resilient company. We are structured to and focused on outperforming our markets consistently. Corning's deep relevance to secular trends along with our ability to drive more content into our markets over time will enable us to maintain our strength through this economic downturn and emerge stronger on the other side.\nAs we look to both the immediate future and longer term, we're confident that our investments in our focused and cohesive portfolio together with our financial discipline will help us drive durable, profitable, multiyear growth. In fact, our R&d engine has never been stronger and a new generation of distinguished leaders has stepped up to drive us through our next exciting period of transformation.\nThis quarter, we appointed Dr. Jaymin Amin as our Chief Technology Officer. A 25-year Corning veteran, Jaymin has worked with some of the company's most influential and innovative customers on groundbreaking advancements, including his work launching and commercializing Gorilla Glass Jaymin's leadership, technical expertise and experience with Corning's scientific capabilities will help take us to the next level of innovation.\nI'd also like to thank David Morris. I deeply appreciate his leadership and contributions over the years as one of our most accomplished technology leaders. He received his Ph.D. from MIT when he was only 23 years old. And he retired last month after nearly 50 years with the company. David has created a strong foundation that Jaymin will continue to build on, adding my confidence that Corning's greatest contributions are yet to come.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to preface my remarks today with 3 key takeaways on the quarter. We're executing well and successfully navigating the current environment. We're driving top line growth, improved profitability and strong cash flow with high single-digit year-over-year sales and EPS growth. And we're employing a highly disciplined approach toward investing for the long term. With that said, let's walk through the details on the quarter.\nTotal company sales reached nearly $3.8 billion, growing 7% year-over-year. Highlights included sales growth of more than 20% in Optical and strong growth in Solar. We met our goal of improving gross margin and operating margin sequentially, driven by previously announced pricing actions across the organization. Gross margin grew 90 basis points and operating margin grew 120 basis points.\nNet income was $489 million, up 7% year-over-year. And EPS was $0.57, which represents an 8% increase year-over-year. We generated $440 million of free cash flow in the quarter, keeping the company on pace for another year of strong cash generation. And we invested $353 million in CapEx.\nI'd also like to comment on the impact of currency. We have actively hedged our foreign currency exposure over the past decade. This serves as an effective tool to reduce earnings volatility, protect cash flow, enhance our ability to invest and provide shareholder returns. Our largest exposure is to the yen, which has been weakening. We have most of next year hedged, and we expect our core rate to remain the same in 2023. We're pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We've received more than $2 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the operational rigor our teams displayed during the quarter. We successfully raised prices to more appropriately share the impact of higher inflation with our customers. we successfully navigated extended COVID-19 lockdowns in China, a sharp correction in panel maker utilization in the display market, lower demand for smartphones and an additional temporary step down in China automotive production. And we're capitalizing on our market leadership and strong secular growth in Optical and Solar.\nSecond quarter results reflect the benefits of our focused and cohesive portfolio, particularly the balance it provides.\nNow let's go through the segments. In Optical Communications, sales grew 22% year-over-year reaching $1.3 billion for the second quarter. Year-over-year sales growth was driven by 5G, broadband and the cloud. Net income was $182 million, up 23% year-over-year primarily driven by strong volume and price increases. We believe we're in the early phases of a multiyear build cycle across multiple segments in the passive optical market. We're responding to this demand by ramping up production and opening new facilities. As always, we de-risk these investments by requiring meaningful commitments from customers, often including funding before beginning construction.\nIn the second quarter, Display Technology sales were $878 million, down 8% sequentially. Panel makers have been reducing their utilization rates for the last few quarters. In June, we saw a significant decline in panel maker production versus April and May. And our volume declined in line with this change and the market. Importantly, glass price was up slightly sequentially. This, coupled with solid execution, resulted in net income declining 3% sequentially, less than half the sales decline.\nIn the third quarter, we expect June's low panel maker production levels to continue and our volume to decline in line with the market and lower average utilization, resulting in our glass volume down mid-teens sequentially. We expect third quarter glass price to be consistent with the second quarter.\nThe factors we use to assess the pricing environment in the display glass market continue to support a favorable pricing environment. First is glass supply-demand balance. Currently, glass makers are taking tanks off-line for maintenance and repairs after an extended period of glass tightness. We are actively managing tank repairs and restarts to align our supply to demand. These actions result in lower glass capacity in the market. Additionally, after running flat out for so long, we need to replenish our inventory towards optimal levels to reduce excess logistics costs.\nAnd lastly, glass maker profitability also supports favorable pricing. In this inflationary environment, it is challenging for glass makers who have high fixed costs to maintain profitability during periods of low volume. Additionally, our customers depend on us for our market-leading supply reliability, enabling us to build on our strong competitive position. So overall, we feel good about our execution against our goal to stabilize returns in display. The pricing environment is stable. We have maintained our pricing, and when volume returns, our sales and profitability will improve.\nIn Specialty Materials, sales were consistent with a strong second quarter 2021. Net income was $91 million, up 12% year-over-year. We achieved these results despite the smartphone and IT markets being down. Our more Corning approach, product leadership and ongoing collaboration with industry leaders are enabling our outperformance in this market. Specifically, we maintained revenue and profitability driven by the adoption of our premium cover materials.\nWe also continue to benefit from the strength of the semiconductor equipment industry. In fact, we expect to see continued investments in the industry to meet rapidly growing demand and to support increased stability in the supply chain. To ensure we are prepared to capture growth, we just announced an expansion of our advanced optics operations in New York State. And as Wendell mentioned, we expect Specialty Materials sales growth in the back half driven by customer product launches.\nIn Environmental Technologies, second quarter auto production experienced constraints due to prolonged chip shortages, the Russia-Ukraine war and COVID-19 lockdowns in China. As a result, second quarter sales were $356 million, down 13% both sequentially and year-over-year. In the automotive industry, this will be the third year in a row production has been unable to meet end market demand. Since 2019, auto markets have declined around 16%.\nIn contrast, we have outperformed the market and our sales were up about 5% over the same period. We're pursuing content opportunities that generate sales beyond end market demand, such as additional adoption of GPFs in new regions. We expect an uptick in sales in the third quarter, driven primarily by a resumption of auto production in China following COVID lockdowns. We remain prepared to serve demand globally as supply constraints ease and auto production increases.\nIn Life Sciences, sales of $312 million remained consistent year-over-year and sequentially, and net income of $37 million was down. Lower demand for COVID-related products was offset by growth in research and bioproduction products. Additionally, COVID lockdowns in China impacted sales and profitability. Looking ahead, we expect to see continued growth in research and bioproduction, and we're well positioned to meet that demand with recent capacity investments designed to improve efficiency and enable us to better support global customers.\nFinally, in Hemlock and emerging growth businesses, sales reached $418 million, a 45% increase year-over-year and an 11% increase sequentially. This strong performance was largely driven by our production ramp to meet new long-term solar take-or-pay contracts.\nDuring the quarter, Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies also contributed to strong sales as we saw continued adoption of our pharmaceutical packaging solutions for critical drugs. And Automotive Glass Solutions delivered year-over-year growth as well. During the quarter, Continental recognized the business as one of its suppliers of the year for our auto-grade Corning Gorilla Glass technology, another proof point on our progress toward a $100 per car opportunity.\nIn sum, the multiple growth drivers and our market leadership across our portfolio create an inherent resiliency that enables us to consistently outperform our markets.\nNow turning to our outlook. For the third quarter, we expect sales roughly consistent with the second quarter in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.85 billion. We expect continued strong sales in Optical Communications, Hemlock's solar products and specialty materials to offset lower display volume, which is expected to be down mid-teens from the second quarter as I noted earlier. We expect EPS in the range of $0.51 to $0.55 for the third quarter. While we expect the benefits of our pricing actions to continue, the lower volume in display will impact profitability.\nOur most likely outcome for the full year is to slightly exceed $15 billion in sales as we shared with you in April. We now expect sales to be up 6% to 8%, and we expect to grow EPS in line with sales. Our guidance factors in a range of probabilities for the market challenges that we've outlined this morning.\nAs I wrap up my remarks today, I'll end it by saying we're very pleased with the results of the quarter and the first half of the year. We're growing profitably. And we remain highly disciplined in our approach to investment decisions while maintaining a strong balance sheet and delivering solid free cash flow. This gives us the ability and flexibility to address evolving market conditions. We're also expanding capacity to support committed customer demand, all while carefully monitoring the external environment to pace appropriately. We're confident in the many levers at our disposal to manage through any environment and come out the other side stronger while advancing our long-term growth initiatives.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A."

Quarter 2021 Earnings Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nIt is my pleasure to introduce you to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Catherine, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ed Schlesinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business.\nFor the first quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stem from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and noncash impairment charges. With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this increased GAAP earnings in the first quarter by $138 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.\nOur currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP record results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides.\nWe've received more than $1.9 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception almost 10 years ago. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading. And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman & CEO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. We're off to an outstanding start in 2022 with strong first quarter sales and improved profitability. Sales grew 15% over the first quarter of 2021 to $3.7 billion. EPS increased 20% year-over-year to $0.54. Free cash flow was $171 million. We saw broad-based strength across our businesses and we effectively navigated a complex geopolitical and external operating environment. Gross margin of 36.6% and operating margin of 17.6%, both expanded sequentially and year-over-year. The improvements were primarily driven by benefits of pricing actions across all our businesses.\nHistorically, prices are usually down in the first quarter. However, as I told you last quarter, we negotiated with customers to increase prices in our long-term contracts to share increased cost more appropriately. And therefore, this year, price in total was up both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect price to be up again in the second quarter. Specifically in display, we achieved a slight price increase in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect price to be up slightly sequentially in glass supply and demand to remain tight. You'll hear more from Ed on the display market and our outlook.\nNow let's take a closer look at how we performed in each of our market access platforms. In Display, we continue to operate from a position of strength. We delivered 11% year-over-year sales and net income growth, driven by higher glass volume and slightly higher price. In Optical Communications, we grew sales 28% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, representing 32% and of total sales. Optical Communications is our largest market access platform by sales, and we expect significant growth to continue. Operators are expanding their networks while the pace of data center construction is accelerating and fiber-rich wireless deployments are underway. We continue to be energized by the momentum that is building in this business, and we're well positioned to capture growth.\nIn mobile consumer electronics, Specialty Materials outperformed the market with year-over-year sales growth of 9%, driven by significant demand for our premium cover materials and Advanced Optics products. In Automotive, our environmental technology sales declined year-over-year due to customer production constraints. However, we continue to outperform the market. Sales were up in our Automotive Glass business, and I'll talk more about that in a minute.\nIn Life Sciences, we grew year-over-year, advanced key innovations for cell and gene therapy and expanded supply of glass vials and tubing. Based on the quarter and our expectation of continued strong demand, we are raising our sales expectations for the year to above $15 billion.\nOur results speak for themselves. We've been delivering consistent growth with more balanced contributions across the company. And you'll hear more about that from Ed in just a minute. So how do we do this? Our strong position stems from a complementary set of 3 core technologies, 4 proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms and 5 market access platforms. We're leaders in each. We captured growth opportunities by combining, integrating and evolving these capabilities to help our customers drive their industries forward. And in so doing, we drive more Corning content into the products people are already buying.\nNow we typically spend the majority of our time discussing the results within our 5 segments. However, important growth opportunities for our more Corning strategy also reside in the segment, we have historically referred to as other. To better reflect the significant contributions and potential of these initiatives, we've renamed it, Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. This segment grew 38% year-over-year in the first quarter. So today, I want to spend some time talking about what's going on and how it underscores our confidence that we will continue to deliver durable, multiyear profitable growth.\nHemlock currently delivers most of the sales in this segment. Hemlock manufacturers ultra-pure polysilicon for the semiconductor and solar industries. As a reminder, Corning owns 80.5% of Hemlock as a result of Hemlock's purchase of DuPont's ownership in the company in 2020. Now this was a great transaction for Corning. We didn't put any money into the transaction, and we gained an additional 40% interest in Hemlock's strong semiconductor business that also has the upside potential reflected in the solar market. Recently, we secured multiyear take-or-pay commitments for solar, and we expect demand to grow. Additionally, as the renewable energy industry evolves, we believe that Corning's technical and manufacturing capabilities, [our] 3 and 4 can provide significant benefits. We believe this business has excellent growth potential.\nThe other 2 major contributors in this segment are Automotive Glass and pharmaceutical glass packaging. And we're making good progress on these 2 large opportunities. And both are prime examples of our focused and cohesive portfolio in action. So let's take a look at how we reapply and reuse our capabilities to drive ongoing value, starting with Automotive Glass. There's no denying it. The driving experience is rapidly evolving. Drivers want more connected and autonomous features. And the basis of competition is moving from the engine to the cabin. Automakers are responding to these trends. Car design is getting less analog and more digital. Fewer buttons and more large screens with touch capability.\nNearly universally, the solution is more glass. And as automakers address the opportunities and the challenges they face, they're looking for glass to provide both form and function. To meet their needs, we've reapplied our existing capabilities, expertise and experience in the automotive market. We started with the fusion jaw assets that provide pristine flat glass in our display and mobile consumer electronics market access platforms, and we took insight from Gorilla Glass to create better, more sustainable products that offer superior economics and help our customers advance the transformation of their industry.\nPull for our technical glass products is strongest in auto interiors. We've answered with auto-grade Gorilla Glass. It provides our signature toughness and optics tailored for the automotive use case to bring the smartphone experience into the car. We've also developed and patented ColdForm technology. By removing heat from the glass shaping process, ColdForm improved yields, saves money and ultimately delivers a better, more sustainable product at a lower cost than hot-form glass.\nIt enables dashboard and console displays that follow the natural curves of the car's interior protected by a single thin piece of precision glass. Our customers can bend the glass to suit their design needs right at the end of their own display module assembly.\nLooking ahead, we continue to pursue multiple opportunities for our interior and exterior glass innovations. We've entered a new product category with our Curved Mirror Solutions for head-up displays. And we're providing Gorilla Glass to Jeep's iconic Wrangler and Gladiator.\nWe're also working on OLED lighting. And we're in the early stages of delivering glass solutions for the sensors that are critical for autonomous vehicles. What this all adds up to is an increasingly significant business created by applying our More Corning approach. Our Automotive Glass Solutions business is helping us capture $100 per car opportunity. We've already been awarded over $1 billion of multiyear business across multiple manufacturers and numerous car makes and models, and we're confident in our growth trajectory as we continue to build on this exciting opportunity.\nNow let's look at another key emerging growth business. We drew on our glass science capabilities to develop a pharmaceutical packaging solution with both exceptional strength and enhanced chemical stability relative to incumbent borosilicate vials.\nBorosilicate glass is inherently prone to issues such as delamination. Shifting to an alumina-silica base eliminates this risk and optimizes vials for our ion exchange process. As with the auto example that I just shared, we applied our experience making tough damage-resistant glass to the pharmaceutical vial market. And we drew on our deep relationships and years of experience in the Life Sciences market to deepen our understanding of customers' problems and collaborate very closely on our solution.\nWe started with glass tubing and then applied our expertise in extrusion and precision forming to convert the glass into vials. And we leveraged our experience in vapor deposition to apply a coating that helps vials travel more quickly through the drug filling process. The result was Valor Glass, and I think it's fair to say that this is a product no one else in the world could have invented. Last fall, we expanded our portfolio by unpacking the Valor technology stack to launch a new product that helps address supply chain challenges. Our new Velocity Vials use already approved packaging with a patented coating. Velocity is helping drug makers increase efficiency and throughput to drive faster manufacturing of vaccines and other medications to help meet significant global demand.\nToday, our solutions are clearly showing their strength. Our portfolio of vials and tubing has enabled the delivery of 5.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and demand continues to be strong. In the first quarter, our vial production was up more than 150% versus 2021, and our tubing production is expected to increase more than 25% this year as we ramp capacity.\nWe also recently announced a new long-term supply and development agreement with West Pharmaceutical to enable advanced injectable drug packaging and delivery systems for the pharmaceutical industry. This partnership is designed to help speed the commercialization phase for biologic drug developers by avoiding costly, time-intensive barriers, so they can successfully bring important new drug discoveries to market faster.\nIn total, we're helping to create a future for pharmaceutical manufacturing that offers higher quality, greater efficiency and better sustainability. Stepping back, I think you can see why our customers value our capabilities. We provide unique solutions to move industries forward, all while making the world just a little bit better. Because of this, we're able to thrive in up and down markets. Combined with the measures we're taking to improve margins, we're confident in our ability to drive long-term profitable growth.\nNow as I conclude my remarks, I'll leave you with a final thought. The confluence of the consequential events that we're experiencing today and the need to operate effectively to serve our stakeholders has required that we all embrace creative new ways of doing business. And at Corning, our values are evident in our actions. We outlined much of our progress in our 2021 sustainability and DE&I reports, which published last month. And this quarter, we built on our success through actions, including financial support for humanitarian efforts in the Ukraine and surrounding countries. And continued progress on the greenhouse gas goals we announced at the end of last year.\nI'm excited about the year ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress. Now let me turn the call over to Ed, who will share more details on our results, financial priorities and outlook.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell. Good morning, everyone. I want to begin today by saying how encouraged and energized I am by the way our company is performing. We've started 2022 from a position of strength. We are successfully navigating against a complex external operating environment. We're confident in our ability to deliver on a short and long-term profitable growth opportunities to create compelling value for shareholders.\nStarting with the short term, we had an extremely strong quarter, commercially, operationally and financially. We delivered year-over-year top and bottom-line growth, and we improved margins as our pricing actions began to take hold. Total company sales surpassed $3.7 billion, growing 15% year-over-year, highlighted by a nearly 30% increase in Optical sales, a slight increase in Display glass prices and continued demand for Hemlock solar materials.\nNet income for the quarter was $465 million, up 16% year-over-year and EPS was $0.54, up 20% year-over-year, both growing at a faster rate than sales. We generated $171 million in free cash flow in the quarter and we are on track for another strong year of cash generation. In terms of capital deployment, we invested $383 million in CapEx.\nWe declared a quarterly dividend of $0.27, which reflects the 12.5% increase announced in January, and we repurchased approximately $150 million of outstanding shares. Taking a closer look at profitability. First quarter gross margin expanded 10 basis points sequentially, and 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the benefits of our pricing actions. Typically, aggregate price for the company and gross margin percent declined sequentially in the first quarter. This year, both increased as we took price actions across all businesses. Additionally, first quarter operating margin expanded 140 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points year-over-year.\nAs we've previously discussed, we continue to experience increases in key input costs. We are tackling these challenges on multiple fronts. We're leveraging relationships with our suppliers to secure favorable long-term raw material pricing, our strategic approach to manufacture in region and to co-locate with customers has helped to shield us from some of the elevated freight and logistics costs. And most importantly, we are increasing price to more appropriately share rising costs of raw materials. We will continue our focus on these unusual costs as well as our normal rigorous cost reduction efforts. Combined with our pricing actions, we expect our gross margin percent to improve from the first quarter.\nI'm proud of the operational rigor our teams continue to apply and deliver. We're navigating with discipline and agility while capitalizing on our strong market positions, and we see the benefits in our improving profitability. With that background, let's take a closer look at our segment results.\nIn Optical Communications, sales grew 28% year-over-year, reaching $1.2 billion for the first quarter as network operators increased capital spending. Net income was $166 million, up 50% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Corning continues to outpace the passive Optical market and capture growth which is driven by increased spending on 5G and broadband projects, along with the accelerated pace of data center builds as applications rapidly move to the cloud.\nLooking ahead, we continue to see strong demand for our Optical communication solutions. We believe the industry is at the beginning of a large multiyear wave of growth for passive Optical networks. Project momentum is strong across our customer base and as the broadband equity access and deployment program rolls out, it could add as much as $1 billion a year to our market for 4 years starting as early as 2023. We believe that the combination of private network and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth over the next few years and that our solutions provide advantages particularly lower labor requirements for customers.\nIn Display, sales grew 11% year-over-year to $959 million. Net income was $236 million, also up 11% year-over-year.\nSequentially, the price for Display glass was up slightly. As we have previously discussed, the Display industry is driven by 3 main factors: retail demand, panel makers' production and glass makers' ability to supply panel makers. We continue to expect that glass at retail will grow in 2022 and by a high single-digit percentage, driven by average screen size growth and TV unit growth. Over the last several months, panel makers have been reducing their capacity utilization rate. We expect additional utilization reductions in the second quarter, and we've reflected that expectation in our guidance.\nNevertheless, -- similar to quarter 1, we expect second quarter price to be up slightly sequentially and glass supply and demand to remain tight. Two factors add to glass supply-demand tightness. First, over the last 18 months, we have extended tanks beyond their design life to support customer demand. Second, we have completely depleted our inventory leading to higher logistics costs and missed opportunities. So we plan to shut down end-of-life tanks, upgrade to the latest technology and begin to replenish our inventory levels to ensure excellent service for our customers. We feel good about our outlook for 2022. We've completed long-term share agreements that cover well over 90% of our planned volume for the year. In 2022, overall, we expect glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable.\nIn total, we're very pleased with Display's performance, and we're operating from a position of strength. In Specialty Materials, sales grew 9% year-over-year to $493 million. Net income was $75 million, down 18% year-over-year. This sales growth was driven by our More Corning strategy. Take the Samsung Galaxy S22 series, for example. Our cover materials are on the front and back of these devices, including all 5 rear cameras on the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Also, we continue to benefit from the strength of our new-to-the-world materials. Apple's iPhone 13 launch and legacy product lines like the iPhone 12, which features ceramic shield resulted in increased premium glass sales year-over-year.\nIn the quarter, investments in innovations that are moving towards commercialization resulted in lower net income versus first quarter 2021. We expect growth to accelerate and profitability to improve throughout the year as we introduce new innovations and capture more content per device. In the first quarter, Environmental Technology sales declined 7% year-over-year due to automaker production constraints. Net income was $74 million, consistent with 2021. The auto industry has been experiencing variability from ongoing shortages of chips, components and raw materials.\nAs a result, Auto production has been paced by component availability versus consumer demand. Once these constraints are relieved, automakers will be able to increase production to satisfy pent-up vehicle demand and we would expect significant sales growth from current levels.\nMoving to Life Sciences. Sales increased 3% year-over-year to $310 million. Net income was $42 million, down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by COVID-related operational challenges in the first half of the quarter, which impacted our output. We expect growth going forward with strong demand for our products and production output increasing over first quarter levels.\nFinally, in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, sales increased 38% year-over-year to $375 million, primarily driven by strong performance at Hemlock as we continue to see increased demand for solar materials. Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies also contributed to year-over-year growth. Our portfolio of vials and tubing has enabled the delivery of 5.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines. And Automotive Glass Solutions grew year-over-year as well.\nThe company has been awarded more than $1 billion of business from multiple manufacturers and numerous car makes and models. In summary, we grew organic sales $500 million this quarter on a year-over-year basis, we are growing faster than our end markets driven by our More Corning strategy. And as we look ahead, we're confident that our content-driven strategy will continue to create outperformance and growth.\nNow let's talk about our outlook for the second quarter and how we're viewing the year. For the second quarter, we expect $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion in sales with EPS of $0.54 to $0.59. We expect benefits from pricing actions to accelerate in the quarter. And this guidance reflects our view of the most probable outcomes of potential COVID-19 lockdowns in China.\nFor the full year, we're now expecting to exceed $15 billion in sales with growth at a high single-digit percentage. We expect EPS to grow up to a few percentage points faster than sales and gross margin to expand from the first quarter, and we anticipate another year of strong free cash flow in 2022.\nOur priorities for capital allocation remain the same: investing in profitable growth opportunities across our market access platforms, extending our leadership and rewarding our shareholders. We expect our return on invested capital to increase as we continue to reuse and repurpose assets, secure customer commitments and deliver on high ROIC projects. We're continuing to build a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver multiyear consistent and profitable growth.\nNow as I wrap up my formal remarks, I'd like to leave you with a few key highlights. We're off to a great start in Q1. And we see strong demand across all our businesses, and our pricing actions are beginning to take hold with more coming in the second quarter. In Display, we achieved a slight price increase in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect price to be up slightly sequentially and glass supply and demand to remain tight.\nWe expect Q2 sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion and EPS to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.59. And our guidance reflects our view of the most probable outcomes of potential COVID-19 lockdowns in China. We have an incredible set of opportunities across all of our market access platforms. For example, we see multiyear double-digit growth in Optical. Adding mobile consumer electronics, we have an exciting innovations in our pipeline that will deliver growth in the second half of this year and beyond.\nIn total, we're a stronger and more balanced company today than we were even 5 years ago. And we are focused on commercial and operational execution to achieve broad-based profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ann for Q&A.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you. Catherine, we're ready for our first question."

(Operator Instructions) It is my pleasure to introduce you, Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Shannon, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Corning's Quarter 4 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer; and Ed Schlesinger, currently serving as Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller.\nI'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.\nYou should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. For the fourth quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stem from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and noncash impairment charges.\nWith respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt set in future periods to be marked to market, and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.

You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast. We encourage you to follow along. They're also available on our website for downloading.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.\n\nWendell P. Weeks\n\nChairman & CEO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. We delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year growth. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We generated EPS of $0.54 and free cash flow of $425 million. For the full year, sales were $14.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year. We generated EPS of $2.07, up 49% year-over-year, and we nearly doubled free cash flow. In addition, we achieved double-digit ROIC, we expanded our operating margin by 230 basis points, we increased our dividend by 9% and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% through the resumption of share repurchases.\nBy leveraging our fundamental capabilities and our more Corning strategy, we are capturing a compelling set of short and long-term opportunities across our portfolio. We are performing well in a challenging environment, and we have momentum entering the year.\nNow all of that said, our gross margin is simply not where it should be. As we said last quarter, throughout the pandemic, we have prioritized protecting our people and delivering for our customers in a complex inflationary environment, and it has come at a cost. Over the last several months, we have negotiated with customers to increase prices in our long-term contracts to more appropriately share the increased cost we are experiencing. We are focused on expanding our gross margin and expect improvement in 2022 as our sales growth and our price actions take hold throughout the year.\nLast quarter, we also discussed our expectations for our Display business. I am pleased to report we had another strong quarter of Display revenues and profits in quarter 4. Display glass pricing is expected to be flat sequentially in the first quarter. The supply-demand balance for Display glass is tight. In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable.\nThis morning, you'll hear more on these and other priorities for 2022, our focus on how we intend to maintain our growth and positive momentum, that Tony and Ed will discuss our results as well as our plan to enhance our profitability and overall, financial strength. So let's dive in.\nWe've been delivering consistent growth. Sales have been up for 6 quarters in a row. Since 2019, we've grown sales by 21% and EPS by 18%, with more balanced and consistent contributions across our businesses. Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. We're the world leader in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics along with our four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms.\nWe focus our strategy on capturing synergies among these capabilities and applying them to create disruptive innovations. Across multiple industries, we work closely with many of the most influential and successful companies to bring our world-leading capabilities to bear on their toughest challenges. In the process, we help move the world forward.\nAs we partner with our customers to advance their visions, our probability of success increases as we combine our capabilities, reapply our talent and repurpose existing assets. This provides a powerful value creation lever by unlocking new ways to integrate more of our content into our customers' ecosystems. We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. We're driving more Corning content into the products they're already buying. Our progress in 2021 illustrates the effectiveness of our approach, and it gives us confidence that we're building on a strong foundation for additional growth in 2022.\nIn Optical Communications, we've returned to growth with sales up 22% in 2021, and we expect strong growth to continue. Operators are expanding network capacity, capability and access. The pace of data center construction is accelerating as more applications move to the cloud and data creation continues to soar and fiber-rich wireless deployments are underway.\nMeanwhile, governments around the world are initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband to more people in more places as network access is increasingly viewed as a human right. For example, the recently passed U.S. Infrastructure bill allocates $65 billion in new spending for broadband infrastructure, including $42 billion for new network builds. Our customers are stating their preferences for fiber to build these networks.\nAs the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, Corning plays a vital role in driving the continued expansion of connectivity. We're working even more closely with industry players at the regional and national levels, including expanding our long-time collaboration with AT&T.\nStepping back. We're at the beginning of a large multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks. Project momentum is strong across our customer base. And as U.S. infrastructure plans roll out, it could add as much as $1 billion a year to the market for 4 years, starting as early as 2023. We believe private carrier and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth over the next few years.\nIn Life Sciences, we're delivering growth on multiple fronts with sales up 24% in 2021. We're seeing ongoing demand and support of a global pandemic response. Our inventions are also helping the industry advance the transition to cell in Chief gene-based therapies. And we're making progress on our multibillion dollar content opportunity in our pharmaceutical packaging business.\nAfter introducing Valor glass vials in 2017, we recently introduced Velocity vials. These vials are helping industry-leading drug makers increase efficiency and throughput to drive faster manufacturing of vaccines to help meet global demand. Velocity joins Valor and our glass team business as we build a comprehensive end-to-end pharmaceutical packaging portfolio. In fact, our portfolio has enabled the delivery of nearly 5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far. And earlier this week, West Pharmaceutical Services, a global leader in injectable drug administration, announced a long-term supply agreement and technology investment in Corning to enhance injectable drug packaging systems.\nIn Automotive, 2021 sales in our Environmental Technologies segment increased 16% to reach an all-time high $1.6 billion despite weakness in the automotive market related to chip shortages. We're pursuing a $100 per car content opportunity driven by trends that are reshaping the auto industry and reimagining the car. We delivered multiple proof points in 2021.\nDaimler launched the Hyperscreen dashboard display in the Mercedes-Benz EQS. The display features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly 5 feet wide. Building on this momentum, we entered a new automotive product category with our curved mirror solutions. This innovation is enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's electric crossover, the Ionic 5. And Jeep announced a product that brings our tough technical glass into their iconic vehicles. The new Jeep performance parts windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory installed option on the Wrangler and Gladiator.\nAdditionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. Our newest generation of gasoline particulate filters help vehicles including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate tailpipe emissions. The contributions of our GPF business provide a strong illustration of our more Corning strategy in action. Since 2017, Environmental Technologies sales have increased more than 40% -- global car sales had decreased by 20%.\nLet's turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics, where 2021 sales increased 7%, and we surpassed the $2 billion in sales for the first time. Since 2016, specialty Materials has added nearly $900 million on a base of $1.1 billion in a smartphone market that has been flat to down. As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, more of our content is deployed in each device sold. That is another great illustration of more Corning in action.\nOur industry-leading innovations continued to garner widespread accolades. In fact, SaaS company named Corning the most innovative company in the consumer electronics category for 2021, touting Ceramic Shield, the world's first transparent and color-free glass ceramic as virtually indestructible and recognizing Gorilla Glass Victus as the toughest Gorilla Glass yet. We continue to see strong demand for both of these premium products.\nIn 2021, more than 125 devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets and laptops, launched featuring Gorilla Glass. And we expanded our capabilities into a new category by introducing Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ to optimize mobile phone cameras. These composite products create an attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device.\nFinally, in 2021, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing fund. To date, Corning has received $495 million in total from Apple's fund. We're investing in multiple new inventions and innovations for mobile consumer electronics, and we're excited about the potential in 2022 and beyond.\nTurning to Display. Our leadership in large glass puts us in a position of strength. 2021 sales grew 17% to $3.7 billion. Our volume exceeded glass market growth as we ramp Gen 10.5 facilities that supply glass for large-sized TVs, which are expected to grow at a high teens compound annual growth rate over the next several years. In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced, and the pricing environment to remain favorable. We continue to believe the retail market will grow, led by higher TV unit sales and growth in average screen size.\nAcross our markets, long-term growth drivers are strong, and our role is clear, we lead in capabilities that are vital to progress. Our approach provides exciting opportunities for Corning inventions to make a positive impact on the world. And it underscores our commitment to moving the world forward in everything that we do.\nNow let me give you some examples outside of the operational context. In 2021, we hosted COVID-19 vaccination clinics at Corning sites around the world. In Reynosa, Mexico, for example, we helped administer more than 100,000 doses of vaccines and boosters to employees and community members. And we provided more than 200,000 diagnostic tests for employees around the world. We kicked off a 5-year $5.5 million partnership with the nation's largest historically black university, North Carolina A&T. Our work will prepare students for STEM careers.\nWe engaged our Board of Directors to provide guidance and resources to our office of racial equality and social unity, utilizing our members' diverse experience, gender, age and ethnicity to advance this new initiative. We achieved gender pay equity globally for all salaried employees, and we expanded the reach of DE&I office with regional business counsels.\nAnd finally, we committed to greenhouse gas goals that align with the Paris agreement. And we signed solar contracts at Hemlock that will help the world address its renewable energy goals. I feel very good about our efforts to bolster equality inside and outside the company and our progress on our sustainability initiatives.\nOverall, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company. We're in the early innings of exciting industry transformations and key trends are converging around our capabilities. You can see it in our results, you can see it in our outlook for 2022 and advancement of new businesses towards significant commercial sales over the next few years.\nOf course, to keep advancing during Corning's next 170 years, we must focus on growing and developing our leaders. We have a new generation who are stepping up to guide this company to a very exciting phase of its history and into the future, and I'm working closely with each of them. To that end, I want to recognize Tony as he prepares to hand over the reins to Ed in just a few weeks. The strong position we're in today certainly reflects the many contributions he's made throughout more than 3 decades of excellent service to Corning. Tony, we thank you and wish you the very best in retirement.\nAt the same time, I'm excited to welcome Ed into the CFO role, which he starts on February 18. Ed has long played a key role in the growth and financial strength of our company. Tony and I have worked closely with him during that time, and I look forward to the important contributions he will make in this new position.\nSo let me turn the call over to Tony and Ed, who will share more details on our results, our priorities and our outlook for 2022.\n\nR. Tony Tripeny\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Corning Incorporated\n\nThank you, Wendell, and good morning, everyone. Our growth initiatives are succeeding, and we delivered another quarter of excellent year-over-year growth that capped off a truly exceptional year.\nFor the full year, sales increased 23% and EPS was up 49%. All of our segments grew with 4 out of 5 increasing sales by a double-digit percentage. It was a strong year, even compared to prepandemic levels. Since 2019, we have grown sales by 21% and EPS by 18%. We nearly doubled free cash flow to $1.8 billion, which is a conversion rate of 97% for the year. We achieved double-digit ROIC, and we utilize our strong cash generation to reward shareholders. We increased our dividend 9% and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% to the resumption of share repurchases. On so many dimensions we are feeling great.\nThat said, as you heard from Wendell, our gross margin percentage is not where it should be. In the fourth quarter, gross margin was 36.5%, down 180 basis points sequentially. As expected, below normal auto production and seasonally lower sales in Specialty Materials reduced profitability. In addition, we restarted idle polysilicon capacity to support Hemlock's new long-term solar contracts thus incurring temporary start-up costs. We expect to expand gross margin percent throughout the year.\nWe negotiated pricing increases in long-term customer contracts to more appropriately share the higher cost that we are experiencing. These increases take effect and accelerate throughout the year.\nAs always, we expect to deliver on a robust cost reduction program. The combined benefits of these efforts should offset the cumulative inflation we experienced over the last year and what we anticipate for 2022. Our gross and operating margins will also benefit from growing volume. Our operating leverage is such that additional volume drives good incremental profitability and becomes even more apparent as we offset inflation. We expect volume increases throughout the year. As our volumes increase and our pricing actions take effect, our gross margin percent will grow.\nAs a reminder, the first quarter is usually our lowest volume quarter of the year. We expect Specialty Materials to improve on its normal cycle, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year. Environmental Technologies sales will improve with the resolution of the chip shortage, which we expect to happen later in the year. And Optical Communications will grow as we fill the capacity that we're adding to meet growing demand. For the year, we expect price increases cost reductions and volume growth. Putting this all together, we expect Q1 to be the lowest gross margin percent quarter every year and for gross margin to grow from there.\nNow let's take a closer look at performance in each of our businesses during the fourth quarter and the full year. Let's begin with Optical Communications. Fourth quarter sales were up 7% sequentially, exceeding $1.2 billion. Net income increased to 12%. For the full year, sales grew 22% to $4.3 billion, and net income was up 51%. We grew significantly faster than the passive optical market. National and regional carriers increased capital spending on 5G and broadband projects. Additionally, enterprise sales were up as customers increase spending on data center builds.\nFull year net income grew 51% driven by the incremental volume despite cost headwinds related to materials and logistics. We're entering 2022 with a sales run rate 25% higher than where we started in 2021, and we have a strong order book. We continue to see significant public and private investments in fiber infrastructure as operators work to expand capacity, capability and access and we expect a large multiyear wave of growth.\nIn fact, we believe private carrier and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth. We're adding capacity to capture the growing demand, and we feel really good about our position as the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions.\nTurning to Display. In the fourth quarter, sales were $942 million, up 12% year-over-year and net income was $252 million, up 16% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $3.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Net income reached $960 million, up 34% year-over-year. The pricing environment was favorable throughout the year, and our excellent operational performance allowed us to continue to lead the market.\nIn the third quarter, we provided detail about our perspective on the Display industry based on three main factors: Retail demand, panel makers production and glass makers' ability to supply panel makers. Our fourth quarter performance and first quarter outlook reaffirm our expectations. We continue to expect that glass at retail will grow in 2022 by high single digits, driven by TV unit and screen size growth. We expect display glass pricing to be flat sequentially in the first quarter and supply-demand balance for display glass to be tight. We expect glass supply-demand to remain tight to balanced in 2022 and the pricing environment to remain favorable.\nOverall, we are very pleased with Display's performance in 2021, and we feel good about our outlook for 2022. We're operating from a position of strength, and we intend to build on our momentum as we move forward.\nIn Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $353 million, down 9% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Fourth quarter net income was $54 million, down 10% sequentially and 42% year-over-year on lower sales volume. These declines were driven by auto production constraints created by the semiconductor chip shortage that began in the second quarter of last year. As expected, this negatively impacted profitability for the segment and the company.\nNow even with this temporary setback caused by the chip shortage, for the full year, we were able to deliver double-digit sales growth, enabled by our content-driven growth strategy. Full year sales were nearly $1.6 billion, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in heavy-duty diesel and greater adoption of gas particulate filters. For the full year, net income was $269 million, up 37% year-over-year.\nAs we look ahead, we're confident that our content-driven approach will continue to drive outperformance. And when the automotive market rebounds with the resolution of the chip shortage, we expect significant growth from current levels.\nTurning to Specialty Materials. Sales were $518 million, down 7% sequentially on normal seasonality. Sales were down 5% year-over-year versus a strong Q4 in 2020 following the launch of Ceramic Shield. Fourth quarter net income was $92 million, down sequentially and year-over-year, driven by the lower sales volume. Full year sales were up 7% and exceeded $2 billion, driven by continued strong sales of premium cover materials. Demand also remains strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growth. Despite sales being up, full year net income was down as we invested strongly in new innovations that will be commercialized in the coming year.\nWe have grown sales every year since 2016 through our more Corning approach despite smartphone unit sales maturing. Over that 5-year period, we've added nearly $900 million in sales on a base of $1.1 billion. Looking ahead, in 2022, we expect sales to grow faster than our underlying markets driven by continuing adoption of our innovations and growth in advanced optics specifically in products for EUV lithography. And as I mentioned here, we expect sales to increase from the seasonal low levels we expect in the first quarter.\nAnd finally, turning to Life Sciences, we had a great year with total sales topping $1.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Fourth quarter sales were $317 million, up 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic response, continued recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labs and strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic-related consumables. Full year net income was $194 million, up 40%. Fourth quarter net income was $49 million, up 17% year-over-year.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect our strong growth to continue, driven by COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, strong research funding, lab utilization returning to prepandemic levels and growth in the bioproduction segment.\nI also want to spend a minute on our other segment. As a reminder, the majority of sales in our other segment are in Hemlock Semiconductor Group. During the year, Hemlock saw new demand for solar-grade polysilicon. With the increased activity and interest in U.S.-based solar manufacturing, customers have turned to Hemlock, a leader in polysilicon manufacturing. So in addition to selling polysilicon for use in semiconductors, Hemlock was able to sell solar polysilicon from inventory.\nGoing forward, solar remains a strong revenue opportunity for Hemlock. In the fourth quarter, we signed long-term take-or-pay supply contracts with customer deposits that start to shift in 2022. As a result, we restarted idle capacity with minimal capital investment to meet this demand. As I mentioned earlier, gross margins were impacted in the fourth quarter as we incurred temporary cost to restart solar polysilicon capacity. This will improve throughout the year as solar production increases.\nAdditionally, our auto glass and pharmaceutical packaging emerging businesses are also in the other segment. And both businesses significantly grew sales during the year as well.\nStepping back, we made strong progress across all of our businesses in 2021. We entered new product categories, announced collaboration with key industry leaders and contributed to significant industry advancements. We're building a strong foundation for future growth. This, combined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD&E is what continues to fuel and sustain Corning's leadership position across its markets.\nLooking ahead, we expect Corning sales and EPS to grow year-over-year in the first quarter. We expect sales to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion and EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.53. Sales are down sequentially due to typical seasonal volume declines. For the full year, we expect sales of approximately $15 billion and profit to grow faster than sales.\nBefore I turn things over to Ed, I'd like to take a moment to express my gratitude. First, to all Corning employees whose dedication and commitment to this great company is such an inspiration. Second, to those of you on the call and all our shareholders. For being with being on this journey with us, we're working hard every day to maintain your trust and reward your confidence in us. And finally, I'd like to thank Wendell, Ed and my fellow members of Corning's senior leadership team. I'm proud to have played a role in building the strong foundation Corning has today. It's truly been a wonderful journey.\nAs Ed takes the reins in just a few weeks, I'm fully confident in his ability to build on this foundation and continue creating value for all our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Ed.\n\nEdward A. Schlesinger\n\nSenior VP & Corporate Controller, Corning Incorporated\n\nThanks, Tony, and hello, everyone. I'm looking forward to connecting with you in the days and months ahead so we can expand on the thoughts I share today and address any questions you may have.\nBefore I start, I'd like to say that it's been an honor working alongside Tony all these years. Under his tenure, we met or exceeded all the goals of our 4-year strategy and capital allocation framework. And today, we're performing well against the subsequent goals we outlined in our strategy and growth framework in 2019.\nExecution has created a stronger, more resilient Corning and that provided vital -- proved vital as the pandemic unfolded. Our solid footing enabled us to preserve our financial strength throughout 2020, and it kept us well positioned for growth in 2021. Throughout it all, Tony's focus on financial stewardship has been central to our results, and I plan to sustain that disciplined approach.\nSo let me walk through my priorities as CFO as I work to ensure that Corning continues to be an excellent steward of capital. We expect another strong year of cash generation in 2022, and our financial priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest of cash to support organic growth, extend our leadership and reward shareholders.\nFirst, we will continue to invest for growth, primarily through RD&E and CapEx. RD&E is fundamental to our long-term success and our allocation will be consistent with previous years. In 2022, we expect to keep CapEx consistent with 2021. Our investments include adding capacity to meet growing demand, introduce new innovations and improve productivity.\nShareholder returns also remain a key priority. In 2022, we expect to increase our dividend per share by approximately $0.10. And we expect to continue opportunistic share repurchases building on the 5% of outstanding shares we repurchased in 2021. In the near term, improving gross margin is my top priority. We expect improvement throughout 2022 as sales grow and our pricing actions take hold.\nOverall, I'll close today saying that I'm optimistic about our growth trajectory for 2022 and excited to step into the CFO role. We're building on a strong foundation. Our capabilities are relevant to major trends playing out across the industries we serve. Our more Corning approach is working. And we're executing effectively through some very volatile end markets, expanding relationships and commitments with our customers and extending our leadership position.\nBased on the growth drivers and financial priorities you've heard this morning, I feel good about delivering on our expectation to grow sales to $15 billion in 2022 with EPS growing even faster. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Ann for Q&A. Ann?\n\nAnn H. S. Nicholson\n\nVP of IR, Corning Incorporated\n\nThanks, Ann Okay. Shannon, we are ready for the first question. (Operator Instructions)."

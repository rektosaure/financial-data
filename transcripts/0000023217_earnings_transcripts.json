All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star and then one. To withdraw your questions, you may press star and two. Please note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Matthew Neisius, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Once again, I'm joined this morning by Sean Connolly, our CEO, and Dave Marberger, our CFO. We may be making some forward-looking statements and discussing non-GAAP financial measures during this session.\n\nPlease see our earnings release, prepared remarks, presentation materials, and filings with the SEC, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website for more information, including descriptions of our risk factors, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, and information on our comparability items. I'll now ask the operator to introduce the first question. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and one. Our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Sean, Conagra Brands expects to return to positive organic sales growth in the fiscal second half, but also mentioned recent consumption trends in pointing to a low single-digit decline expected in the second quarter. What's driving the fiscal second half inflection, or is it really just easy year-ago comps? Do recent consumption trends that you mentioned sort of give you any pause, particularly in light of the planned tactical pricing actions that you're taking? To what do you attribute the recent consumption weakness?\n\nAll right, good morning, Andrew. Let me tackle that in reverse order. First, I wouldn't overly read into any recent consumption trend data. To the degree you saw any softening at the end of Q1, that was tied primarily to the two things I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is the shift of a major Angie's King Chicken Pop promotional event to Q2 and the initial planned elasticity effect of the inflation-justified pricing that we took on Duncan Hines due to cocoa costs. That's kind of the Q1 concept. This quarter in Q2, some of our major frozen events are planned about a month or so later than a year ago based on our supply ramp-up. That is pretty consistent with what we would expect in the full year, just a little bit of a shift in timing. Not much else to really discuss there.\n\nAs for the basis of our expectations for further sales progress in the second half, it will be a combination of volume momentum on frozen, where we wrapped last year's supply constraints, plus continued volume momentum on growing businesses like protein snacks. You have to also add what I'll call dollar momentum on inflationary businesses where we're taking price. That combination of factors reflects the horses for courses plan that we built. What I mean by that is we are investing to drive volume in frozen and snacks while maximizing cash via inflation-justified pricing and staples.\n\nGot it. Thank you for that. Fiscal first quarter came in ahead of expectations. Fiscal second quarter was moderated a bit in terms of your outlook. Net-net, do you see fiscal first half as potentially coming in a bit better than originally planned? Dave, how much was the benefit from trade expense timing to organic sales growth in the quarter? Thanks so much.\n\nYeah, Andrew. Taking the last part first, it was about 50 basis points of benefit in Q1, the trade timing, and then that will flip to Q2. 50 basis points in terms of sales. In terms of the first half, I would say given the flip in timing of that, given the fact that Q1 we had some benefit in inventory where we delayed some of the tariff costs, and now they're going to be coming in in Q2, I would say generally we're still on track with our original plan for the first half. There are different pieces we talked about in our guidance. We're a little favorable in interest expense, but our tax rate's a bit higher. There are obviously some puts and takes, but I think we're pretty much on our first half plan. Yeah.\n\nI would say, Andrew, that what I was looking for this quarter really were two things. Number one, can we get the service issues behind us and getting to 98%? Check. I'm feeling good about that. Second, once we did that and could start to resume our merchandising activities and rolling out our innovation, are we getting the consumer takeaway and are we seeing inflection on key businesses? Check, we saw that. The consumer is certainly not out of the woods yet. We're still seeing value-seeking behavior. We're still having to deal with inflation and tariffs. After a quarter, I think we're feeling good about the setup for the balance of the year.\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Sean and Dave, I just wanted to maybe touch on the updated core inflation outlook that you gave. I know you talked about some of the moving pieces within kind of the animal protein, but maybe you can just remind us, A, kind of how you're bought for the remainder of the year on some of those items. Are you kind of locked in now for the rest of the year? Just given that some of these cuts are very volatile and have moved, particularly chicken over the past month has maybe moved more favorably. I just want to understand the flex in that inflation guide as we get in the back half. Yeah. Peter, our original guidance, our overall inflation was approximately 7%. That's split 4% core inflation, and then 3% gross tariffs.\n\nThen we had mitigation, obviously, on tariffs of about 1 to 1.5% on that. We have our productivity, which helps us offset our core inflation. As we've gone through this quarter, we're seeing more pressure on the core inflation. There's been a little bit of movement on the tariffs, but generally, that's immaterial. The 3% gross tariffs we estimated at the beginning of the year are about the same. The increase in the overall inflation for the year is really coming from the core inflation, and that's really driven by the animal proteins. Particularly beef, pork, turkey, and then to some extent eggs relative to our original forecast. To your question about where we are from an overall coverage perspective, for Q2, we're about 85% covered. Certain commodities are fully covered, but then the animal proteins, which has been a pressure point, that's more spot market overall.\n\nWe do take positions and freeze them. We have capability to add coverage through freezing proteins, but generally that's more market and spot-based. About 85% covered Q2. For the full year, 60 to 65% coverage overall. Again, those proteins, we're exposed. If there's additional inflation or if the inflation moderates, we'll see a benefit from that. Great. Thanks for that, Dave. Very helpful. I wanted to pivot maybe to the balance sheet and the cash flow. Dave, I know you called out that there would be some debt pay down in that quarter. I've gotten a few questions this morning just on the cash flow generation in the quarter. It was a bit maybe lighter than expectations in some of the inventory builds.\n\nMaybe you can unpack both the debt pay down and how we should think about that in Q2 and the remainder of the year, and then just anything around kind of inventory build that happened in the quarter. Thanks very much. Sure. Let me start from the top. When we gave our guidance, we had forecasted that we would pay down $700 million in debt for fiscal 2026. That's from both the proceeds from the divestitures as well as $100 million from, you know, cash flow from operations to pay down debt. We're still on track with that. Actually, we included in our materials that we're going to have additional favorability from the tax legislation. We are estimating that at $75 million. We haven't built that into our specific pre-cash flow forecast yet, but that's clearly going to be a benefit.\n\nAs it relates to Q1, we have, and this is just solely timing. We built more inventory in the first quarter because remember, we were coming off supply disruptions, and we had to get back to service levels. That was a priority. We built our inventory, so our normal seasonal build affects Q1. We leaned in to make sure we had the right safety stocks on the areas where we had disruptions. You normally will see that in Q1. It's a little bit more. Our inventory on hand, we have more days on hand, but that's been planned. That's timing. We still feel comfortable about our full-year forecast as it relates to inventory. I would say we're on track. Q1's the normal build. In the first quarter, our net debt is down about a little over $400 million versus where we finished at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nAs we said in the comments, on a rolling 12, we've reduced our net debt by $1.1 billion. We feel really good about cash flow generation, both where we are and how we're forecasting it for fiscal 2026. Just one other piece of perspective on that inventory build. Several of the peers in Center Store Grocery have really struggled in the last year to generate consumer pull against their brands, even when investing. We have not had that problem. You may recall we had six or seven quarters of straight line top line improvement as we invested after in the pursuit of volume last year, and we returned to growth in Q2. We have clear evidence that the brands and the innovation are working for consumers, but we ran into the supply interruption and we had to pull a lot of our merchandising.\n\nNow that we've got service levels back, armed with that confidence that we can generate consumer pull because of these products, we are absolutely convinced having inventory in place so we don't fall out of stock again and fail to keep up with consumer demand, particularly going into holiday season, is absolutely the right thing to do.\n\nAwesome. Thanks, guys.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Tom Palmer from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Mr. Palmer, is it possible your phone is on mute? Just to confirm, the speaker room, are you able to hear me?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWe can hear you. Okay.\n\nIt looks like we've got Palmer number two in the queue. Why don't we go there and we'll come back to Tom in a bit.\n\nAll right. Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Sir, please go ahead with your question.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Good morning. Frozen entrees, obviously, it's been a great long-term category for Conagra Brands. Just looking at the recent data, and I know there's reasons for this, maybe some overhangs from some of the past supply chain stuff, but wondering, you know, what is your state of the union with that category? It looks like you guys are losing share and the category is declining. For years, you guys were driving the majority of growth in the category that was oftentimes growing at least a little bit. I wonder what your frozen outlook is, frozen entree in particular outlook is through the rest of the year, and I have a quick follow-up.\n\nSure. All right, David. Yeah, our outlook is positive. You know, the simple way to think about frozen meals is the category goes as Conagra Brands goes. That's been the rule for the last seven or so years. When we didn't innovate back in the day, the category didn't grow. When we committed to innovating frozen, the category grew steadily for a long, long time. Including, by the way, in our Q2 last year, I think our frozen business was up in the ballpark of 3%. We're coming off of a back half of last year where we had major service interruptions in that business. We walked away from major merchandising, and that hands our merchandising to competitors who then get in the plans, customer plans for a period of time while we're working to get service levels back.\n\nThat contributed, obviously, to us being a share donator, which is the first time that's happened in years and years and years. That's obviously a temporary phenomenon tied to our supply interruptions. What you're seeing now is our innovation is rolling into the marketplace. Our service levels are back to 98%. We're getting kind of back in the queue on these major events and feel extremely bullish about it. We've got some absolutely fantastic innovations that we rolled out last year that were interrupted. We're rolling out new ones this year, and they're already off to a particularly strong start. I will draw your attention to the new Dolly Parton frozen meals and frozen desserts that are new in the marketplace and performing extremely well. What's encouraging about that as well is they're not only performing well, that's a premium-priced product. That's a good mix for us too.\n\nI have tremendous confidence in our frozen business. To win in frozen, you've got to have scale and you've got to have an innovation machine. We've got the best in the business. We're looking forward to continued momentum on that business as we go through the year and wrap some of the weak spots in the last year or second half.\n\nThank you for that. Just a very general big-picture question. You're going to have those easier comparisons in the second half of the year, and you're going to be more on your front foot. I'm wondering, what are some, I don't know if there's exact metrics that you can share, but what are the things that you're going to be looking for in the second half that would really tell you that you get back to balanced sales and profit growth in fiscal 2027? If that is, the goal here is to get back to an on-algo in 2027, what would kind of let you know you're there? Clearly, growing against some of these comparisons may not be enough for that. Perhaps give us a sense of what you think would be \"good enough\" in the second half to show us you're really on track again.\n\nThanks. You know, Dave, you once said a good piece of wisdom for me. You said your hero business has got to be heroes, meaning frozen snacks need to grow. I think that is well said. I think, you know, for this company, frozen snacks are clear growth categories. It represents about 70% of our retail business. We've had tremendous momentum on both of those businesses leading up to the supply challenges we had last year. By the time we exit this year, I want to see real momentum and inflection on those businesses. We've already got it within the key strategic snacks businesses. For example, Slim Jim right now is tracking really well. SeaStore is coming back. That's very encouraging. Our new innovation on Slim Jim, which is our new Buffalo Wild Wings Buffalo Chicken Slim Jim, is performing really well out of the gate.\n\nThat's a very positive sign. On frozen, it's all about getting back in the queue on merchandising events with customers and then making sure that the innovation that we worked so hard to build performs. So far, it looks good. Those businesses with a positive trajectory as we move through the year, I think is a very, very positive sign for next year when we've got some of these margin clawback opportunities in front of us. That'll be a combination of a good-looking top line and an improving gross margin line as well. I'm looking forward to that.\n\nThank you very much. Our next question comes from Brian Adams from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHey, morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe just first a quick housekeeping one following up on David's question there. Q1 volume performance for refrigerated and frozen came in a lot better than I think maybe scattered trends would have suggested. I think in the prepared remarks, you said volumes for frozen itself were up like 3% or so. Was there any elevated shipments in the Q1 as you were finishing up restoring supply at shelf, or is this pretty consistent with other consumption trends that you were seeing?\n\nHey, Brian, the 3% number, that was the I was referring to Q2 last year when frozen was back growing strongly in Q2. Shipments were a little bit ahead in the quarter, which is pretty typical at a time when you've been out of stock and you're kind of replenishing. I wouldn't overthink this because if you look at our company on kind of a rolling four-quarter basis, shipments to consumption are almost always equal. For us, it doesn't really amount to much. I wouldn't overthink that piece. Anything you'd add? The only thing I would say is just if you're just purely looking at shipments to consumption within the quarter for R&F, that hit here, obviously, because the prior year, shipments were really strong. There's a little bit of benefit, shipments versus consumption related to hit here within Q1 for R&F.\n\nOkay. Awesome. Thanks. Yeah, not my best reading comprehension, I guess, there. On the margin clawback opportunities that you just actually spoke to, can you kind of just run through those high level for us as we think about '27? Some of the stuff, you know, like some of the costs you've had this year, like tariffs, that's not necessarily something you can assume goes away. I also know you have some work in process on the chicken, and then I'm not really sure the puts and takes on SG&A. Do you mind just running through those, Sean, as you see them today?\n\nSure. Absolutely. I'll tick off five things that I mentioned last quarter that remain intact. It starts with productivity. In fiscal 2026 this year, between core productivity and tariff mitigation, that number is just over 5%, which is very strong. By the way, Q1 came in right at that, above that level, which is a super strong quarter. That will continue. The supply chain team is doing a nice job. Second, at some point, we're going to get inflation relief. You said somebody mentioned proteins a little bit ago. Hopefully back closer to our typical 2%. If you look back 100 years as we have, anytime we've had these kind of runaway inflation cycles like this, there's always been relief on the other side of the hill. At some point, that'll happen. We obviously can't recall exactly when.\n\nThird, the advancement of our supply chain resiliency investments, including the chicken plants, will enable us to repatriate some of that outsourced production going forward at lower costs. Fourth, we are taking pricing in certain categories. After you get past the initial lag of inflation hits and you wait 90 days or so to get pricing in, you start to get the benefit of that. Fifth, I mentioned last quarter, we were kicking off an ambitious initiative to re-engineer our core work processes, leveraging technology, including AI. We have kicked that work off to accelerate growth and lower costs. We'll have more to report on that going forward. That's an exciting possibility. Between those actions and our ongoing efforts to reshape the portfolio for faster growth and better margins, we do expect a good margin expansion following fiscal 2026.\n\nOkay. Really helpful. Thanks, Sean. Thanks, Dave. I'll pass it on.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHi, thanks. I have a phasing question about Q2 volume, Dave and Sean. I'm just looking at comparisons versus a year ago on volume, and it would appear that, you know, the volume growth comp would get tougher in Q2 compared to Q1 because of the Hebrew comparison and also because you had a lot of frozen vegetable volume in Q2. Should I assume that volume growth is, or volume declines are similar in Q2 as in Q1 because of those comps, or is the merchandising activity enough to provide some sequential improvement in volume?\n\nYeah, Rob, this is Dave. We have obviously a ton of brands, and so there's a lot of moving pieces, a lot of dynamics on merchandising. Generally speaking, the volume that we had in Q1 should be similar in Q2. When you net it all together for total company.\n\nIn terms of growth, okay.\n\nYeah, in terms of volume and year-on-year growth.\n\nYeah, thanks a lot.\n\nYeah. Just for perspective, Rob, on the year-to-go basis, we had a strong investment profile in merchandising last year. We had to pull back on some of that in the second half. We have a very strong investment in merchandising behind this innovation for the year-to-go period as well. As I mentioned, some of those innovations which just are getting going now are already performing quite well. We are looking forward to that. You saw in the promotion chart I shared in the prepared remarks that while we've had some of the merchandising restored in Q1, there is room to go as we move through the back half of the full year.\n\nGot it. Thanks, Sean.\n\nOur next question comes from Megan Klapp from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with maybe a follow-up, Sean, to Andrew's second question at the beginning, just around how the quarter played out and how you're tracking so far. You made a comment last quarter that you viewed the fiscal 2026 guide as prudent given the operating environment. You've talked a lot about a lot of encouraging things that you saw in Q1. At the same time, consumer sentiment's weak. You've talked about value-seeking consumer behavior. Cost inflation's a bit higher. Just putting all those puts and takes together, I guess when you think about the fiscal 2026 guide today, you reiterated it. Would you still characterize it as prudent? Maybe where is the guide in your mind, you know, the most conservative? Thank you.\n\nI think it remains prudent. As I mentioned to somebody this morning, the two things I was really looking for in this quarter are we got to get service back, right? We had a lot of momentum. That momentum was very material. It was interrupted in the back half of last year because of service. We've got confidence that if we get service back, we will get the consumer takeaway. We got service back to 98%. That's good. The fact that the innovation is off to as strong a start this year, actually stronger than what we had last year. We had a very strong innovation performance last year in terms of not only customer acceptance, but the velocity of that innovation right up to the point where we pulled our merchandising, particularly in frozen.\n\nIt's good to see innovation out of the gates this year performing at an even higher level in terms of units per store per week velocities, things like that. That's a positive. Between that and the plans we've got calendared out for the balance of the year, I think the outlook is prudent. We're pretty optimistic about building that momentum that I talked about with Dave Marberger a few minutes ago as we move through the year. Specifically, this is a horses for courses annual operating plan that we built. There are some businesses where we've planned out the year to invest to drive volume growth, specifically frozen and snacks. We're seeing movement in the right direction there. I expect to see more of that as we get to the back half.\n\nThere are other businesses where we are facing more acute inflation because of things like in-place tariffs, where we're taking more inflation-justified pricing. There, it's about dollars. Between the volume plans that we've got and the dollar plans that we've got, I think it comes together and puts us in a prudent position.\n\nOkay, great. Thanks. That's a good segue to my follow-up, which is, as you think about implementing tariff-related pricing, which I think you said will come on late in the second quarter, have your views on elasticity and the expected elasticity changed at all, just given you're still seeing some value-seeking behavior with the consumer? If we just think bigger picture around the macro, the consumer is going to be seeing a lot of, it seems like, inflation-driven pricing start to roll in around the same time. Thank you.\n\nGood question. We track elasticities weekly, and we've kind of built in a historical elasticity expectation in categories as we built the plan. Specifically, what we've seen is within our categories, Conagra Brands' average elasticity is a bit better than our competitors' across channels. Further, at a company level, if you look at just total pricing versus total volume change, you'll also see that our elasticity has been a bit better than most peers over the past year. I don't feel like we are assuming anything heroic in terms of elasticities going forward, even in the face of the pricing actions that we've got.\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Max Gumpfort from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHey, thanks for the question. Sean, I'm curious for an update on the value-seeking behavior that you're still seeing. It's been a few years now. I'm just wondering how you see this cycle playing out and how you're positioning Conagra Brands to come out of this cycle in a better place. Thanks very much.\n\nYeah, I mean, I think you're probably hearing the same thing from just about everybody in consumer packaged goods on this. It is kind of this barbell economy where you've got higher-income consumers that are showing more resiliency and they're still spending. You've got lower-income consumers across different age groups that are being more discerning. They are absolutely doing what they've got to do to maximize their household balance sheet. We have to deal with that. Clearly, there is more value-seeking behavior that is evident in the lower-income group. Our job is to give those consumers the value they're seeking. With the portfolio scope that we have, there are a lot of great value choices. That's a big part of why sales are improving and so are shares. Going forward, we'll continue to put that value lens on our innovation and marketing effort because it matters.\n\nIf you weren't seeing this kind of behavior, I think if you look at our innovation slate over the last 10 years, you've probably seen it skew toward more premiumized products. When you have a large cohort of consumers that are value-oriented, you take a different lens around your innovation for both price-pack architecture and the kinds of innovation that you want to deliver. Why? Because the benefit of superior relative value is a benefit that's going to move the sales line. You should imagine that we not only have a good slate of great value offerings already out there, but it does inform our innovation pipeline going forward to make sure that we've got products that are very provocative, not because of maybe an ultra-premium benefit, but because of a value benefit.\n\nGreat. As a follow-up, it was nice to see service levels get back to 98%, enabling a recovery to some degree in quality merchandising and improved volume share performance as well. As we look to the remainder of the year, is there any color or guardrails you could provide on how you expect your promotional levels and your volume share performance to progress from here? Thanks very much.\n\nYeah, I'll point to some data that I shared last quarter, which is if you look across the group, and specifically the near-end kind of center store peers, what you've seen is that promotional levels in terms of % of total volume sold on promotion has kind of migrated back to just about pre-COVID levels. It's uncanny. It's almost pre-COVID levels company by company. We're a little lower than that because we're still recovering from supply interruption, but moving back toward that. I have not seen promotional levels go above that kind of pre-COVID norm. That's a positive sign, I think. The second metric we track is kind of depth of discount. You know, are we seeing this more broad-based desire to have a return to volume growth now leading to deeper discounts? The answer is no. We've not seen that. That's been that way for several quarters running.\n\nI think that's positive because I think what it shows is that it's a rational environment. You know, everybody is to some degree investing margin in the service of volume. I think that kind of keeps your feet on the ground here. It's been a rational environment, and I think there's room for us to do more in terms of merch. We've, you know, back in the right direction, but we're not back to where we were. Obviously do it in a very rational way. That's our intent.\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Marks from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHey, good morning, Sean, Dave. Thanks so much for taking our questions. The first thing I wanted to ask about, coming back to some of the recovery of the supply chain disruption from earlier this year, you've spoken about obviously recovery in your own service levels, rebuilding of your own inventories as well. I'm wondering how you're seeing it from the retailer side in terms of their inventory levels relative to where they were prior to the disruption on frozen vegetables and some of the chicken products. Thanks.\n\nYeah, good question, Scott. It's probably not a lot of drama in the answer, though. We're not seeing anything particularly noteworthy. I would say pretty typical and nothing that I could report that would really be of any real news. Anything you'd add to that, Dave? Yeah, no. When we use the term service levels, they're very specific metrics in terms of where they are with their levels and inventory. Customers are kind of back where they need to be, generally speaking.\n\nGot it. Thanks for that. A follow-up question just on some of the chicken facility modernizations. I know you made the comment that you're still expecting the baked chicken facility to be completed in Q2. I think you're still working through a fried chicken modernization that's expected a little bit later. How should we be thinking about maybe cadence of recovery of the margin, let's say? I know you spoke about some benefits in H2, but just trying to gauge how we should be thinking about the restoration of margin from that perspective. Thanks.\n\nSure. The baked chicken project, that's the one we kind of started with. That's farther along. The fried chicken is kind of a newer development because the demand for fried chicken has just exploded in the last couple of years. We had tremendous success last year with our Banquet Mega Filet. That's an investment that will go on a little bit longer. In the meantime, it'll be an investment that moves some of that production out of house, which has kind of a double whammy in that we lose the absorption of not producing it ourselves, and we pay a tolling fee for that. That'll correct as we go forward as well. Baked comes on first in terms of the benefit, and fried will follow that. The good news here is we sell a lot of healthy meals and frozen.\n\nThese days, the ones that contain protein are the ones that, not surprisingly, people are really buying. Unfortunately, it's also been the inflationary part of the basket. We've got, you know, that's where we had a decision to make in terms of what are we after, short-term volume or margin. We fundamentally believe that the best thing for the future cash flows of our frozen business is to keep that consumer pull strong and keep our market share strong. That's why we're investing some margin in the short term to really get that volume cranking.\n\nGot it. We'll pass it on. Thanks very much.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Tom Palmer from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nThank you. Is round two here? You can hear me?\n\nWe got you, Tom.\n\nAll right. A third Palmer on the call. I wanted to just ask on the timing of inflation and kind of how it plays out over the course of the year. I think from the materials, it seems like to start off the year, maybe it was a little bit favorable to that kind of 7% plus. Is Q2, just given what we're seeing with protein, maybe heightened or just, I guess any help on kind of the cadence over the next three quarters as you see it today?\n\nYeah, Tom, it's Dave. The Q1, the real favorability there was for tariffs and timing on tariffs. The core inflation was kind of where we thought it would be, actually a little bit a tad bit higher. When you kind of look at Q2 through Q4 and you look at overall inflation, it's pretty consistent from a percentage perspective to the full-year guide of slightly above 7%. There's no material change in the year-on-year percentage of the inflation.\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you for that. Sean, I just wanted to kind of clarify, I guess, one item, and I know it's been asked about already a little bit, but it seems like you are seeing benefits from promotional activity. At the same time, as you have kind of taken some pricing initially, maybe you noted a little bit lower elasticity than you might see in the past. I mean, look, I get some of this is maybe we're talking about different products where these two are applied, but I guess in the current environment, are you guys kind of baking in that one of these two sides shifts a little bit to converge?\n\nI think what we're baking in, Tom, is that as we roll out our innovation and our marketing support, including our advertising and our major merchandising events, we're going to have the kind of consumer pull that we've seen in the past. That's on the more volume-oriented businesses. On the more dollar-oriented businesses, I think we've baked in a historically accurate elasticity level. Usually, that's around a minus one. We have not seen any elasticities to suggest that that is an overly optimistic point of view at all. I think in total, the outlook for both sides of the horses for courses concept is that it's prudent. I expect good consumer response in the areas where we're investing to drive volume on frozen and snacks as the year progresses. I expect there will be an elasticity effect on canned goods and some other things that we're taking price on.\n\nThey should be fairly predictable effects consistent with history.\n\nThank you for that.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Matthew Neisius for closing remarks.\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. Please reach out to Investor Relations with any additional questions. Have a great day.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

Thanks, Melissa. And thank you all for joining our first quarter fiscal 25 earnings call.\n\nBefore we begin, I'd like to extend our sympathies to everyone affected by Hurricane Helene. We are supporting World Kitchen, American Red Cross and Feeding America, and we'll continue to monitor the situation to determine how we can further help those in need. Now let's get started on slide four. Q1 marked another quarter of progress in many areas. And I'm proud of the way our team executed within a dynamic environment. We took the actions we told you we would take And by and large, we got the results we expected to get. We told you last quarter that Q1 would have plenty of noise in it, and it did.\n\nBeyond the anomalies we planned for, we had one out-of-plan dynamic to contend with. Today, we will endeavor to unpack the quarter and provide a clear understanding of the underlying state of our business, which is encouraging. In fact, the most important thing for you to take away from our call today is that we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 25 goals. We had clear priorities for Q1 and delivered on all of them. We continue to drive meaningful volume improvement in our domestic retail business, including year over year growth in our strategic frozen and snack domain.\n\nOur share improvement stands out, not just in the absolute, but among peers, as we drove strong share performance across the majority of the portfolio. Continuing to drive our value over volume strategy in food service helped us sustain our margins at pre-COVID levels despite channel softening. We continue to advance our supply chain productivity initiatives, which remain on track to deliver one billion dollars of cost savings by the end of fiscal twenty five. And finally, we were excited to resume our portfolio reshaping initiatives with the acquisition of Fatty Smoked Meat Sticks, which expanded our leading position in the high growth, high margin meat sticks product category, as well as the divestiture of our Indian joint venture ATFL.\n\nOur team delivered on these priorities, despite an out-of-plan dynamic that pressured performance during the quarter, namely a manufacturing disruption that required us to pause production at our Hebrew National hot dog plant in the middle of grilling season. While we were able to fully resume plant operations, the temporary manufacturing pause resulted in lost sales. Revenue for the Hebrew National Brand was down 47 percent in Q1. We estimate that this equated to a 60 basis point reduction in total volume and a 90 basis point reduction in total organic net sales during the first quarter. The loss was particularly apparent within refrigerated and frozen, where we estimated that it accounted for 150 basis point reduction in volume and a 210 basis point reduction in organic net sales for the segment.\n\nWe estimate that the majority of the impact of this disruption will be isolated to the first quarter. Taking all of this into account, our results for the quarter were in line or above our internal plan for most metrics except organic net sales, which was impacted by the temporary manufacturing disruption I just discussed. I'm pleased with our team's continued execution against our key priorities, which has strengthened the underlying momentum of our business. As a result, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 25 guidance. Let's take a closer look at each of our priorities, beginning with our volume progress on slide five.\n\nAs you can see, our proven playbook and strategic investments have generated continuous volume recovery in our domestic retail business over the past year. In fact, domestic retail volume performance in Q1 exceeded our expectations, and our volume recovery would have been higher, but for the temporary impact of Hebrew National. Importantly, as you can see on slide six, we delivered year-over-year volume growth across both of our strategic domains, frozen and SNAC. We focused our investments to maximize consumer engagement within these domains. And their return to growth demonstrates that our plan is working. Slide seven shows the volume trends in our staples domain.\n\nExcluding the temporary disruption in hot dogs, the rest of our staples domain also delivered sequential volume improvement during the quarter. And don't forget, Q1 staples volume was impacted by the elasticity effect of last year's price increase on our tomatoes platform. Since we wrapped those pricing actions as we exited Q1, this impact will wane going forward. And to give you a sense of the magnitude, staples consumption in Q1, ex-tomatoes and hot dogs would also have been positive. So overall, while we anticipate the consumer environment will remain a challenge in Fiscal 25, our proven ability to navigate through it gives us confidence that we will continue to drive volume across our business.\n\nEven more impressive than the strength of our volume improvement is our share performance seen here on slide eight. Achieving four consecutive quarters of share progress is a solid achievement in any period, but to do so amid today's challenging consumer environment underscores the strength of our strategy and the resiliency of our portfolio. In Q1, approximately 71% of our portfolio held or gained volume share, and the vast majority of that was share gain. And, as you can see on slide nine, our share performance is far ahead of our near-end peer set. Only one of our closest peers has more than half of their portfolio holding or gaining share, and we are outperforming them by a solid margin.\n\nIf you zoom in on our strategic frozen and snack domains shown here on slide 10, the share performance is even stronger. 93% of our frozen and snack brands held or gained volume share during the quarter. This slide demonstrates the continual improvement of our share performance over the past year, highlighting the effectiveness of our enhanced investments to drive consumer engagement. Importantly, we continue to deliver volume progress and strong share gains while achieving the expected ROI. Slide 11 demonstrates how the industry merchandising environment remains rational. There are two key metrics to consider when evaluating the state of merchandising, the share of volume sold on promotion and the average depth of promotion.\n\nIn both key metrics, Conagra and our near-end peer set are promoting slightly less today than we did in the most comparable pre-pandemic period. Said differently, the overall promotional environment is roughly consistent with historic norms. And when you double click on each of these metrics, you'll find that Conagra is actually less promotional than our closest peers. Both today and in the pre-pandemic period, Conagra sells a lower percentage of our volume on promotion. And when we do have targeted promotions, our average discount is also less. The takeaway is clear. We continue to operate in a rational merchandising environment.\n\nConagra remains less reliant on promotions to drive volume, and we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to prioritize the long term health of our brand. Now, let's dive into each of our domains. Starting with frozen on slide 12, our Q1 volume sales outpaced both edible and relevant frozen categories, led by our strong volume share performance in single serve meals and share increases in vegetables and multi-serve meals. Slide 13 takes a closer look at single serve meals, our largest frozen category. Conagra now represents a majority of all industry volume in this $6.5 billion category, a tremendous achievement in this dynamic and competitive environment.\n\nOur investments have enabled us to drive steady share improvement in this category throughout fiscal 24, and we built upon that success during the first quarter of fiscal 25. Frozen Vegetables is another category that contributed to our improved share performance during the quarter. Recall that Birdseye was the focus of our value over volume approach as we pulled back activity on the commodity veg space while building our business and innovation pipeline in the premium value added space. As you can see on slide 14, our efforts are paying off. Our Frozen Vegetables business remains stable and positive. Moving to snacks on slide 15.\n\nWe continue to considerably outpace the total snacking category, largely due to our Advantage portfolio. Our brands span on trend permissible snacking subspaces like meat snacks, popcorn, and seeds, as consumers opt for low-carb, protein, and fiber-rich snacks offered by Slim Jim, Dukes, David, Angie's Boom Chicka Pop, and more. Permissible snacking is growing much faster than the overall snacking category, and our portfolio of well-known brands is benefiting. During the first quarter, we took another step to build upon this strength by welcoming the fatty to the Conagra family. Slide 16 highlights some of the key points that make this acquisition so attractive.\n\nConagra is a leader in the meat snacks category with significant scale. But within meat snacks, Conagra is the leader in meat sticks, a high margin business that is growing faster than all other snacking categories, as demand for more convenient, healthy and affordable experiences continues to attract new buyers. Fatty Smoked Meat Sticks joins consumer favorites Slim Jim and Duke's to form a trifecta smokehouse, which will allow us to capitalize on high growth, protein focused snacking behavior. The addition of a premium brand like the Fatty furthers Conagra's position of strength as we focus on growing our snacking business across advantaged categories.\n\nTurning to our food service business on slide 17. It's no secret that COVID posed an unprecedented challenge for the entire food service industry. And our food service segment was no exception. Over the last five years, we've been laser focused on building a better business and returning margins to pre-COVID level. As a result of our efforts over the past few years, we grew organic net sales and adjusted operating profit. And this past year, we were able to restore food service margins to their fiscal 19 level. During Q1, we sustained that margin as we continue to execute our value over volume strategy.\n\nOur margin recovery has also been supported by our efficient and effective supply chain, highlighted here on slide 18. We expect to drive approximately $350 million in savings during fiscal 25 through multiple productivity initiatives. Further, Q1 service levels remained at the strong pre-COVID level of 97%. We also continued to deliver improvements in free cash flow, reducing our cash conversion cycle by seven days relative to the prior period. As a result of these efforts, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings by the end of Fiscal 25. Our productivity initiatives remain a key tool in our strategic playbook as the savings we realize help fuel our brand building investments and portfolio reshaping efforts.\n\nTurning to slide 19, we were excited to resume our historical practice of active portfolio reshaping with both inbound and outbound activities. consumer tastes and habits are constantly changing. And we continuously evaluate opportunities to reshape our portfolio to position the company for further growth and margin expansion, whether that be through investments in innovation, and brand modernization, M&A, or value accretive divestitures or spend. Portfolio reshaping is in our DNA, and Conagra has taken substantial actions over the past decade to transform our portfolio. However, in recent years, we've been more single-mindedly focused on debt pay down. Now, given the progress we've made on debt and cash flow, as well as other market dynamics, we are in a strong position to resume active portfolio reshaping, and importantly, still meet our long-term, three times net leverage target through a combination of bolt-on acquisitions and divestitures of low-growth businesses.\n\nIn Q1, we advanced these efforts through the acquisition of the fatty and the divestiture of our majority stake in Indian subsidiary Agrotech Foods Ltd. Looking ahead, we will continue to assess opportunities to reshape our portfolio for faster growth and stronger margins. As discussed at the top of the call, our execution across each of our priorities in Q1 has reinforced our confidence in the underlying strength of our brands, people, and strategy. With that, I'm pleased to reaffirm our Fiscal 25 guidance.\n\nI'll now pass the call over to Dave to discuss our financials in more detail. Thanks, Sean. And good morning, everyone. Slide 22 shows our financial results for key metrics in the quarter. Sean provided a good overview of how our business performed in Q1, highlighting our continued volume improvements in domestic retail, share gains, and strong productivity.\n\nTo most effectively unpack our Q1 results, I'll move to our segment performance on the next slide. Slide 23 shows the composition of organic net sales by segment, and also highlights the estimated impact of the Hebrew National manufacturing disruption on total company sales. Total organic net sales, excluding Hebrew, would have been down 2.6%, or 90 basis points better than the minus 3.5% we delivered. In Grocery and Snacks, we delivered organic net sales of approximately $1.2 billion, a decline of 1.9% versus last year's first quarter, primarily from lower volume. Price mix decreased slightly, a result of investments in selected brands partially offset by a price increase taken in the prior year on our tomato business.\n\nOur refrigerated and frozen segment delivered approximately $1.1 billion in net sales, a decline of 5.7% from prior year. volume and price mix were both impacted by the temporary manufacturing disruption in Hebrew National. Excluding Hebrew, we estimate that refrigerated and frozen net sales in the quarter would have been down 3.6%. volume for the quarter would have increased 1.6% and price mix would have been down 5.2%. Refrigerated and frozen price mix was impacted by pass-through pricing reductions in certain brands that were experiencing deflation, primarily in our spreads business. and increased trade merchandising investments, particularly in our frozen business.\n\nWe also experienced a shift in the mix of products sold, which was a headwind to price mix in the quarter. Our international segment delivered an organic net sales increase of 3% over prior year, driven primarily by another strong double-digit quarter in our global exports business. Finally, our food service business performance continued to be impacted by the lower margin business we exited that was first called out in our Q3 fiscal 24 call, along with ongoing softness and restaurant traffic. As Sean discussed, our food service business is larger and more profitable than it was at the start of the pandemic and remains an important contributor to the Conagra business portfolio.\n\nSlide 24 shows our net sales bridge. I've already unpacked the quarter's volume and price mix dynamics for you. The remaining elements are foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net sales by 40 basis points, largely driven by the US dollar to Mexican peso exchange rates, and 10 basis points of favorable impact from the acquisition of fatty smoked meat sticks.\n\nThe components of our Q1 Adjusted Operating Margin Bridge are shown on slide 25. Adjusted Operating Margin declined 244 basis points over prior year to 14.2%. In addition to the price mix and trade merchandising investments I've already discussed, we also saw year-over-year cost of goods sold inflation of 3.3%, primarily from proteins, sweeteners, and warehousing costs. SG&A was higher due to wrapping lower incentive compensation a year ago and foreign exchange was a headwind. Productivity improvements, which approximated 3.6% of cost of goods sold, helped fund our trade investments in the quarter. This productivity was partially offset by the impact of the Hebrew national disruption.\n\nWe don't expect these unfavorable costs to continue going forward.\n\nSlide 26, details are adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin performance by segment for Q1. All segments reported a decline from prior year and adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin, and all segments were impacted by the same dynamics. Primarily, lower organic net sales, which included increased merchandising investment, higher cost of goods sold inflation, and unfavorable operating leverage, partially offset by favorable productivity. Additionally, refrigerated and frozen adjusted operating profit was impacted by approximately $10 million from the manufacturing disruptions in Hebrew National, and our international segment saw an outsized negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe adjusted EPS bridge for Q1 fiscal 25 is shown on slide 27. Adjusted EPS was $0.53 in the current quarter compared to $0.66 a year ago due to a decline in adjusted operating profit, unfavorable FX rates, and lower equity earnings from Ardent Mills. Pension and adjusted taxes contributed one cent of EPS in the quarter. Our Ardent Mills joint venture continued to perform well in its core flower business, but delivered lower commodity revenue in Q1 compared to last year due to lower market volatility.\n\nKey balance sheet and cash flow metrics are shown on slide 28. Conagra generated $269 million in net cash flows from operating activities in Q1. The decline from prior year was driven primarily by lower operating profit and changes in seasonal working capital that we expect.\n\nCapital expenditures were $133 million, dividends paid were $167 million, and we resumed share repurchases of $64 million to offset dilution from our share-based equity incentive compensation plan. Our Q1 fiscal 25 ending net debt reduction from prior year reflects debt paydowns during fiscal 24 and includes funding the Q1 acquisitions of both the fatty smoked meat sticks business, as well as the manufacturing operations of an existing co-manufacturer of our cooking spray products. Net leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.6 times and was in line with our expectations as we remain on track to finish the fiscal year around 3.2 times.\n\nIn addition to the acquisitions in Q1, we also closed on the sale of our ATFL business in India. The net of those three transactions resulted in additional cash uses of approximately $154 million. We remain focused on reducing our net leverage and continuing to generate strong free cash flow.\n\nAs Sean said, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 25 guidance as shown on slide 29. I will provide some more color on the next slide. As we stated last quarter, when initially providing our full year fiscal 25 guidance, we expect sequential volume recovery each quarter, and we expect adjusted operating margin improvement to be greater in the second half. For Q2, we expect improvement in volume, top line and margin compared to Q1. We do expect our fiscal 25 merchandising investment to be at the highest level in Q2. Also, we are now forecasting full year fiscal 25 inflation of approximately 3.2% of total cost of goods sold.\n\nThat is up from approximately 3% originally projected for the year. We are seeing inflationary pressure primarily in the areas of proteins and sweeteners. While we are seeing deflation in select areas such as edible fats and oils, the net impact is a 20 basis point increase in the annual overall inflation estimate. We don't expect any material impact on fiscal 25 margin or adjusted EPS from our first quarter M&A transaction. But we expect a decrease in overall reported net sales of approximately $30 million for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our year-end net leverage target of approximately 3.2 times assumes expected favorability in free cash flow resulting from improved working capital, lower expected capital expenditures, and lower estimated cash taxes from a favorable tax settlement.\n\nAnd finally, we expect full-year adjusted gross margin to be relatively flat versus fiscal 24.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for your interest in Conagra Brands."

I'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bayle. Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. Let's start with the Q2 headlines shown here on Slide 5.\nAt a macro level, the industry-wide shift in U.S. consumer behavior that we discussed on last quarter's call persisted into the second quarter. These behavior shifts continued to pressure volume and mix. However, while the consumer is still deploying some value-seeking tactics when they shop, we are seeing clear progress when it comes to volume recovery. In Q2, that progress was most notable in our refrigerated and frozen segment, in particular, our frozen business. This inflection was helped by investments on key brands as we were seeking to understand consumer readiness to revert back to more typical purchase behaviors. We saw outstanding responsiveness that will inform our back half actions. More on that in a moment.\nThe net result was a clear improvement in volume trends with domestic retail volume loss that was half of what we saw in Q1. We delivered solid margins and EPS as well as excellent free cash flow conversion. Our productivity initiatives remain on track, although we also saw a [ self ] absorption impact from our volume declines.\nAs we look ahead to the second half, we have a robust investment plan in place, reflecting our increased confidence and consumer responsiveness to brand-building levers. Our goal is to continue to build momentum with our consumers as we move through the back half of the fiscal year and then enter fiscal '25 in a position of strength. I will share more on our multifaceted action plan in a few minutes.\nFinally, we are updating our guidance for fiscal '24, reflecting both the consumer environment and the additional brand investments in the second half of the year. After tremendous initial resilience in the face of a record inflation super cycle, U.S. consumer behavior shifts did emerge last spring in our industry as the cumulative effect of inflation caused consumers to begin to stretch their budgets. This resulted in a reprioritization of food choices as shoppers adjusted purchase behavior towards more stretchable meals. This slide reprises some of those shifts we discussed last quarter.\nAt that time, we told you that we expected these trends to be transitory. We still believe that to be the case. But the pace of the shift back to normal consumer behavior has been slower than we initially expected, and that pressured our volume, performance and mix in the second quarter. That said, the tide appears to be turning.\nWhen we discussed these behavior shifts last quarter, Frozen was one of our most impacted businesses, specifically our frozen single-serve meals. After 5 years of consistent strength, we saw some consumers looking to alternatives such as multi-serve meals and scratch cooking to stretch their budgets. We didn't expect that trend to be lasting as the unshakable consumer demand for convenience combined with Conagra-driven product innovation has generated strong frozen demand for a long time now.\nAs I noted in my opening remarks, we believe it's important to understand consumer readiness to resume more typical shopping behaviors before more fully ramping up investments to facilitate the process. We want to be confident that our investments will have the desired impact. With that in mind, during the second quarter, we did invest in certain key businesses to assess consumer response to increased brand building stimulus. Most noteworthy was our largest frozen business, single-serve meals where we deployed high-quality merchandising nationally. The results were very encouraging with lifts up 60%.\nThese lifts ultimately drove meaningful gains in our market share. As you can see on this slide, our Q2 share in this business approached 51%, eclipsing last year's gains and also setting a new record. The net of this is while the consumer is still stretched, they are responding to high-quality brand-building stimulus. And when you look at volume trends, while not yet positive, you can see that progress is clearly underway. Slide 9 shows volume results in our key U.S. retail segments both separately and combined.\nI'll draw your attention to the chart on the left, where you can really see the impact of our investment actions. As a result of these investments, Refrigerated & Frozen segment volume went from minus 10.5% in the first quarter to minus 3.3% in the second quarter coming in line with volumes in Grocery & Snacks. Overall, our targeted investments in Q2 helped cut the total domestic retail volume decline in half compared to the first quarter, not all the way back, but good progress.\nI'm also pleased to report that we continue to deliver momentum in our International and Foodservice businesses, which together account for approximately 18% of total Q2 revenue. International grew organic net sales by 5.6% in the quarter, while our two largest markets, Mexico and Canada delivered organic net sales growth above 9%. This was a result of our international team's outstanding execution including strong brand activation, improved point-of-sale performance, innovation that is resonating with our customers and expanded distribution in Mexico. Our Mexican business has now delivered four consecutive quarters of volume growth.\nIn Foodservice, we delivered organic net sales growth of 4.3% in the quarter, driven largely by favorable price mix as well as expanded distribution in our frozen portfolio, which accounted for roughly half of our total Foodservice business.\nSlide 11 details our second quarter results, including organic net sales of approximately $3 billion, which is down 3.4% compared to last year. Adjusted gross margin of 26.9% was down 129 basis points from last year, reflecting our targeted investments and the absorption impact associated with the volume decline. Adjusted operating margin of 15.9% was down 108 basis points compared to last year. And adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 was down approximately 12% versus last year.\nImportantly, we delivered strong free cash flow during the second quarter. Dave will cover this in more detail shortly. But as you can see on Slide 12, free cash flow in the first half of fiscal '24 was almost 6x what it was in the first half of fiscal '23. We used some of that free cash flow to pay down debt, bringing our net leverage ratio to 3.55x in the second quarter.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have a robust and multifaceted investment plan in place for the second half of the year, reflecting our confidence in consumer responsiveness to our brand-building efforts. On Slide 13, you can see images from our new advertising investments focused on our biggest brands, including Birds Eye, Healthy Choice and Slim Jim. You may have already seen some of the terrific work we've done this year with Slim Jim and the WWE, building on the heritage and built-in awareness of our long-term partnership with Wrestling Legend Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage.\nFiscal '24 is one of our biggest innovation slates yet. We are backing those launches with meaningful increases in slotting, in-store and other sales support versus the prior year. Slide 14 highlights some of the exciting innovation we've recently launched. If we have any Chili lovers on the call, I highly recommend our Wendy's Chili. You can get the true restaurant taste of this beloved Chili at home.\nFinally, Slide 15 highlights the investments we're making in high-quality merchandising. Our efforts are focused on reengaging consumers with our existing products, to capture market share as well as introducing consumers to our new innovation. The targeted investments we made during the second quarter give us confidence that our multifaceted brand-building investments in the second half of the year will drive momentum going into 2025.\nWe're updating our guidance for fiscal '24, reflecting both the consumer environment and the additional brand investments in the second half of the year. Our new guidance includes organic net sales decrease between 1% and 2% compared to fiscal '23, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.6% and adjusted EPS between $2.60 and $2.65.\nOverall, we remain confident in our brands, plans, people and agility as we continue to navigate this shifting consumer environment. With that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Slide 18 highlights our results from the quarter. Overall, our team executed well as we continue to navigate consumer behavior shifts that pressured our volume and mix.\nIn Q2, net sales were $3.2 billion. As Sean discussed earlier, this reflects a 3.4% decrease in organic net sales, driven primarily from lower year-over-year volumes. However, this is the third quarter in a row where the rate of volume change versus the prior year quarter improved. Amid these broader macroeconomic challenges and increased brand investments, we delivered solid margins and EPS along with strong free cash flow during the second quarter.\nAdjusted gross profit decreased by 7.6% in the quarter as the positive impact from productivity initiatives was offset by cost of goods sold inflation unfavorable operating leverage, lower organic net sales and increased trade investment. Adjusted operating profit decreased 9.3% and adjusted EBITDA decreased 7%, largely driven by the decrease in adjusted gross profit, partially offset by an increase in equity earnings driven by continued strong operating performance in our Ardent Mills joint venture. We delivered Q2 adjusted net income of $341 million or $0.71 per diluted share.\nSlide 19 provides a breakdown of our net sales for Q2. The 3.4% decrease in organic net sales was primarily driven by the consumer dynamics just discussed. Further contributing to the decline was a 0.5% decline in price mix which reflects an increase in strategic trade investments made during the period and an unfavorable mix impact from selling a higher percentage of lower sales dollar per unit items. This was partially offset by price increases taken on our tomato-based products given the continued high inflation. We also saw a small benefit from foreign exchange, which is reflected in our net sales decline of 3.2%.\nSlide 20 outlines the top line performance for each segment in Q2. While organic net sales were down in our domestic retail segments, we delivered sequential volume progress that benefited from the targeted strategic investment Sean discussed earlier. We also continued the strong momentum in our International and Foodservice segments, which delivered Q2 organic growth of 5.6% and 4.3%, respectively.\nSlide 21 shows our Q2 adjusted margin bridge. While our productivity initiatives remain on track, our margin was negatively affected by the continued impact of overhead absorption from our lower volumes. Cost of goods sold inflation was a headwind of 1.7% and price mix was a 0.6% headwind, which reflects the retailer investments made during the period. These factors combined drove the decline in adjusted gross margin for the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin benefited from small year-over-year favorability in A&P and SG&A.\nSlide 22 details our margin performance by segment for Q2. Adjusted operating margin in both our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments decreased due to the margin drivers I just discussed. Although inflation impacted the Grocery & Snacks segment at a higher rate than Refrigerated & Frozen. We were pleased that our Foodservice adjusted operating margin expanded 193 basis points and our International segment's adjusted operating margin expanded 30 basis points, both driven by higher organic net sales and productivity as both segments are showing consistent improvement. Foodservice also benefited from comparison to prior year Q2, which included supply chain disruptions.\nOur Q2 adjusted EPS performance of $0.71, was $0.10 below the prior year quarter, primarily from the decline in adjusted gross profit and pension income and higher interest expense. This was partially offset by slightly lower A&P and adjusted SG&A expense, along with increased equity method investment earnings driven by Ardent Mills. The A&P change was timing related, as we expect to increase A&P spending in the second half and the decline in SG&A was primarily the reduction in incentive compensation versus the prior year.\nSlide 24 displays the significant progress we made in the quarter and first half on free cash flow and our net leverage ratio. Over the first half of fiscal '24, we delivered a $532 million improvement in free cash flow with a conversion rate of approximately 97%, the highest first half conversion rate over the past five years. Our focus on managing inventory levels and improvement in accounts payable directly contributed to these strong results. In addition, we had strong cash distributions from Ardent Mills in the second quarter, reflecting the strong profit and cash flow performance of Ardent Mills the last few years.\nOur strong free cash flow has helped us deliver debt reduction during the period. At the end of Q2, our net leverage ratio was 3.55x, reflecting debt repayment of more than $500 million over the last 12 months.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we expect to continue our debt reduction efforts as we prioritize our long-term leverage target of 3x. We chose not to repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to prioritize paying down debt this fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate the best use of capital to optimize shareholder value as we progress through the fiscal year.\nAs mentioned, we are updating our guidance for fiscal '24 to reflect our year-to-date results, expectations for the slower pace of volume recovery and the additional brand investments in the second half. Slide 25 outlines our expectations for our three key metrics, including organic net sales to decrease between 1% and 2% compared to fiscal '23 with volumes continuing to improve through the back half of the year. Adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.6% and adjusted EPS between $2.60 and $2.65.\nTurning to Slide 26, I'd like to take a minute to walk through the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We expect net inflation to moderate through the remainder of the fiscal year, resulting in an inflation rate of approximately 3% for fiscal '24.\nRegarding pricing, there are a few dynamics currently at play. With our estimated 3% inflation rate, we are seeing areas that are still highly inflationary such as tomatoes and starches, which are up above the average and areas that are deflationary such as edible oils and dairy, which are below the average. These dynamics have resulted in both inflation-justified pricing actions and select pass-through price reductions included in our outlook. We expect that these dynamics, combined with our increased second half investments will result in price mix being down versus prior year in the second half.\nWe now anticipate CapEx spend of approximately $450 million in fiscal '24 as we continue to make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. As a result, we continue to expect to achieve gross productivity savings of approximately $300 million by the end of fiscal '24. We expect interest expense to approximate $440 million primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt. While we do not expect to receive any benefit from pension income, we expect Ardent Mills to contribute approximately $170 million to our bottom line due to its continued strong performance. Our full year tax rate estimate remains approximately 24%.\nAs I discussed, we are prioritizing our debt reduction efforts and expect to further reduce our outstanding net debt in the second half. Longer term, we remain on track to reach our 3x net leverage ratio target by the end of fiscal '26. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Napier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMelissa Napier\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relation\n\nGood morning, and thanks joining us for the Conagra Brands First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO, will first discuss our business performance, and then we'll open up the call for Q&A.\nOn today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. And while we are making these statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nWe will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP and adjusted numbers refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. Let's start with what we want you to take away from our presentation shown here on Slide 5. At an industry-wide level, macro dynamics have clearly impacted consumer behavior across the board. I will cover this in more detail shortly, but ultimately, this behavior shift has elongated the volume recovery period across the industry, which is reflected in our Q1 top line results.\nAs we've navigated these macro dynamics, I'm proud of the team for delivering another quarter of strong margin improvement and EPS growth. We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet improving our leverage ratio during the quarter while investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Our team's execution supported a strong supply chain recovery during the quarter, hitting pre-pandemic service levels as we exited Q1.\nLooking towards the remainder of the year, we will work to drive volumes and top line growth through targeted and disciplined investments behind prudent merchandising and continued support for our strong innovation. Finally, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24, reflecting confidence in our plans, people and agility as we navigate a shifting consumer environment.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, the timetable for volume recovery has been elongated across the industry due to near-term consumer behavior changes. After 3 years of unprecedented inflation, along with other macro dynamics, consumers have felt increased financial pressure and used a variety of strategies to stretch their balance sheet. This resulted in a near-term reprioritization of their typical purchase behaviors in order to make their budgets work. We've seen shifts like this before and expect these near-term changes in behavior to also be temporary. In fact, recent trends suggest this is already underway.\nLet me provide a bit more color on the kinds of behavioral shifts we've observed. As you've seen for some time now, with the notable exception of summer travel, discretionary purchases have been down almost across the board. Consumers have also been actively reducing remnant household inventory from the pandemic.\nWithin food, convenience-oriented items, typically a top consumer priority have lagged as shoppers have turned to more hands-on food prep to get additional bang for their buck. And as they've done this, not surprisingly, they have shifted from meals for one to meals for many, even if not everyone at home at the same time to be together.\nAnd the last shift, I will mention is a reduction in wasted food and an increase in the use of leftovers. Collectively, these short-term behavior shifts act as a sort of cheat code to help these consumers spend within their means. Slide 8 demonstrates the elongated volume recovery across the industry. As you can see, through the 4-week period ending August 26, the entire peer group was showing volume performance within a very tight band with Conagra in the middle of the pack. As I mentioned a minute ago, more recent trends are showing the first signs of improved performance.\nWith that backdrop, let's dive into our results shown on Slide 9. As you can see, in the quarter, we delivered organic net sales of approximately $2.9 billion, which is down slightly compared to last year as a result of the slower volume recovery we've discussed. Adjusted gross margin of 27.6% was up 272 basis points from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 16.7% was up 297 basis points compared to last year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 increased almost 16% versus last year.\nDiving further into our top line performance by retail domain, you can see on Slide 10, that sales in our Staples domain were flat compared to the prior year. As consumers shift toward more stretchable meals, our staples categories such as can Chile and can tomatoes are well positioned and have gained unit share compared to last year.\nDespite the macro headwinds, our snacks domain has continued to grow, as shown on Slide 11. We're building unit share as consumers continue to respond positively to our microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat pudding and gel brands.\nLooking at Slide 12, you can see that our frozen domain has been the most significantly impacted by recent shifts in consumer behavior particularly in areas like single-serve meals, given the headwinds we discussed a moment ago. As we look at the frozen domain, it's worth noting a few key points.\nFirst, despite the recent impact on volume, we continue to gain unit share in important frozen categories like single-serve meals. This dynamic demonstrates the relative strength and strong position of our brands.\nSecond, the year-over-year performance figures do not properly represent the broader trend within frozen food. In fact, if you look over a 4-year period, Conagra's frozen retail sales have increased 22%.\nFrozen meals has been one of the fastest-growing categories in consumption over the past 40 years. Its 4% CAGR is in the top tier of foods growing in at-home consumption. This expansion has been fueled by the long-term sustained consumer demand for convenience as well as the addition of innovation and quality ingredients. This 40-year trend demonstrates the critical role that frozen plays in providing convenient, high-quality foods for every occasion, which consumers have come to increasingly rely on. This is central to why we believe the current softness is temporary.\nTurning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to share that we continue to advance our supply chain initiatives during the quarter, allowing us to return our service performance back to pre-pandemic levels. Our productivity initiatives remain on track, and we plan to maintain and capitalize on this strong recovery during the rest of fiscal '24.\nThat's a key piece of our action plan for the remainder of the year, as outlined on Slide 15. In addition to our ongoing supply chain execution, we will continue to focus on executing our Conagra Way playbook as we make targeted and disciplined investments behind our brands. Help protect share and drive the top line, we're focused on investing behind quality, high ROI merchandising and A&P to support our brand. We'll also continue to prioritize reducing our debt and improving our net leverage ratio.\nWe are reaffirming our fiscal '24 guidance that we shared last quarter, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to fiscal '23. We adjusted operating margin of 16% to 16.5% and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75. Overall, we remain confident in our plans, people and agility as we continue to navigate this shifting consumer environment.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Slide 18 highlights our results from the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our profit and cash flow delivery and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance targets.\nIn Q1, net sales were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 0.3% decrease in organic net sales, driven primarily from the elongated recovery of volumes due to the industry-wide slowdown in consumption that Sean discussed earlier.\nGross margin recovery was a key priority for us in fiscal '23, and we delivered another strong result in Q1. Adjusted gross profit increased by 10.9% in the quarter, primarily from the pricing implemented in the prior year and strong productivity, which more than offset the negative impacts of cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable operating leverage. Adjusted gross margin increased 272 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA increased 12.1%, largely driven by the increase in adjusted gross profit.\nSlide 19 provides a breakdown of our net sales. The 0.3% decrease in organic net sales was driven by a 6.6% decrease in volume which was partially offset by a 6.3% improvement in price mix, a result of fiscal '23's inflation-driven pricing actions. A small benefit from the impact of foreign exchange contributed to reported net sales coming in flat for the quarter.\nSlide 20 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q1. Our Grocery & Snacks segment achieved net sales growth of 1.2% in the quarter. We gained dollar share in snacking categories, including seeds and microwave popcorn as well as in Staples categories, including Chili and [ Candy ]. As Sean discussed earlier, our Refrigerated & Frozen segment was the most impacted by recent consumer behavior shifts, with net sales down 4.6% in the quarter.\nOur International and Foodservice segments combined are slightly below 20% of our net sales. Both are important to Conagra and contributed meaningfully to growth this quarter. Our International segment delivered year-over-year volume growth in addition to improved price mix, which helped support strong organic net sales growth of 8.2% during the quarter.\nOur two largest international regions, Mexico and Canada delivered double-digit organic net sales growth over prior year. We also saw low single-digit volume growth in Mexico, which contributed to the segment's overall positive volumes. For the remainder of the year, we expect volume growth to continue in international.\nOur Foodservice segment delivered 5.2% net sales growth in Q1 from strong price mix, and we expect to see positive net sales growth in Foodservice for the fiscal year. Foodservice also delivered a strong gross margin in Q1 versus a year ago due to the reduction of supply chain disruption costs incurred in the prior year. This benefit is not expected to extend beyond Q1. Our Foodservice segment supplies a diverse set of clients beyond restaurants, including health care, travel and leisure and educational institutions, and we are well positioned to compete in these markets.\nSlide 21 highlights our adjusted operating margin bridge. We are pleased to have delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of strong gross margin improvement, up 272 basis points in Q1.\nWe drove a 4 percentage point improvement from price mix during the quarter. We also realized a 1.8 percentage point benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives along with the wrap of some supply chain disruptions in the prior year. These price and productivity benefits were slightly offset by cost of goods sold inflation, a margin headwind of [ 3.1% ]. Those factors, combined with small year-over-year favorability in A&P and SG&A, drove the 297 basis point improvement in operating margin for the quarter.\nSlide 22 details our margin performance by segment for Q1. Overall, continued progress on our productivity initiatives and positive price mix contributed to an increase in adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin across all four operating segments. It is worth noting that our Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued its very strong operating profit and margin recovery in the quarter with adjusted operating margin improving 294 basis points versus a year ago.\nOur Q1 adjusted EPS increased to $0.66, representing a 15.8% increase over the prior year. Higher adjusted gross profit and slightly lower A&P and adjusted SG&A were the positive contributors to our adjusted EPS performance in the quarter. These positives were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement nonservice income, decreased equity method investment earnings and higher interest expense.\nSlide 24 includes our key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. At the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.55x down from the end of fiscal '23. We will continue to prioritize reducing our debt and lowering our net leverage ratio in fiscal '24.\nNet cash flow from operations increased $180 million in the quarter, primarily driven by reduced investment in inventory versus the prior year. While CapEx investment increased by approximately $20 million, Q1 free cash flow more than doubled from a year ago, coming in at $300 million. This strong free cash flow enabled us to pay down approximately $130 million of net short-term debt while also funding $157 million for the Q1 dividend, highlighting our focus on balanced capital allocation. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to prioritize paying down debt.\nAs mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24, given the strong Q1 profit and margin performance and the confidence in our investment plans year-to-go as we continue to navigate a shifting consumer environment.\nSlide 25 outlines our current fiscal '24 expectations for our three key metrics, including: Organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal '23; adjusted operating margin between 16% to 16.5%; and adjusted EPS between $2.70 and $2.75. Let's take a closer look at how we expect to achieve that guidance during Q2 in the back half of fiscal '24 shown on Slide 26.\nDuring Q2, we expect to continue seeing low single-digit organic net sales decline, but volume decline should improve versus Q1 as we wrap inflation-driven pricing actions from fiscal '23. As Sean mentioned, we will redeploy some of our strong gross profit into strategic investments behind quality, high ROI merchandising and increased A&P to support our brands. We also expect operating margins to be down from Q1 with adjusted EPS approximately flat to Q1.\nIn the back half of the year, we expect volume trends to return to year-over-year growth, which will help drive low single-digit organic net sales growth. We expect our trade and A&P investments to be higher than the first half, with margins flat to Q2 and second half fiscal '24 adjusted EPS approximately flat to the same period in fiscal '23.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. I'll start with the business update on the quarter and fiscal year and then share how we're thinking about 2024 and beyond.\nSlide 6 outlines what we'd like you to take away from today's call. In Q4, we delivered solid profit and margin growth despite the disruption from one of our frozen logistics partners, Americold, which impacted both our sales and costs during the quarter. For the full fiscal year, I'm proud of the way our team navigated a dynamic operating environment to deliver strong results. These efforts to execute against our fiscal '23 strategic priorities, and the continued implementation of our playbook have our brands well positioned following the volatility of the past few years.\nAs you'll see, our outlook for fiscal year 2024 reflects a transition toward a more normalized operating environment as well as a continued commitment to our long-term financial algorithm.\nWith that overview, let's dive into the results, starting on Slide 7. Organic net sales for the quarter grew over 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and adjusted gross margin of 27% represents a 216 basis point increase over the fourth quarter last year. The full year results underscore the strength of our performance across all 4 metrics, including 6.6% organic net sales growth and 17.4% adjusted EPS growth compared to the prior year period, as well as robust gross and operating margin improvement.\nLooking back at our priorities going into fiscal '23, we're pleased to say that we delivered on each of them. We continued our disciplined pricing execution in the face of ongoing inflation, which helped to drive margin recovery a top priority coming into fiscal '23. Our supply chain continued to improve as we made meaningful progress on our cost savings initiatives, which in turn led to a vast improvement in service levels.\nWe remain committed to lowering our net leverage ratio, which was reduced from 4.0x to 3.6x by the end of the fiscal year. And we did all of this while investing to maintain the brand strength that we've built up for many years running.\nLet's take a closer look at these priorities, starting with the impact of our inflation-justified pricing actions on Slide 9. As you can see, pricing peaked in Q3 but remains almost 17% above the prior year due to our actions to offset ongoing COGS inflation. During the fourth quarter, elasticities did soften a bit, but remain fairly consistent well below historical norms and in line or better than competitors.\nOur strong execution was instrumental in driving margin recovery, which is detailed on Slide 10. As we've previously discussed, there is an inherent lag between the time when inflation hits and when we're able to recover that cost through inflation-justified pricing. This lag effect results in temporarily compressed margins as we saw, most notably throughout fiscal '22. We took great strides to recover our gross margin in fiscal '23, and Q4 was our third consecutive quarter of strong margin improvement up 216 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.\nTurning to Slide 11. We continue to advance our supply chain initiatives, investing to rebuild our own inventory which helped us to deliver service levels of 95% as we exited the fiscal year. While we're making strong progress in supply chain, it's not yet back to normal as we experienced transitory disruptions in the quarter such as the cybersecurity event at Americold. That said, we're pleased with our progress so far and see more room for improvement in fiscal '24, including investing in technology and modernization as the operating environment continues to normalize.\nSlide 12 highlights one of the key ways in which we are investing to maintain brand strength, our persistent focus on modernizing brands through innovation. The innovations we've launched since fiscal 2018 generated nearly $1.8 billion in retail sales during the last fiscal year. And unlike many in our space, we continue to innovate during the pandemic with new product launches since fiscal '21, now representing more than half of that total. Importantly, our innovation has built some really strong and sustainable platforms, including Bowls, Slim Jim Savage and Duncan Hines Epic.\nOur strategic frozen and snacks domains have been the focus of our innovation engine. As Slide 13 highlights, their growing domains and we've helped architect that growth. Over the past 4 years, the frozen and snacks categories in which we compete have grown 9% and 8%, respectively, outpacing total food growth. Within our portfolio, frozen and snacks together now represent almost 70% of our domestic retail dollar sales, and we've consistently increased our share within these strong and growing domains.\nLooking more closely at frozen. Slide 14 shows the growth of this category over the past 9 years, which represents the time frame in which we reinvented our approach to frozen food. Since fiscal 2014, the frozen categories in which Conagra competes have grown from $29 billion to $54 billion, representing a 7% CAGR. And Conagra has increased our share by nearly 500 basis points to become the leader in frozen. This growth is a testament to our continual effort to modernize and support our strong brands as part of the Conagra Way playbook.\nOne example of that brand strength is how our unit sales stack up to our peers. As you can see on Slide 15, even during the year of significant pricing 7 of our top 10 frozen product segments held or grew unit share in fiscal '23. The same is true in our snacks portfolio. As you can see on Slide 16, our 2 largest snacking platforms meat snacks and microwave popcorn also gained unit share during fiscal '23.\nNow let's turn to the year ahead. As we continue to emerge from unprecedented operating conditions, including both COVID and the inflation super cycle, we anticipate fiscal '24 to be a transition toward a more normalized operating environment. That transition will include a few tailwinds and headwinds that are outlined on Slide 19.\nStarting with the tailwinds. In fiscal '24, we will be wrapping the various discrete supply chain disruptions that persisted throughout the year. As the operating environment continues to normalize, we will also benefit from the ongoing advancement of our productivity initiatives, and we expect our investments in innovation to continue to deliver strong results, building upon our track record of success.\nNow let's talk headwinds. First, shifting consumer behavior. As you can see in the weekly scanner data, food companies are starting to wrap pricing in the year ago period and dollar sales are coming down as expected, but the rate of improvement in volume recovery is lagging. That suggests new consumer behavior shifts beyond the initial elasticity effects that occurred when pricing actions were initially taken.\nWe've seen this dynamic since just after Easter, and it has been broad-based across many categories and competitors. And importantly, where we see it, it is usually not a trade down to lower-priced alternatives within the category. Rather, it's an overall category slowdown. The question is, why now, given the steadiness we've seen from the consumer for 2 years? There are several possibilities at the root of this. One behavior shift we've heard about from consumers is just buying fewer items overall, more of a hunkering down than a trading down.\nThere are several potential reasons as to why, including this summer being more travel intensive than last year. Overall, we view this dynamic as likely temporary behavior shift for consumers to stretch their budgets, but we have captured it as a near-term headwind in our outlook.\nMoving to the second headwind. While very limited, we have seen a few single ingredient brands become deflationary, and we will make appropriate price adjustments to reflect that. Finally, the reduction of pension income and decline in contribution from Ardent Mills compared to its strong fiscal '23 performance will impact our earnings performance compared to the prior year.\nTo maximize our competitiveness this year, we will continue to execute our playbook and invest in our business. And Slide 20 highlights one of our most important investments, our biggest innovation slate to date. Our fiscal '24 innovation lineup features a compelling mix of convenient, value-added meals, restaurant experiences and exciting licenses. We expect our most significant new innovation to be in distribution by the end of Q1 and build throughout the rest of the year. These innovations, coupled with our consumer and customer support will help us effectively navigate the dynamic marketplace conditions.\nSlide 21 outlines our financial guidance for fiscal '24. We expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal '23, adjusted operating margin of 16% to 16.5% and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75. As Dave will unpack further, our EPS guidance reflects our expectation for growth from the underlying business operations, which is being muted by the previously mentioned impacts from lower contribution from Ardent Mills and pension income.\nOverall, Conagra continues to benefit from strong brands, strong processes and strong people, which are all working together to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion. With that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. As Sean noted, we've made great progress from this time 1 year ago, as shown on this page. We navigated a challenging operating environment and successfully delivered on our priorities to implement inflation-justified pricing, drive gross margin recovery reduced net leverage and rebuild inventory levels, all while investing to maintain the strength of our brands. This enabled us to deliver strong full year results that exceeded our original fiscal '23 expectations on all metrics.\nSlide 24 highlights our results from the quarter and full fiscal year. During fiscal '23, we delivered strong top line growth with full year organic net sales up 6.6% compared to fiscal '22, driven by our inflation-justified pricing and modest elasticities. Margin recovery was a top priority for fiscal '23 and our business delivered, increasing adjusted gross margin by 226 basis points and adjusted operating margin by 125 basis points for the full year. This margin enhancement contributed to strong full year adjusted EPS growth of 17.4%.\nSlide 25 shows our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year. The increases in fourth quarter and full year organic net sales were driven by improvements in price mix, primarily from inflation-justified pricing actions and were partially offset by a decrease in volumes. We estimate that our fourth quarter volume was impacted by the transitory supply chain disruptions from the cybersecurity incident at Americold, impacting revenue by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter.\nThis disruption negatively impacted sales in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment during the fourth quarter, an impact of approximately 110 basis points for the quarter. Despite this discrete situation in Refrigerated & Frozen, we were pleased to deliver solid sales growth in all other segments during the fourth quarter. And both our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments delivered 6.1% organic net sales growth for full year fiscal '23.\nWe detail our adjusted operating margin bridge on Slide 27. As Sean discussed, we are pleased to have delivered a third consecutive quarter of strong gross margin improvement, up 216 basis points in Q4. We drove a 7.1% margin gain from improved price mix during the quarter and realized a 40 basis point net benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with market inflation and market-based sourcing negatively impacting our margins by 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively.\nAdjusted operating margin was 14.6% for the fourth quarter which was a 39 basis point decline versus a year ago. The strong gross margin improvement was more than offset by increased A&P investment and an increase in SG&A from both higher incentive compensation expense and transitory asset write-offs in the quarter.\nOne additional call out on this slide. Our cost of goods sold inflation headwind of 5.4% as calculated by netting our Q4 market inflation and our market-based sourcing. Previously, market-based sourcing was captured in our net productivity column. We believe this format is more meaningful to investors, and this change will be applied in our materials going forward.\nSlide 28 details our margin performance by segment for Q4. Refrigerated & Frozen continued its strong operating profit and margin improvement in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin improving 286 basis points versus a year ago. Grocery & Snack operating margins were down 248 basis points due primarily to increased inventory reserves for excess seasonal inventory, along with unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption.\nThe International segment increased adjusted operating margin, 497 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by pricing, while the Foodservice segment adjusted operating margins were down 75 basis points due to some transitory asset write-offs. Also, as highlighted in our earnings release, results from our annual goodwill intangible impairment testing also negatively impacted reported profits primarily in our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments. The primary driver of the impairment charges was the increase in our discount rate due to the current interest rate environment.\nSlide 29 shows adjusted EPS bridges for the fourth quarter and full year compared to fiscal '22. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS from operations was flat as the increase in adjusted gross profit was offset by the increases in A&P and SG&A mentioned previously. Total EPS for Q4 was down 4.6% as the flat operating profit and benefit from our equity method investment earnings was more than offset by lower pension and postretirement income, higher interest expense and higher adjusted taxes.\nOn the bottom half of the slide, you can see that our year-over-year EPS growth of 17.4% and was entirely attributed to the operating profit increase of $0.41, which underscores the strength of the underlying business. The benefit of $0.11 from our Ardent Mills joint venture was offset by increased pension and interest expense.\nSlide 30 includes our key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. At the end of fiscal '23, our net leverage ratio was 3.63x, down from 3.99x at the end of the prior year. Our net cash flow from operating activities reflects continued investments to rebuild our inventory levels. Going forward, we are well positioned to support sustained demand across categories.\nYear-to-date CapEx was $362 million at the end of fiscal '23, down from $464 million in the prior year due to the timing of projects. We continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders as we paid $624 million in dividends in fiscal '23, up 7.2% versus fiscal '22, and we paid $150 million to repurchase shares in fiscal '23, up from $50 million a year ago.\nI'd like to spend a minute reviewing our guidance for fiscal '24. Slide 31 outlines our expectations for our 3 key metrics, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal '23, adjusted operating margin growth between 16% to 16.5% and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75.\nLet's take a closer look at the drivers of our adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 32. Compared to the prior year period, we anticipate continued improvement to our adjusted gross profit to be offset by the impact of elevated investments in A&P and SG&A to support our innovation and our people, higher interest expense from interest rate increases approximating $450 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%, net net to adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 4% in our underlying business operations or an adjusted EPS of $2.83 to $2.88.\nWe also expect the growth in our underlying business operations to be offset by lower income from our Ardent Mills joint venture as well as the reduction of pension income due to higher interest rates. As we previously discussed, Ardent Mills had a particularly strong fiscal '23 driven by favorable market conditions and the venture's effective management through recent volatility in the wheat markets. As we transition toward a more normalized operating environment, we expect lower Ardent Mills income of approximately $150 million in fiscal '24, which is still a very strong operating performance relative to historical results as Ardent continues to mature as a business.\nI will now unpack a few additional assumptions behind our guidance shown here on Slide 33. Again, we expect to see easing inflationary pressures and improved supply chain operations in fiscal '24, which is reflected in our outlook. We anticipate net cost of goods sold inflation of approximately 3% in fiscal '24 as we continue to emerge from the inflation super cycle, with targeted inflation-justified pricing actions that will become effective in the early second quarter of fiscal '24 to help offset elevated costs.\nFrom a supply chain perspective, we expect CapEx spend of approximately $500 million as we continue to make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. We also expect the investments we are making to drive gross productivity savings of approximately $300 million during fiscal '24. Finally, we expect to reach a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.4x and by year-end fiscal '24 and remain on track to reach our target net leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of fiscal '26.\nWe see fiscal '24 as a transition toward a more normal operating environment, and we are reiterating our commitment to the long-term financial algorithm we unveiled at our Investor Day in July 2022, as shown here on Slide 34. This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in our annualized dividend from $1.32 a share to $1.40 per share. This increase reflects confidence in our outlook and is in line with the targeted payout ratio.\nTo sum things up, we made outstanding progress in fiscal '23 and as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive value for shareholders. We believe Conagra is well positioned for long-term value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call.\nThank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Napier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMelissa Napier\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relation\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us for the Conagra Brands Third Quarter and First 9 Months of Fiscal 2023 earnings call. I'm here with Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO, who will discuss our business performance. We'll take your questions when our prepared remarks conclude.\nOn today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. And while we are making these statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantees about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nWe will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP and adjusted numbers refer to measures that exclude items management believes impacts the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. Slide 5 outlines what we'd like you to take away from today's call. Our top priority coming into fiscal year 2023 was margin recovery following the unprecedented environment of the last 2 years with COVID and the inflation supercycle.\nTo facilitate that margin recovery, our executional focus has been on inflation-justified pricing, supply chain improvements and the pruning of low-margin volume, a strategy we have successfully deployed before and refer to as value over volume. And 3/4 of the way into the year, our plan is working.\nIn Q3, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of strong gross margin recovery, our pricing execution continued to be excellent while elasticities remain muted and consistent. Our volume performance again led our near-end peers versus our pre-pandemic baseline and our supply chain continued to improve with service levels exceeding 90%.\nThis improvement allowed us to rebuild inventories to appropriate levels and support most of the strong demand from our customers, but there were exceptions as we experienced temporary manufacturing disruptions in certain categories that prevented us from being in stock. Despite this, we had strong results in the quarter overall, and we are updating our guidance for the year, including increasing our expectations for adjusted EPS growth and tightening the ranges for net sales growth and operating margins.\nWith that overview, let's dive into the results on Slide 6. We delivered organic net sales of approximately $3.1 billion representing a 6.1% increase over the prior year period. Our adjusted gross margin of 28.1% represents a 409 basis point increase over the third quarter of last year, and our adjusted operating margin of 16.9% represents a 321 basis point increase over that same period.\nAdjusted EPS rose 31% from last year to $0.76 per share. The year-to-date results underscore the strength of our performance with growth across all four metrics including 8.1% organic net sales growth compared to the prior year period and the robust margin improvements we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year.\nSlide 7 shows the sustained recovery of our gross profit margin for a second consecutive quarter. Again, this margin recovery was our top priority for the year. Why? Because our gross margins fund our innovation program, and that innovation has been the centerpiece of our playbook and our success in driving sustained category growth in our two strategic focus areas frozen and snacks. This recovery, therefore, means you should continue to expect a relentless stream of provocative innovation and brand-building support as we go forward.\nIn fact, looking at Slide 8, you can see that Conagra is one of the only companies in our peer set whose gross margins are essentially on par with pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, our brand strength and innovation pipeline position us well to maintain solid growth and healthy gross margin going forward. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our sales growth was primarily driven by inflation justified price increases coupled with ongoing muted elasticities.\nSlide 9 shows the relationship between elasticities and price increases. As you can see, elasticities have remained remarkably consistent and benign over the last 8 quarters, even as we increased the price per unit of our products to help offset ongoing COGS inflation.\nAnd Slide 10 shows our elasticities are among the best in the industry. The modest elasticities, which are well below historic norms and have remained consistent in the face of our inflation-justified price increases are a testament to the strength of our brands, the execution of our pricing strategy and the limited impact of private label competition.\nTurning to Slide 11. As you can see, at the total Conagra level, retail sales grew by 5.5% compared to the third quarter of last year and by 24.7% compared to 3 years ago. To put some context around the 5.5% number, three points: first, there was a fair amount of noise in the year-over-year comps for the peer set in Q3. Some companies had a very weak year ago period due to supply chain challenges while we had pockets of real strength in the year ago period due to Omicron and strong customer support for products that had recently come off allocation.\nSecond, we continue to prune low-margin volume, most notably resuming our opportunistic value over volume strategy on select brands. This included eliminating 10 for 10 promotions on both value tier vegetables and canned products such as Chef Boyardee and Hunt's Tomatoes.\nThird, we experienced manufacturing disruptions in certain categories that led to out-of-stocks in the quarter. Most notably impacted where our canned meals and sides businesses, specifically canned pasta, canned beans, canned chili and canned meat, all part of our grocery portfolio.\nIn Frozen, we had one noteworthy disruption as our fish business was on allocation, which led to out-of-stocks during the peak Lenten season. This was due to a fire on our fish frying line as reported in our second quarter 10-Q. While these discrete issues suppressed our volume in Q3, the root causes have been largely resolved, and we expect volumes to rebound sequentially from here.\nImportantly, when you take the noise out of the short-term view and compare our growth versus the stable baseline of 3 years ago, you see our performance has been strong on both the top and bottom lines. Dampening the results versus this time period normalizes for the volatility across demand, inflation and supply chain throughout the pandemic and demonstrates that Conagra is a top performer among our peer set.\nSlide 12 details our top line performance on a 3-year basis as measured over the prior 52 weeks and compared to our near-end peer group who are footnoted in alphabetical order at the bottom of the slide. Among this group, Conagra continued to rank second in dollar sales growth and first in unit sales performance just as we did in Q2.\nThis remains true when you look at the same chart isolating the third quarter. And post-Q3, the syndicated scanner data has shown our unit sales trends improving. In fact, in the 4-week period ending 3 25 are units ranked in the middle of our near-end peer group on a 2-year CAGR basis. Our continued top-tier pricing execution and volume performance is made possible by the strength of our brands and the superior relative value that our products provide to the consumer.\nLet's take a look at our top line performance during the third quarter by retail domain, starting with Frozen on Slide 14. We maintained our momentum, delivering strong retail sales growth on both a 1- and 3-year basis, improving 4% and 23%, respectively. This growth was driven by a number of our key categories, including breakfast sausages and single-serve meals. It's worth noting that this performance comes on top of very strong performance for our frozen domain in the year ago period when the Omicron outbreak influenced consumers' in-home eating behavior. For example, single-serve deals grew 12% last year, creating a 2-year stack of 18% in that category.\nTurning to Snacks on Slide 15. You can see a similar story. We drove a 7% increase in retail sales compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22 and a 39% increase over the third quarter of fiscal '20. The continued momentum in this domain is broad-based across a number of categories. Compared to last year, seeds was up over 22% and baking mixes and microwave popcorn both rose more than 10%. Meat snacks grew 6% year-over-year, building on top of the 22% growth in the year ago quarter, a period when meat snacks were coming off allocation and our customers were eager to fulfill demand for our leading products in this category.\nWe also continued to drive growth in our highly relevant staples portfolio despite the discrete supply chain challenges in some of our canned meals and sides businesses that I noted earlier. Our staples portfolio increased retail sales 7% compared to the third quarter of last year and 20% compared to the same period 3 years ago. This growth was led by WIP toppings, which grew more than 18% on a year-over-year basis.\nTurning to Slide 17. While we experienced transitory supply chain friction, we also continued to make progress on our supply chain initiatives during the third quarter, which benefited from continued headway on our ongoing productivity initiatives, which remain on track to achieve the targets we outlined at our most recent Investor Day, and more moderate increases in COGS as anticipated.\nThese improvements to our supply chain led to improvements in the service we provide our customers. While we're making good progress in supply chain, it's not back to normal and industry-wide challenges persist. However, we're recovering as expected, and we see more room for improvement as we advance our productivity initiatives, and the macro environment continues to normalize.\nOverall, we're confident we will deliver on our top line and margin guidance for the year, and we're raising our bottom line estimates. With that in mind, we are updating our guidance to reflect that we now expect organic net sales growth of 7% to 7.5%. We expect adjusted operating margin of 15.5% to 15.6%, and we're increasing our expectations for adjusted EPS growth to range from $2.70 to $2.75.\nBefore I hand the call over to Dave, I want to reiterate our confidence in the path ahead. We have successfully executed pricing actions in response to inflation, that inflation is moderating, and elasticities remain remarkably consistent and benign. We're moving past discrete supply chain disruptions and continue to make progress on our margin expansion initiatives such as productivity and value over volume, all within an environment that is normalizing.\nAnd as we look at more recent scanner data, we are already seeing improvements in sales trends and we expect that momentum to accelerate through the end of the fiscal year. Overall, Conagra continues to benefit from strong brands, strong processes and strong people, which are all working together to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials from the quarter in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by discussing a few highlights as shown on Slide 20. We delivered another quarter of strong results, reflecting the ongoing strength of our brands and successful execution of the Conagra Way playbook. In the quarter, organic net sales increased 6.1% due to inflation-justified pricing and continued muted elasticities, as Sean discussed.\nAdjusted gross margin increased 409 basis points to 28.1%, and adjusted gross profit dollar growth was up 23.9% for Q3 and 17.8% year-to-date benefiting from higher organic net sales and productivity initiatives, reflecting our focus on margin recovery. This increase in adjusted gross profit contributed to strong adjusted EBITDA growth of 21.1% in the quarter.\nLet me break down the drivers of our 6.1% organic net sales growth here on Slide 21. We delivered 15.1% improvement in price/mix from our inflation-justified pricing actions. This price improvement was partially offset by a 9% decrease in volume. If you simply apply Conagra's current and historically favorable 0.54 elasticity factor to the 15.1% price/mix, you will see that elasticity explains approximately 8 of the 9 percentage points of the volume decline. The remaining 1 percentage point volume decline is mostly from the supply chain disruptions we've discussed. And given our elasticities have been running at these favorable levels for some time now, this level of volume decline has been planned in our fiscal '23 sales and gross margin projections.\nSlide 22 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q3. We are pleased with the continued net sales growth across all four reporting segments. Our domestic retail portfolio continues to perform well. With net sales in our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments, up a combined 4.7%. Our International segment saw solid growth in the quarter with organic net sales up 9.5%. International reported net sales were up 7.7%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Finally, we continued to see strong recovery in our Foodservice segment, which grew 17.3% in the quarter.\nI'd now like to discuss our Q3 adjusted margin bridge found on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, we are pleased to have delivered a second consecutive quarter of strong margin recovery. We drove a 10.9% margin benefit from improved price/mix during the quarter and realized a 1.8% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with 8% gross market inflation impacting our operating margins by 5.9% and a negative impact of 2.8% from market-based sourcing. Finally, higher investment in A&P and adjusted SG&A during the quarter reduced margins by 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.\nSlide 24 breaks down our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment. While some supply chain challenges continued during the quarter, execution of pricing and improvements in our productivity and service levels allowed us to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion in each segment.\nTotal adjusted operating profit increased 30.8% to $522 million during the quarter despite an increase in adjusted corporate expense primarily due to increased incentive compensation. It is worth noting that we delivered 321 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in Q3 versus a year ago, while incurring incremental transitory costs in our Grocery & Snacks segment due to the supply chain challenges we've discussed.\nTurning to Slide 25. Our Q3 adjusted EPS increased by 31% or $0.18 per share compared to a year ago primarily driven by higher sales and gross profit as well as from a small benefit in taxes. Our Ardent Mills joint venture performance continued to be strong and has wrapped strong results from a year ago. These positives were partially offset by higher adjusted A&P and SG&A as well as lower pension and postretirement income and higher interest expense versus a year ago.\nYou can see on Slide 26, how we are continuing to strengthen our balance sheet metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.65x, down from 4.2x at the prior year period. Our net cash flow from operating activities reflects investment to rebuild our inventory levels. Improvement in our inventories has enabled us to improve service levels above 90%, and we are well positioned going forward in most categories to support sustained demand.\nYear-to-date CapEx was $267 million at the end of the quarter, down from $364 million in the prior year period, while year-to-date free cash flow increased to $436 million. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the year-to-date increase in our dividend payments and share repurchases.\nFor the balance of fiscal '23, we will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize shareholder value. As Sean mentioned, in response to our continued business momentum and ongoing operating dynamics, we are raising our fiscal '23 EPS guidance and narrowing our ranges for organic net sales growth and adjusted operating margin with only one quarter remaining in fiscal '23.\nTurning to Slide 28. I'd like to briefly discuss the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We continue to expect total gross inflation of approximately 10% for fiscal '23 and expect gross inflation to continue for the full calendar year 2023. We will update you at our Q4 earnings call in July with our inflation expectations for full year fiscal '24.\nWe expect our net leverage ratio at year-end to remain approximately 3.65x and anticipate CapEx spend of approximately $370 million for fiscal '23. This number is below our original expectations due to the timing of certain projects. We remain committed to making capital investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation.\nLastly, we expect interest expense to be approximately $410 million and pension and postretirement income to be approximately $25 million for the year, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our full year tax rate estimate remains approximately 24%.\nTo sum things up, we are proud that we delivered another strong quarter in fiscal '23 especially considering a supply chain environment that continued to present some challenges. Our service levels have improved and our margins continue to recover to pre-COVID levels, and we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities to generate value for our shareholders.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. I hope you all are off to a happy and healthy start to the new year. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. I'd like to start by covering some key points for the quarter on Slide 5.\nDespite our most recent wave of inflation-justified pricing, consumer demand for our products in the second quarter was strong as elasticities remained muted and well below historical norms. The ongoing durability of demand is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and demonstrates how the Conagra Way playbook has positioned our brands to continue to resonate with consumers even in an inflationary environment.\nThe successful execution of our playbook is clear in our second quarter results. We drove a significant increase in our top line. We continue to have solid share performance across the portfolio, especially in our key frozen and snacks domains, and we made excellent progress recovering both gross and operating margin.\nOperationally, we made good headway on our supply chain and productivity initiatives. While we're pleased with what we've accomplished to date, our supply chain is not yet fully normalized. That will improve. And overall, we see a long runway of opportunity ahead. We also continue to prioritize strengthening our balance sheet while making strategic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders. In short, Conagra had a strong quarter across the board.\nGiven our positive results during the first half of fiscal '23, we have increased our expectations for the year, raising our full year guidance across all metrics, including organic net sales growth, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted earnings per share.\nWith that overview, let's dive into the results on Slide 6. As you can see, we delivered organic net sales of more than $3.3 billion, representing an 8.6% increase over the prior year period. Our adjusted gross margin of 28.2% represents a 310 basis point increase over the second quarter of last year. And our adjusted operating margin of 17% represents a 237 basis point increase over that same period. Adjusted EPS rose 26.6% from last year to $0.81 per share.\nSlide 7 goes into more detail on our sales results on a 1- and 3-year basis. Given the timing when the pandemic and inflation began to impact our industry, we believe that the 3-year comparison provides important context to highlight the underlying strength of our performance. At the total Conagra level, we grew retail sales more than 10% on a 1-year basis, and more than 26% on a 3-year basis.\nWe're pleased with our solid share performance, including how our strong brands allowed us to largely maintain total company market share while taking several inflation-justified pricing actions, particularly during the past year. Notably, we've continued to drive robust share gains in key frozen and snacks strategic domains, on both a 1- and 3-year basis.\nI want to spend a minute putting our sales growth in context. Slide 8 shows our performance over the past 3 years compared to our near-end peer group, including Campbell's, General Mills, Kellogg's, Kraft Heinz, Smucker's. We have a great deal of respect for our peers, all of which have been navigating the same macro demand and inflation dynamics over the past 3 years. Among this group, Conagra ranked second in dollar sales growth and first in unit sales performance.\nIt's important to keep in mind that all of these peers have taken pricing actions to help offset inflation and Conagra is in the middle of the peer set in terms of the price per unit increases in this time period. It's clear that consumers continue to appreciate the quality, convenience and superior relative value that our strong brands have to offer, which has enabled Conagra to perform extremely well on both on absolute and relative basis.\nLet's take a closer look at our top line performance during the second quarter by retail domain, starting with Frozen on Slide 9. We maintained our momentum, delivering strong retail sales growth on both a 1- and 3-year basis, improving 9% and 26%, respectively. This growth was driven by a number of our key categories, including breakfast sausages and single-serve meals, which both experienced double-digit retail sales growth compared to last year.\nTurning to Snacks on Slide 10. You can see a similar story. We drove a 14% increase in retail sales compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22 and a 41% increase over the second quarter of fiscal '20. The continued momentum of our Snacks business is broad-based across a number of categories. Compared to last year, microwave popcorn was up 21%, seeds was up 18%, and meat snacks and hot cocoa both rose more than 14%.\nWe also accelerated growth in our highly relevant staples portfolio, increasing retail sales 10% this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year and 22% compared to the same period 3 years ago. This growth was led by pickles and whipped toppings which grew more than 11% and 10%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. As I've mentioned, our strong top line performance was primarily driven by inflation-justified price increases, coupled with ongoing muted elasticities.\nSlide 12 details the relationship between pricing and volume over time. As you would expect, increased pricing does have an impact on volume, both for Conagra and the total industry. However, you can see how elasticities have remained steady even as we have continued to increase the price per unit of our products to help offset ongoing COGS inflation. And as we detailed a few minutes ago, Conagra's 3-year CAGR on unit sales performance leads its near-end peer group. The relatively modest elasticities, both compared to historic norms and our peers, are a testament to the strength of our brand.\nNow that we've unpacked the relationship between price and volume and the resulting net sales, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the relationship between net sales and COGS and the resulting impact on our margin performance on Slide 13. Generally speaking, when a business has strong brands, strong processes and strong people, as Conagra does, it is able to navigate inflationary cycles in discrete, predictable phases.\nAs we have detailed for some time, when unprecedented inflation increased our cost of goods, we took strategic pricing actions to help offset the rising costs. However, there was an inherent lag between when we implemented pricing actions and when we realize the benefits of those actions in our top line results, this pricing lag resulted in temporary margin compression. Furthermore, continued inflation extended this period of margin compression as new inflation-justified pricing actions led to additional lag effects.\nThat is the dynamic we have experienced over the last several quarters as we continue to play catch-up by increasing price incrementally to account for the extraordinary extended rise in inflation. At the end of the first quarter, we reached a significant inflection point in the relationship between net sales and COGS, marking the end of the temporary margin compression phase in the beginning of the margin recovery phase. As you can see in the chart, inflation has begun to moderate in certain areas, enabling our inflation-justified pricing actions to catch up to the rising costs.\nSlide 14 shows the impact this inflection has had on our gross margin results, as continuously rising inflation weighed on our COGS throughout fiscal '22 and into the first quarter of fiscal '23, our margins were compressed. Now predictably, as pricing has finally caught up to COGS inflation, you can see the recovery of our gross margin to be more in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile our gross margin can vary quarter-to-quarter due to a range of internal and external factors, the strategic pricing actions we have successfully executed, combined with moderating inflation and our strong brands, position us well to recover and maintain a healthy gross margin going forward. Of course, inflation remains elevated in many areas, and we continue to closely monitor our costs, just as we have in the past. We will continue to take appropriate inflation-justified pricing actions as needed.\nAnother key driver of our margin recovery is our supply chain performance shown on Slide 15. This is due to a combination of macro factors as well as the strategic initiatives we are executing to improve our operations. We made good progress on our supply chain during the second quarter, which benefited from improvements in the service we provide to our customers, continued headway on our ongoing productivity initiatives, which remain on track to achieve the targets we outlined at our most recent Investor Day, more moderate increases in commodity prices and improved inventory levels due to an increase in the availability of materials.\nThe takeaway here is that we're pleased with the progress we're making, but industry-wide challenges do persist. There's more room for improvement as we advance our productivity initiatives and the macro environment continues to normalize. As a result of our strong performance this quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2023, we are raising our full year guidance for all metrics detailed here on Slide 16.\nWe now expect organic net sales to grow between 7% and 8% compared to fiscal '22; adjusted operating margin to be between 15.3% and 15.6%; and full year adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14% or $2.60 to $2.70 per share. Dave will provide more detail on the underlying assumptions behind these expectations.\nBefore I turn the mic over, I want to summarize what I've covered today. Our strong performance during the first half of fiscal '23 was primarily driven by a combination of inflation-justified pricing actions and muted elasticity, reflecting the strength of our brands. Consumers continue to recognize the value our brands provide despite the higher prices, allowing us to gain share in key domains such as frozen and snacks.\nOur top line growth was coupled with encouraging progress in a number of different areas of our supply chain that enabled us to operate more efficiently. Together, these factors as well as improvement in the inflationary environment helped us recover our margins to near pre-pandemic levels. As a result of our strong performance, we're raising our full year fiscal '23 guidance for organic net sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS.\nFinally, we're looking forward to seeing everyone who can make it to CAGNY this year. We plan to host our annual kickoff dinner on February 20 and are scheduled to present the following morning. We will follow up with more details on the event as we get closer.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials from the quarter in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by discussing a few highlights from the quarter as shown on Slide 19. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect the ongoing strength of our business and successful execution of the Conagra Way playbook. For the quarter, we delivered organic net sales growth of 8.6%, primarily driven by inflation-justified pricing and muted elasticities.\nAdjusted gross margin increased to 28.2% and adjusted gross profit dollar growth was up 21.7%, benefiting from higher organic net sales and productivity initiatives. The increase in adjusted gross profit, combined with another strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, contributed to adjusted EBITDA growth of 21.5%.\nSlide 20 provides a breakdown of our net sales. As you can see, the 8.6% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 17% improvement in price/mix, which was a result of inflation-justified pricing actions that were reflected in the marketplace throughout the quarter. This was partially offset by an 8.4% decrease in volume, primarily due to the elasticity impact from those pricing actions. However, the impact was favorable to both expectations and historical levels.\nSlide 21 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q2. We are pleased with the robust net sales growth across our entire portfolio. Net sales growth in our domestic retail portfolio remained strong, with our Grocery & Snacks segment and Refrigerated & Frozen segment achieving net sales growth of 6.8% and 10.5%, respectively. The difference between the organic and reported net sales performance in our International segment reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\nI'll now discuss our Q2 adjusted margin bridge found on Slide 22. We drove a 12.2% benefit from improved price/mix during the quarter, driven by the previously discussed inflation-justified pricing actions. We also realized a 1.3% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with 11% gross market inflation negatively impacting our operating margins by 7.5% and a negative margin impact of 2.9% from market-based sourcing.\nAs a reminder, as commodity prices rose quickly last year, we benefited from locking in contracted costs that were lower than the market. Even though we see commodity inflation moderating, we will not immediately realize a benefit to the P&L as our costs may remain higher than the spot market due to the timing of our contracts and when they roll off.\nSlide 23 breaks down our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment. As Sean detailed, our decisive inflation-justified pricing actions, coupled with improved service levels and productivity, allowed us to successfully navigate ongoing inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply chain challenges and deliver adjusted operating margin expansion in each segment during the quarter. We were also pleased that higher sales and productivity, once again, offset headwinds from inflation and elevated supply chain operating costs across all four segments in Q2.\nAs a result of this continued strong performance, total adjusted operating profit increased 25.9% to $563 million during the quarter despite an increase in adjusted corporate expense during the period primarily due to increased incentive compensation.\nSlide 24 shows our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter. Q2 adjusted EPS increased $0.17 or 26.6% compared to the prior year. This significant increase was primarily driven by higher sales and gross profit as well as a small benefit from a continued strong performance from Ardent Mills.\nSlightly offsetting these positives were higher A&P and adjusted SG&A compared to the prior year period as well as lower pension and postretirement income, higher interest expense and the impact of adjusted taxes.\nSlide 25 reflects the continued progress we made on our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet. Our net leverage ratio remained at 3.9x at the end of Q2, down from 4.3x at the end of Q2 in the prior year period. As we have previously communicated, Q2 is historically a heavier use of cash quarter from a working capital perspective. So we expect progress on our net leverage reduction to be greater in the back half of the year. With that in mind, we continue to expect to end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of roughly 3.7x.\nYear-to-date CapEx of $188 million decreased by $69 million compared to the prior year period, while free cash flow increased by [$104] million year-over-year. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by our payment of $159 million in dividends in Q2 fiscal '23 and $309 million year-to-date. The first half dividend increase of $27 million compared to the first half of fiscal '22, reflects the quarterly dividend rate of $0.33 per share.\nWe also repurchased $100 million worth of shares in the second quarter and $150 million worth of shares year-to-date to offset most of the longer-term performance-based shares we estimate issuing. As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize shareholder value.\nAs Sean mentioned, we are raising our fiscal '23 guidance for net sales growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal '23 and expectations for a solid performance for the balance of the year.\nTurning to Slide 27. I'd like to take a minute to walk through the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We expect gross inflation to continue, but moderate through the remainder of the fiscal year, resulting in an inflation rate of approximately 10% for fiscal '23. Additional inflation-justified pricing actions that have previously been communicated and accepted, will go into market in Q3. However, the magnitude of these pricing actions will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always, we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price as needed to manage future volatility.\nWe anticipate CapEx spend of approximately $425 million in fiscal '23 as we make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. Approximately $200 million of the $425 million was spent in the first half of fiscal '23.\nLastly, we expect interest expense to approximate $405 million and pension and postretirement income to approximate $25 million for the year, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our full year tax rate estimate remains approximately 24%.\nTo sum things up, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of fiscal '23, especially the recovery of Q2 adjusted gross margins to near pre-COVID levels. This, along with our expected continued positive business momentum led to raising our full fiscal year '23 guidance.\nOur strong performance amid such a dynamic environment would not be possible without the hard work of our entire team and reflects the ongoing strength of our brands and successful execution of the Conagra Way playbook.\nLooking forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic business priorities and generating value for our shareholders.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening.\nI'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Napier. Please go ahead.\n\nMelissa Napier\n\nSVP of Investor Relation, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us for the Conagra Brands First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I'm here with Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO, who will discuss our business performance. We'll take your questions when our prepared remarks conclude.\nOn today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. And while we are making these statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nWe'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP and adjusted numbers refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. Let's jump right in with what we want you to take away from our presentation shown here on Slide 5.\nOverall, Conagra delivered strong first quarter results. We had robust net sales growth across our portfolio, mainly due to the impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions, coupled with ongoing limited elasticities.\nWe continued to gain market share at the total portfolio level, particularly within our strategic Frozen & Snacks domains, and drove solid profit improvement during the quarter. We also saw another strong performance from Ardent Mills as effective management enabled the joint venture to continue capitalizing on volatility in the wheat markets.\nOur supply chain productivity continued to improve. However, we experienced some internal and external operational challenges during the quarter like many of our peers. These challenges led to both increased costs and inefficiencies, which more than offset the benefits from improved productivity and impacted our business in the quarter. I'll unpack this later in the presentation.\nWe also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our leverage ratio during the quarter while investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders.\nFinally, our solid start to the year reaffirms our confidence in the fiscal '23 guidance we announced last quarter.\nWith that backdrop, let's dive into the results shown on Slide 6. As you can see, in the quarter, we delivered organic net sales of just over $2.9 billion, representing a 9.7% increase over the year ago period. Adjusted operating margin of 13.7%, which is down slightly compared to last year as a result of the supply chain inefficiencies, I mentioned a moment ago, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.57, 14% higher than what we generated last year.\nSlide 7 breaks down our strong sales performance during the quarter. At the total Conagra level, retail sales grew by almost 9% compared to the first quarter of last year and just over 24% compared to 3 years ago. Our momentum continued as we gain share in the marketplace, demonstrating the valuable connection our brands have with consumers. These share gains are most pronounced in our Frozen & Snacks domains, which increased share 0.8 and 1.5 percentage points on a 1- and 3-year basis, respectively.\nDiving further into our top line performance by retail domain, you can see on Slide 8 that Frozen generated a significant acceleration of quarterly sales growth on a 1- and 3-year basis of 8% and 27%, respectively. Clearly, our focus on catering to consumer preferences for convenience, quality and great taste continued to resonate. Similar to prior quarters, this growth was led by key categories such as plant-based protein and single-serve meals, which, along with breakfast sausages, increased sales by double digits compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22 while gaining market share from our competitors.\nOur Snacks domain also continued to deliver strong sales growth on a 1- and 3-year basis shown here on Slide 9. Compared to the first quarter last year, Snacks retail sales increased 13%. And as you can see, we have delivered sustained growth versus the period 3 years ago, including 36% in the recent quarter. In particular, we saw significant growth in sales of microwave popcorn, which increased more than 20% compared to the prior year.\nOur highly relevant Staples domain also accelerated sales growth, increasing 8% compared to the prior year and 15% versus 3 years ago. This was driven by strong performance in single-serve dinners and entrees with toppings, pickles and canned tomatoes.\nSlide 11 highlights the relationship between price and volume over time. As I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we continue to take strategic pricing actions during the first quarter to help offset ongoing COGS inflation. As you would expect, pricing has driven some volume elasticities both for Conagra and the overall industry. This tends to be most acute in the immediate aftermath of new pricing and wanes over time as consumers adjust. As you can see at the bottom of this slide, our net elasticities have remained nearly flat over the past few quarters. These relatively modest elasticities, both compared to historic norms and our peers, are a testament to the strength of our brands.\nAs we monitor the impact of our pricing actions on volume, we also look at the relative impact between branded foods and private label. As you can see on Slide 12, private label has increased its dollar share of certain categories on average since 2019, including a jump in share gains at the beginning of this calendar year. However, it's worth noting that those share gains are much more modest in the categories in which we compete. We're confident that the continued investments in our brands as part of the Conagra Way will ensure they continue to resonate with consumers. These important efforts, combined with our limited exposure to private label, will help us retain the market share we've gained during the pandemic.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dave, I want to talk about Conagra's supply chain and both the improvements and inefficiencies I referenced earlier. As I said, our supply chain continues to make progress. Pricing actions we implemented in the quarter and over the last year were largely able to offset continued inflation, and our service metrics continued to improve in Q1. While we're pleased with what we've accomplished to date, our supply chain is not yet fully normalized. We've continued to see some discrete inefficiencies pop up that resulted in higher costs in Q1.\nI'll give you 2 examples to illustrate this. In our Foodservice business, we identified an off-spec finished good issue while producing product for a customer. We disposed of the product and lost manufacturing time during our diagnostic. This pulled sales and gross margin below where they should have been.\nMy second example is in our canned chili and beans businesses where late, in Q1, we found cans that were off-spec. No product was recalled. And while production is now back up and running properly, the lost inventory effect will linger into Q2, impacting volumes and margins. The point is, these types of challenges can result in downtime needed to determine and solve the root cause of the issue as well as proper testing to ramp production back up. That lost time can result in higher costs and less production.\nLooking ahead, we're not expecting these discrete supply chain interruptions to disappear overnight as the external environment remains dynamic. But despite these transitory disruptions, we are making good progress in the supply chain, with core productivity continuing to improve. Accordingly, we remain committed to our operating margin target for the year and to the productivity targets we announced at our Investor Day in July.\nIn summary, we're off to a strong start in fiscal '23 fueled by robust top line growth as a result of inflation-driven pricing increases and muted elasticities. Operationally, we continue to make progress in our specific areas of focus.\nFor the balance of the year, we're planning for the operating environment to remain dynamic. While we expect consumer response to our brands to stay strong, we are planning for this quarter's volumes to be impacted by the supply chain disruptions, I just outlined, and from our most recent wave of inflation-driven pricing introduced to the market in early Q2. However, as I covered earlier, we expect this elasticity to wane over time. And while inflation remains persistent, we are starting to see moderation in certain areas and anticipate relief for commodities as the year unfolds.\nOverall, we're off to a great start. But 1 quarter doesn't make a year, and we remain focused on delivering for our customers and consumers. We continue to see a clear path to achieving the guidance we issued for fiscal '23 behind the strength of our brands and ongoing productivity initiatives, leading us to reaffirm those targets.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Dave.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by discussing a few highlights from the quarter, as shown on Slide 16.\nOverall, we are pleased with our start to fiscal '23 and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance targets. We delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9.7% in Q1, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers. Adjusted gross margin came in at 24.9% in line with expectations. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth was up 7.1%, benefiting from higher organic net sales and continued progress on supply chain productivity initiatives, although supply chain operational challenges did impact our business, as Sean referenced.\nThe Ardent Mills joint venture continues to operate as an effective inflation hedge as favorable market conditions and effective management drove another strong quarterly performance reflected in the equity earnings line and contributing to adjusted EBITDA growth of 9.1%.\nTurning to Slide 17. The 9.7% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 14.3% improvement in price/mix, a result of continued inflation-driven pricing actions. This was partially offset by a 4.6% decrease in volume primarily due to the elasticity impact from those increases. The small headwind from the impact of foreign exchange was the final contributor to net sales during the quarter.\nSlide 18 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q1. As mentioned, we are pleased with the robust net sales growth and continued share gains across our entire portfolio, particularly within our domestic retail businesses. Our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments achieved net sales growth of 10.5% and 9.6%, respectively. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was reflected in the net sales decrease for our International segment.\nI'd now like to spend some time discussing our Q1 adjusted margin bridge found on Slide 19. We drove a 10.5% benefit from improved price/mix during the quarter, reflecting previously communicated pricing actions. We also realized a 1.2% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives, which is net of operational inefficiencies Sean discussed. These price and productivity benefits were muted by continued inflationary pressure, with 15% gross market inflation impacting our operating margins by nearly 11%.\nMarket-based sourcing had a negative margin impact of 1.6%. As commodity prices rose quickly last year, we benefited from locking in contracted costs that were lower than the market and have rolled off this quarter. As a reminder, even when commodity inflation eases, we will not immediately realize a benefit as our costs may remain higher than the spot market due to timing of contracts. This is transitory and a product of a dynamic operating environment.\nSlide 20 breaks down our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment. We were pleased that higher organic net sales and supply chain productivity drove increased adjusted operating profit growth across 3 of our 4 segments in Q1. The strength of our Grocery & Snacks segment stands out on this slide, with adjusted operating margin in the segment increasing by 90 basis points compared to a year ago. Although Refrigerated & Frozen operating margin was down 21 basis points in Q1, this segment's gross margins were better than Q4 gross margins, demonstrating gross margin inflection that we expect to continue year to go. Inflation, supply chain pressures and elevated operating cost headwinds offset higher sales and realized productivity in our Refrigerated & Frozen, Foodservice and International segments.\nBefore unpacking adjusted EPS on Slide 21, I'd like to provide some context on the goodwill and brand impairment charges that impacted our reported numbers. During the quarter, we made the decision to reorganize the reporting structure for certain brands in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. In connection with these changes and in accordance with GAAP, we conducted an evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Given the increases in the current interest rate environment, which has further increased from the rates we recently used in our standard Q4 impairment testing, a higher discount rate primarily drove the noncash goodwill and brand impairment charges of $386 million for the quarter in reported SG&A expenses. The charges are not shown on the slide because they do not impact our adjusted numbers, but all reconciliations can be found in the tables at the back of this presentation.\nOur Q1 adjusted EPS increased $0.07 or 14%. Higher sales and gross profit, Ardent Mills' strong performance and a slight benefit from adjusted taxes were the primary positive contributors to our adjusted EPS performance in the quarter. These positives were offset by higher adjusted SG&A from the comparison to lower incentive compensation in the prior year's first quarter as well as lower pension and postretirement income and higher interest expense.\nYou can see how we are continuing to strengthen our balance sheet on Slide 22. At the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.9x, down from 4x at the end of fiscal '22. We expect to end fiscal '23 with a net leverage ratio of roughly 3.7x. Keep in mind that historically, Q2 is a heavier use of cash quarter from a working capital perspective. So we expect progress on our net leverage reduction to be greater in the back half of the fiscal year.\nCapEx decreased by $30 million year-over-year to $125 million during the quarter, while free cash flow increased $138 million from negative $15 million in Q1 '22, partially due to the accelerated receipt of outstanding receivables as we capitalized on certain customer payment terms. We paid $150 million in dividends in Q1 fiscal '23, an increase of $18 million compared to Q1 a year ago, highlighting our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. And we repurchased $50 million worth of shares in the first quarter in line with our stated objective of offsetting dilution from our share-based incentive compensation plans. We will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to optimize shareholder value as we progress through the fiscal year.\nOnce again, we are reaffirming our fiscal '23 guidance across all metrics given our strong quarter and expectations for solid performance for the balance of the year.\nBefore opening up the call for questions, I want to walk through the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We continue to expect the inflationary environment to persist, but moderate through calendar year '23, which will result in a low teens inflation rate for our fiscal year '23 weighted toward the first half of the fiscal year. We also expect previously communicated pricing actions in light of these costs to become effective early in the second quarter, likely causing volume to decline. We recently communicated some additional pricing that will be effective in Q3. However, the magnitude will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always, we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price as needed to manage future volatility.\nWe expect CapEx spend of approximately $500 million in fiscal '23 as we make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation.\nFinally, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $410 million, and pension and postretirement income to be approximately $25 million for the year driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our full year tax rate estimate is approximately 24%.\nTo reiterate, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and remain confident in our outlook for fiscal '23. Our ability to deliver solid results amidst such a dynamic environment is a testament to the hard work and skills of our team, the strength of our brands and our execution of the Conagra Way playbook.\nThank you for listening. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal '22 earnings call. I'll start with what we would like you to take away from the call this morning.\nThroughout fiscal '22, our team took decisive actions to offset inflation and invest in our business. We faced heightened costs throughout the year, but inflationary pressures were especially high in the fourth quarter. As a result, we implemented additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset the impact.\nWe continued to make deliberate strategic investments in our business to better serve our customers and meet the strong consumer demand for our products as physical availability is an important part of maintaining and building trust and loyalty. I'm pleased that our brands continue to resonate with consumers demonstrated by broad-based share gains within the portfolio, particularly within our most strategic domains of frozen and snacks.\nWe are continuing to drive growth, gain share in attractive categories, and we remain disciplined in executing the Conagra Way to create lasting connections with consumers.\nAs we've communicated throughout the year, the external factors I touched on a moment ago, as well as investments we made to maximize service and product availability in the face of supply constraints, all contributed to increased margin pressure.\nWe continue to pull levers to manage these factors and we were pleased to see margin improvement materialize in the fourth quarter in Grocery & Snacks as well as Foodservice. This represents an important inflection point that we expect will extend to our Refrigerated & Frozen and our International businesses within fiscal '23.\nI also want to highlight the strong fourth quarter performance of our joint venture, Ardent Mills, which effectively managed through recent volatility in the wheat markets and continued to prove an effective hedge against inflation.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '23, we expect to see continued strength in our sales driven by strong innovation, the impact of pricing actions and progress in the supply chain to help offset continued inflation and elasticities. While we expect elasticities to increase incrementally from fiscal '22 levels as more inflation-justified pricing comes to market, we believe they will remain below historical levels. These expectations are reflected in the fiscal '23 guidance we're providing today. With this expected macroeconomic backdrop, we are lowering our long-term leverage target which Dave will discuss later. As you know, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and keeping our investment-grade credit rating remain important to us.\nWith that overview, let's take a look at the results. While we had planned for high inflation, it was higher than we anticipated. Slide 7 shows our cost of goods increased 16% in fiscal '22, far higher than the 9% we anticipated at the time of our fiscal '21 fourth quarter call a year ago.\nInflation was particularly acute during the fiscal '22 fourth quarter when our cost of goods sold were 17% higher than a year ago period and 24% higher on a 2-year basis. The elevated levels of inflation we experienced in fiscal '22, particularly in the fourth quarter, required decisive actions in response. A critical part of that response included the inflation-justified pricing we implemented throughout fiscal '22.\nOn Slide 8, you can see the change in on-shelf pricing by quarter. On-shelf prices for our brands rose across all 3 domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago and also increased in Q4 as we experienced additional inflationary pressures. We closely monitor the impact of these pricing actions on volumes. We've been pleased that price elasticity has remained below historical levels.\nSlide 9 demonstrates that unit sales have stayed largely consistent on a 3-year basis even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. Even in Q4, as more significant inflation-justified pricing took effect, the increase in elasticity was relatively modest and below historical norms.\nAs we monitor the impact of our pricing actions on volume, we look at the relative impact between branded foods and private label. While private label is gaining some share more broadly in food, we have not seen notable migration toward private label in the heavily branded categories in which we compete.\nThe superior relative value of our products continues to resonate with our customers and our consumers and the resiliency of our portfolio means we are well positioned to take additional action in fiscal '23 if we continue to experience incremental inflation.\nAs a result of our decisive actions, we're beginning to see the expected recovery in our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter represented an important inflection point as we saw margin improvements materialize in Grocery & Snacks and Foodservice, which helped drive fourth quarter operating margin improvement for the total company.\nAs I already noted, we expect our Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments to deliver operating margin improvement as fiscal '23 progresses.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, our team delivered solid Q4 results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of '21, Organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased at just under 7%, with growth in all 4 segments. And importantly, adjusted operating margin increased approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up over 20%.\nI'd like to briefly detail our performance across our 3 retail domains, starting with our frozen business on Slide 12. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers modern attributes, convenience and quality to make it the perfect fit for today's consumer. In Q4, we continue to deliver strong growth on both a 1-year and 3-year basis. And within this consumer domain, we've seen growth across key categories, highlighted by more than double-digit year-over-year growth in both plant-based protein and single-serve meals.\nNow let's talk about snacks. As shown on Slide 13, we've seen a meaningful acceleration in retail sales growth in our snacks business over the last 3 years. In the fourth quarter, our snacks business grew 11% year-over-year. That equates to 34% growth over the same period in 2019. In this domain, we've driven growth in key categories, including meat snacks, hot cocoa, microwave popcorn and salty snacks.\nOur retail sales of ingredients and enhancers and shelf-stable meals and [sides] have also been growing meaningfully over a 3-year period, and that trend continued in the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 14, this business grew 5% year-over-year and 10% on a 3-year basis. In particular, we saw a large increase in the retail sales for syrup, which was up nearly 20% in Q4 on a 2-year basis.\nAs we execute our Conagra Way playbook, innovation has remained a key to our success across the portfolio, slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the fourth quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year ago period. And once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including whipped toppings, single-serve meals and plant-based protein.\nLooking at Slide 16, you can see that we continue to grow sales on both a 1- and 3-year basis. Total Conagra retail sales were up 15.8% on a 3-year basis for the year. We also continue to gain share in the important frozen and snacks categories with our category weighted share growth up both on a 1-year and 3-year basis.\nWith that context, for fiscal '22, let's turn to our outlook for fiscal '23. We expect our strong brands, on-trend innovation, effective pricing, and strengthen supply chain to drive top line growth and margin improvement.\nContinued inflationary pressure in fiscal '23 is expected to result in incremental increases in elasticity, which, overall, we anticipate will continue to remain below historical levels.\nOur outlook also reflects our expectation that we will have higher CapEx and interest expense in fiscal '23, lower pension income and that the elevated performance from Ardent Mills in fiscal '22 will moderate.\nWe look forward to sharing more details about our expectations for the year at our upcoming Investor Day.\nIn 2023, we expect organic net sales growth of 4% to 5%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%, adjusted EPS growth of 1% to 5%.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dave, I'll remind you that my team and I are looking forward to hosting an Investor Day on July 27 to discuss our plans for the future. In response to feedback, we've decided to hold our event in a virtual-only format to best accommodate our investors and analysts. Registration, dial-in and Q&A details for the virtual event are available on our website.\nDave, over to you.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year, which are shown on Slide 22. Overall, we feel very good about how we are exiting fiscal '22, and the way we navigated the dynamic operating environment that impacted our entire industry throughout the year.\nDuring fiscal '22, we delivered strong top line growth with full year organic net sales up 3.8% compared to fiscal '21, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers. While higher-than-expected cost of goods sold inflation weighed on our adjusted operating margins throughout the year, we were encouraged to see Q4 operating margins improve versus year ago.\nOverall, our full fiscal year '22 adjusted operating margins decreased by 312 basis points versus last year to 14.4%, which was in line with the revised expectations we provided during our third quarter call. Fiscal '22 adjusted EPS of $2.36 was also in line with our revised expectations.\nTurning to Slide 23, you can see our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year. During the fourth quarter, the 6.8% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 13.2% improvement in price mix as a result of continued inflation-justified pricing actions as well as favorable brand mix. This was partially offset by a 6.4% decrease in volume. The headwinds from the divestiture of our Egg Beaters business and the impact of foreign exchange were the final contributors towards the 6.2% increase in total Conagra Brands net sales during the fourth quarter.\nThe bottom half of the slide highlights the drivers of our net sales growth for full year fiscal '22 versus the prior year. The highlight here is the 3.8% organic net sales growth that I just mentioned, which showcases the underlying health of the business and our ability to execute inflation-justified pricing actions.\nThis point is reinforced on Slide 24, which shows the top line performance of each of our segments. As Sean mentioned, we are pleased that net sales continue to grow across the portfolio for both the quarter and full year when compared to the respective year-ago periods. We also continued to see market share gains, reflecting the strength of our brands.\nThe sales momentum of the business is strong as we exit fiscal '22. We detail our adjusted operating margin bridge on Slide 25. In aggregate, our adjusted operating margin was 15% for the fourth quarter approximately 100 basis points above the year ago period. As you can see, we realized a 9% benefit from favorable price mix and a 1.8% benefit from net productivity in our supply chain.\nAlthough our productivity in the quarter was below historic levels, given continued supply chain challenges, the rate was up compared to Q3 and we are seeing steady improvement in our supply chain operations as we exit fiscal year '22. The price and productivity benefits were more than offset by gross market inflation of 17.3%, which impacted our operating margins by more than 12%.\nI will unpack the inflation impacts in more detail shortly. Together, these factors contributed to the 147 basis point decrease in our adjusted gross margin for the quarter compared to the year ago period. Advertising and promotion costs for the quarter decreased 38.7% driven primarily by lacking -- lapping the significant increases in A&P during Q4 last year.\nThis decrease contributed 1.1% to overall adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A costs also declined during the quarter driven by decreased incentives and deferred compensation, contributing an additional 1.3% benefit.\nSlide 26 breaks down our adjusted operating margins by segment. We were encouraged to see both our adjusted gross margins and adjusted operating margins in our Grocery & Snacks, and Foodservice segments hit inflection points during the fourth quarter and begin to improve compared to last year. The recovery in these segments drove the 13.5% year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating profit during the fourth quarter.\nOur Refrigerated & Frozen segment was most impacted by higher-than-anticipated input cost inflation in Q4, particularly in proteins and edible oils. The above forecast inflation in Refrigerated & Frozen has pushed forward the lag until additional inflation-justified pricing is reflected in market. As we have mentioned previously, we believe our Refrigerated & Frozen segment and our frozen portfolio, in particular, is well positioned for further success.\nOur International segment was also impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflation and some FX headwinds versus prior year. Pricing actions were implemented as planned but were not enough to fully offset the cost headwinds incurred. As Sean mentioned earlier, we expect to see operating margins expand in both our Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments in fiscal '23, as pricing actions catch up to the recent inflation.\nI would like to take a deeper dive into the gross market inflation we experienced during the quarter, shown here on Slide 27. Inflation continued to rise to over 17% above the high end of the range that we were anticipating at the time of our third quarter call. It rose most acutely for commodities that are particularly difficult to hedge including chicken and pork. Even though we forecasted a significant acceleration of our chicken and pork costs in Q4, as depicted in the charts on the right, actual inflation came in even higher especially in chicken, which hit record levels compared to our expectations as of the Q3 call.\nWe continue to pull on a number of levers to offset the elevated costs including an additional round of inflation-justified pricing actions implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 that will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and new pricing that will take effect in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Another strong performance by Ardent Mills also proved to be an effective inflation hedge in our Q4 results.\nSlide 28 details our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter compared to last year. The sales increase and recovery of overall operating margins was the primary driver of the increase in our adjusted EPS during the fourth quarter contributing $0.09. We also saw a $0.02 benefit from our equity method investment earnings, which increased 42.1% during the quarter to $48 million due to solid results from Ardent Mills as effective management at the joint venture allowed it to capitalize on volatile market conditions. A benefit from pension and postretirement nonservice income and higher adjusted taxes were the additional drivers of our EPS change.\nThe $0.65 in adjusted diluted EPS that we generated for the quarter brought our full year adjusted EPS to $2.36 down 10.6% from fiscal '21. On a 2-year compounded annualized basis, full year fiscal '22 adjusted EPS increased 1.7%.\nTurning to Slide 29, you can see our balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the quarter and full year. We feel good about ending the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x, which was generally in line with the target we outlined during our third quarter call. We aim to continue decreasing this ratio moving forward as we prepare for more market volatility, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.\nCapital expenditures decreased by $42 million year-over-year to $464 million, or 4% of net sales. Lastly, we continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders as we paid $582 million in dividends in fiscal '22.\nI'd now like to spend a minute talking about our guidance for fiscal '23. Slide 30 outlines our expectations for our 3 key metrics, including organic net sales growth of plus 4% to plus 5%, and adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%, and adjusted EPS growth between plus 1% and plus 5%.\nIn addition, we aim to continue reducing our long-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 3x, as I alluded to earlier. The macro environment remains volatile, and this target reflects our strategy to maintain an even stronger balance sheet as we navigate continued headwinds moving forward. And we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating.\nBefore we open the lineup for questions, I want to unpack the assumptions behind our guidance shown here on Slide 31. We expect the high inflationary environment we experienced in fiscal '22 to continue into fiscal '23, with levels in the low teens off of the fiscal '22 gross market inflation of 16%.\nAs I noted, we have communicated additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset these elevated costs, which we anticipate being realized during the first and second quarters of fiscal '23. And we are keeping a close eye on how these actions impact elasticities.\nWe forecast the environment to remain dynamic through fiscal '23 with elasticities, increasing from fiscal '22 levels but remaining below pre COVID but historical levels. From an investment perspective, we expect CapEx spend of approximately $500 million as we prioritize reinvesting in the business as a lever to combat inflation with a focus on capacity expansion and productivity enablers.\nWe also plan to increase our SG&A investment to support talent, infrastructure and continued automation. Interest expense is anticipated to be roughly $410 million for the year, pension and postretirement income, approximately $25 million, and our tax rate estimate is approximately 24%.\nThese 3 items combined represent an approximate $0.13 headwind to fiscal '22 adjusted EPS and are incorporated into our fiscal '23 EPS guidance of plus 1% to plus 5%. The higher interest rate environment is the main driver of the expected interest expense increase and pension income decline. We anticipate Ardent Mills having another strong year, but expect fiscal '23 results to moderate versus fiscal '22, particularly versus the elevated performance in the second half of fiscal '22.\nTo reiterate, we are confident about how Conagra ended the year and are optimistic about our future opportunities. We are looking forward to walking through these opportunities and our strategies to unlock them in more detail at our Investor Day later this month. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening.\nI'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bayle Ellis. Please go ahead.\n\nBayle Ellis\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements today. While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nAlso, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures.

Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in either the earnings press release or the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, conagrabrands.com.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bayle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will detail our results for the quarter and our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. We'll then open the line to your questions.\nI'd like to start with the key messages we want to share with you this morning. As we navigate a dynamic external environment, our team delivered a solid Q3 that was largely in line with our expectations on the top line and adjusted EPS. We remain laser-focused on successfully executing the Conagra Way playbook by creating superior products and ensuring physical and mental availability to create lasting connections between consumers and our brands. This enabled us to deliver a robust plus 6% organic net sales growth for the third quarter, in line with what we expected.\nThe strength of our top line can be measured both in the absolute and relative to peers as we gained share in key categories on a 1- and 2-year basis. And it's important to note that in response to inflation-driven pricing that has been executed in the market to date, elasticities have been favorable to historical patterns, even more so than what we expected. Unit demand remains strong as consumers continue to recognize the superior relative value that our portfolio provides.\nAs worldwide events contributed to an already challenging environment, our teams remain agile and nimble to respond effectively and continue to serve our customers. Our third quarter results reflect strong contributions from our latest innovations, and we have another exciting innovations slate planned for fiscal 2023.\nBut we also experienced higher-than-anticipated inflation as the third quarter unfolded. In the face of these heightened costs, we again made the deliberate decision to continue to invest to service orders and meet the strong consumer demand for our products, ensuring physical availability is an important part of maintaining and building trust and loyalty with consumers. While these strategic investments contributed to margin compression in Q3, we believe making them was the right decision as we position Conagra for the long term. Ultimately, we landed Q3 EPS a bit differently than we previously anticipated, but we did get there. Our adjusted Q3 EPS actualized in line with our expectations, above forecasted performance, and our Ardent Mills joint venture offset incremental Q3 inflation headwinds.\nAs we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, the environment isn't getting much easier in the near term. We now expect an additional $100 million of market inflation in Q4. The updated Q4 inflation forecast equates to a 26% increase versus 2 years ago. As we'll detail further today, this higher-than-expected inflation is disproportionately impacting some of our strongest businesses, including meat snacks and frozen. Keep in mind that these businesses rely on inputs like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term and that frozen requires more specialized temperature control transportation.\nBut as we started to see this latest wave of inflation coming, we took action on pricing just as we have throughout the year. These new pricing moves go into effect in Q1 of fiscal '23 and are highly targeted toward frozen and protein snacks. These businesses have been distinguished by innovation-driven sales growth, favorable elasticities, continued share gains and limited private label competition. So although we are experiencing pressure on our total company margins near term, we will see the benefits of the new pricing actions we've taken to offset this latest wave of inflation beginning in Q1 of fiscal '23.\nWith this context, we're updating our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Our updated outlook reflects expectations for continued strong consumer demand for our product and lower-than-historical elasticities as well as the further increase in our gross inflation expectations for the year and the timing of the related pricing actions. Specifically, we now expect organic net sales for the year to be plus 4%, and we project adjusted diluted EPS to land at about $2.35, which translates to approximately $2.65 of earnings power when taking into account the impact of the lag between inflation and our end market pricing this fiscal year.\nAnd with that overview, let's dig into the quarter. As you can see on Slide 6, our team delivered solid Q3 results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. On a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the third quarter increased at just under 8%, and adjusted EPS grew by over 11%.\nLooking at Slide 7, you can see that we continue to grow sales on both a 1- and 2-year basis. Total Conagra domestic retail sales were up 18.5% on a 2-year basis in the quarter. We also continued to gain share in the quarter with our category weighted share growth up on both a 1- and 2-year basis. And on a relative basis, our share performance continued to compare favorably to the industry overall and to our largest peers.\nSlide 8 demonstrates that we gained category share at levels that outpaced our top 15 peers during the quarter. And if you take a look at the chart on the right, the share gains in our frozen and snacks domains were particularly notable.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, our performance in frozen and snacks has driven our total Conagra share gains fiscal year-to-date and during the third quarter. Importantly, our categories are healthy, attractive and growing. As you can see from the chart on the left, our frozen and snacks domains have grown nearly 8% and 9% during the fiscal year-to-date and third quarter, respectively. So we're not just gaining share, we're gaining share in some of the most attractive parts of the store. These results are holding notwithstanding our need to put significant inflation-driven pricing into the market.\nOn Slide 10, you can see the extent of our recent actions which increased in Q3 and have accelerated over the last 5 weeks. On-shelf prices for our brands rose across all 3 domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago, with inflation-driven price increases most concentrated in frozen and protein snacks. We implement these pricing actions. We're watching the impact on volumes closely, and we are pleased that the price elasticity has remained below historical levels.\nSlide 11 demonstrates that unit sales have remained consistently positive on a 2-year basis even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. This dynamic is a testament to the fact that despite the broad-based inflationary environment we're operating in, the targeted nature of our inflation-driven pricing actions and the superior relative value of our products continue to resonate with our customers and consumers.\nA great example of this is our Banquet brand in our frozen business. As we've discussed before, the Banquet brand is a mainstay in American households and has undergone considerable modernization to ensure that the brand delivers on its promise of relevant flavors, hearty portions and a great value. Consumers see the relative quality and availability of our Banquet products and continue to choose Banquet despite inflation-driven price increases. Banquet's volume has remained consistent as prices went up and start contrast to a key competitor.\nWe see a similar story in our snacks domain with Slim Jim, another brand that has made lasting connections with its consumers through perpetual modernization, relevancy and availability. Despite the increased cost of protein and associated pricing actions, Slim Jim volumes have increased considerably, far outpacing a key competitor.\nIn addition to strong relative performance compared with other branded products, we also continue to maintain share relative to private label products. Slide 14 shows private label dollar share across the edible industry at large, across the categories in which Conagra competes and across Conagra's frozen and snacking categories specifically.\nTwo things stand out about this chart. First, we compete in parts of the store with less private label penetration than the edible space at large. And second, the share of private label sales has remained stable amid the highly inflationary environment over the past several years. We believe the data shows that consumers are finding comfort in the quality, reliability and familiarity that national brands provide, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio.\nAnd we have not backed off from our modernization focus in the current environment. Innovation has remained a key to our success. Slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the third quarter, our innovation outperformed with the strong results we delivered in the year ago period. And once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including with toppings, frozen vegetables and frozen plant-based meat alternatives.\nAnd we have another exciting lineup of new innovations set to hit the shelves during fiscal 2023. The new products you see on Slide 16 are already being accepted by customers who have come to respect the innovation and marketing engine at Conagra and our ability to drive demand in key categories.\nOur ongoing investments in e-commerce also continued to yield strong results in the third quarter. We delivered compelling quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business as we outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth in Q3, building on our momentum from fiscal 2021.\nLooking at the chart on the right, you can see that our e-commerce business has continued to grow as a percentage of our total retail sales as we continue to invest behind supporting our brands. I'd like to briefly detail our performance across our 3 retail domains, starting with our frozen business on Slide 18. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers convenience and quality that make it the perfect fit for today's consumer. In Q3, we continued to deliver strong growth on both a 1- and 2-year basis. And within this domain meat substitutes, single-serve meals, desserts and multi-serve meals were the main drivers of our results. Driven by the appeal of our products to the consumer and the investments we've made in brand building and innovation, our leading frozen portfolio again grew share in Q3, both in the domain overall and within key categories.\nNow let's talk about snacks. Slide 20 highlights the meaningful acceleration in retail sales growth that we've experienced in our snacks business. In the third quarter, our snacks business grew 11% year-over-year that equates to more than 30% growth over the same period in 2020. Within Snacks, we have seen growth across key categories, highlighted by more than 20% year-over-year growth in meat snacks. Similar to our frozen business, our snacks portfolio is gaining share in this large and growing domain. We delivered share gains in multiple snack categories, including several popcorn categories, meat snacks and hot cocoa.\nOur staples retail sales have also been growing over a 2-year period, and that trend continued in Q3. Specifically, we saw very large increases in retail sales for refrigerated whip toppings and cooking spray, both of which were up over 25% in Q3 on a 2-year basis.\nSince the onset of COVID-19, many consumers have rediscovered their kitchens reinvigorating the relevance of our staples portfolio. As demonstrated on Slide 23, our staples portfolio has increased its share during this critical time frame with 2-year share gains across many key categories including Asian sauces, refrigerated with toppings, syrup, Sloppy Joe and canned meat. When you take a step back and look across our portfolio and the retail domains in which we operate, you see broad-based strength in healthy categories. We are driving growth, gaining share in attractive categories and remain disciplined in executing the Conagra Way to create lasting connections with consumers.\nThe health of our business is what will enable us to deliver profitable growth for the long term. In the immediate, however, we face a volatile cost environment that continues to be very challenging. As the third quarter unfolded, our expectations for full year fiscal 2022 gross inflation increased from approximately 14% to approximately 16%. The biggest driver of this change is the market inflation that we now expect for Q4. At the time of our Q2 call, we expected Q4 gross inflation of about 11%. Today, we expect Q4 gross inflation of approximately 16%. On a 2-year basis, Q4 gross inflation is expected to be an unprecedented 26%. And as I noted earlier, these incremental costs are disproportionately impacting our strong frozen and snacks businesses. Both rely on inputs like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term and in the case of frozen require specialized temperature-controlled transportation.\nAs noted on Slide 25, we're updating our guidance for the full year to reflect the trends I just covered. We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 4%, adjusted operating margin to be approximately 14.5%, adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35, and as I just mentioned, we're updating our gross inflation guidance to approximately 16%.\nWe're also providing guidance for the fourth quarter to reflect the higher estimated inflation and the lag in the offsetting pricing actions. In Q4, we expect organic net sales growth of approximately 7%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.5% adjusted EPS of approximately $0.64 and gross inflation of approximately 16%. While the environment remains challenging, our team continues to stay focused on executing our Conagra Way playbook and positioning our business for long-term growth and value creation.\nWe delivered strong sales growth and continued to gain share, particularly in our healthy and growing frozen and snacks categories, both of which continue to resonate with consumers despite necessary price adjustments to help offset the impact of inflation. While accelerated inflation has put pressure on our near-term earnings, we're confident in our ability to offset the impact with additional inflation-driven pricing actions. And overall, due to the strength of our brands and consistent approach to creating lasting connections with consumers, we are confident in the underlying health of the business and the many value creation opportunities ahead.\nWe hope to see you at our upcoming Investor Day on July 28 at the New York Stock Exchange, where the team and I will be sharing more on our plans for the future. We look forward to seeing many of you there in person.\nNow that I've highlighted our performance for the quarter. I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our financials.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our quarterly results at a summary level, as shown here on Slide 28.\nAs Sean discussed, we delivered strong organic net sales of plus 6% in Q3, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers. We experienced better-than-anticipated elasticities on volume in the face of our inflation-driven price increases. Inflation pressures accelerated as Q3 unfolded as reflected in our Q3 operating margins. At the same time, our Ardent Mills joint venture, reflected in the equity earnings line, had a strong quarter driven by favorable market conditions.\nQ3 adjusted EPS of $0.58 was largely in line with our expectations, down 1.7% versus prior year and up 11.1% on a 2-year compounded growth basis. Overall, a very solid Q3 financial performance given the volatile operating environment.\nWe show a breakdown of our Q3 net sales bridge on Slide 29. Our 6% organic net sales growth was driven by a strong price mix increase of 8.6%, reflecting the inflation-driven pricing actions we have taken in every segment of our business over the last year. Volume declined 2.6%, primarily due to the elasticity impacts of the price increases, along with supply constraints on certain refrigerated and frozen products.\nLooking at reported net sales drivers, the divestitures of our peanut butter and Egg Beaters businesses drove an 80 basis point decline, and foreign exchange was an additional 10 basis point headwind. Together, these factors contributed to 5.1% growth in total Conagra net sales for the quarter versus a year ago.\nSlide 30 shows our Q3 net sales summary by reporting segment on a 1- and 2-year basis. We delivered organic net sales growth across each of our segments this quarter due to inflation-driven pricing and continued strong consumer demand. Growth was particularly strong within our Foodservice segment where volume continued to rebound as restaurant traffic recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Foodservice third quarter organic net sales were in line with pre-COVID sales levels.\nWithin our 2 domestic retail businesses, both Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen delivered strong price mix results for the quarter. Volumes were down a bit more in refrigerated and frozen than in Grocery & Snacks as we had some higher-than-expected supply disruptions in Refrigerated & Frozen in the quarter associated with labor and materials challenges, but we expect this dynamic to improve as we progress through Q4. For total Conagra, organic net sales grew at a 2-year compounded growth rate of 7.8% in the third quarter.\nWe show the operating profit and margin summary of each of our reporting segments on Slide 31. Adjusted operating profit was down 9.9% in Q3 and was essentially flat on a 2-year compounded basis. As you can see from our results, inflation and cost pressures were most concentrated in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment this quarter.\nI have a slide later in my remarks with specifics, but at a summary level, as Q3 unfolded, we began to experience higher-than-anticipated inflation on protein and higher costs in the temperature-controlled transportation network, both of which are harder to offset in the short term. But as you heard from Sean, our frozen businesses continue to win with consumers. While we look forward to getting back to a more normalized cost environment, we believe that our frozen portfolio is well positioned to support the additional price increases that the current inflationary environment require. We've recently announced new pricing actions for our frozen businesses as well as for our protein snacking businesses, which are also experiencing elevated levels of inflation. We will see the benefits of these new pricing actions in Q1 of fiscal year '23.\nPage 32 summarizes total Conagra operating margin, excluding Ardent Mills for the third quarter. This page really highlights the significant impact that inflation had on the business in the third quarter. Q3 total market inflation was 15.4% and negatively impacted operating margin by 10.6 percentage points in the quarter. This inflation level was higher than what we estimated when we discussed our outlook with you following Q2, and it's driven the additional pricing actions I just mentioned. The good news is that our 8.6% increase in price mix and sales translated to 5.7 percentage points of operating margin improvement in the quarter.\nWe also delivered 1.5 percentage points of productivity improvement, net of operational offset in the quarter. Our teams were able to deliver this level of net productivity even in the face of meaningful labor disruption. The level of base productivity we achieved in our plants and our production output were both challenged in Q3 due to Omicron-related labor disruptions. But with the labor situation now starting to stabilize, we expect these headwinds to abate as we progress through Q4. We also saw marginal benefits from A&P and adjusted SG&A savings in Q3. These factors combined to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13.7% for the third quarter.\nTurning to Slide 33. You can see our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter. The operating profit drivers I just discussed resulted in a $0.06 decrease in adjusted EPS versus Q3 of last year. The primary operating profit headwind was the 15.4% inflation rate. The other major headwind in Q3 was the unfavorable operating efficiencies related to labor disruptions in our operations that I just mentioned. The tailwinds for the quarter were the significant price mix benefits and realized productivity that we delivered. We also had lower SG&A and A&P costs in the quarter.\nQ3 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt and by a very strong quarter from Ardent Mills. Given the nature of Ardent's business, it can benefit from volatile market conditions. Although Ardent income is recorded below operating margin in our financial statements, it is a cash-generating business that has performed well in this highly inflationary environment.\nAs you've seen in our materials this morning, the highly inflationary environment has caused us to reduce our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. However, we believe it's important to provide some additional details on how we view the underlying earnings power of our portfolio, which we believe is strong.\nOn a pro forma basis, we estimate that fiscal '22 adjusted EPS approximates $2.65 versus the updated guidance of $2.35 we're sharing today. So what does the $2.65 represent? First, as you can see on the chart, it incorporates the impact of the updated market inflation estimate we're now expecting in Q4 and driving a reduction in our previous EPS estimate of about $0.18. The $2.65 also reflects estimated favorability of approximately $0.03 versus the previous full year EPS estimate for Ardent Mills. Beyond those items, the $2.65 reflects our estimate of all the pricing lags we faced this fiscal year.\nAs you've heard us discuss in recent quarters, the reality of a CPG food business is that inflation hits the P&L before a corresponding pricing response can be executed with customers. Generally, that lag is about 90 days. We've estimated the impact of our pricing lags, netted elasticities for fiscal year '22. We believe that the full year EPS impact of these lags is approximately $0.30. This estimated impact excludes our Foodservice and International segments as we only quantified it for the domestic retail businesses. Of course, it's important to understand what this estimate represents. It is not our fiscal year '23 EPS guidance. We will provide more insight on our expectations for fiscal '23 after fiscal year '22 ends. But it is our estimate of what adjusted EPS might have been in fiscal '22, if price increases were effective at the same time that inflation actually hit our P&L., better demonstrating the underlying earnings power of the business.\nSlide 35 breaks down our revised inflation expectations a bit further. As you can see, the expected inflation rate for Q4 has the biggest delta compared to our previous expectations. If you look at the chart on the right, Q4 inflation is expected to be approximately 26% versus 2 years ago. clearly, an unprecedented level of market inflation that we are managing through. Slide 36 goes into more detail on where we saw this inflation impact on our supply chain most severely in the third quarter, and where the bulk of the incremental $100 million of new inflation is coming from. As Sean and I have both mentioned, transportation and proteins were particularly challenging in Q3 and remain so as we started Q4. Dairy has also been a headwind versus our prior expectations.\nLet's talk a bit more about each of these. Beginning with transportation, Q3 costs were heavily impacted by driver and truck availability, which resulted in more inflationary pressures from spot market usage and rates. Additionally, as you are all aware, fuel prices were driven up significantly during the quarter due to unforeseen worldwide events. With respect to proteins and dairy, we also saw Q3 inflation at rates higher than previously forecasted. Meat-based proteins are difficult to hedge and current industry freezer inventory positions are at multiyear lows. This supply dynamic limits our ability to build our freezer stock inventory, which is our typical coverage strategy.\nFor a bit more perspective on cost, our total meat-based protein spend in fiscal '21 approximated $675 million. For fiscal '22, we now estimate total meat-based protein market inflation of approximately 50%, which is approximately $340 million of additional market cost in this one commodity area, driving nearly 40% of our total gross materials inflation in fiscal '22. In summary, these 3 categories alone are estimated to drive $0.16 of the incremental gross cost inflation we're now expecting for Q4.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flows, we stayed the course on our balanced capital allocation approach this quarter. As outlined on Slide 37, we reduced net debt by approximately $240 million in Q3 and getting our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 4.2x. As more of our pricing actions flow through our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, we expect this leverage ratio to drop to approximately 3.9x. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and to our long-term net leverage target of roughly 3.5x.\nI'll wrap up with a repeat of the updated guidance that Sean walked you through. our new fiscal '22 and Q4 guidance are shown on Slide 38. As you've heard from us this morning, we expect our strong top line momentum to continue with benefits from our pricing actions and favorable elasticities driving organic net sales growth of approximately 7% in Q4 and approximately 4% for the full year, up from approximately 3% in our previous guidance and up from approximately flat in our original fiscal '22 guidance. Because of the incremental inflation we have discussed today and the additional lag in the pricing actions, we are estimating Q4 EPS to approximate $0.64, a strong increase of 18.5% versus the prior year. This results in EPS for fiscal year '22 of approximately $2.35, down from approximately $2.50. We also now expect market inflation for the year to approximate 16%, up from approximately 14%, and we expect adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.5% in Q4 and approximately 14.5% for the full year.\nWe remain confident in the brand strength and underlying earnings power of our business. Following the Conagra Way playbook, we continue to invest in our brands to create innovative products that resonate with consumers, and we believe these investments have positioned our portfolio well to manage through this challenging environment.\nWe look forward to diving deeper into the progress we have made and the future opportunities we see at our upcoming Investor Day scheduled for July 28 in New York City. You will also hear from our new supply chain leader, LA Eby, who will review the strategic actions we are planning to drive further efficiencies in our supply chain. We will also communicate our algorithm for longer-term financial performance. We look forward to seeing many of you then.\nThank you for listening, everyone. That concludes my prepared remarks today. I'll now hand it back to the operator for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney from Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nBrian Kearney\n\nHead of IR, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements today. While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of the risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nAlso, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. References to adjusted items, including organic net sales, refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in either the earnings press release or the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, conagrabrands.com.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our results for the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of the year and why we believe that Conagra continues to be well positioned for the future.\nI'd like to start by giving you some context for the quarter.\nFirst, as you all know, the external environment has continued to be highly dynamic. But our team remained extremely agile in the quarter and executed the Conagra Way playbook. We navigated the ongoing complexity and delivered strong net sales growth anchored in elevated consumer demand that continued to exceed our ability to supply, inflation-driven pricing actions and lower-than-expected elasticities.\nWhile our net sales exceeded our expectations, margin pressure in the second quarter was also higher than expected driven by 3 key factors. First, while we anticipated elevated inflation during the second quarter, it was higher than our forecast. Second, we experienced some additional transitory supply chain costs related to the current environment. And third, in the face of elevated consumer demand that continue to outpace our ability to supply, we elected to make investments to service orders and maximize product availability for our consumers.\nWe expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the levers we pulled and continue to pull to manage the impact of inflation. We'll always look to our cost savings programs to offset input cost inflation. However, given the magnitude of the cost increases, our actions also include additional inflation-driven pricing. We communicated pricing to customers again in December.\nFor the year, we're once again reaffirming our adjusted EPS outlook, but our path to achieve that guidance has evolved. We're increasing our organic net sales guidance based on stronger-than-expected consumer demand and lower-than-anticipated elasticities. We're also updating our margin guidance given the increase in our gross inflation expectations for the year and the timing of the related pricing actions. Taken together, we continue to believe that elevated consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost savings actions, will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of about $2.50.\nSo with that as the backdrop, let's jump into the agenda for today's call. We'll start with an overview of the quarter before going into more detail on our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. I'll also share some of our thoughts on the structural changes we're seeing in consumer behavior, particularly with younger consumers. We believe these changes are further evidenced in the long-term potential of Conagra Brands.\nLet's dig into the quarter. As you can see on Slide 7, our team delivered solid Q2 results. On a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the second quarter increased by more than 5% and adjusted EPS grew by nearly 1%.\nAs I noted earlier, we delivered these results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. Input cost inflation came in higher than expected in the quarter. In addition, we made some strategic decisions to service the heightened consumer demand we continue to experience.\nAs the entire industry incurred transitory costs associated with labor shortages, supply issues on material and transportation costs and congestion challenges during our Q2, we chose to invest in our supply chain and service orders. This deliberate decision ensured we could deliver food to our customers and consumers especially during the holiday season.\nMaintaining physical availability is an important part of building trust with customers and maintaining consumer loyalty. The bottom line is that amid the supply disruption seen across the industry, we remain focused on building for the long term. While the net result of these factors was a negative impact on our margins during the quarter, we're confident that our purposeful approach better positions our portfolio for the future.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank our tremendous supply chain team. They've been resilient in navigating this environment, allowing us to remain agile and deliver for our customers and consumers. I continue to be impressed by our team's commitment, and I'm grateful for their ongoing dedication.\nLooking at Slide 10. You can see that our strong performance in the second quarter was broad based. Total Conagra retail sales were up 14.8% on a 2-year basis in the quarter, with double-digit growth in each of our domestic retail domains: frozen, snacks and staples.\nHousehold penetration was also up this quarter, building upon the significant number of new consumers we've acquired over the past 2 years. Total Conagra household penetration was up 59 basis points on a 2-year basis, and our category share increased 41 basis points.\nIn addition to increasing household penetration and acquiring new consumers, we are retaining our existing consumers, as demonstrated by our repeat rates. Shoppers continue to discover our incredible products and their tremendous value proposition. As the chart on the right of Slide 11 shows, our consumers keep coming back for more.\nAs we execute our Conagra Way playbook, innovation remained a key to our success across the portfolio in Q2. Slide 12 highlights the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new product and modernizing our portfolio. During the second quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year ago period. We continue to invest in new product quality, and it's supporting our innovation launches with deeper, more meaningful consumer connections. Once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including snacks, sweet treats, sauces and marinades and frozen vegetables.\nSlide 13 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce continued to yield strong results. We again delivered strong quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business, and e-commerce accounted for a larger percentage of our overall retail sales than our peers. We outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the second quarter, just as we did in the first quarter of 2022 and throughout fiscal 2021. As we mentioned earlier, our strong net sales growth was driven by elevated consumer demand, favorable elasticities and inflation-driven pricing actions.\nOn Slide 14, you can see the extent of our pricing actions in the first half of the fiscal year. During this period, our on-shelf prices rose across all 3 domestic retail domains. And, as Dave will discuss shortly, the pricing flowed through the P&L.\nAs you can see on Slide 15, price elasticity has been fairly low. It's been favorable to our expectations. Consumers continued to see the tremendous value of our products relative to other food options, a concept I will elaborate on in a few minutes.\nNow let's turn to the path ahead. You can see on Slide 17 we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 14% for fiscal 2022 compared to the approximately 11% we anticipated at the time of our first quarter call. This is a large increase, and we're taking actions to offset the increase while still investing in the long-term health of our business.\nTo help manage our increasing inflation, we're taking incremental pricing actions, including list price increases and modified merchandising plans. Many of these actions have already been announced to our customers. As a reminder, there is a lag in timing between the impact of inflation and our ability to execute pricing adjustments based on that inflation. As a result, the incremental price increases will go into effect in the second half of the year with the most significant impact during the fourth quarter.\nWhile it's easy to get caught up in the quarter-to-quarter impact of inflation and pricing, it's important to keep focused on the big picture. The long-term success of our business is driven by how consumers, particularly younger consumers, respond to our products. And when you take a step back to evaluate the broader environment and how our portfolio delivers against the needs of the modern consumer, we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned for the future.\nAs we've detailed many times before, Conagra's on-trend portfolio filled with modern food attributes is winning with younger consumers. And our confidence is underpinned by the many changes we're seeing in consumer behavior that are proving to be structural, especially given that these changes are driven by younger consumers that represent the most significant opportunity for long-term value creation.\nYounger consumers represent a large and growing part of the U.S. population, and they want to optimize the value that they get for the money they spend on food. A large part of optimizing their food spending includes shifting more dollars from eating away from home to eating at home. As they make that trade, they're choosing national brands. And we believe Conagra is ideally positioned to experience an outsized benefit from these behaviors given the relationship our brands are forming with younger consumers. Overall, Conagra is delivering superior relative value to consumers compared to both away-from-home options and store brands.\nLet's take a closer look at these trends, starting with the population changes.\nSlide 20 highlights the demographic shift underway in the U.S. Millennial and Gen Z consumers are a large and growing cohort. These consumers are starting to settle down, buy homes and start families. As we presented in the past, when people enter the family formation phase, they increase the amount of food they eat at home with an outsized increase in the consumption of frozen foods. And what we find particularly important about reaching Millennial and Gen Z consumers is that we believe they will remain more value focused than their predecessors.\nFirst, let's talk about the near term. As you can see in the chart on the left, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are earlier in their careers and earning less than the older generations of working-age people. This is natural, but it bodes well for food-at-home trends in the shorter term. We believe that even as foodservice bounces back, younger consumers will be value conscious in their food choices.\nFewer younger consumers are expected to achieve the financial success of the generations before them. The data on the right suggests that Millennials are more likely to earn less than their parents. We believe this means that these savvy consumers will look to stretch their food dollars further even as they age.\nThe data also shows that younger consumers are already eating more at home. Compared to the population as a whole, Gen Z and Millennials have decreased restaurant visits more and sourced a larger percentage of their meals at home.\nAs these younger consumers have made the shift to at-home eating, the data shows that they're finding comfort in the quality, reliability and familiarity that national brands provide. We believe this makes a lot of sense. National brands provide value while replicating many of the on-trend flavors and modern food attributes that consumers are used to experiencing in away-from-home dining. When consumers make trades like away-from-home to in-home eating, trust is paramount. In short, national brands, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio, deliver on this trust imperative, and that's because they offer superior relative value versus other food options.\nAs consumers seek to stretch their household balance sheets in the face of broad-based inflation, one of the single largest levers available to them is the reduction in spending on food away from home as food-away-from-home prices are typically over 3.5x more expensive than food-at-home prices. This trade will likely become even more important for consumers as food-away-from-home prices have already increased faster than at-home prices in calendar 2021, and they are expected to increase at nearly twice the rate as at-home prices in calendar year 2022.\nOur aggressive modernization of the Conagra portfolio over the past several years has put us in a strong position to capitalize on these structural shifts. Our portfolio has shown its competitive advantage with excellent trial, depth of repeat and share gain performance. Overall, we believe Conagra is well positioned to leverage these shifts to create meaningful value for shareholders.\nAnd Slide 25 shows you the data to support our claim. Conagra is attracting more younger consumers than our peers and getting them to repeat at more attractive rates. By appealing to younger consumers now, we're building superior consumer lifetime value.\nImportantly, the data shows that these new, younger buyers are stickier across our portfolio. We believe this comes back to the investments we've made and continue to make in our products and our brands. The Conagra Way has positioned us to win.\nAs I discussed earlier, we're reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50 for the full year with a few updates on how we expect to get there. We're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 3%, up from approximately 1%. We're slightly adjusting our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15.5%, down from approximately 16%. And we're updating our gross inflation guidance to about 14%, up from approximately 11%.\nNow that I've highlighted our performance for the quarter and strong positioning for the future, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our financial performance.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everybody. I'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 28.\nAs Sean mentioned earlier, there were a number of factors that influenced our results this quarter. First, we were encouraged to see that consumer demand for our products remain strong. And second, elasticities were better than anticipated.\nHowever, we also continued to see inflation rise across a number of key inputs, and the dynamic macro environment created challenging conditions for the supply chain. The team remained agile in response to these dynamics, including the decision to make additional investments during the quarter to meet the elevated demand and maximize the food supply to our consumers. Overall, our actions favorably impacted our top line during the quarter with organic net sales up 2.6% compared to the year ago period.\nAn important part of the top line success we've realized throughout the pandemic is our ongoing commitment to the Conagra Way. We've remained focused on building and maintaining strong brands across the portfolio. We continued these efforts in the second quarter with continued product innovation and by further increasing our spending on advertising and promotion, primarily focusing on e-commerce investments.\nWe show a breakdown of our net sales on Slide 29. The 4.2% decline in volume was primarily due to the lapping of the prior year surge in demand during an earlier stage in the COVID-19 pandemic as volume increased approximately 1% on a 2-year CAGR. The second quarter volume decline was more than offset by the very favorable impact of brand mix and inflation-driven pricing actions we realized this quarter, driving an overall organic net sales growth of 2.6%.\nOn last quarter's call, we noted that the domestic retail pricing actions were just starting to be reflected on shelves at the end of the first quarter. Those increases were reflected in our P&L this quarter, driving the 6.8% increase in price/mix. The divestitures of our H.K. Anderson business, the Peter Pan peanut butter business and the Egg Beaters business resulted in a 70 basis point decline, and foreign exchange drove a 20 basis point benefit. Together, all these factors contributed to a 2.1% increase in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago.\nSlide 30 shows our net sales summary by segment both on a year-over-year and on a 2-year compounded basis. As you can see, we continue to deliver strong 2-year compounded net sales growth in each of our 3 retail segments, which resulted in a 2-year compounded organic net sales growth of 5.3% for the total company.\nYou can see the puts and takes of our operating margin on Slide 31. We drove a 6.2 percentage point benefit from improved price/mix, supply chain-realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses.\nNetted within the 6.2% are the additional investments we made to service orders and maximize product availability. These investments reflect the dynamic environment and actions we've taken to respond to it. This includes decisions to utilize more third-party transportation and warehousing vendors for some of our frozen products, incurring incremental cost to move product around our distribution network to better align with customer order patterns and delaying a plant consolidation productivity program to maximize current production. The 6.2% also includes transitory supply chain costs such as higher inventory write-offs and increased overtime to support operations.\nThe 6.2 percentage point benefit was more than offset by an inflation headwind of 11 percentage points. The second quarter gross inflation rate of 16.4% of cost of goods sold was approximately 100 basis points or $20 million higher than expected, driven by higher-than-anticipated increases in proteins and transportation, which are both difficult to hedge.\nThe combination of the favorable margin levers, our choiceful supply chain investments and inflation headwinds resulted in adjusted gross margin declining by 483 basis points. Our operating margin was further impacted by 20 basis points due to our increased A&P investment during the quarter, as I mentioned earlier.\nYou can see how these elevated costs impacted each of our reporting segments on Slide 32. While each segment was impacted, our Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted the most with adjusted operating margin down 707 basis points primarily due to outsized materials inflation and the additional investment incurred to service orders and get food delivered to consumers. We are confident that we will improve overall operating margins in the second half as we execute our additional pricing actions to offset the higher inflation rates.\nAs you can see on Slide 33, our second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.64 was heavily impacted by the input cost inflation across our portfolio. Even though the benefits of our first quarter pricing flowed through the P&L this quarter, the incremental inflation we incurred in the second quarter created an additional headwind. In response, we announced additional pricing to customers in early Q3 during December. Although we have yet another lag before this pricing benefits the P&L, we expect to realize benefits from these pricing actions in late Q3 with most of the impact in Q4.\nAlso, our Ardent Mills joint venture had another good quarter and delivered EPS benefit versus the prior year. We realized lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases in prior quarters.\nTurning to Slide 34. I want to unpack how Q2 adjusted EPS landed versus our expectations.\nOur second quarter adjusted EPS came in lower than we originally had anticipated due to 2 main factors. First, as previously mentioned, inflation came in higher by approximately 100 basis points of cost of goods sold or approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of EPS. While we have announced additional pricing actions for the second half to offset the incremental inflation, the timing of these benefits is naturally lagging behind the higher inflation. Second, the cost we elected to incur to service orders, coupled with the additional transitory supply chain costs I described earlier, led to another $0.02 to $0.03 impact on our adjusted EPS. We are forecasting these service and transitory cost dynamics to improve as the second half progresses.\nLooking at Slide 35, we ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.3x, which is in line with the seasonal increase in leverage expected for the second quarter. We expect to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year and expect to end the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.7 to 3.8x. We remain committed to a longer-term net leverage target of approximately 3.5x and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.\nI want to close today by reviewing the factors driving the updated guidance we issued this morning, which is shown here on Slide 36.\nI'll start by saying that we remain confident in our ability to achieve approximately $2.50 in adjusted EPS for the full fiscal year. As the macro environment continues to be very dynamic, our expectations for the path to achieve that target have shifted. We are increasing our organic net sales growth guidance to approximately 3% to reflect our stronger-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as our incremental pricing actions in the second half.\nWe are lowering our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15.5%. We expect the incremental sales and pricing actions in the second half to offset the dollar impact of the incremental net inflation and other supply chain costs.\nWe have increased our gross inflation expectations to approximately 14%, largely driven by higher estimated costs versus the previous estimate for proteins, transportation, dairy and resin. We will continue to monitor these input costs closely and will be quick to respond using all available margin levers. As Sean detailed, price elasticity has been favorable to our expectations so far.\nAs we have explained previously, there is a lag in timing between when we experience inflation, take actions, including pricing, to offset the dollar impact of the inflation and when we see those actions flow through our financial results. With respect to the additional pricing actions we have announced for the second half of fiscal '22, we expect to realize a small amount late in the third quarter and the full benefits from these price increases in the fourth quarter.\nWe, therefore, expect our third quarter margins to be roughly in line with second quarter margins with an increase in operating margins in Q4 as the pricing catches up with inflation and the impact of the lag is reduced. Our guidance also assumes that the end-to-end supply chain will continue to operate effectively as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.\nBefore turning it over to the operator for Q&A, I would like to reiterate that confidence in our ability to reach our earnings goal is based on the strength of our business at its core to manufacture and deliver foods that people enjoy.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks today. Thank you for listening. I'll now hand it back to the operator for questions."

Constantine\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's third quarter investor event. I'm Doug Constantine, Treasury Controller and I'll be moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which posted to the company's website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CFO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Introductory comments by our CFO were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team.\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as supplemented by our Form 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 2025, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to the forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CFO, John Sauerland, who will kick us with some introductory comments. John?\n\nJohn Peter Sauerland\n\nVP & CFO, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Progressive's Third Quarter 2025 Investor Relations Call. We had an excellent quarter with an 89.5 combined ratio, 10% premium growth and policies in force growth of 12% versus a year ago. That policies in force growth equates to 4.2 million more policyholders or almost 7 million more vehicles in forced than a year ago. While growth is lower than in recent years, we are still gaining significant market share in capitalizing on the opportunities for growth through robust media spend and competitive rates. Year-to-date, our combined ratio is 87.3%, with 13% premium growth and comprehensive income of $10 billion, which is over 30% ahead of 2024. Rounding out our key performance metrics, our trailing 12-month comprehensive return on equity stands at 37.1%.\nBefore moving to questions, we'd like to take a moment to offer more commentary on the $950 million estimate for policyholder credit expense for Personal Auto customers in Florida that we recognized in September. Florida is Progressive's largest market, and we are the leading provider of Personal Auto insurance in Florida.\nIn 2023, Florida legislators responded to rapidly rising insurance rates passing House Bill 837, which, among other things, move Florida to a modified comparative negligent system, meaning drivers where more than 50% of accident could no longer sue for damages, and this allowed one-way attorney fees. Since House Bill 837 took effect, our average loss cost or pure premiums for Florida injury claims are down between 10% and 20%, and the percentage of Florida personal injury protection or PIP claims, for which we receive lawsuits is down around 60%.\nWhile we have been responsive in reflecting these changes in our loss costs through 2 rate reductions for Florida consumers in the past year and another plan for December, the drop in loss cost was more pronounced than we expected. Additionally, obviously, there is significant risk of very costly storms in Florida, and we have seen virtually none in 2025. The Florida excess profits law calls for the return of profits in excess of 500 basis points better than our filed and approved underwriting profit margin over a 3 accident year period. And at quarter end, we estimated that liability at $950 million.\nFor Prospective, in 2022 alone, inclusive of Hurricane Ian, our Personal Auto combined ratio was over 100, and those results translated to around $750 million decrease to the excess profit equation for the periods that included 2022. Our Florida auto business is more than 50% bigger now than in 2022. We applaud the legislative changes in House Bill 837 and resulting in more affordable personal auto insurance premiums for consumers, and desire to continue to grow our presence in Florida.\nOur loss reserves will continue to develop as we handle more claims into the new system, and our estimate for the policyholder credit expense for the 2023 to 2025 period will develop accordingly, with monthly adjustments showing up in the expense line on our income statement. Naturally, going forward, our intent is to manage profitability in Florida to avoid excess profits.\nAnd finally, in response to questions we received, while a few other states have statutes covering excess profits, we don't currently foresee other similar exposures.\nThank you again for joining us, and we'll now take your questions.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question. ."

These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Pat?\n\nPatrick K. Callahan\n\nPresident of Personal Lines, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. Through the second quarter, 2025 continues to be one of our best years on record by all objective measures. We delivered strong profitability while simultaneously growing at an incredible pace, adding over $5 billion in premiums written and nearly 2.4 million additional bps during the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of last year.\nWe've previously said it's easy to grow an insurance company if you're not focused on underwriting profit and conversely, relatively easy to generate profit and insurance if you're not looking to grow. But simultaneously doing both, while operating in the highly competitive U.S. P&C marketplace requires the rare combination of strategic focus and relentless execution that we consider key sources of Progressive's competitive advantage.\nFull statutory industry results released in June show that Progressive gained more than 1.5 points in personal auto market share in 2024 while outperforming the industry combined ratio by more than 7 points. Our 2024 market share increase was the largest share gain of any carrier in the past 15 years. This rare combination of profitable market share growth isn't an isolated event for Progressive. Over the past 15 years, we've increased our auto premium almost fivefold while simultaneously running close to 9-point wider underwriting profit margins.\nOur performance is the direct result of executing against our 4 strategic pillars. People and culture, product breadth, brand and competitive prices. Today, we'll focus on competitive prices and provide you with some insights into how our ability to predict and price to future loss costs and to rapidly deploy products and pricing to match our premiums to our costs remain key ingredients of our continued success. The compounded effect of doing this with each successive product model has enabled us to continue to make great progress towards achieving our vision of becoming the #1 destination for consumers, agents and business owners for insurance and other financial needs.\nBuilding on our exceptional underwriting profit performance, we continue to invest to drive continued growth. Despite seeing greater competition now than we did at the beginning of the year, through the second quarter, we continued to see strong demand for our personal auto products across both of our distribution channels. The independent agent channel is a great barometer for the competitive environment where available coverage options across carriers are presented via comparative raters, which provide agents and their client's real-time comparisons of how our products compare to those offered by other carriers. Every indication is that our auto products have continued to outperform on a relative basis as evidenced by strong year-to-date double-digit growth in new applications, premiums written and policies in force.\nOn the direct side, our marketing engine remains highly effective, generating high-quality prospects at near-record levels, and our conversion rates indicate that despite the increasing marketing spend, our prices are still highly competitive and provide consumers a good value relative to other end market options.\nYear-to-date, we have spent $2.5 billion on marketing, an increase of about $900 million compared to this time last year. And as our volume denominator grows, achieving year-over-year new application growth becomes more challenging. But so far, we have continued to leverage our scale in identifying new opportunities to refine where and how we invest our marketing spend to drive profitable growth.\nSimilar to Personal Lines, we continue to rapidly grow market share in our Commercial Lines business while consistently beating industry combined ratios by 8, 10 and as much as 20 points over the last 20 years. This consistent profitability is particularly impressive when looking at how U.S. commercial auto continues to struggle with profitability, producing its 14th consecutive unprofitable calendar year in 2024.\nOur success can be attributed in part to the intense focus on commercial auto as a core line of business in our Commercial Lines offering. This auto focus, in conjunction with introducing the segmentation of commercial auto into business market targets more than 10 years ago, has enabled us to capitalize on meaningful and actionable differences between resulting vehicle types and usage that we can operationalize across all aspects of the business. This granular focus has allowed us to quickly develop segment-level insights and execute proactive rate and underwriting actions at the BMT level to deliver strong division level performance as we did late last year when we adjusted rates and underwriting across BMTs to drive written premium growth across all our BMTs other than for higher transportation. We're now extending those capabilities to our expansion product lines like the business owner policy product.\nTo support long-term positive contributions from these newer businesses, we leverage established pricing and product delivery capabilities to ensure we have the necessary monitoring and insights in addition to leading capacity and the delivery agility to bring rapid rate and underwriting adjustments to market. Leveraging these proven capabilities should help our expansion commercial businesses deliver the profitable growth we expect from all of our underwriting businesses. A significant contributor to delivering our continued profitable growth is the ability to quickly and decisively respond to changes in loss costs to ensure we can remain open for business when inflationary pressures create hard markets and elevated shopping levels. This is no small feat, especially given the lack of historical precedent for some of the drivers of recent loss cost increases. Fast forward to today, and we're similarly working to model first, second and third order effects of global tariffs and potential supply chain disruptions to determine the appropriate future rate levels for these emerging macroeconomic events.\nOur pricing teams are responsible for translating highly complex and dynamic internal and external data into timely rate level recommendations. Each of our product teams are supported by a group of these talented individuals who leverage complex actuarial methods to understand and trend our future costs towards our goal of collecting the right premium to cover both the costs we'll incur and our target profit margin.\nToday, we'll be diving into the details of our personal and commercial lines pricing theory and practices. To guide us through this, we have two senior pricing leaders with us. First, Brad Granger, who has been our national auto pricing leader for the past 17 years and who will be celebrating his 25th progressive anniversary later this month. We'll discuss some of the technical theories behind our pricing methodology. Following Brad, Jen Kubit, who has been with Progressive for 21 years, and recently took on the leadership of our Commercial Lines pricing organization, will explain how these theories are applied in practice at Progressive. Once again, thank you for joining us today.\nI'll now turn it over to Brad. Brad?\n\nBradley Granger\n\nThanks, Pat, and thank you, everyone, for joining this morning. What is our product? A property and casualty insurance companies such as Progressive doesn't actually manufacture a physical product. Our product is not tangible. Instead, it is a transfer of risk from insured to insurer exchanging the small probability of an adverse financial event in exchange for the payment of a premium. That transfer of risk is outlined in our policy contract. And that transfer of risk is both dependent on when accidents occur or the accident date and time bound within our short-term contract lengths of 6 or 12 months.\nCar accidents are not corn flakes as opposed to a tangible product like corn flakes where costs are largely known before the product is priced and sold. Progressive doesn't know for sure what our costs are until long after our product is priced and sold. That is precisely the transfer of risk from insured to insurer. I just described only now from the perspective of the insurer that risk is now ours. And as we will discuss in a few minutes, we do many things to mitigate that risk within both our pricing science and our operationalization of getting the right rate to market quickly.\nPricing to expected cost. First, when we talk about pricing for costs, we were referring to all parts of our premium dollar losses, loss adjustment expenses, or LAE, general expenses and profit. According to the Casualty Actuarial Society statement of principles on ratemaking, A rate is reasonable and not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. If it is an actuarially sound estimate of the expected value of all future costs associated with an individual risk transfer.\nA few things to highlight there. First, it references expected value of future costs where actual outcomes could be lower or higher. Second, it is always forward-looking or perspective as it is an estimate of future costs. Third, today's presentation will focus primarily on not excessive and not inadequate as opposed to not unfairly discriminatory which is largely in the domain of our product development departments. This is analogous to the field of economics and the distinction between macroeconomics and the focus on changes in whole economies and aggregate variables and microeconomics and the focus on changes in individual firms and consumers.\nWe will focus today on macro level pricing as opposed to the individual relative risk rating and segmentation of micro level pricing. And in addition to our approach being aligned with actuarial principles, it is also well aligned with state regulation as nearly all states legally require that rates are not excessive, not inadequate and not unfairly discriminatory. And it also fits quite well within Progressive's vision to be consumers' #1 choice via competitive rates. But to do so by growing profitably and adhering to our core value of profit.\nThe fundamental pricing questions. There are two questions that completely underlie our approach. Number one, if we don't do anything to current rates, what loss plus LAE ratio should we expect in the upcoming rate revision for the policies we are about to write. And number two, what do we need to do to current rates in order to hit our combined ratio target in the upcoming rate revision for policies we are about to write. We refer to these as the fundamental pricing questions. And in the coming slides, we will build the fundamental pricing equation to answer these questions.\nActuaries develop predictions that minimize bias and variants. An enormous competitive advantage that Progressive has is the quality granularity and quick availability of data. Our growth and scale have only deepened that advantage. But if you don't think you have a blind spot, then you have a blind spot. And with all of this quality data, if we are not careful, we could slice the cake and slice the cake and slice the cake until all we have are crumbs. This is where we, in our pricing organizations, come in.\nActuaries are experts in matching rates of risk, balancing responsiveness and stability and maximizing accuracy and precision. And as we will see in the coming slides, as we try to price this accident year promise, our data is trying to fool us. There is no single perfect piece of data. Our work centers around correcting for bias or accuracy and spread and variance or precision and finding signal through noise. And bias, as used here refers to statistical bias.\nFrom Wikipedia, \"in the field of statistics, bias is a systematic tendency in which the methods used to gather data and estimate a sample statistic present an inaccurate, skewed or distorted biased depiction of reality\". Every month, Progressive releases financial information publicly describing our underwriting performance by line of business. To align with generally accepted accounting principles, this is predominantly a calendar year or month view that includes incurred activity on all losses and LAE regardless of date of occurrence. For the purposes of ratemaking, however, we are attempting to price for the accident year that is ensuring that we have the correct rates at the time the accidents occur which I'll explain further in the next few slides.\nCalendar year incurred losses are a combination of paid losses and change in reserves. They can also be subdivided to show contribution to that calendar year of current accident year versus all prior accident years. We will now use a historical example derived from a progressive personal auto state comprehensive coverage to demonstrate how we can effectively answer the fundamental pricing questions. All amounts are in thousands of dollars.\nThe first piece of data we readily have is trailing 12 calendar year incurred losses of $43.24 million. As we just stated, calendar year incurred losses can also be subdivided to show contribution of current accident year versus all prior accident years, as can be seen here as we see the same paid loss plus change in reserves pattern for both the current accident year and all prior accident years.\nWe will now use our simple example to fill in values for each element of the formulas. And in this example, when we isolate the contribution of this accident year, to the current calendar year incurred losses of $43.24 million, we see that the current accident year incurred losses are $43.56 million.\nThe other element of calendar year incurred losses is the contribution of prior accident years, also known as prior accident year runoff, which in this case, is negative $327,000. The $43.56 million current accident year losses is what we need to start to answer the fundamental pricing questions. Unbiased ultimate accident year losses equal accident year incurred losses, times loss development factor.\nLoss reserving goal is to set financial reserves to be adequate with minimal variation from date of loss until final selling. We examine the development over time of historical accident year losses as claims are reported and settled across the columns of the loss development triangle, as can be seen in the upper right. That is known as a loss development factor. In this case, the reserves set by claims and loss reserving have historically been accurate. In our example, that loss development factor is then slightly less than 1 at 0.99.\nAt this point, we can also bring in another piece of data that we readily have, trailing 12 calendar year earned premium of $61.14 million. Loss adjustment expenses are correlated with losses. Loss adjustment expenses can be divided into defense and cost containment or DCC, which is defense, litigation and medical cost containment expenses, whether internal costs or external fees and adjusting another or A&O which is adjusting in other overhead expenses, whether internal costs or external fees. Both can change in the short term and long term depending on a number of factors, including attorney representation rate, statutory and regulatory changes, changes in efficiency in our claims organization among other possible causes but in general, tend to move with losses. In this example, we have selected LAE to be 12% of losses.\nA portion of our costs are mean reverting, forecasting elements of the fundamental pricing equation deals with two distinct forms of time series. First, time series was stationarity. The graph on the left. This series tends to revert to a historical mean and requires a longer experience period to provide an effective future forecast. Weather is a prime example of where this approach is warranted. Care must be taken to decide whether such historical mean needs to be slightly adjusted going forward due to environmental changes in our future pricing period.\nTime series without stationarity. The graph on the right. That series does not revert to a historical mean, it is dominated by trend and seasonality. We will discuss this further when we examine frequency trend, severity trend and premium trend. In this example, the last year contained $14 million of wind, flood, hail losses, well above our long-term expected average. Therefore, restating the long-term expectation implies a weather factor of 0.926.\nFor commercial lines, an additional area where we must consider this paradigm of reversion to the mean is in treatment of large losses. As with weather, care must be taken to decide whether such historical mean needs to be slightly adjusted going forward due to environmental changes in our future pricing period. Frequency and severity of losses change over time. What changes each over time? Essentially, this is time as a segmentation variable. It helps to separate the multiplicative components of losses as the drivers of each can be different. Frequency is the probability of having a claim, severity is the dollar amount of the claim itself. Factors that can affect frequency include vehicle technology, safety laws, product mix, for example, deductibles or tier, statements, new business growth, retention, weather, seasonality, underwriting and billing.\nApart from the magnitude of the trend itself, the number of months that we need to trend is important too. That is a function of time to price file, get approval and elevate, policy term and rate revision length. Remember the bull's eye slide from earlier? The precision of our estimates declines, meaning we have a greater spread, the further into the future we have to estimate. That is a particular importance in commercial auto as they have a preponderance of annual policies which increases the number of months into the future, we must trend.\nIn our example, we have estimated frequency trend to be plus 1% annually. That needs to be applied for approximately 16 months from the midpoint of the historic period to the future average accident deed of our prospective pricing period. The faster we can analyze our data, the shorter we can make our policy terms and the more frequently we can elevate rate revisions, the fewer months we need to trend and the more we can reduce spread of outcomes and increased precision in our forecasts. The process is similar for severity. Factors that can affect severity include vehicle technology, safety laws, product mix. For example, limits, state mix, medical inflation, used car values, car part inflation, body shop labor rates, weather, seasonality, claims staffing.\nIn our example, we have estimated severity trend to be plus 7% annually. As with frequency trend that needs to be applied for approximately 16 months from the midpoint of the historic period to the future average accident date of our prospective pricing period. The further into the future, we have to estimate the wider the spread of future possible outcomes. Progressive changes rates frequently. Remember, the fundamental pricing equation is working towards answering the fundamental pricing question of determining what we need to do to current rates.\nProgressive changes rates a lot. Consequently, any recent historical period of earned premium will include premium written at varying rate levels. This phenomenon is further exacerbated by the presence of varying policy terms, 6 months and 12 months. So we need to adjust this historical premium entirely to today's current rate level. In our example, we have elevated two rate decreases in the last year. That means our current rate level factor is 0.958.\nControlling for the effect of product mix shifts on loss trend. A frequency or severity trend that is caused by a product mix shift will not necessarily mean our rate adequacy position, as seen by our fundamental pricing equation will shift. For example, Progressive has been shifting to Robinsons for several years. In isolation, what would we expect to happen to frequency and severity of losses. Frequency would decrease significantly due to more lower risk drivers in our book, severity would increase for liability coverages due to higher purchased limits of liability. Overall, losses per exposure would decrease as the frequency decline would overwhelm the severity increase. But we would also be collecting less premium per exposure as we charge less for Robinsons for exposure.\nWe control for the effect of product mix shifts on our frequency and severity via premium trend which measures changes in average earned premium at current rate level over time. We must put all premium at a common rate level as only looking at changes in average earned premium over time would be confounded by Progressive's frequent rate changes. The graphs on bodily injury earned premium on this slide illustrate this. While Progressive's average earned premium per exposure has increased due to our rate increases in recent years, the average earned premium per exposure when controlling for that, i.e., at current rate level has declined. The net effect of the rate increases and product mix shift is still to have increasing bodily injury average earned premium per exposure. And therefore, a product mix shift will not necessarily mean our rate adequacy position would shift. It would only change if we are shifting into a part of our book that has a different relative level of profitability.\nIf we are shifting into a part of our book that is less profitable, the rate need, as indicated by the fundamental pricing equation would go up as frequency/severity would rise more than premium, and we would need more rate. If we are shifting into a part of our book that is more profitable, the rate need, as indicated by the fundamental pricing equation would go down as frequency/severity would rise less than premium and we would need less rate.\nIn our example, here, in contrast to the graphs of progressive bodily injury, annual premium trend is actually positive at plus 5%. And like frequency and severity trend, that needs to be applied for approximately 16 months from the midpoint of the historic period to the future average accident date of our prospective pricing period.\nWhat target loss plus LAE ratio would meet our underwriting profit target? First, we determined a forward-looking estimate of expense ratio. Second, we work backwards to determine our target loss ratio, which is equal to 1 minus the expense ratio minus profit. In our example, expense ratio is 17.7% of premium, together with our profit target of 4% and our budgetary loss plus LAE ratio is 78.3%. Some elements are correlated. While we have detailed the elements of the fundamental pricing equation individually, we do not assume the correlations do not exist between elements. Some examples are losses and LAE premium trend or product mix and frequency trend, premium trend or product mix and severity trend, LAE and severity trend, loss development factors and severity trend, premium trend or product mix and expenses via the budgetary loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Understanding these patterns can inform our predictions of each element and improve accuracy and precision of the fundamental pricing equation.\nBalancing responsiveness with stability. Remember the bull's eye diagram from earlier, we always seek truth but observe data which is truth plus random noise. Credibility, also known as the crown jewel of casualty actuarial science helps us ultimately deliver the best minimum variance unbiased estimate or as close to the bull's-eye pattern in the lower right-hand corner as possible and allows us to slice the cake optimally to balance responsiveness and stability and achieve forecasts that minimize both bias and variances.\nWe want to emphasize recent data such that random noise is kept to an acceptable level. And we want to emphasize that recent data because it is closest to what we can expect in our future pricing period in terms of our book of business and the external environment. But there can be a trade-off there as that data can be thinner and noisier and we need to make adjustments to account for that noise.\nCredibility is the number between and including 0 and 1 that we use to weight our data. The higher credibility is the more weight we attach to our data and the fundamental pricing equation. A sample of experience reaches full credibility, so credibility equals 1. If we have enough claims that 90% of the time, our experience is within plus or minus 5% of the true value. That standard for full credibility for each coverage is determined through complex actuarial formulas and increases as the variability of experience increases.\nIn our example, the standard for full credibility is 4,559 claims. We have over 27,000 claims in our experience period. So we have full credibility and credibility equals 1 or 100%. Our growth and scale has significantly enhanced our credibility and our ability to best react to changes in our environment. And in general, for personal auto, we have achieved that full credibility with one year of data in the overwhelming majority of our state channel coverage combinations.\nWe now have developed the fundamental pricing equation where we can answer the first fundamental pricing question. If we don't do anything to current rates, what loss plus LAE ratio should we expect in the upcoming rate revision for the policies we are about to write. So that's our experience loss plus LAE ratio. We can also answer the second fundamental pricing question, what do we need to do to current rates in order to hit our combined ratio target in the upcoming rate revision for policies we are about to write. That's our experienced loss plus LAE ratio divided by our budgetary loss plus LAE ratio.\nAnd one final step is to weight our estimate with a complement via credibility. So the experience loss plus LAE ratio divided by the budgetary loss plus LAE ratio times credibility plus a complement of credibility times 1 minus credibility. The complement is an alternate estimate of rate need apart from the fundamental pricing equation that augments the fundamental pricing equation with an estimate of future net trend. In our example, we used a complement of credibility of plus 2.4%.\nThe final product is what we refer to as a credibility weighted rate level indication here that is plus 1.3%. This concludes the theory of pricing. As you can see, it's complex with many variables and considerations and thus many ways to go astray. This is really, really hard to do successfully. We have been at this for decades, and combined with the availability, quality, scope and size of our data it is really, really hard to replicate this at our scale and to be as accurate and precise as possible when we apply this theory in practice, we have many additional considerations, which Jen Kubit will discuss in the next section. Jen?\n\nJen Kubit\n\nThank you, Brad, for explaining the theory behind the calculations to the two fundamental pricing questions. If we don't do anything to current rates, what loss plus LAE ratio should we expect in the upcoming rate revision for the policies we are about to write. And what do we need to do to current rates in order to hit our combined ratio target in the upcoming rate revision for policies we are about to write. So now let's discuss how we answer these questions at Progressive and how the answers influence customers' rates and future profitability.\nThis ratemaking process at Progressive slide was last shown in the 2021 Fourth Quarter Investor Relations call with John Curtis and Kanik Varma. This process is utilized in all our lines of business at Progressive. The product R&D, pricing and product management teams collaborate to determine the rate need to support our operational goals, grow as fast as you can at or below a 96 combined ratio. Additional teams joined these 3 to deploy the final rate changes to the marketplace. Once deployed, a consumer's quoted premium reflects the revised rates.\nLet's focus in on the 3 teams that collaborate to determine our rate need. There are 2 broad areas of rate need, segment level and aggregate rate. In this presentation, Brad went in depth into the best actuarial science we use in pricing to evaluate the aggregate rate need in the future revision to hit the target our budgetary loss and LAE ratio.\nProduct R&D calculates the segment rate need for the relative rate need across variables used in the product design and product managers leverage these aggregate and segment level rate needs, along with their knowledge of the local market dynamics to set the pricing strategy for their respective states. They decide if the segmentation aggregate rate level or both need to be revised. A product manager strategy ensures that we seek to not only hit rate revision targets, but also our calendar year goal to grow as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. At Progressive, we believe that our ratemaking process is effective because of the knowledge at the local level combined with the advanced and accurate view of segment level and aggregate rate need. And we strive to maximize its effectiveness by analyzing the rate need often and bringing revised rates to market quickly.\nIn personal auto pricing, we frequently evaluate the expected loss and LAE ratio in the future revision. We complete rate level indication analyses on 51 states with each agency and direct distribution channel done individually. Also, there are 12 to 15 coverages analyzed separately. For example, the bodily injury liability and comprehensive physical damage coverages each have their own indicated aggregate rate need because the data patterns are different, such as frequency and severity trends. These analyses are completed 3 or 4 times per year and discuss with the product manager of the specific state and channel along with their team. The numbers on this slide show that we're calculating the fundamental pricing equation roughly 4,000 times in a year. And each of those includes all the complex actuarial methodologies, analyses and selections that Brad discussed. So that's 4,000 times our pricing teams are analyzing how losses will develop to ultimate costs. And 4,000 times we're discussing with product managers how losses will trend into the future rate revision period.\nIn commercial auto pricing, our data set is smaller. However, we're still analyzing the aggregate rate need quarterly and discussing with the product management teams. We aggregate most states together to improve the credibility of our progressive data. The largest 4 states are analyzed individually. Rate revision and calendar year combined ratio results for smaller states are monitored. Rates are revised at the state level because of insurance regulation. And for rate revisions, we complete a rate level indication that uses state-specific data. We evaluate our aggregate rate needs separately for our 5 business market targets. Differences by BMT and how losses present and how they develop and frequency and severity trends over time, affect the estimated loss ratio in the future revision. And finally, there are 9 coverages analyzed separately in commercial auto rate level indications.\nOverall, we're analyzing and discussing at least 900 fundamental pricing equations in a year. The regular cadence of these complex analyses in both personal lines and commercial lines auto is so important in understanding the aggregate rate need and being responsive to changes in the data. But it's not enough to analyze the rate need often to truly respond to the changing data, we need to deploy rate changes to the market quickly.\nThis chart shows the number of rate revisions that are deployed each year over the past 5 years in our Personal Lines Auto and Commercial Lines auto products. We deploy many rate changes to market to adjust either the segment level, our aggregate rates are both. And we have the capabilities at Progressive to increase the number of revisions deployed. For example, in 2023, both the personal lines and commercial lines auto rate revision teams responded quickly and often to increasing loss costs and loss development in our underlying data. These rate revision capabilities are very important to our success at Progressive. Moving quickly is important because of the time needed for some states regulatory approval of rate changes and because of the premium earnings cadence. A policy written today at the new rate level will have earned premium in each month that it's in force or for the next 6 or 12 months depending on the policy term. So it takes many months for the earned premium and the denominator of our calendar year combined ratio to fully reflect the new rate level.\nWe are confident in our pricing teams aggregate rate level recommendations using our robust data sets, and we have an efficient process to deploy rate changes to the insurance market. However, there are times we must respond to changes and intervene in our fundamental pricing equation because historical data may not be informative. Recall that car accidents are not corn flakes. We are selling a promise to pay for claims in the future policy term. For example, changes in tariffs on imports may impact the payments on claims or loss payments in the future. Our role in the pricing teams is to answer the two fundamental pricing questions for the policies we are about to write in the upcoming rate revision.\nBut we have no previous loss payment experience with the changes to tariffs. Consistent with the Casualty Actuarial Society's statement of principles on ratemaking, we answer these two questions with an actuarially sound estimate of the expected value of all future costs, including changes in tariffs. Calculating the expected value of the future loss payments from changes to tariffs is not straightforward because auto claims are not all the same. Broadly speaking, we split the loss payments into claims for damaged vehicles versus injuries. And these two categories can be further split into similar types of costs.\nStarting with damaged vehicles. If it is repairable, the loss payment includes the cost of labor and parts and materials. If the repair is more costly than the value of the vehicle less anticipated salvage recoveries, then it is declared a total loss, and the claimant has paid the value. The expected value of the future loss payments from changes to tariffs is calculated at this more granular level of data. For example, the labor parts and materials, the value of a vehicle and salvage recoveries. This is because the cost in this granular level of data are more similar. Also, we consider the insurance coverage to the calculation of the expected value of the future loss payments from changes to tariffs collision and comprehensive coverage for our customers' damaged vehicle usually has a deductible for the first $500 or $1,000, but the maximum payment is unlimited. Compare this to property damage liability coverage for a claimant's damaged vehicle, it has a limit to the maximum payment.\nFor example, $25,000 on the personal lines auto policy. For injuries to claimants or our customers, the loss payment includes the cost of medical treatment. The loss payment may also include general damages, such as pain and suffering. Again, we analyze how the changes to tariffs may affect these two different types of costs included in injury loss payments, and we consider the insurance coverage.\nInsurance coverage for injuries usually has a limit to the maximum payment per claim. For example, per injured person and $100,000 for all injured claimants on a personal lines auto policies bodily injury liability coverage. A commercial auto policy often carries significantly higher bodily injury and property damage liability coverage. For example, $1 million combined single limit. But the pricing team is not working alone. We believe our analyses are improved by collaborating across functions at Progressive. We leverage subject matter expertise to calculate the expected value of the future loss payments from changes to tariffs.\nThe economics team within Progressive's capital management function provides interpretation on the federal government's actions and timing for implementation. They also share insights and external economic indices related to tariffs and imports. Members of the claims functions, process and control teams provide subject matter expertise on the categories of loss payments described in the previous slide to evaluate if they are impacted by tariffs. They provide the necessary granular data. The pricing team aggregates this information from the economics and claims teams to calculate the expected value of future loss payments, including changes to tariffs. We then incorporate this expected value of loss payments within the fundamental pricing equation to calculate the expected loss and LAE ratio in the upcoming revision for the policies we will write.\nProgressive has multiple pricing teams within the personal lines and commercial lines functions. Personal Lines is also split by auto, home and special lines. In addition to collaborating with economics and claims, we also collaborate among the pricing groups to share and debate methodologies and assumptions. Despite all the best actuarial methods for evaluating the aggregate rate need, communicating with product managers and deploying quickly to market, predicting the future is impossible. So our initial expected value of future loss payments, including changes in tariffs will be wrong.\nThe fundamental pricing equation requires us to estimate future loss payments and other costs. All our future predictions are wrong to some degree, and the probability of being wrong increases with changes that have minimal historic precedents such as inflationary impacts when an economy emerges from a pandemic or the frequently changing impacts of tariffs. Pricing, claims and economics teams are working together to monitor the actual change in loss payments from implemented changes to tariffs.\nThe scale and quality of our data at Progressive allows us to quickly identify the change in the actual loss payments and compare it to our expected value. This leads to refining our calculations. Our robust data set at Progressive and the expertise of multiple teams contributes to our speed through this iterative cycle of estimate, monitor and refine. We are moving quickly to the center of the Bull's eye from Brad's slides where our expected value of future loss payments from changes in tariffs are accurate and precise.\nProducing the rate-level indications often provides the updated aggregate rate level advice to product managers so they can recognize the differences in the refined expected value of the future loss payments. We have the capability to deploy necessary rate changes quickly. The speed of estimating, monitoring and refining our rate level indications and deploying the right rate change is important to deliver on our profit targets. And we want to write more business when we have accurate rates relative to the expected costs.\nChanges in tariffs are not our first intervention to the fundamental pricing equation. Our combined ratio results show that we have moved quicker than the industry to recognize increasing costs, raise rates and deliver on our operational goal of at or below a 96 combined ratio. In Personal Auto, the standard deviation of our annual combined ratios in this 11 years from 2014 through 2024 is half of the average standard deviation from the other top 10 carriers. So we are responding quicker and making smart interventions.\nPricing's collaboration with subject mentor experts and other progressive functions along with the infrastructure to analyze rate need often and deploy rate changes quickly, has proven effective in responsiveness and stability of our combined ratio and is a major contributor to our outperformance of the industry.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Brad Granger and Jen Kubit, who are available to answer questions about the presentation.

Constantine\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's first quarter investor event. I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's call for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO are previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team.\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as supplemented by our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2025, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. Since the pandemic started in March of 2020, we've hosted 20 Investor Relations calls. And the common theme of those calls has been how our business is weathering uncertain and unique macroeconomic environment. The last 5 years has shown challenge after challenge [indiscernible]. And through it all, Progressive has not merely survived, but thrived. Following a fantastic 2024, we just delivered one of our best quarters ever with near-record margins coupled with record growth. As more challenges arise, including in the form of the macroeconomic effects of tariffs, I feel very confident in Progress' ability to face the issues head on.\nThe momentum we had in 2024 carried us into 2025. And during the first quarter, we added new policies below our target acquisition cost and continued moving full speed ahead on growth with a focus on realizing our vision of becoming consumers, agents and business owners' #1 destination for insurance and other financial needs.\nEven though our competitors have reported improved profitability over the last couple of quarters, the shopping environment in personal auto has remained very favorable to Progressive. You may recall that the first quarter 2023 set the record for the most new personal auto applications of any other first quarter in our history. Well I'm proud to say that the first quarter 2025 personal auto new applications surpassed the previous record by over 20%. Our results achieved because of both more quotes, and higher conversion of those quotes to a sale. More year-over-year quotes, mean our customer acquisition machine is running efficiently and strong conversion in both channels suggest a very good price competitiveness.\nGrowth is not just happening in personal auto. In property, we increased homeowners policies [ enforced ] in the less volatile states and reduced policies [ enforced ] in the more volatile state. We're also continuing to significantly grow our renters business. In commercial lines, although the trucking space continues to be challenging, core commercial auto new applications are up 8% year-over-year and our business auto and contractor BMT has experienced significant growth in new applications. In addition to growth, our personal auto and property products as well as commercial lines have year-to-date combined ratios below 90, a significant achievement considering the industry's challenges in property and commercial auto.\nDespite the significant turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks as investors react to tariffs and other news, I'm pleased to report that our balance sheet has remained strong. At quarter end, common equities were only 4% of our total portfolio. And thus far, it has been largely insulated from stock market volatility. Additionally, we have been generating capital at a brisk pace, both from strong underwriting profitability and investment returns.\nFor the quarter, our investment portfolio generated investment income that was 32% greater than the first quarter last year and averaged over $270 million a month year-to-date. We are still in the early days of the tariffs and the effects may not be known until sometime in the future. The interconnectedness of global trade makes it even more difficult to predict where and how quickly the impact of tariffs will work their way through supply chain and ultimately, our [ loss cost ]. Determining our rate levels is a prospective exercise where we try to predict future loss trends and other costs to be able to set appropriate rates to achieve our underwriting profitability goal. Since late 2024, our talented team of pricers, modelers, analysts and actuaries have been modeling various scenarios to allow us to assess the impact of potential tariffs on our business to help us to be prepared to react as quickly as possible.\nIn our fourth quarter 2021 IR call, we talked about our ability to gather data quickly, process it effectively and react to it decisively. I believe we're better at this than anyone else in the industry. And proof of this is that over the last 20 years, periods of macroeconomic turmoil have often directly coincided with progressive most successful periods. More recently, the inflationary environment of 2021 through 2023 proved that we were able to manage through rapid unpredictable increases in loss costs and manage our calendar year combined ratio. I think that we have the tools, systems and most importantly, the people to react quickly and effectively during times of market disruption. While I can't know what the future holds, I believe the odds are strongly in favor of Progressive to once again manage through whatever lies ahead, better than anyone else in the industry.\nThank you again for joining us today, and I will now take your questions."

Constantine\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Fourth Quarter Investor Event.

Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. As we usually do for our calls after even number of quarters, today, we will have a presentation that dives into a certain aspect of our business. Today, we'll speak to two of our strategic pillars: People and culture where everything starts for us and competitive prices with a focus on technology investments in our Claims process. To present these topics today, we've enlisted two experts in Progressive. First, we have John Murphy, Claims President. John assumed the role of Claims present in December 2021 after spending nearly 7 years as Progressive's customer relationship management President. In this role, he was responsible for all aspects of Claims strategy and resolution across all product lines. John joined Progressive as a Claims representative in 1992. During his initial tenure in Claims, he held various strategy, process and operations roles in the country, including regional Claims manager, national implementation leader, Claims business leader and physical damage process business leader.\nAfter John, we have Matt White wide joining us today. Matt has been our Claims business leader for data and analytics since May of 2022, after spending 6 years in Personal Lines managing our hologram innovation team in direct acquisition. In this role, he's responsible for our Claims data science, business intelligence and data strategy to build solutions for all aspects of Claims handling. Matt joined Progressive in 2014 as an IT manager after serving the CoStar. His military career took him from various leadership positions on ships petroleum in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific to Washington, D.C., where he worked on Capitol Hill in Budget and Program Management. He was the Director of Operations in Key West Florida and ultimately to Cleveland, where he oversaw several business lines across the great Lakes region.\nAgain, thank you for joining us this morning, and I will now pass it on to John. John?\n\nJohn Joseph Murphy\n\nMD and Lead United States Auto Analyst, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\n\nThank you, Tricia. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Over the next 40 minutes, you're going to hear a quick recap of 2024, which was a tremendous year for Progressive. We'll dive into two of our strategic pillars: First, people and culture, which is where our long history of success starts and then competitive pricing. We will focus on the critical role that Claims plays in creating a competitive advantage that helps fuel business growth. And finally, we'll share just one of the many examples where the effective use of data and technology at Progressive enhances our Claims team's accuracy and efficiency.\nNow before I get to the topics at hand, I wanted to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that ravaged the Los Angeles area injury. Our thoughts and prayers remain with those affected by this event. In that vein, we know our customers want and expect action to support their recovery. Our catastrophe services team responded quickly with empathy and respect to meet their needs. While the majority of the claims we received are now resolved, our team continues to assist our customers however they can.\nI also wanted to acknowledge our human resources and local leadership team who responded quickly to support our employees who are impacted by these fires. As a senior leader in this organization, the urgency, empathy and care that our collective team has shown here is an excellent example of our core values in action and fills me with incredible pride.\nQuickly recapping 2024. In short, this was arguably the greatest year in the 87-year history of Progressive. Net premiums written grew approximately 21% year-over-year, finishing the year at $74.4 billion. In absolute dollars, premium grew by nearly $13 billion in this single calendar year. So let me try and put that in perspective.\nThat nearly $13 billion net premium increase in '24 is equivalent to adding the premium of the eighth largest auto insurer in the calendar year of 2023. For those who have been following us for a while, the premium growth in '24 is about $1 billion more than we wrote for the entire calendar year of 2003. Average written premium increases provided a little bit of a tailwind here, but the majority of this premium growth comes from customer growth, which is our preferred measure, and 2024 was a record year here as well. We increased active policy by more than 5 million this year, which is more than twice the previous highest annual rate of policy growth in our history.\nGrowth is one important objective for us and profitability is the other. You're well aware of our stated calendar year goal of a 96 combined ratio or below. And in 2024, we produced a CR of 88.8, well below the 96 and also about 6 points lower than 2023. We often say that growing or generating a profit individually is fairly straightforward. To do both simultaneously and at the performance levels that we did in 2024 is significantly more challenging.\nIn true Progressive fashion, more than 65,000 of us worked diligently together to deliver what may very well be the best combination of growth and profitability in the industry.\nWhile we celebrate these successes, our excellence core value challenges us to continually improve for our teammates, our customers, partners and investors. I believe strategic investments in our people, data, processes and technology position us to perhaps have an even better 2025.\nThe fourth cornerstones is a construct that we've shared in the past. It's how we think about competitive advantage and defines how we win and win in the right way. We start with our core values or who we are. These are unifying statements that provide the very foundation of our company culture since the late 1980s.\nNext is our purpose or why we're here. We evolved this statement in 2022 to build on the legacy of our core values, and our history of challenging the status quo to accelerate progress. Then we have our vision of where we're headed. This company-wide objective highlights the constituents that we feel so fortunate to serve and our never-ending pursuit of becoming the #1 destination.\nFinally, is our strategy or how we'll get there. These are the 4 important pillars of this strategy, and 2 of them will be the focus of today's discussion. People and culture, which are collectively our most powerful source of competitive advantage and competitive pricing is driven by industry-leading segmentation, claims accuracy and operational efficiency.\nProgressive people and culture are collectively our most powerful source of competitive advantage, a very well-known and respected brand, a routinely recognized top work environment and sustained business success makes us an attractive option for folks in market looking for jobs.\nWhile our growth rate in staff over the past 10 years lags PIF growth and premium, it has been substantial. Our outstanding talent acquisition group generates robust Canada pools for our roles from which we then choose top talent with personal values that align with our core values. Due to the very significant number of people interested in working at Progressive, we're able to be highly selective. In fact, we hire less than 3% of people who apply for jobs at Progressive. This scale advantage allows us to bring additive skills and experiences to our team, ensuring that we're always growing and always evolving.\nOur culture is built on the foundation of our core values, and it has evolved beautifully with our people growth over several years. A transparent, inclusive and forward-thinking environment ensures our people feel empowered, welcomed, valued and respected. Development focus allows our people to build careers have become talented business leaders who can drive enduring success for decades to come.\nGallup is a multinational analytics and advisory company well known for its public opinion polls and surveys conducted worldwide. In an article published on January 14, 2025, Gallup reported that U.S. employee engagement sank to a 10-year low. That is not the case at Progressive. At Progressive 2024 marked a significant year of achievement where engagement has surpassed previous records. Progressive ranks in the 98th percentile of engagement and the 99th percentile in overall satisfaction. These results have us in the top 10 and top 5, respectively, for U.S. companies in Gallup's client database.\nAs we look a level deeper into our 2024 survey results, we see year-over-year increases in every single question and in every tenure bucket. As we explore the tens of thousands of comments from our team, responses to the question, the one thing I like most, generates themes of a positive work environment, care for customers and colleagues, strong leadership and support, career growth and development, flexibility and values. You can see just a few of the comments here on this slide.\nOnce again, consistent with our excellence core value and our desire to consistently improve, we also ask about things that should change. The data that we collect from that question, really all others are rich and guide our efforts to further nurture our special culture. We believe firmly that the investments we've made in our people and culture have fueled our growth and success for several years now. We'll continue to care for both to position us to be e-better in the future.\nIn prior presentations, we've discussed our ability to rapidly deploy risk selection and new product models, our segmentation excellence as well as efficient media and agency compensation each of which has had a positive impact on rate competitiveness. Claims plays a very important role here as well. The combination of loss costs and loss adjustment expenses typically represents between 70% and 75% of our total company expenditures.\nSo we focus heavily on producing accurate claim outcomes while optimizing efficiency, customer experiences and employee engagement. We refer to these as our 4 guiding principles, and they have helped inform our daily efforts, investments and priorities in Claims for more than 2 decades. On the left and right, you see the 2 key constituencies that we are privileged to serve. In the middle are the 2 items that have the most linear connection to our combined ratio and ultimately the rates that we then have in market. If we don't deliver here, we simply can't compete at the level we become accustomed to and continue to aspire to.\nThis chart is our theoretical cost curve and gives incident to how we approach our work. The x-axis represents loss adjustment expenses, or LAE, essentially what we spend to operate the claims organization. The Y-axis represents loss costs, both claims payments and reserves plus LAE. Much like my commentary earlier about growth and profitability, being accurate or being efficient individually are straightforward. Doing both at the same time is a far greater challenge, and we believe we do it better than anyone in the industry.\nNow there are downsides to focusing too much on either side of this curve. If sole objective was to be the lowest cost, we couldn't make the investments in people, data and technology that enable us to pay the right amount. Quality would suffer, cycle time would increase, rentals would extend and ultimately, loss costs would rise. Likewise, if accurate as the sole objective, you would need to overspend to eliminate the potential for errors likely spend on non-value-added activities and end up with a cost structure that would be uncompetitive. We leverage operational excellence to drive us down this curve. This is where having the best people in the industry who are willing to get into the details, investigate tirelessly and effectively and make the right decisions around coverage, liability and damages, really pays dividends and moves us down the left side of this curve. Empowering them with the right data, processes and tools, increases their efficiency and throughput, moving us down the right side of this curve.\nNow this view of driving down total cost is more about the journey and the incremental gains that come with it than any theoretical destination because no matter how good we get, we will always seek to be better. In the Claims organization, we constantly measure accuracy and efficiency, so we always know how we're doing. Objective assessments of the work provide valuable insights into how and where we can be even better.\nAnd while we're always trying to find the optimal spot on this curve, we also strategically target efforts to shift the curve to a better position for us and for our customers. You'll hear from Matt White shortly about how we invest in new technology, data and processes to shift this curve. And this is what driving down and shifting the curve looks like in practical application, using perhaps the best measure of success for Claims, which total cost.\nWhile Claims supports all manufactured products across auto, special lines, commercial lines and home, I use private passenger auto data here because it offers the cleanest comparison relative to industry. This graph is a visual representation of the competitive advantage our claims organization in conjunction with all other business areas brings to Progressive and shows why we're able to grow faster and with better margins than the industry as a whole.\nTotal cost is a combination of loss costs, which tied directly to accuracy and LAE, which is our primary efficiency metric. This slide compares Progressive reflected by the to the industry ex Progressive, which is in orange, and shows that we've maintained an advantage for more than a decade. More recently, though, you can see the gap widen. And while we don't have complete 2024 statutory data for the industry yet, we have loss ratio data through the first 3 quarters of '24, and we maintain a 7-point advantage in loss ratio alone. As we compare our own results for 2024 to 2023 for total indemnity, we see a near 9-point improvement and finish the most recent year, sub-70%.\nBack to our full set of guiding principles. I'm proud to say that in 2024, our Claims organization had the highest engagement in our history. The lowest LAE ratio in our history, improved accuracy, and generated the best customer satisfaction and retention that we have in several years. These results don't just happen and they don't happen overnight. This culture of execution excellence has been developed over years, and isn't easily replicable, but we believe it can be improved upon.\nAnd now Matt White, our Claims business leader of data and analytics is going to share with you how we use data and technology to enable and enhance our human capital. While the efficiency and cost wins you'll hear about are very significant, it's our intentionality around also increasing accuracy that makes these efforts really valuable. Matt?\n\nMatt White\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks very much, John. empowering our employees is indeed at the heart of our approach and Claims. As emphasized by John and as Tricia states often, along with our culture, our people are our greatest competitive advantage. We focus on enhancing, not replacing their roles through technology. Similarly, we want to enable our customers with user-friendly digital options so they can interact with us when, where and how they choose. We'll share some of those concepts and how our progressive DNA around digital experiences, segmentation and data translate to claims. And we'll dive into a specific use case around photo estimating, highlighting the Progressive made and our commitment to achieve the optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency.\nJohn showed how we stack up from a total loss LAE perspective. Here is an alternative view of efficiency. An indexed comparison of auto policy growth and the number of staff aligned to auto claims handling. We continue to grow and hire. But our scale and strategic investments have allowed us to grow staff at a slower rate than policies, shown in the gray shaded area indicating the growing gap. And while we acknowledge that frequency declines in this period are a tailwind, we're very pleased with the efficiency [Audio Gap] the improvements we've been able to achieve.\nMarket conditions may have us make specific calendar year staffing decisions to ensure we're positioned for the future. But over the long term, we believe we can continue to become more efficient and selective with the human capital required to service our customers while maintaining the competitive advantage we believe our culture provides.\nIn prior calls, you've heard us talk about our large and growing media spend and how critical it is for us to manage it efficiently. Efficiency is also top of mind with our claims technology spend. The vertical axis shows the indexed gap between auto policies claims staff, the same gray area I highlighted in the previous slide. In general, we want to be higher on the vertical axis, indicating more efficiency in our staffing. The horizontal axis is our claims IT spend, a subcomponent of LAE. In this case, both indexed to 2007.\nYou'll note that while we made some progress growing that policy of the staff gap from 2008 to 2016, when our technology spend was flat to down slightly, it grew notably faster with some strategic investment decisions after that point. The policy to staff gap grew by 50% from the index values of 1 to nearly 1.5 in the 9-year period from 2007 to 2016. But we've been able to grow it by 130% from 1.5 to 3.4 in the 7 years since 2017. Our investments in technology to improve the claims process have shown through and clear efficiency gain. And not unlike our media spend, we're willing to invest here as long as we can do so efficiently.\nYou've heard us talk before about our digital capabilities and acquisition and policy servicing, and the obvious value we believe advanced product segmentation provides for our company results. That progressive DNA and experience applies just as well to Claims. In fact, when it comes to first notice of loss or the moment of truth when a customer contacts us to report a claim, we think about it similarly to our acquisition funnels. That said, it is a bit more nuanced as it's a funnel that then feeds our claims handling funnel from the point of assignment to resolution. And that path can be nonlinear depending on the circumstances of the claim or what facts might emerge a initial assignment.\nNonetheless, there are similar trade-offs at first notice of loss as in our acquisition funnels. Asking a lot of questions might aid initial triage and segmentation, but it might also frustrate customers, drive digital abandonment and increase call times and expense. What's very important, we gather as much accurate information as we can, as efficiently as we can, but limited to only what we truly need. As John alluded to previously, it's straightforward to one, it's much more complicated to do both at the same time. To be clear, segmentation in this context is about the facts of the claim and not customer segments. We are not talking about Robinsons or Sams here, but not every claim or accident is the same, knowing the number of vehicles and parties involved, where their vehicles are likely total losses and whether there are injuries and how severe are just a few of the many important facts that allow us to segment income and claims and make assignment decisions to get the claim in the right hands faster.\nGetting it wrong can negatively impact cycle time, which can increase expenses such as rental and storage fees, if we must spend time retriage and claims and/or vehicles. It also resulted in a suboptimal customer experience and even hurt retention. We believe there remains additional upside on the digital side of our first notice of loss funnel and have been investing accordingly. Industry data from Bain suggests that digital adoption in the auto claim submission process averages about 25%. While we are meaningfully above that industry data point, we think there remains additional opportunity given the long-term trends we've seen in acquisition and policy servicing.\nMany customers prefer interacting digitally, and we'll continue investing to ensure we have those options available. That said, an accident is certainly a very different kind of life event than purchasing or modifying a policy, and we will always be available for human-to-human contact with customers that prefer or need that channel. One of the reasons we continue to invest in digital experiences for our customers and our employees is it further accelerates a virtuous data cycle we've referenced a variety of context over the years.\nAs we work to resolve claims, our customers and employees generate a variety of interactions with each other and other involved parties. Historically, across the industry, these have been predominantly analog in their nature with lots of phone calls, manual claim and relatively unstructured data. At Progressive, we've invested significantly in monitoring digital experiences. Those enable us to turn many of those unstructured processes and associated data into more structured information. Additionally, the very nature of digital interactions creates even more data that's not exclusive to a fine set of events or outcomes. They also provide experiential insights to how our customers and employees are using those systems.\nThis data helps us identify areas for additional claims process and technology investment connecting back to John's description of how claims contributes to competitive pricing. Our operational efficiency improved helped lower LAE, which enables lower rates, powering additional business growth and scale, generating even more data and enabling additional targeted investments.\nOne example of these cycles in action has been photo estimating. Photo estimating is a digital experience whose adoption has grown significantly. It can be a convenient one for customers and claimants when they're uncertain as to the repair cost relative to any deductible or they're not sure when or where they'll get the vehicle repaired. From the comfort of their own home or workplace, they can submit photos via guided digital experience and get a repair estimate back quickly, often within a day, if not faster. If you recall the conceptual curves John discussed, photo estimating is a good example of a shift in the curve. And as we'll walk through even when we do a -- a shift, we continue to optimize so we can operate at the bottom of the curve.\nThe chart on the left shows annual photo estimates of 2016, over which time we've enjoyed an 82% growth rate. While we're not showing actual numbers on the prime axis, know that in total, this represents millions of photo-based estimates written over the last 8 years. And with it, of course, tens of millions of customer-submitted photos.\nSecondary vertical axis is an indexed view of our Estimate Quality Index plotted on the orange line. These objective assessments of the work that John mentioned earlier are a core benchmark for quality and accuracy, and an invaluable source of ground truth. Despite the growing volume, there's been no material degradation in accuracy. So while we're pleased with the growth of photo estimating as a viable and efficient vehicle inspection channel, we are consistently measuring accuracy alongside the growth in volume to ensure the experience we're offering and outcomes we're generating aren't compromising the claims guiding principles John described earlier.\nThe chart on the right indexes daily estimates completed compared to traditional in-person estimate completion. In total, we've seen we can complete 2.5x the number of estimates each day, making it our most efficient vehicle inspection channel.\nOnce we achieve viable scale, refined our processes, organizational and data structures, we began to apply additional technology so that we could potentially drive further down the cost curve. In this case, we're using machine vision models alongside a variety of other technologies to help us automate parts of the photo estimating process. These photos illustrate the process without disclosing actual customer images. At a high level, we're using deep learning models or neural networks, alongside more traditional machine learning peaks to look at customer-submitted photos like the example on the left, identify the correct parts through segmentation masks and then identify the location and type of damage by part.\nGenerating an accurate estimate requires several discrete predictions. For example, we need to know not just the location of the damage by specific part, but also the type of damage. Is it a dent, scratch, et cetera. From there, we need to decide whether we should repair or replace the part. And in the case of repair, how many labor hours do we believe it will take. These models use transformer architectures you may have heard about, quite literally the second tea and ChatGPT, but they are trained very differently than some of the models making headlines more recently. These are supervised models that we train on our photos and our own curated data to ensure accuracy consistent with progressive estimating standards.\nSuch models all benefit from very large, clean and diverse data sets. We're fortunate to have all 3 in-house without feeling a need to look externally. And again, that ground truth data from objective assessments and our own people's disciplined quality assurance processes and willingness to do the hard work to get it right give us the benefit of a very clean, trustworthy and we believe, differentiating historical data set. It's my experience that it's really the combination of technology and Progressive's talented people that make the brands. On this solution, our data science team works daily with our physical damage process team that combined brings over 400 years of experience. Most of them have worked at every level of our Claims organization. They have estimates themselves, worked in and alongside shops and have a deep understanding of all facets of vehicle repair. It's that difficult to replicate expertise alongside more advanced technology that really helps us deliver competitive advantage.\nAs one quick example of why the details and subject matter expertise matters, let's consider a bumper. It's not enough to be able to identify a bumper and the existence of damage on it, you need to be able to distinguish between such things as upper and lower bumper covers depending on the year, make and model. And in this case, the presence of bumper sensors. At left is a rendering of an example with some of the things our solution does behind the scenes in relative real time. In this case, cropping the bumper from the original image and then making a prediction as to whether it sees the smaller outlines that indicate the presence of sensors in the bumper of a particular car. These can be very hard for even a human eye to detect from a photo. But we must get such things right to ensure we get the accurate part of the estimate in the first place, and account for the incremental labor required as shown in the estimate ample on the right.\nOf course, while machine vision is a very interesting technology, we are not in the business of winning data science competitions. We are in the business of insurance, so it's important we prove the value. The orange line here represents the index value of traditional in-person inspections completed per day, the same value as before. You can see the light blue line as we introduced and then scaled photo estimating get into that original 2.5x increase in productivity that I mentioned previously.\nWe began this journey in 2019, well before the current hype cycle, as an R&D effort with a small group of our photo estimating representatives. We continue to iterate and refine our models and approach until such time that we were convinced one of the efficiency gains and two, that we were able to equal or better accuracy results.\nNow the darker blue line shows our estimates per day when enhanced by machine vision. In 2022, we began expanding these capabilities throughout our photo estimating organization and fully rolled them out in 2023, having achieved an incremental 2x increase in productivity. To put that in some context, without these advances, we would have needed a 200 additional staff in 2024. While it has been a multiyear journey, the combination of data science and other automation techniques have now doubled the productivity of what, as I mentioned, was already our most efficient means of vehicle inspection and estimating. 100% of our photo estimates are now initially drafted by these solutions and then validated and/or corrected by our estimating professionals.\nTo be clear, this is not full automation or straight through processing that you may see referenced across the industry. We have people involved. We do think full automation is possible at some point, but we won't do that until we're sure we can do it consistent with our guiding principles and, of course, applicable regulations. For now, we're quite happy to continue empowering our people to be even more and more productive. And we continue to see gains with nothing suggesting to us, we've even hit us feeling yet.\nI'll cover just two examples on how we're continuing to further refine our solution that we think will generate incremental gains in accuracy and efficiency beyond even what we've already achieved. Beyond our people's efficiency, we also work to make our model training more efficient. At our scale, we must keep up with a very diverse set of vehicles and an OEM market that is always moving. One of the ways we do that is with a semi-supervised training approach called pseudo-labeling. This is the practice of training a model on a small set of label data to label the rest of the data. Traditional machine vision use cases rely on a very large set of manually labeled photos, as I mentioned. But as we've scaled our solution, we sought to improve the speed at which we can deliver value across a broader and ever-evolving list of car parts.\nFor context, and while it certainly varies by manufacturer, there are an average around 125 distinct external parts on most common vehicle types. Our process starts with our original segmentation model capable of identifying major parts such as doors and quarter panels. From this base model trained on subject matter experts labels, pseudo labels are generated on a much larger data set to create an initial base model that's even better at those major parts. This improved base model is then fine-tuned with even more detailed part labels from a diverse set of vehicles. This allows us to get more details about very specific parts in the vehicle, like portions of the grill and emblems that can all vary in shape, location or even existence depending on the specific vehicle type. This new part segmentation model is a general template model that works reasonably well on all vehicles.\nBut to ensure the most accurate outcome, we customize the model further for specific vehicle makes and models. With only around 100 detailed label examples, we can apply these vehicle-specific pseudo labels to hundreds of thousands more examples of that vehicle using a bootstrap technique to randomly sample additional internal data.\nFor computational efficiency, we then fine-tune the model with a technique called low-rank adaptation or LORA. LORA allows us to efficiently adapt large models to specific tasks enhancing precision without needing as much training data or training time. The point of all this is shown in the images on the right. While you might look at the top right image and suggests the damage is probably on the bumper or maybe the right front vendor, the accurate view is the damage extends across three parts: the bumper, front fender, and molding, the details of which we achieved by much more fine-grained part segmentation capability. Our approach ensures both broad applicability and precise customization across vehicle reducing the need for extensive label data sets. It has enabled us to achieve a 10x speed improvement in training while providing more accurate identification of all relevant external parts. It's important to recognize that such techniques are not possible without very trustworthy and accurate labels and a large data set upon which to extend them. Our subject matter experts and tens of millions of available photos give us both.\nThis is obviously a very fast-moving space. We continue to keep our eyes on. This animation illustrates a newer approach called 3D Gaussian Splatting. It allows us to transform 2-dimensional images into dynamic 3-dimensional models. Doing this well requires a lot of photos. But back to those trade-offs of accuracy, efficiency and customer experience, we can't reasonably ask customers to take hundreds of photos. But we do ask them to take a video in addition to around 8 to 12 photos on average. A 1-minute video at 30 frames per second of the car yields us around 1,800 frames, and it's that data we are increasingly leveraging as part of our solution.\nSome research scientists have suggested that what large language models are to text, Gaussian Splatting is to graphics. The latter is what's interesting to us. Being able to reconstruct the vehicle as if we were in person to understand the full extent of damage. 3D Gaussian Splatting builds on previous work in the field of reconstruction such as neuroradiance field, but it's much more computationally efficient and as a solution that meets our operational needs. Remember, we must be efficient and accurate.\nWhile we won't walk through the math here, there are 4 primary steps to this technique. First, we use the underlying data, again, thousands of frames to understand the position of the Cara and construct a 3-dimensional coordinate grid to understand the relative position of every pixel in the frame. In parallel with understanding camera position, algorithmic techniques such as motion create a point cloud or mesh of the vehicle. This essentially gives us the center point or mean upon which to locate the gaussian splats.\nOn those points, we gaussian functions onto each pixel to simulate the physical characteristics of the vehicle surface. It can capture intricate details, providing a more comprehensive reconstruction of the vehicle surface and geometry. Those 3-dimensional splits or blobs help us render the point cloud, representing every point as a gaussian or normal distribution in 3-dimensional space. From there, we optimize using traditional graphic rasterization techniques and adjusting the density of the gaussians until we get results representative of the original training data.\nWhat's ultimately produced is a fully interactive 3D model of the vehicle. This is important because it allows you to view the vehicle and damaged regions from novel angles and views that may not have been fully captured in the original data and also provide for more accurate scale and distance measurement enabled by full understanding the relative camera angles. Such approaches can enable more accurate labor hour predictions where the service and depth are very relevant to how long it will take to repair a part. Longer term, we think it could enable virtual inspections of additional damage types. Vehicle conditioning in the case of total loss and perhaps enable LEAP decisions by anticipating damage to interior parts that aren't visible from external pictures alone because we have a more detailed understanding damage depth.\nLastly, I do want to reiterate that at Progressive, this isn't about cool science or gaussian math for its own sake. It's about our excellence core view striving for continuous improvement and better business outcomes, for our customers, employees and investors. And as John mentioned previously, we are willing to dig deep and work hard to achieve those outcomes consistent with our core values.\nBefore wrapping up, I wanted to share our general approach when we consider build and buy decisions. First, we think those are complementary and not competitive sides of the same coin. For example, our vision solution for photo estimating is powered by things we have built, but also relies on very tight integrations with our EX platform partner to turn those predictions into the correct part numbers and actual estimates. When building or buying, we prefer to keep things decoupled. Rather than monolithic solutions, good for one purpose, but perhaps difficult to change or modify for other purposes, we prefer to build or buy systems that are open or can be decoupled so that some of the pieces and parts can be reassembled and is something entirely new.\nThis gives us the potential to earn outsized returns on the initial technology investment and provides flexibility when new technology solutions inevitably arise. We can use those decouple pieces to drive near-term value but it also allows us to be agile in adopting new solutions like pseudo labeling, gaussian splatting and whatever may be next. We can also start to apply parts of the original solution to build something entirely new that we may not have even considered at the time.\nOn the right is an example of that potential emerging. When we began a firm commitment to our claims Machine Vision journey with photo estimating back in 2019, we were focused on photos that were submitted after first notice of loss from customers that had selected photo estimating as their vehicle inspection option. But as we've iterated on that experience or funnel, we're now receiving hundreds of thousands of photos per year at first notice of loss, and that is an accelerating rate as we optimize. This is before a customer may have decided to opt in for photo estimating.\nWe can and do use those for photo estimating, but we can also apply our existing machine vision capabilities in that initial triage and segmentation decision and not just photo estimating. It could allow us to make even more fine grand triage decisions based on a much more accurate damage estimate. We can also use those photos to enable more sophisticated review processes of estimates that weren't written through the photo estimating channel.\nWe hope a few things came through today as we conclude. First, I'll remind again that the 2024 company-wide results John shared and our efforts in Claims to help enable competitive pricing starts with our people and culture. They and it are what makes such things possible. Secondly, we remain tirelessly committed and energized to chase that ever-elusive perfect cost curve balance while simultaneously investing strategically to shift it further downward, and we see further opportunities ahead to continue doing just that. And as shared in the photo estimating example, we continue to exploit advanced technology by putting it in the hands of our people because we know they will generate outcomes fully aligned with our Progressive core value and claims guiding principles and keep those virtuous cycles turning.\nOn behalf of John and I and 65,000-plus Progressive teammates, thank you for your attention.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event.

Constantine\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive Second Quarter Investor Event. I'm Dough Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be a moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team.\nThe introductory comments and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2024. We will see discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I am pleased to introduce our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Pat?\n\nPatrick K. Callahan\n\nPresident of Personal Lines, The Progressive Corporation\n\nThanks, Dough. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm Pat Callahan, Personal Lines President, and I'm pleased to introduce the topic of today's presentation, direct acquisition. Our vision is to become consumers, agents and business owners, #1 destination for insurance and other financial needs. To achieve that vision, we strive to be available where, when and how consumers want to shop for their insurance and to optimize our experiences to meet the needs of individual consumers. A foundational element of this optimization is to understand the differences between our agency and direct channel customers.\nAgency customers often choose that channel because they value the professional local counsel, ease of shopping, and breadth and depth of product and carrier options available through independent agents. These customers often have more complex insurance needs. And as such, the expertise provided by an agent coupled with the personal relationship agents build with their customers gives the customer peace of mind. The direct channel customer frequently places higher value on the convenience and ease of access afforded through self-service 24/7 shopping and servicing.\nThey often have less complex needs and feel comfortable making insurance decisions after educating themselves through the tools that we provide online, supplemented by the knowledge of our trained and licensed direct consultants. The customers, segmentation and economics of these 2 auto insurance distribution channels are fundamentally different, which is why we've developed, deployed and optimized distinct personal auto products for each channel.\nThe result of these distinct products is not necessarily higher or lower rates in one channel versus the other as we target similar combined ratios. But instead, delivers products that better aligns our rates with the different indemnity and [ pancracteristics ] of each channel.\nThere are 3 primary distribution channels for U.S. auto insurance. captive agents, independent agents and direct-to-consumer. We write through both independent agents where we're the market share leader and through direct where we're the #2 writer enjoying over 25% and growing market share. The independent agency and direct channels make up the majority of the U.S. personal auto insurance market and continue to grow faster than the captive market. The current hard market has distorted some long-term channel trends as certain large competitors in these channels either shrink significantly or grow rapidly amid large underwriting losses.\nThese dynamics have presented an opportunity for us as prospects have been released to the market and rate increases from less well segmented carriers have driven competitors to be adversely selected. On the right side of the screen, you'll note just how critical our dual-channel strategy has been to achieving our continued market share growth. But today, we're going to spend time focusing on what drives our success in the direct channel. Insurance is a trust-based business. and we build that trust and take share from competitors within the direct channel through the strength of our brand, the power of our segmentation, the breadth of our media presence and the experiences we deliver to our customers. Our presentation will focus on 2 aspects of the direct channel. Media and customer experience.\nWe think about direct customer acquisition has a funnel with a virtuous cycle, similar to what we've previously shared from a product segmentation perspective. Media sits at the top of this funnel, where our online presence and award-winning advertising is deployed and optimized by our world-class in-house media team. Our advertising delivers billions of impressions every year, which in turn bring more than 100 million visitors to progressive.com annually. The experience on progressive.com turns those initial touches into tens of millions of quotes and ultimately, millions of sales annually. As we put more prospects through our funnel, we obtained the data to optimize the experience which in turn improves the media economics at the top of the funnel, which again, leads to further optimization. Our scale means this cycle is difficult for competitors to replicate which has helped to continue to feed our market share growth.\nToday, our direct media business leader, Jay VanAntwerp, a 20-year progressive employee will provide insights on how we optimize our media spend and why investors should feel confident that when we invest a dollar in media, it's a dollar well spent. After Jay, Dave Crew, our acquisition experience business leader will join us. Dave has led our acquisition experience team for 12 of his 34-year progressive tenure. He will walk us through how progressive.com has evolved from a basic Web 1.0 site back in the '90s to become the #1 ranked insurance website today.\nAnd, how his team enables us to continue to increase the complexity of our rating and our products while simultaneously improving yield through our acquisition funnel. Thanks again for joining us today, and I will now hand it over to Jay. Jay?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Pat. Today, I want to begin by talking about our Media Group and why we believe it is a competitive advantage for Progressive that would be incredibly challenging for our competitors to replicate in the near to medium terms. One of the distinct things about Progressive is that we buy almost all of our media using an in-house team. The media channels we buy include mass media like TV and radio, programmatic display, paid social media, direct mail and paid search. Virtually any type of advertising or demand generation that is purchased our media team buys.\nWe believe that this makes us unique, not just in the insurance industry, but in the advertising industry overall. This is not a new development. The decision to buy media in-house was made almost at the very beginning of our efforts in the direct channel in the mid-1990s. At that time, our demand generation efforts were focused on television and direct mail. But since then, our Media Group has evolved with the media landscape. As digital channels like programmatic display and paid social media have become more prominent. Our media team has given appropriate focus to those areas. And using Progressive's risk learn, grow philosophy, we develop viewpoints on how to buy those media types efficiently.\nSo our current capabilities are the result of an evolution of over 3 decades. Given how long we have been doing this and how ingrained the Media Group is within the company, it would be very challenging to assemble a team from scratch that would be able to efficiently deploy spend in all media channels and at our current scale.\nWhat are some of the advantages that having an in-house team gives us. Our focus relative to an external agency is very important. We focus on one brand and one small set of products. This allows for a level of specialization that an external agency would be challenged to match. We are able to leverage one of Progressive's core strengths, which is analytics. Progressive has a very strong history and track record of analytical innovation. We draw on those capabilities and building our analytical team. Another advantage our in-house team has over an external agency is product knowledge.\nOur analysts typically come from other areas of the company. They understand our product. They understand the dynamics of the auto insurance market. They're able to bring the insurance context to how they look at media in a way that no external agency would be able to replicate. If you combine the focus with the analytics, the result is custom models built specifically for Progressive using first-party data we would never make available to an external third party.\nAll of our models are proprietary. Using our data to evaluate only our brand and the products that we sell. As opposed to a one-size-fits-all model for multiple clients that you might get using an external agency. This has been incredibly impactful. We have leveraged our analytical horsepower and first-party data to dig into all of our spend and determine the relative efficiency and lifetime value of all of the different media channels.\nThis then gives us a guide for the optimal places to spend more when adding budget and where -- when reducing the budget so we can optimize for progressive specific needs. Progressive is a leader in segmentation for auto insurance pricing it is similarly powerful when we bring these skills to how we buy media. Another advantage is the ability to quickly flex the budget.\nOur budget is flexible within controls, which I will talk about later in the presentation. We are willing to increase the budget if there is efficient opportunity and available margin within our calendar year '96 combined ratio target to fund the additional spend. Also, if there is a need to reduce the [ expense ] ratio in order to hit our target '96, we can do that quickly as well. Our analytics show us how to optimize sales, both when adding and when cutting. Furthermore, we are able to flex our budget up and down extremely quickly. Another advantage is that we have aligned incentives. Like other progressive employees, our media teams on our gainshare annual bonus program. So they benefit from the success of Progressive in a way that a media agency that is compensated on commission wouldn't. A media agency is primarily incented to encourage clients to spend more on media in order to increase commissions.\nOur media team is focused on the core strategies of Progressive, primarily profitable growth. We also have lower overhead costs than an equivalent program that relies on external media agencies. So not only are we buying the media smarter, but we are also doing it at a [indiscernible] commission on $2 billion in spend, which is about what we spent at our peak in 2020 would be $100 million. Our team is less than 100 people with total annual cost for this team considerably lower than $100 million.\nFinally, and this really cannot be overstated. Our team has very strong relationships with in Progressive that no external agency would be able to develop. While we work closely with our marketing team in the way most agencies would. We also work directly with state product managers and general managers as well as many other areas of the business. We also have a very firm understanding of the business that allows us to credibly show how what we do in the Media Group benefits Progressive. As I talk more about some of the accomplishments of the last decade, I think it would be unlikely that an outside agency would have been able to make the case to be as aggressive as we were leading up to our peak spend in 2020 and could an outside agency move as quickly to make cuts as we did in 2023.\nTo summarize, we feel that our Media Group and the capabilities that we have built over 30 years have contributed greatly to Progressive success. I will talk specifically about the last decade and how we have been able to support Progressive's goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a '96. Before talking about progressive specific spend over the last decade, it is worth providing context about insurance industry ad spend over the last 30 years because it has shifted significantly over time.\nProgressive Direct and other directors became more aggressive in the mid-1990s, with the emergence of the direct-to-consumer business model for auto insurance. Spurred strong growth in insurance and advertising spend. From 1996 to 2003, and there was 10% compound annual growth in Media spend. This is a high rate of growth, and yet that rate of growth increased about 50% from 2003 to 2011, with the compound annual growth rate rising to 15%. Between 2011 and 2017, industry ad spend slowed to only 2%, largely driven by agency distributed companies whose economic models didn't allow them to keep pace with the direct-to-consumer companies who continue to have double-digit growth rates during this time period.\nStarting in 2017, growth in advertising ramped up again from 2017 to 2021, the industry compound annual growth increased 5x from the previous period to 10%. We will talk about some of the dynamics happening at that time that may have spurred the next round of growth. But there is a strong argument to be made that Progressive was the catalyst as we started spending more at this time and competitors followed suit. As we know, overall industry profitability issues in 2022 and 2023 led to a contraction in ad spend as the compound annual growth rate for those 2 years was negative 20%. That was the overall industry landscape.\nNow let's talk about Progressive specifically. Prior to 2017, Progressive's media spend was under $700 million. and we are consistently around 10% of total industry spend. In 2015 and 2016, we really hit our stride in using analytics to generate insights for how to buy media more efficiently. We were able to come up with a common metric between all media types that allowed us to better evaluate where our spend was efficient and where it wasn't. Also during this time, we were coming out of a hard market. Similar to today, we reacted in advance of the industry and aggressively raised rates, such that our loss ratios were trending below our '96 combined ratio target.\nAs such, we had available margin to fund a higher level of spend as a percentage of premium, while keeping our combined ratio below [ '96 ]. Starting in 2017 and continuing for the next 3 years, we were able to operationalize the advances in media efficiency, which allowed us to spend significantly more while still maintaining our target economics with the increased spend funded by available margin. We went from $650 million in spend in 2016 to almost $2 billion in 2020, a tripling in just 4 years. You will remember from earlier slides, that during that 4-year period, there was also an increase in industry spend, which I hypothesized was spurred by our increase in spend.\nWhen we started to spend more, competitors noticed and also began spending more. This resulted in that period of growth from 2017 to 2021 for the industry. While our competitors did spend more during that time, we increased our media spend much faster than the industry. Resulting in an increase in our percentage of total industry spend from 11% in 2016 to 20% in 2020.\nTo summarize, we tripled our spend in 4 years and almost doubled our share of the industry spend. When our losses are higher than target, we look to cut expenses with the goal of meeting our '96 combined ratio target until we have adequate rate. One of the largest and most flexible ways we can control our combined ratio is through the media budget. As severity trends rapidly steepened starting in 2021. We cut the Progressive media budget 3 years in a row from 2021 through 2023. Prior to this period, going back 30 years, we had never cut the budget 2 years in a row.\nSo this was an unprecedented time as was the increasing size of the cuts. We went from almost $2 billion of media spend in 2020 to about $1.3 billion in 2023. These cuts happened at a time when the overall industry was cutting as well. So even with the significant cuts, the statutory data shows that we were the biggest vendor in the industry in 2022 and 2023. And our share of the overall spend within the industry was almost flat. Going from 20% of industry spend in 2020 to 19% in 2023. All of these dynamics would have been impossible to manage without the capabilities of our in-house team. Our insights, analytics and relationships with the business allowed us to make the case for the increase in spend up to 2020 and then quickly cut significant amounts particularly in 2023 to support the overall company goal of hitting a [ '96 ]. I've talked about the efficiency of our spend, but have not necessarily defined what that means. We do have a number of controls on our spend. The primary one is that our cost per sale has to be at or below our target acquisition cost. If that is the case, then we would say that the spend is beneficial. Cost per sale is our total acquisition costs divided by direct sales. Tamini is the largest part of our total acquisition costs. Other costs include the expenses related to running our call centers, development of our creative maintaining and improving our online quote experience, the compensation of our marketing and media groups, among other things.\nTargeted acquisition cost is how much we charge customers for acquisition expenses over the life of their policy plus margin adequacy. It's the amount we price into the policy for acquisition. This amount is adjusted up or down based on where our margin is relative to targets. We need to make sure that the sales we are bringing in are at or below the acquisition expenses we price into our policies. That's the primary control in our spend, but there are others. Another constraint is that the direct auto lifetime combined ratio has to be at or below meaning we have to be confident that the new business that we are writing in a state is going to meet our profitability target over the life of the policy. As we talked about in our second quarter 2023 Investor Relations call, Direct channel policy acquisition costs are expensed in the first term of the policy and every subsequent term of the policy is collecting the premium necessary to cover the initial acquisition expense.\nIf the acquisition expense is too high, such that the premium collected over the average lifetime does not cover the initial acquisition expense, indemnity expense and other expenses, we shouldn't be spending money to acquire those policies. We need to be able to service our customers well. This is primarily for claims. There are times when the growth in the state is greater than our claims staffing can keep up with. So we will turn media off in order to slow demand and allow our staffing to catch up. Another constraint is our focus on achieving an aggregate company-wide calendar year combined ratio at or below a [ '96 ]. We will not spend additional media dollars if our calendar year [ '96 ] target is under threat. Even if there may be opportunities for efficient media spend.\nAnd the final control on our spend is an efficient incremental cost per sale. That is a relatively new constraint. Incremental cost per sale is our measure of whether our spend is bringing in a quote or a sale that is over and above the ambient shopping rate. We are able to measure that at a pretty granular level. and we are able to use that metric to evaluate efficiency within a channel as well as between channels. This chart shows the relativity of actual cost per sale versus the target acquisition cost.\nWe want this metric to be at or below 0. At 0, it would mean that our actual acquisition cost is equal to our target acquisition cost.\nYou can see that even during the run-up in spend from 2016 to 2020, that we kept cost per sale below the target in some years by as much as 15%. Even as we deployed 3x the level of spend, we brought in enough sales to hit our target economics and for that extra spend to be completely paid for with the premium that was generated. 2023 was certainly an outlier given the size of the cuts. When we cut spend, we cut the least efficient areas first. After the cuts in 2023, we were left with only the most efficient spend as well as a relatively high level of ambient shopping due to the hard market. So cost per sale was significantly below the target acquisition cost in 2023. Even with a significant rise in spend in 2024, the ratio has increased, but is still well below our targets. This means that so far in 2024, we are adding policies very efficiently.\nAnd this is true for 2 reasons. First, year-to-date, many of our competitors have remained at depressed levels of media spend. This means that we are able to get a large amount of media impressions for less. Additionally, when those media impressions turn into quotes, we're converting them at a good pace, suggesting cost competitiveness. Another view of efficiency is to look at the upfront acquisition expenses as a percentage of the lifetime earned premium that is expected from the sales. From 2016 to 2020, our acquisition expenses as a percentage of premium went up but stayed in the 7% to 7.5% range.\nAs with the cost per sale versus target acquisition cost, this metric did fall as we made cuts in 2023 and is up in 2024 as we've increased spend. Again, this suggests that in 2024, even as we have significantly increased our media spend, we're still bringing in prospects at very high efficiency. We have shown cost per sale versus target acquisition cost in order to illustrate that even with the run-up in spend, we hit our target economics. This chart illustrates the benefit that we got from increased spend a little more clearly. This chart shows an index of media spend anchored to 2015 as a 1.0 on the horizontal axis and an index of direct auto sales anchored to 2015 on the vertical axis.\nEach dot represents a different year. You can see that even with the increase in spend, we were able to increase sales commensurately. As with the other charts, 2023 is an outlier. In previous calls, we were often asked about ambient shopping and how we gauge it. The 2023 number is a clear indication of the elevated amount of ambient shopping last year. Despite spending below 2019 levels, we sold more direct new policies than in any year in our history. This is because rates were rising across the industry, prompting customers to shop at and eventually purchase from Progressive.\nWe have talked about how the budget cuts were a key tactic in helping progressive hit the [ 96% ] combined ratio in 2023. This chart shows acquisition expenses as a percentage of direct auto earned premium. You can see the increase in acquisition expense as a percentage of earned premium going from under 9% in 2016 to almost 13% in 2020. I had mentioned before that one of the keys to our ability to increase the spend the way that we did was available margin to be able to pay for the extra spend while still hitting profit targets. As we reduce spend starting in 2021, the acquisition expense ratio dropped from 13% to just over 6% in 2023. This cut reduced the company-wide combined ratio by about 2.8 points in 2023 and was a big factor in our ability to exceed our [ '96 ] calendar year target. Year-to-date 2024 we have increased spend, so now our acquisition expense ratio is back to about 10%.\nNote that the 2024 ratio on the chart is a year-to-date number. The first quarter acquisition expense ratio was below that of the second quarter as margins continue to be strong, we will look for opportunities to grow the business as much as possible. While we only get statutory spend data annually, we do have some ways to gauge progressive spend in relation to the rest of the industry during the year.\nThere are a number of third parties that provide a measure of what individual competitors are spending in select media channels. This chart shows an index created using iSpot data as a proxy for year-to-date TV spend and sensor towers Pathmatics data as a proxy for year-to-date programmatic display and paid social media spend. We have set the progressive spend at a 1.0 index and show the next 4 largest spenders in the insurance industry. You can see that based on this data, Progressive media spending is considerably higher than others. Though this is only a partial picture of all of the advertising done in the industry, it does provide a useful data point suggesting Progressive is outspending competitors by a significant margin.\nThat increased spend is paying off as we are delivering the necessary sales to pay for that spend. This chart of spend versus sales is the same as the one I just showed, but each dot represents only the first half of each year. You can see that 2024 is above the historic trend line with record spend and record sales. This chart suggests we are getting a strong return on our media spend to date.\nIn conclusion, Progressive's in-house media team is a unique competitive advantage that has driven significant value for Progressive since the inception of the direct business. In the last decade, the media team has been instrumental in increasing media spend efficiently, which has resulted in greater market share. This team also plays a huge role in managing to our [ 96% ] combined ratio through expense management and cutting spend to support the goal of a company-wide [ 96% ] combined ratio. Today, the team is laser focused on profitable growth and is deploying record spend amounts in the first half of 2024, and this has produced the largest first half direct sales volume in our history. While we focus on the relationship between sales and media spend as a measure of efficiency, it is important to point out that many other areas of the company work in conjunction with our media team to deliver sales.\nEverything from the award-winning creative produced by our marketing team to our industry-leading product and pricing make our jobs easier. Another key area is the team that received the online and we generate at the top of the funnel and converts it into quotes and sales. That team is the direct acquisition experience team, which has ownership of progressive.com and the online quote funnel. In the same way that the media team has evolved over decades, the acquisition experience team has been a competitive advantage for Progressive since we sold our first policy online over 25 years ago.\nMy colleague, Dave Crew, leads that group and is going to speak to their part in the funnel. Dave?\nThanks, Jay. Once Jay and his team get prospects to engage with Progressive, the direct acquisition experience team works to turn digital touches into productive experiences for the consumer and then profit for Progressive. My team is focused on progressive.com and our personal lines auto and recreation aligns direct sales funnels. There are parallel roles that focus on property and commercial lines applying similar concepts. Our goal is to deliver incremental lifetime underwriting profit each year by optimizing our digital experiences and periodically delivering breakthrough step functions in the evolving digital education, quote and purchase process. The term lifetime underwriting profit or LUP for short, refers to the sum of expected profit dollars generated from the incremental sales we produce.\nI'll touch more on why that's important later. To do what we do requires very close collaboration with adjacent organizations. IT, product, CRM and marketing in particular. It also requires a diverse set of subject matter experts on our central team. We work to connect the dots between deep insurance knowledge, the digital agency mindset, data analytics, data science and process management. Another way to say this is a real balance of right and left brain disciplines come together. And in my opinion, that's where the value has had. Like the media team, we've been at this for several decades. Let's start with the origin story. There have been a number of digital first in our history. We are online in 1995 and started quoting and selling online soon thereafter. We started planning for scale, had segmented operational data and tracked results all before the turn of the century And 15-plus years prior to the coining of the term insurtech.\nTaking the time line a bit further and deeper, as I said, we were online in 1995. We first showed comparison rates online in 1996, sold our first fully digital auto policy in 1997 and expanded our online footprint from auto to recreational lines in 1999. As we grew, we set out to innovate in the user experience space with several end market innovations, such as Name Your Price. We also invested in our mobile quoting capabilities. Starting in 2017, we began to leverage advanced technologies to personalized user experience and increased funnel throughput. We also continued investing in other value-adding educational content and a chatbot. Which leads us to today selling millions of policies untouched by human hands each year plus a substantial number of digital-assisted sales that quote online and purchase over the phone.\nWhile over half of those digital sales happen on mobile devices. Here's a look at today's digital funnel. There are over 100 million visits to progressive.com annually. [ Ease led ] to tens of millions of quote starts and ultimately, millions of digital sales. The screen shots on the right of the slide are representative way points as a prospect navigates from our homepage into an auto quote in this case, and ultimately a purchase. A 1% movement in throughput generally contributes sales lift that equates to tens of millions of profit dollars. To that end, we invest significant talent and resources in the user experience, technology and optimization. These incremental sales are high margin given the media team already got the prospects in the door.\nTo be clear, we often count sales for ease of communication, but the underlying analysis of [ lift ] generally contemplates contribution of lifetime underwriting profit or LUP as noted earlier, given all the policies are not the same and trade-offs can present themselves. Optimizing motorcycle versus auto lift in a multiproduct experience is one example of such a LUP based tradeoff.\nI'll now transition from our digital history and scale to some of the how of what we do. Our digital experience is in effect, the front end of our highly segmented product. Our product continues to evolve and move faster, which is a very good thing but using the metaphor on the slide requires our digital customer acquisition train to stay in sync with an accelerating product train. Our product requires a complex interview for an infrequent transaction with many options. We have decades of experience delivering an accurate online quote and optimizing the user experience simultaneously. Along the way, we've evolved a set of tactics and principles that help us make informed trade-offs.\nWe often run pilots ahead of product changes to assess the best way to gather a given rating input. And by best, we mean most accurate and easiest for the consumer. We've also evolved a living analytic framework to assess and target abandoned points as our user experience and product evolve together. As stated a bit earlier, there is much value to be had at the interface of deep insurance knowledge and deep user experience knowledge. To be clear, the fastest quote is not our goal. Optimal use of the consumer's time is. An instant or quick quote generally implies assumptions in downstream rework. Not to say we don't experiment, in fact, we have a motorcycle quick quote pilot in market in several states as we speak as well as embedded rates with automotive and financial partners. But the science needs to include rate accuracy in a total end-to-end look at the customer experience from quote to purchase to onboarding.\nRegarding that science, our scale affords lots of data to optimize new experiences via A/B testing. As part of that testing, we look for sales and LUP lift, as one might expect, and also come full circle to look at the impact of user experience on product mix. How you ask and display the question can matter.\nTo conclude this slide, keeping up with a fast-moving product, while simultaneously improving user experience and sales throughput necessitates that we have deep connections and frequent collaboration with our product and IT partners. Another way to state our objective function is to stay on and ultimately stretch the efficient frontier of customer ease and segmentation fidelity. As the final topic in our acquisition experience section, I'll touch on our approach to personalization and the digital funnel. We know that delivering the right content to the right consumer in the right context drive substantial value. As I pointed out before, we have been delivering personalized content to enhance customer experience and drive increased sales and associated up since 2017.\nWe've built a number of points of user experience personalization throughout our digital funnel. Personalization use cases have led to cumulative benefits in the hundreds of millions of dollars proven via A/B tests in the marketplace. Before breaking down our approach to real-time digital personalization on the next slide, I'll also mention another point of advanced technology deployment. Since 2018, our quoting and progressive.com chatbots have delivered millions of conversations and replaced millions of dollars of human support cost. While I won't get into detail on the specifics since this is a fast-moving space that provides real competitive advantage, I'll break down our approach.\nDelivering personalization at scale in a digital sales funnel in real time requires a set of balanced capabilities. We continue to evolve our capability set along 4 dimensions. Every year, we work to make sure we advance along each of 4 key elements, represented on what we call the personalization wheel. While not in a particular order, I'll start with context data. We continue to evolve the data we can access in a real-time digital funnel to drive decisions. We take great care around annuity and privacy as we use the data to drive better user experience. Working clockwise on the wheel, we come to content. Delivering the right content to the right consumer in the right context is at the heart of our digital personalization work. We constantly work to add new use cases to our road maps, think stars on the prior slide. a close connection with the marketing team is important here.\nNext is Decision Science. We continue to add new models and evolve existing ones. Context data is the input a content decision is the output. Last and absolutely not least, is the delivery system. We need an infrastructure that delivers the content decision and the content itself in milliseconds where the value of optimized content is lost. We also need a nimble environment for our data scientists and engineers to test and evolve new models. We have a strong partnership with our IT team to ensure we leverage and influence the latest enterprise-wide developments while meeting more current in-market objectives. We work to advance on all 4 of these dimensions each year as a means to drive a road map of short, medium and longer-term end-market tests and ultimately, sales and LUP lift. That was a very brief overview of our direct acquisition experience world. To summarize, we've been at digital sales funnel growth and optimization for a very long time. We have a lot of data that we learn from and advance in progressive fashion. A tight coupling with product is not only necessary, but we believe a source of significant advantage that InsurTech startups will likely never have. We continue to advance our personalization capability set in this space. And last but not least, we've been evolving at the junction of insurance and technology for decades to help fuel the direct customer acquisition virtuous cycle.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Jay VanAntwerp and Dave Krew, who are available to answer questions about the presentation.

To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will pick us of introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. In many ways, this first quarter has felt like we have turned a page. Since mid-2021, inflationary pressure and its subsequent effect on our profit margins has been a predominant factor in our strategic decision-making. Even in the second half of 2023, when we started to see indications that severity trends were stabilizing, more rate was earning in and accident year loss ratios approached our target. We continue to flex in order to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio goal.\nIn our August Investor Relations call, I was asked if we should put aside our 96 target and instead capitalize on the perceived growth opportunity at the time. In my answer, I cited our core values and the belief that our strategy to put profit before growth would prove to be a winning formula. As we look back to the second half of 2023 and the stellar results of the first quarter 2024, we feel stronger than ever that sticking to the core values that has served us well for so long was absolutely the right call. by adhering to who we are. It looks like we have turned that page and we're now seeing the benefits of the tough decisions and hard work over the last several years since inflation took off.\nFull frequency. Mix changes in our book from the nonrate actions we implemented over the last 2 years continued improvements in segmentation and less prior year loss reserve development, among other factors. In Personal Auto, our calendar year margins mean we've been able to shift more focus into growth with incredible results. In the first quarter, we added over 900,000 policies in force, one of the best quarters in our history and second only to the first quarter of 2023. We did this on the back of strong retention on our renewals and new application growth that is ramping up as we increase our media spend and pull back on some of our non-rate actions.\nDuring the first quarter, media spend was down 7% versus the first quarter 2023, and new auto applications were down 9% compared to a record growth in the first quarter last year. [ Fever ] year gap in both spend and sales declined as the quarter progressed. When comparing March 2024 to March 2023, ad spend was up and new auto applications were nearly flat. We continue to see opportunity for growth as the market is still very tight. We have non-rate actions we are unwinding and still have a few states where we are working to get rate revisions approved.\nAs we look forward to the rest of 2024, we will continue to seek to strike the right balance between efficient marketing spend, our calendar year profit targets and maximizing our growth. In Commercial Lines, the first quarter saw better results as compared to 2023. Our core commercial business continues to run well with almost 10 points of rates still to earn in from revisions in 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, 90% of our policies in commercial lines are on 12-month terms, so it takes much longer for rates to earn in as compared to personal auto. The trucking insurance market continues to be soft due to macroeconomic factors. And as a result, we are experiencing year-over-year decline in policies in force in our for-hire transportation and specialty business market targets.\nWhile our other 3 BMTs are growing year-over-year from both a unit and premium perspective, in property, we continue to execute on our strategy to reduce our exposure to catastrophe prone states, grow in states that have less volatile weather profiles and improve the underwriting and segmentation of our products. Policies in force and volatile. [indiscernible] heading, given what we know now, however, we're encouraged about the future. Inflationary trends are showing indications of stabilizing, and we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on a marketplace that is still reeling from the profit challenges of the last 2 years. It's comforting to be able to report that we're pivoting to a more normalized operation where, in most states, we can take small bites of the apple when it comes to rate and can focus on growth and increasing our market share. While challenges undoubtedly lay ahead, we're confident in where we stand today and look forward to maximizing our potential in the future.\nThank you again for joining us, and I'll now take your questions."

Constantine\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Fourth Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event. The company will not make detailed statements related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.\nThis quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team.

These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I am pleased to introduce our Customer Relationship President, Lori Niederst, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Lori?\n\nLori Niederst\n\nPresident of Customer Relationship Management\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. As Doug said, my name is Lori Niederst needers and I'm excited to be the first to participate in our new format. Traditionally, Tricia provides the opening comments for these presentations. But going forward, members of our leadership team will have the opportunity to speak to topics in our area of responsibility and introduce the talented individuals executing on these initiatives that we highlight during the event. In previous presentations, we've discussed our strategic pillars, which serve as the foundation of our vision.\nToday, we're focusing on one of those pillars, serving the broad needs of our customers. This pillar is synonymous with our strategy to become a destination company, providing products that meet our customers' changing needs throughout their lifetime. We seek to instill customer confidence in both the products and the prices that we offer. To set the stage for today's presentation, I thought it would be helpful to recap the history of Progressive's evolution as a destination company. Back in 2008, we publicly introduced our now ubiquitous customer segments, Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. In 2014, we first spoke of our destination strategy, stating our intention to invest in the products, services and experiences to better serve customers from all 4 segments.\nSince then, we've had relentless focus on not only maintaining and growing the Sams, Dianes and Wrights who have always been well served by Progressive but significantly increasing our market share with Robinsons, which we estimate represent just under half of the personal insurance direct written premium in the United States. We've been very successful growing Robinsons who in December of 2023, accounted for just under 13% of our direct written premium. Countless efforts have contributed to Robinsons being our fastest-growing segment, but it was two strategic decisions that really drove our success.\nEven before the introduction of the destination strategy, in 2006, we began offering homeowners insurance from other carriers in our Progressive Advantage Agency, or PAA. What began as a small endeavor has evolved into HomeQuoxplorer, or HQX, where we now offer customers competitive homeowner rates from a lineup of reputable carriers. This success in Direct and our desire to grow Robinsons in the independent agent channel, led Progressive to purchase a stake and eventually fully acquire American Strategic Insurance. ASI, now branded Progressive Home, has enabled us to offer both underwritten home and auto bundles as well as partner bundles to significantly increase our appeal to the rights in Robinsons. We've since leveraged our learnings and success in bundling personal insurance products in the commercial market, where we continue to be an industry leader.\nIn 2018, we first introduced BusinessQuoteExplorer, or BQX, which enabled direct customers to purchase a variety of commercial insurance products from other carriers, and bundle with our Commercial Auto and [ BOP ] coverages. More recently, we're exploring this winning strategy in Personal Auto with Auto Quote Explorer, or AQX, which enables customers to compare rates and purchase products from other personal auto carriers on progressive.com. This gives us another avenue to serve more customers and cross-sell from our expanding portfolio of products. Customer bundling doesn't end with Home and Personal Auto, our Commercial Auto and BOP. We have a whole suite of offerings, which includes progressive underwritten Special Lines, Renters and Umbrella products.\nBy expanding our portfolio of products, we have continued to increase our addressable market and capture new business. The result of these efforts has been pretty incredible. We now estimate that 19% of households in the United States have at least one progressive sold product, an increase of over 80% in the last 10 years. The benefits of these efforts on our business are far reaching. The top line growth from increased sales of progressive underwritten products and commissions earned from sales of partner products is just the beginning. The more products the customer purchases from Progressive, the stickier the customer becomes leading to higher lifetime profits and lower per policy acquisition costs. Fueling the virtuous cycle that results in greater market share.\nBut it's not just Progressive the benefits. We're making insurance easier for customers by providing options to meet their insurance and other financial needs now and in the future. Additionally, our industry-leading brand and acquisition engine provides growth opportunities for our partners. Making this destination strategy, a win, win, win. It's important to note that today, we're talking about the direct channel. Like many efforts Progressive has undertaken we often leverage the direct channel to test, learn and perfect new ideas. While doing so, we're always looking for ways to deploy our successes in direct to benefit our independent agents. For decades, the agency channel has been vital to Progressive's growth and independent agents will continue to be the face of Progressive for millions of customers.\nWhile we're focusing on Direct today, we fully recognize that Robinsons are the largest segment of consumers served by independent agents in the United States, and we have a number of significant investments underway to continue our leadership in this channel and our partnership with our 40,000-plus independent agents. For a deeper dive into our evolution as a destination company, I'd like to introduce [ Kathy Lamu ], a 42-year progressive veteran and our business leader for CRM Sales Experience. Kathy will share more detail on how we're leveraging our HQX, BQX and AQX platforms to provide choice and build customer confidence.\nOur second speaker is Sean Freeman. Sean is a business leader of our Comparison Rating Experience and Direct Property Quoting, who's been with Progressive for 14 years. He'll demonstrate the benefits of bundling and multi-product households and explain how these efforts will continue to drive Progressive's growth and profitability. Again, thank you for joining us today, and I'll now hand it over to Kathy.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nHello. I appreciate the opportunity to deliver some highlights on our progress toward achieving our destination company vision. Today, we'll focus on how the Progressive Advantage Agency is becoming a primary source for insurance products for consumers who prefer the direct channel. We strive to provide access to a broad portfolio of products, so customers begin and then keep their relationship with us without the need to look elsewhere. Let me begin by introducing the journey of Sam and Ashley, two actual Progressive customers. Back in 2009, when Sam first contacted Progressive, he was seeking insurance for his 1999 Saturn. Eventually, he bought a motorcycle, which needed insurance as well. Later, he married Ashley, and together, they acquired Renters Insurance until eventually, they bought a home, which required homeowners insurance.\nBoth our Renters and Homeowners insurance policies were purchased through the Progressive Advantage Agency. In the case of Sam and Ashley, we were able to offer them different products as life events triggered the need for additional and more complex insurance coverage. We would have loved to sell a progressive manufactured property product to the couple, but that wasn't the right solution for them. So we had other options ready. Let's talk more about that approach. Our multi-carrier marketplace for property and small business insurance products allows us to meet the needs of more and more customers. We are leveraging the Progressive brand building on our industry-leading digital tools and working with a growing number of reputable carriers to make buying and maintaining insurance easier. This recipe is proving very successful delivering 200% growth in premiums written through our agency in less than a decade.\nOver the years, we've evolved the comparison shopping experience from Property to Commercial Lines from one carrier to many from the phone to the online channel and from Quote to also buy without agent intervention. While the large majority of our insurance customers start their shopping experience online, using our Home Quote Explorer or Business Quote Explorer digital experiences, which launched after our shop by phone-only models, the majority work with our team of knowledgeable in-house agents to customize their policy before purchasing. As you've come to expect from Progressive, we continue to invest in improving the quote and buy experience, always focusing on the needs of our customers. We introduced a Digital Multi-carrier Quote experience, which we call Home Quote Explorer in 2017. Over the course of the next several years, we made enhancements and introduce new features to improve the quote experience and the platform's efficiency.\nThese efforts have generated close to a 10% increase in quote completions over early HQX results. One of our most recent changes was the introduction of a Quick Quote Experience, which displays prefilled data from third-party providers upfront so that customers can easily review and edit. Leveraging our proprietary models, we customize prompts and details to assist customers in selecting coverages and qualifying for discounts. This change alone decreased quote time by 20% and reducing the effort for customers and increasing their likelihood to purchase as a result. This is just one example of our work to simplify what has traditionally been a complicated shopping experience for both homeowners and small business owners. Our dedication to continuous improvement is bolstered by a rigorous A/B testing approach aimed at making a fully digital quote and purchase available to more shoppers.\nHowever, our in-house agents are always here to provide guidance and instill customer confidence. The investments in our HQX and BQX platforms only produce value when they're backed by a broad portfolio of products underwritten by reputable brands. Both the breadth of carriers in our network and the depth of their product suite have grown over the last decade. Presently, 13 carriers comprise our Home Quote Explorer portfolio and 9 for Business Quote Explorer. There are major benefits to having a large contingent of carriers in the PAA which Sean will get into later, but there is also a risk because we are exposing progressive customers and thus the Progressive brand to the services of another carrier. To protect our customers and the Progressive brand, we are selective about the carriers we partner with. They must meet our standards for customer care. They must offer a quality product at a fair price pass our information security assessments and they must have the financial strength and standing to uphold the promise we make to customers that will be there when they need us most.\nAdditionally, we'll consider a carrier's technological capabilities so that we can provide a seamless integrated digital customer experience for quoting and servicing. Also worthy of note is that our carrier networks include a number of companies that provide both property and small business insurance offers in HQX and BQX. We take pride in this fact as it demonstrates the strength of our mutually beneficial relationships. The benefits of our multi-carrier model extend far beyond quote and buy and are evident throughout the customer insurance journey for significant life changes, such as Sam and Ashley getting married and buying a house, perhaps experiencing a future job relocation or if they eventually need to ensure their teenage driver. Our agencies ready with the products they need and the customer service to help them navigate these events. Recall that Sam and Ashley added a home policy underwritten by one of our network carriers several years after acquiring their Progressive Auto Insurance and built a bundle, becoming one of the more than 1 million Robinsons we ensure through the PAA. The portfolio of products and carriers who underwrite them that are available to our customers allows us to grow more bundles over time.\nBut even when the event isn't life changing, for example, a policy renewal accompanied by a steep rate increase, we are presented with an opportunity to support our customers by offering options, which gives us the chance to retain the customer. Often, we are able to anticipate customer shopping by leveraging our proprietary data models and proactively reach out to offer assistance. Even subtle nudges such as the e-mail presented here, reinforce the value our in-house agency offers. That leaves our longest running product comparison experience, Auto Insurance. More than 30 years ago, we introduced auto comparison rating as a fee-based service in California. Insurance products were much simpler in those days, so at the time, rates were manually calculated by a team of Progressive people who reverse engineered them from public filings. This industry altering idea proved to be a winner with customers, prompting us to make the service available countrywide and to build our brand on comparison rates.\nOur early marketing messages combine the ease and savings from one-stop rate comparison with a message of transparency. If our rate isn't the lowest, we'll tell you who's is? And challenging the status quo not what you'd expect from an insurance company as early brand differentiators as progressive and competitors advance their products, adding credit, underwriting and tiering, our precision in providing comparison rates declined. Consumers saw decreasing value in the range of rates we provided to adjust to these conditions. The next evolution of comparison rates came in 2016 when we began purchasing discrete auto rates from a third party. This model has proven to be a lower-cost way to provide a service that is to this day, valuable to our customers. Over the past 5 years, we've conducted dozens of tests leveraging comparison rates to improve customer experiences, increase progressive conversion and monetize click referrals. Our decades of experience led us to take the next step in the auto rate comparison journey. Auto Quote Explorer. Bringing our CRE, HQX and consumer insights together, we've been piloting a multi-carrier auto quoting experience since the third quarter of 2022. We launched a Quote and Buy experience over the phone first and have refined the delivery with our in-house agents through several iterations.\nWe're ready to introduce the AQX Experience online soon. The screens that you see on this page were developed using focus group and agent feedback when testing with prototypes. Early results give us confidence that the comparison and purchase experience with a reputable set of carriers will give us the opportunity to better meet consumer needs, starting new customer relationships in those cases where insurance shoppers would not purchase a progressive policy, getting their auto insurance needs met elsewhere. Progressive continues to be known for providing comparison rates but our launch of AQX provides an opportunity to refine our brand positioning. The key is to generate interest by conveying that we've taken the hassle out of shopping for car insurance, while giving customers confidence in the products, prices and providers that we offer. But just like HQX and BQX, the customer value of AQX extends beyond the purchase and we continue to refine the benefit statements, taking advantage of our market research. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today. I'll now hand it over to Sean. Sean?\nThank you, Kathy. Following that overview of the operations of the Progressive Advantage Agency and the many unique shopping experiences we have deployed as part of it. I will now be walking you through the robust benefits of this Destination Era strategy. As Lori referenced earlier, any discussion about the benefits of the Progressive Advantage Agency should be viewed through the lens of a win-win-win strategy as we look to implement programs where all participants stand to benefit. As with everything we do at Progressive, our customers really come first. The PAA was created to ensure we had a full suite of insurance products within our direct channel that can meet consumer needs throughout their lifetime.\nBut beyond just offering a broad collection of types of insurance, we look to ensure that our customers are confident in their purchases through education and choice. Being able to provide quotes for other insurance companies in addition to our own underwritten policies ensures that customers feel empowered in their decision and are confident with their price and coverage. Additionally, our customers benefit from the ease of the shopping experiences, with our best-in-class quoting capabilities, saving them time and frustration. When thinking about the benefits enjoyed by our participating network of carriers the list really starts with the access they gain to millions of qualified customers that were generated through Progressive's marketing and media efforts. Given the strength of the Progressive brand and our advertising experience, this can frequently be greater consideration or at bats than many of these participating brands would experience on their own.\nProgressive also understands what is critical to writing profitable business. So we allow the carriers on our network to apply any of their proprietary acceptance and pricing rules in addition to our strong adherence to any provided procedures as of their appointed agencies. Furthermore, Progressive has been a leader in innovative customer experiences, both off-line and online for many years. Being a part of our carrier network allows for leveraging these experiences to efficiently and effectively quote and bind customers which presumably leads to positive brand association for our participating carriers. Finally, the creation of the Progressive Advantage Agency creates a multitude of benefits for Progressive and our shareholders. I will be highlighting many of these in more details in the upcoming slides. But in general, this Destination Era Strategy allows us to achieve greater top line growth, better efficiency in our media spend, extends household retention and serves as a stable source of revenues complementary to our underwriting profits.\nAs we have covered in past IR calls, Progressive has been focused for several years on expanding our addressable market and improving our penetration into multi-product households or Robinsons as well as increasing our product offerings outside of those traditionally underwritten by Progressive. In doing so, we have seen a steady trend up in our multi-product households on both an absolute and relative basis. Through our Progressive Advantage Agency, we are able to offer complementary products within a unified bundle experience. For example, in Personal Lines, we can offer renters and/or home insurance to go along with the customer's auto policy or in Commercial Lines where we are able to offer general liability or business owner policies to complement their commercial auto coverage. These are prime examples of how the internal agency is able to help us provide a full suite of insurance solutions to meet customer needs and in turn, help us grow.\nAnother important component to our overall growth strategy is understanding how consumers view comparison quoting experiences. We know through our research that there are many key drivers of consumer consideration and ultimately, how they decide what insurance carriers they're going to receive a quote or purchase a policy from. Several of these considerations align nicely with the solutions that we are delivering as part of the Progressive Advantage Agency. This includes consumer confidence that they're getting the right coverage or rates, making the entire insurance process easy to navigate, feeling in control of their insurance decisions, getting good value and demonstrating an understanding of what is important to the consumers. Each of these drivers is met in some way through our comparison quoting experiences and agency operation, and will serve as guiding principles as we expand and refine our consumer messages and experiences.\nAlong with the previous slide, these top of funnel benefits are foundational to the win-win-win dynamic that I started with. As these expand the total volume shopping with Progressive and thus leads to a greater pie to be shared by Progressive and our network of carriers. This offsets any minimal cannibalization risk that may be present through the providing of comparison quotes. With that said, we monitor very closely these trade-offs to ensure we achieve the most optimal outcomes. As highlighted in the last 2 slides, the Progressive Advantage Agency operation allows us to attract more customers at the top of the funnel and drive them to progressive.com or to our call centers. The next critical step is to get the most out of these interactions. Our multi-carrier model allows for a greater likelihood of returning competitive rates that meet consumers' needs. As the chart on the left indicates, by having more carrier appointments in a geography, we increase the likelihood that we can return at least 1 rate for our consumer. This is not surprising, but still critical in the face of greater underwriting restrictions for specific products such as homeowners.\nAs a result of our carrier coverage, we were able to successfully provide a home or condo rate to more than 80% of all shoppers seeking these coverages on progressive.com in 2023. Additionally, we know that offering multiple comparison rates increases the chance we return a competitive rate to the customer. The chart on the right indicates that our conversion relativity is directly correlated with the number of rates we return. While there is diminishing return with every addition, we have seen more than a doubling of our conversion rate due to our portfolio of carriers as compared to a single carrier platform. This means more people finding a policy that works for them and more households having a relationship with Progressive. Transitioning from getting more customers in the door, I would like to highlight the value of the internal agency and maintaining these relationships through increased retention.\nAs mentioned earlier, our goal is to meet customer needs throughout their lifetime. We hope that the policy we initially sell to a customer does just that. However, if this initial policy is no longer the best match, we have the ability to offer alternative carriers and coverage that may be a better fit. In doing so, we maintain a relationship with that customer and household longer. In the current environment, while rates are rising and underwriting is more restrictive, the ability to shop several carriers across the same product produces significant value to the customer and in turn Progressive. Within our homeowners portfolio, we see that we extend this household relationship 9 months longer on average as a result of this multi-carrier safe practice. The other form of retention benefits comes as a result of increasing the number of policies that exist within a household. Not only does selling an additional policy lead to increased sales and profit from those other policies, but the expected original policy also dramatically improves.\nAcross all products within our portfolio, the policy life expectancy grows meaningfully as you add products to the relationship and by a magnitude of up to 2x or more. It is important to note that we see this retention improvement, whether they are Progressive underwritten policies or network carrier policies, leading us to believe that meeting all insurance needs is the driver of customer loyalty even if we leverage other insurance carriers to do so. Many of these benefits come together in what we call a media virtuous cycle. With access to a Multicarrier model, we can offer consumers more choice that meets their needs. In doing so, this elevates our sales yield per visitor to progressive.com or into our call centers. Getting a more efficient return on every visitor to Progressive allows us to increase our media spend while still hitting our target economics. This increased spend drives greater awareness of Progressive offerings, driving traffic to progressive.com our call centers as well as our appointed independent agents.\nThis, in turn, increases the volume available to Progressive and the carriers within our network, incentivizing more carrier participation within our agency, strengthening the multi-carrier model further. This starts the cycle all over again. As we have especially seen in recent years, marketing spend is an important tool to stand out in the crowded insurance marketplace. This virtuous cycle is valuable to ensuring Progressive can rationally be in the top tier of marketing spenders and further widens the financial moat with lesser-known brands. The scaling of the Progressive Advantage Agency and its corresponding revenue expansion has several risk mitigating benefits. Commission revenue is a predictable annuity and has minimal exposure to the loss and cat risks that come along with underwriting insurance policies directly. This includes prominent risks such as weather and natural disasters.\nAs agency compensation is really directly impacted by these risk exposures, this serves as a complementary source of revenue to our standard underwriting operation. Additionally, as previously highlighted, meeting more customer needs strengthens our brand and improves our sales yield, mitigating some of the standard competitive risk that insurance companies face. The many benefits that I've highlighted, stemming from the PAA can be found throughout our income statement. Our top line net premiums earned includes the premiums from our Progressive's underwritten products and is impacted by the agency's brand and consideration lift, the household retention improvements, increased additional protection sales and the increased media spend associated with the PAA operation. Additionally, our success is penetrating the Robinson customer segment roll up within these figures. As we have expanded our PAA operation and product offerings, we have experienced net earned premium growth for Robinsons that has outpaced that of our other customer segments.\nThe service revenue line on the income statement includes the commissions earned from our carrier network. As the chart on the lower right demonstrates this is the most direct way to gauge the trajectory of our internal agency operation as it clearly shows our steady growth throughout the past decade. While it has not lost [indiscernible] this is an Investor Relations call, and thus, the financial results are the primary focus, the story of the Progressive Advantage Agency still really comes down to the customer journey and ensuring that we are offering products and services that meet our customers' needs. Kathy previously highlighted the journey of Sam and Ashley as they progress through their lives and the evolution of their insurance needs along the way. Without bringing together a network of insurance carriers who offer complementary products like BOP or Life Insurance, we may not have been in a position to satisfy all of these needs and possibly would have lost the household relationship entirely.\nHappily, this is not the case as we are pleased to be able to continue to build and grow our Progressive Advantage Agency with a full suite of insurance products and a network of participating carriers. And ultimately, we believe, make good on our win-win-win strategy of delivering value to our direct customers, our network of carriers and to Progressive and our shareholders through the operation of this best-in-class internal agency.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event.

Constantine\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Third Quarter Investor Event. I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. Introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded. On completion of the previously recorded remarks, we'll use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team.\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first, second, and third quarters of 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. At the end of the second quarter, we were in a difficult place. Rising lot cost, adverse development and catastrophic weather events meant we were facing a significant uphill battle to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio target, while facing a very uncertain future. We made difficult decisions to steer the business through this challenging time.\nDespite the headwinds, I believed in our strategy and the leaders who are in charge of delivering that strategy. While we knew it wouldn't be easy, we knew that if we execute properly, we come out better on the other side. While there is still much uncertainty in our future and more work to do, the results in the third quarter suggest our strategy is working.\nBefore discussing what did happen in the third quarter, let's first discuss what did not happen. First, unlike the first half of the year, the third quarter saw modest company-wide reserve development of only 0.2 points unfavorable across all lines. As we discussed in our presentation during our last call, our reserving group adjusted reserves in the first half to react to many things, including higher severity caused by steepening trends in our fixing vehicle coverages, and higher attorney representation rates in Florida precipitated by House bill 837.\nIn contrast to the first half, in the third quarter, we saw some flattening in the loss cost trends for fixing and replacing vehicles. We also now believe we have adequately reserved for the higher severity related to pre-House bill 837 lawsuits.\nSecond, in the third quarter, catastrophe losses were 1.3 points lower in total after reinsurance than the first half of the year. We do not write homeowners in Hawaii. So our exposure to the heart-wrenching Maui fires was limited.\nAfter reinsurance, our property catastrophe losses in the third quarter were 28 points lower than the first 6 months of the year. And while Hurricane Idalia was devastating to the people in this path of destruction, the density of homes and autos we insured in that path was relatively low.\nWhat did happen in the third quarter is that our rate and non-rate actions had a positive effect on premium and profitability. Including the 4 points of rate we took in the third quarter, we have now taken approximately 16 points in personal auto year-to-date with more of that rate earning in every day. Both commercial lines and homeowners also took rate as we look to address loss trends in those lines. We continue to adjust and refine the non-rate actions across the portfolio to help the business we are writing to meet our profitability targets.\nIn addition to improved underwriting results, our net income is also benefiting from the higher interest rate environment. For the first 9 months, our investment portfolio yield is 90 basis points higher, and recurring investment income is 59% higher than the same period last year. With sustained higher interest rates, we expect yields to continue to increase as securities with lower interest rates mature and those funds are reinvested at higher rates.\nMany of the actions we took and continue to take to address profitability have an adverse impact on unit growth. New apps in personal auto were down 20% in the third quarter compared to the prior year and contributed to a decrease in PIF compared to the end of the second quarter. This is a reflection of our self-imposed pullback in media spend as we seek to manage our combined ratio through the acquisition expense ratio and find the right balance in cohort pricing, which we talked about at length in our last quarterly call.\nWe continue to assess our marketing spend. And as always, we endeavor to find the right balance between profitability and new business growth. While new applications shrank year-over-year in Personal Auto, retention reflected through our PLE measure continues to be robust at 35% in personal auto on a trailing 3 basis. We believe robust retention, especially in the face of higher rates than a year ago is an indicator that many of our competitors are still tight on underwriting, and we remain competitive in the marketplace.\nDespite the headwinds created by our profitability actions, our year-over-year growth was very strong. Through September, company-wide PIFs were up 10% year-over-year. Positive year-over-year PIF growth plus higher rates means our premium growth was spectacular with net written premium up 20% year-to-date or $7.9 billion.\nTo put the first three quarters premium growth into perspective, we've added the premium equivalent to a top 8 personal auto insurance carrier, which is a truly amazing statistic. Despite the successes that occurred in quarter 3, we are not yet declaring victory. Our calendar year combined ratio currently stands 1.2 points above our 96% target. While loss trends have flattened, they are still elevated.\nMacroeconomic indicators suggest inflation is abating, but we are vigilant. Given the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, our view of the future could change overnight. We continue to refine our plans for the rest of 2023 and 2024 as new information comes in.\nWe have built a business where we can quickly take advantage of the opportunities the market offers us. So I'm confident that as things change will react with the goal of delivering the best-in-class results we expect of ourselves.\nFinally, as a reminder, and as we've previously announced, beginning this fourth quarter, we will move to reporting results on a Gregorian calendar basis versus our historical approach of a 544 convention. Consequently, for the next year, we will limit historical comparisons on a monthly basis and will continue such comparisons on a quarterly basis.\nThank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]"

Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. I usually begin these calls by extolling the commitment of Progressive's people and expressing my pride in the results they deliver, and this quarter will be no different. In the face of extraordinary pressure on the industry, our people continue to take the actions necessary to succeed in this difficult environment.\nWhile our results through the first half of 2023 fell well short of our 96 combined ratio target, I continue to believe in our people and our strategy [indiscernible] of us. We continue to manage to this calendar through your target, maintaining the discipline that has allowed us to grow in the past with better profitability than the industry. At the same time [indiscernible] first quarter call, talking about actions we would be taking to address our calendar year profitability pressure and those actions continue.\nIn quarter 2, we took 7 points in personal auto, which puts our year-to-date rate take at just over 11%. And assuming regulatory approval, we plan to take approximately 6 additional points during the remainder of the year as we adjust rates to match loss trend. During last quarter's call, we also said that we would reduce our media spend, resulting in our quarter 2 direct expense ratio being amongst the lowest in recent history.\nThese actions have had the expected effect on growth with new app growth slower in the second quarter as compared to the first. And PIF growth, while still robust, slowing from highs we saw in prior months. Calendar year profitability continues to be a challenge, so with the calendar year 96 goal in mind, we will continue to evaluate the rate and non-rate actions we may need to take.\nCatastrophe losses were a significant part of our profitability pressures. To date, 2023 has been a significant catastrophic year with some estimates suggesting that U.S. insurer losses have already surpassed $25 billion this year. The events this year had been broadly felt with 44 states affected by 43 events.\nAt the company level, these events have added 4.5 points to our combined ratio year-to-date, which is 1.7 points higher than the impact catastrophe events had on our combined ratio for the first half of 2022. Our property business has been most affected by catastrophes, adding almost 46 points to the property loss ratio so far this year, which is about 16 points more when compared to this time in 2022.\nHistorically, we have been among the best in the industry in reserve accuracy with reserve changes contributing little to our calendar year combined ratio. We've advanced the science of reserving an employee team of highly experienced individuals to support our goal of being as accurate as possible with our reserves.\nAccurate reserves help us to price more accurately and give us confidence to grow as fast as we have over the last decade. Having said that, the difficult environment of 2023 has presented challenges for our reserving practices. Through the end of the second quarter, prior year adverse development has contributed 4 points to our combined ratio and current accident year actuarial adjustments have contributed another 1.5 points.\nThe majority of Personal Lines adverse development can be placed into 2 categories: Florida and fixing vehicle coverages. Florida's prior year adverse development accounts for over 40% of the 4 points of prior year development. While we continue to be optimistic that March's new legislation will result in lower loss costs over time, the short-term effect has been a significant increase in attorney representation, largely in medical coverages.\nOur data has matured each month since the bill passed, which has allowed us to continue to fine-tune reserving in the face of changes to Florida's ultimate loss costs. In fixing vehicle coverages, unforeseen severity trends deepening on previously closed claims continues to be the major driver of prior year adverse development country-wide.\nThe contributors to the steeper trends come from a variety of sources, including longer vehicle repair times, longer rental times, higher parts prices and labor rates and changes in subrogation trends. Fixing vehicle coverages are short tailed, which explains why over 80% of the total year-to-date prior year development is from the 2022 accident year.\nIn fact, excluding Florida, accident years prior to 2022 have developed favorably. Our current year actuarial adjustments are primarily due to fixing vehicle coverages. Since fixing vehicle coverages are short tailed, most of the claims that are affected by emerging trends have happened in the recent past. As we have moved deeper into the year, the new steeper trends in fixing vehicle coverages have increasingly affected claims that occurred in the current accident year.\nFlorida litigation has been a relatively small part of current year actuarial adjustments since the increase in attorney representation rates largely affected claims that occurred before [indiscernible] this year. I have great confidence in the teams and our strategies, which have delivered results better than the industry for a very, very long time.\nTo showcase these skill sets, this morning, we have 2 senior leaders to speak to these 2 topics for our presentation. First, Gary Traicoff, our corporate actuary business leader and Head of our Reserving Group, will discuss reserving practices at Progressive and how we endeavor to accurately set and adjust reserves. Gary is a 28-year Progressive veteran and has led our reserving group for almost 11 of those years.\nAfter Gary, Jim Curtiss, our Personal Lines Controller, will discuss cohort pricing. Cohort pricing is our term for managing to both our calendar year and lifetime 96 target, when new business and renewal business have different expense and loss characteristics. Jim has been with Progressive for 28 years and in his current role [indiscernible]\n\nGary S.

And finally, walk through an example of the reserving life cycle. [indiscernible] The columns represent our carried reserve balance at the end of each calendar year from 2013 through 2022. And at June 30, 2023 for the rightmost column, on the left side of the graph [indiscernible].\nThis would be the sum of the orange and blue sections within the bar. With our growth as a company, reserves before reinsurance, as of June 30, 2023, is now almost $33 billion and almost 4x greater than what it was in 2013, while our premium growth was a little less than 3x greater over the same time period. Much of this difference in reserves outpacing premium growth relates to our growth in longer tailed products and commercial lines over this period.\nThis means that we believe for all accidents that have occurred through June 30 of 2023, our ultimate future liabilities will be almost $33 billion. The orange section of the bars represent how much of our reserves are ceded for reinsurance. Some examples of this include state-regulated plans such as Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association and the Florida Hurricane Cat Fund and private reinsurers.\nOur ceded reserves now make up about 16% of our gross reserves versus just over 12% in 2013. Much of this increase in the higher proportion of ceded reserves relates to newer products that have been added over time, including property and protective, which have more reinsurance needs than our historical products.\nThe blue section of the columns represent how much of our reserves are retained after reinsurance, almost $28 billion as of June 30, 2023. Next, let's look at some metrics on how our reserves are distributed. The chart on the left shows that 67% of our net reserves are in loss case lost IBNR and the remainder under LAE.\nAny open claim will be assigned a case reserve that may be set by a claims adjuster or an actually derived estimate set by the actuarial team. We will discuss this in more detail in a future slide. [indiscernible] those products, one can think of IBNR as the future liabilities to cover claims that have already happened and are currently not recorded as open case reserves.\nThis would include late reports, reopens and salvage and subrogation recoveries. Anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries can be thought of as a contra reserve and is a reduction to future liabilities. For most of our products, [indiscernible] for the majority of our products, our IBNR reserve does not cover expected case development. LAE reserves make up the remaining 16% and typically cover the anticipated expenses needed to settle claims that have happened, such as defense console costs and claims adjust [indiscernible] salaries.\nThe middle chart shows the distribution of our reserves by product. As expected, reserves will index more to longer-tailed products with higher limits relative to premium size. Thus, our Commercial Lines business makes up almost 1/3 of our total reserves, but a smaller proportion of premium.\nThe graph on the right shows that in Personal Auto, 83% of our reserves are set to cover injury and medical costs and 17% to cover the cost of fixed vehicles. Again, this is due to the longer-tail nature and higher severity costs to injury and medical coverages versus fixing vehicle coverages.\nAnd reserves are over-indexed to injury and medical relative to premium. In addition, fixing vehicle coverages have a higher proportion of contra reserves from salvage and subrogation compared to injury and medical. One additional point. This data is as of year-end 2022 and is on a net of reinsurance basis. While the previous slide gave a high level overview of the distribution of our reserve mix by various parts, we review the reserves at a much more granular level.\nWe typically review reserves by some combination of [indiscernible] which is bodily injury, uninsured motor spottily injury and property damage and even by limit. To determine these breakouts, we weigh the credibility of the data, homogeneity in the data and additional value of segmenting the data at a finer level.\nFor example, in Personal Auto, bodily injury, almost all states are reviewed separately with the majority of states reviewed quarterly. State-level data is credible and many states have different development patterns, which warrant the data to be reviewed separately. In Personal Auto collision, while state-level data is credible, many states exhibit similar data patterns and several clusters of states are reviewed together.\nAbout 25% to 30% of our reserves are reviewed at this in-depth level monthly and about 85% of our reserves quarterly. About 700 reviews, which is some combination of product, state, line, et cetera, are reviewed over the course of the year. By reviewing reserves detailed level, we are able to adjust reserves more accurately at a granular level, which helps our pricing teams better match price to risk.\nWe also have a robust roll-forward process that we will discuss later on, which allows up to 100% of the reserves to be adjusted monthly. The roll-forward process allows us the time to do a deep analysis on a portion of the reserves monthly while still feeling comfortable that all of our reserves are being updated monthly.\nHere is an example of how an in-depth review schedule will look over 3 months. In the first month of the quarter, 57 reserve reviews were completed. Each reserve review is either a loss or LAE review, which is further broken down between defense cost containment or DCC and adjusting and other expenses or A&O.\nSome combination of products such as personal auto, CL or one of our core commercial auto products or TNC, which represents transportation network companies, line coverages such as bodily injury and some combination of state is reviewed. These 57 reviews would make up about 25% to 30% of our total reserves. In the following month, 60 reviews were completed. Again, there is some combination of type product coverage and state, but all 60 reviews are independent of reviews completed during the first month and represent another 25% to 30% of our total reserves.\nFinally, the third month of the quarter had 68 reviews completed, which are all different from any reviews completed during the previous 2 months and represent an additional 25% to 30% of the total reserves. Over the course of the quarter, about 85% of the reserves were reviewed. Typically, between 50 to 70 reviews are completed per month.\nNow let's talk about how the overall reserve level is determined. We use several different methods [indiscernible] occurred and each column represents how much in paid losses had been paid out for those accidents at certain time periods after the accident. For example, the top row represents all accidents that occurred from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.\nThe $100 in Column 1 means that the $100 was paid out as of December 31, 2021 for those accidents. Moving to the right of the same row Column 2 of $120 means that for accidents that occurred during the last 6 months of 2021. As of June 2022, cumulatively that $120 had been paid out. Thus, an additional $20 was paid out during the first half of 2022.\nThe increase of $20 could be due to payments on known claims, late reports or reopen activity. The increase of 20% from $100 to $120 is shown in the loss development factors section in the December 2021 row and Column 1. Similarly, the loss development factor of 1.08 in Column 2 of the December 2021 row is calculated by taking the paid loss of $130 in Column 3 divided by the paid loss of $120 in Column 2 for the December 2021 row.\nNext, the actuarial analyst selected a 1.27 in the first column as the predicted Column 1 loss development factor for the accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June of 2023. We can see that in the June 2023 row, $120 had been paid out by the end of June 2023. The analyst is predicting that paid losses will increase by 27% or $33 during the second half of 2023 and cumulatively be at $153 by December 2023.\nMultiplying the $153 by an additional 8% predicts that an additional $12 will get paid out by the third column for a cumulative of $165. Thus, the shaded numbers in blue are predictions of what will be paid out in the future. The indicated reserve is then calculated by taking the ultimate estimated paid losses minus what has already been paid as of June 2023 since reserves are to cover future liabilities.\nThe indicated reserve is $45 for accidents happening in the 6-month period ending June 2023 and $13 for accidents happening during the second half of 2022. In total, the indicated reserve is the sum of all accident periods or row and adds up to $58. This example illustrates an accident period chain ladder approach using paid data.\nTriangle similar to this byproduct and grouped by line coverage can be found in our annual report. Other approaches that we typically employ include using case-incurred data, developing severity and frequency separately and stratifying the data by size of loss layer. In addition, data is also segmented by late report and reopen lag time from the date of loss to the date of late report and reopen, and hindsight testing to prior reserve amounts are considered as well.\nAdditional ad hoc analysis is typically completed to understand changes in the underlying data and loss development factors. Based off the indications from the multiple reviews completed during the month, the actuarial team will then decide how much of an overall reserve change is needed and adjust reserve factors accordingly.\nThose changes will show up in the earnings release under the actuarial adjustment section and be reported showing the breakout for the current accident year and all prior accident years. For example, in June of 2023, based off the scheduled reserve reviews, which represented between 25% to 30% of reserves, the actuarial team increased reserves $130.9 million for accident years 2022 and prior.\nAnd increased reserves $160.3 million for the 2023 accident year for a total change of [indiscernible]. In addition, due to other changes not related to actuarial reviews, prior accident years developed an additional $6.9 million unfavorably for [indiscernible]. Now let's go through an example of the pathway of a case reserve over time and the impact on our monthly earnings release.\nRemember, case reserves make up about 67% of our total reserves. In this example, a claim happens on December 15 and is reported and opened in our claims system on December 19. Since the claim was reported in the same month as the occurrence of the accident, this would not be considered in IBNR. [indiscernible] determined for this claim from an algorithm used by the actuarial team.\nThe actuarial team uses predictive modeling techniques based off of certain characteristics of the claim and policy to predict what the expected cost would be for all claims that meet the criteria. In Personal Auto, there are over 200,000 unique combinations of tabular case reserves It is important to note that the actuary [indiscernible] case reserve.\nThis is similar to a pricing rate order calculation formula. In this example, the tabular case reserve is $12,125. [indiscernible] The tabular case reserve is booked to the general leisure as the financial case reserve for that claim and is reflected on the balance sheet. If the adjuster case reserve is greater than or equal to the threshold, the adjuster case reserve becomes the financial case reserve booked to the general ledger.\nThe logic here is that the predictive modeling approach is fairly accurate for lower dollar claims. For more severe claims, the adjuster has received more specific information pertinent to the claim and will predict better than the model for higher dollar claims. This combination of adjuster and tabular reserves provides more consistency and accuracy on a monthly basis.\nThe threshold varies by several variables, including product, line coverage and limit, just to name a few. Since the adjuster case reserve is $5,000 and below the threshold, the tabular case reserve of $12,125 is used in the general ledger. In addition, $1,000 of [indiscernible], set as a factor related to earned premium to cover [indiscernible] equaling a total of $13,125, denoted as the dark blue dot and will be the reserve booked at the end of December.\nIn January, the adjuster has kept their initial estimate of $5,000. Since this is below the $25,000 [indiscernible] inflation factor. As the claim is 1 month older, the actuarial algorithm predicted that all claims remaining open would have a higher ultimate cost. In addition, all tabular cases that are not part of an in-depth actuarial review during the month gets inflated as well.\nThe new tabular case reserve is $12,376, which is an increase of $251. A portion of this $251 increase is aging and a portion is inflation. This will show up in the earnings release as unfavorable prior accident year all other reserve development in January. It is important to note that other claims that settled in January may have settled for more or less than the December tabular case reserve, which would also show up in the all other development category of the earnings release. [indiscernible] to set the case reserve liability.\nIn February, this claim was part of the 25% to 30% of reserves reviewed at an in-depth level by the actuarial team. The actuarial team increased the tabular case reserve for all claims that have a similar criteria as this claim to $13,500, which is an increase of [indiscernible].\nIn March, the adjuster increased their estimate again. This time to $20,000. Since $20,000 is still below the threshold of $25,000, the tabular case reserve is still used as the case reserve book to the general ledger. The claim becomes plaintiff attorney repped in March. Thus, while the tabular case reserve will be inflated and aged again, it will also change due to becoming plaintiff attorney rep as this is one of the variables used in the actuarial algorithm.\nThe tabular case reserve is now $20,050, which is $6,550 greater than the prior month. A portion of this $6,550 increase is due to inflation, a portion due to aging and a portion due to the claim becoming plaintiff attorney repped. The $6,550 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly earnings release.\nIn April, the adjuster has increased the reserve again to $25,000. Since the adjuster case reserve is now at least equal to the reserve threshold, the adjustor's estimate is booked to the general ledger as the case reserve for this claim. This is an increase of $4,950 in the case reserve on the balance sheet moving from the tabular reserve at the end of March to the adjusted reserve at the end of April.\nThe $4,950 will show up as unfavorable prior accident year all other development in the monthly release. The adjuster made no change to their estimate in May. Case reserves are set equal to or over the [indiscernible] algorithm. In June, the claim closed out and settled for $20,000. This will show as $5,000 favorable in the prior accident year all other development section of the monthly earnings release.\nFinally, in July, the claim was reopened an additional payment occurred for $1,500. A claim could be reopened for several reasons. For example, a claimant may have initially been undecided about a vehicle repair and received a cash settlement based upon the initial estimate. Several months later, they may have ultimately decided to repair the vehicle and additional damage may have been found.\nAnother example is when a claimant may initially feel that they are not injured in an accident, the claim is closed and subsequently reopened when the person realizes that they were injured in the accident. While the case reserve had closed out in June, we were still carrying $1,000 of IBNR reserves for the potential of a December claim being late reported or reopening.\nFor this example, the IBNR reserve was released in July, which means that there is an expectation that there will be no future costs from late reports or reopens from any accident that occurred in 2022 and is currently not an open case reserve as of the end of July. The development is unfavorable $500. This would show up in the prior accident year all other category of the earnings release.\nIn practice, the IBNR reserve for prior accident years tends to get released monthly as part of another actuarial algorithm as the probability of late reports and reopens decreases with time. An in-depth review of IBNR reserves are completed in tandem with case reserves. Remember, any changes made to factors by the actuarial team as a result of those reviews, will show up under the prior accident year actuarial category.\nFor the year, the starting reserve was $13,125 and the claim was eventually paid for $21,500. The year-to-date development is unfavorable by this difference, which is $8,375. I, as the Chief Actuary, have complete decision-making authority on our reserves. And while the actuarial team has complete independence in determining the reserves to be booked, there are many checks and balances in place.\nInternally, we have a close partnership with our claims, pricing and product management business partners. Meetings are held throughout the month at both a localized and national level discussing trends, changes in the mix of business, claims process changes, rate activity and methodologies.\nQuarterly, I meet with the Audit Committee members of the Board of Directors to discuss results and trends for the quarter. Furthermore, our external auditors perform an annual audit of the company as required by the SEC. My actuarial team meets with the audit firm to discuss our actuarial process, current trends and results for the respective quarters and year.\nI hope that you have found this presentation helpful. For more information on Progressive's loss reserving practices, we posted a report under the investor site of progressive.com. This report is updated every 2 years. Thank you for your time today. And I will now turn it over to Jim to discuss cohort pricing.\n\nJohn Curtiss\n\nPersonal Auto Product Development Leader, The Progressive Corporation\n\nThanks, Gary. Now let's transition from estimating ultimate losses in LAE to another key element of our pricing, which is our expected lifetime value. We price each policy written to a lifetime target consistent with our enterprise goal of a 96 combined ratio. We refer to this as cohort pricing, where a cohort is defined by policies written at new business and followed through their expected lifetime value, including all renewal terms.\nLifetime performance is measured as the sum of all expenses realized and the premium earned across all new and renewal terms for a policy. When I say all expenses, by that, I mean loss LAE, acquisition expenses and operational expenses. As you can see by the stylized chart, loss and expense costs vary between new and renewal policy terms.\nWith this in mind, we price across the policy life to achieve a lifetime 96 combined ratio. Said another way, the sum of lifetime loss and expenses divided by lifetime earned premium nets us at 96 combined. This pricing approach positions us to offer a competitive rate of new business and stable rates across renewals.\nNow that we have a conceptual view of cohort pricing, let's dig into the mechanics. The following is a tabular representation of the lifetime view we covered in the last graph. We think about pricing in 3 separate categories: loss in LAE, acquisition expense and operational expense. Loss and LAE represent our indemnity experience.\nWe break out our expense ratio into acquisition and operational expenses. And in all cases, renewal business operates at a total lower cost structure than the first term or our new business. While we price to the lifetime profitability of our policies at a 96 or better, we also manage this approach with consideration to our calendar year goal of meeting a 96 or better combined ratio [indiscernible].\nLoss ratio improves from new business to renewal and is primarily a function of mix of business and policy life expectancy. And we price to that expected lifetime loss ratio performance based on the characteristics at new business, which ensures the business written is priced to a lifetime target. Starting in the upper left in this illustrative example, you can see that our first term business runs at a loss and LAE ratio of 85, with our renewal book of business at a 77.\nWith an expected policy life of 6 policy terms, the lifetime loss and LAE ratio is at 78. When combined with our other expense categories, the lifetime CR is a 96, thereby combining new and renewal performance and achieving our lifetime target. However, within the new to renewal loss ratio performance, there are segmentation opportunities as not all policy characteristics at new business have the same expected lifetime loss ratio performance.\nBuilding on this with an illustrative example, consider car color starting in the upper right. When looking at the expected renewal improvement from new business in loss ratio on red cars, we see a larger change than we expect to see in green cars. The implication for pricing are twofold: first, we observed that red cars last on average 5 policy terms and green cars last on average 7 policy terms; the second consideration is that the loss behavior also varies.\nWe price to this differential in expected policy life expectancy and the different improvement in indemnity performance between the 2 segments in this illustrative case car color. Applying this to a real-life opportunity, we frequently discuss key consumer segments as Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons and our continued opportunity for growth in the Robinsons segment.\nAs a refresher, Robinsons are consumers who bundle their home and auto needs and typically have a longer policy life expectancy. We can recognize this policy extension and build it into our pricing, which ultimately leads to lower rates with more lifetime renewal premium at a lower cost structure.\nFinally, while I focused on the indemnity piece of cohort pricing, you'll also note that the policy life expectancy can affect the other expense categories. We'll move into the distribution channel and acquisition costs next. Before we dig deeper into acquisition expenses, we need to first review the fundamental differences between the [indiscernible].\nStarting on the left, direct has an up front acquisition expense by virtue of our marketing spend. We spend consumer marketing dollars, media and nonmedia alike and account for the entire acquisition expense in the new business term. We can see that in the illustrative example with a 60% [indiscernible] in an agency channel, policies are acquired at the cost of commission paid to the agent.\nThe commission expense is paid to the agent and ultimately [indiscernible] premium earned. In both cases, in this stylized example, lifetime acquisition expense is 10% and we achieved a 96 combined ratio, but we have a much larger first term expense in direct [indiscernible]. Consider 2 policies with different PLEs. In policy number 1, we see a total of 6 policy terms with a target acquisition expense of 60% on that first term.\nWith an average policy premium of about $750 we can assumer [indiscernible] First term assumptions produces the same $450 permissible or 60% of $750. However, with the addition of 2 policy terms, the acquisition expense of $450 [indiscernible] to drive additional demand or we can lower our rate level to increase our new business conversion.\nIn both cases, we will still achieve a lifetime 96. A real-life example would [indiscernible] life expectancy compared to those who don't bundle their home and auto with Progressive.\nMoving on to the agency channel. This distribution business model takes a different form, as I mentioned [indiscernible] we pay commission to agents. In the example above, the policy achieves a lifetime 96, but you can see that the [indiscernible]. In practice, it is possible to [indiscernible] emission costs in dollars will vary based on policy premium.\nBut as a percentage of premium, we'll always match. This is a [indiscernible] fortunately, more in indemnity and operational expense relative to our direct business model. Finally, we finished with operational expenses, and we see a modest new renewal differential. The operational cost for servicing new business policies is greater than [indiscernible]\nCalendar year earnings have an implicit new and renewal mix driving results. And we manage that mix to ensure target combined ratios are achieved for the calendar year in question. While managing our new renewal mix, we consider both the mix of our cohorts and the rate revisions earning in.\nRemember that rate from revisions take time to earn in as policies have to renew into the new rate level. Typically, this happens in our new business faster than renewal as our rates hit the marketplace before our renewal book. This will affect the combined ratio performance of our new business and renewal cohorts.\nSetting rate changes aside, periods of accelerated new business application growth can apply upward pressure on our combined ratio. As we now know, new business has a higher expected combined ratio and in the case of direct has additional pressure based on our accounting of consumer marketing mix.\nUsing this stylized example, you can see that in a period of high growth, new business makes up a larger portion of our total earned premium. And while we may be within our lifetime targets [indiscernible] in our 96 goal. And in both cases, we are within in our cohort targets. This is a great example of how we develop our media budget.\nWe consider both our lifetime economics and our margin position, considering each simultaneously with calendar year performance taking priority. And we then adjust our budget accordingly. Upward pressure from new business can be dampened by the lengthening of policy life expectancy as our renewal book [indiscernible] expected cohort performance, we price across the lifetime of a policy and balance our near-term and long-term growth with our 96 calendar year goal. Thank you for your time."

Constantine\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's first quarter investor event. I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be a moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company website. Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team.\nThe introductory comments by our CEO or previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team.\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event.\nAdditional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by our 10-Q report for the first quarter 2023, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. One of the enduring lessons since the onset of the pandemic is the uncertainty of the future. Since March 2020, the world and our business have been pummeled by unforeseen events in that vein is perhaps poetic that 3 years post pandemic, we continue to have to manage through the unexpected in our business. In the end, I'm confident that our resilience will see us through.\nThrough the first quarter, we're not on track to achieve our calendar year goal of a 96 combined ratio. Given our extensive history of meeting our stated goals, this has prompted many questions about how we got here and where we're going. As such, in lieu of a more traditional opening statement, I'll instead provide answers to some questions that have been asked by the investment analysts. I hope is that you will gain a clear understanding of how we are addressing the challenges as well as the urgency with which we are acting.\nThe first question is, how are you reacting to being above your target of a 96 calendar year combined ratio. The answer to that is we will react to the same way we always have with speed and decisiveness. The 3 largest levers we have to manage our margin are to decrease our expense ratio, tighten our verification and underwriting scrutiny of new business and increased rates. I'll address these in that order.\nOur largest controllable variable expense is advertising spend, and we are taking action to reduce these costs, which we expect could both slow growth and help to reduce our expense ratio. Once we are confident that we can deliver our target calendar year profitability, we will consider resuming our spend. While we won't provide details on which segments of media we are reducing or how this may affect growth going forward.\nI will tell you that we've invested in bringing the same industry-leading science from the pricing side of our business to the acquisition side, and we'll continue to spend in the places that we believe have the greatest benefit to the business. using non-rate actions such as tighter verification and underwriting standards and limiting bill plan options will reduce our growth in the segments we believe we can't currently write at our target margins.\nFinally, our largest and slowest moving lever is rates. In quarter 1, we took 4 points of rate in personal auto on an aggregate country-wide basis, and we are still earning in some of the prior year rate increases. We plan to take aggressive rate increases where needed across all lines through the balance of 2023 to ensure we're pricing to deliver our target profit margin.\nThe next question, given the actions we will take to meet our profit target is what will this do to growth? First and foremost, keep in mind that growth in the first quarter of 2023 was an all-time high for the company, and we are very proud of that. Secondly, we are still in a very hard market with lots of consumers quoting their interments. We also continue to see ambient shopping. While policy growth may be slowed by our actions, we still anticipate there will continue to be robust demand for our products.\nOf course, the actions of our competitors also play a role in what growth will be. So I won't speculate on specific growth predictions. However, you can rest assured that we are focused on growing policies that we believe will meet or exceed our target margins.\nLastly, we've received many questions like this one. Do you now believe your reserving is adequate or said another way, you said that you were confident that the biggest rate increases were behind you, what changed? The answer is fairly basic. We started seeing data come in over the last few months that was not in line with what we were anticipating, which caused us to increase reserves and react with rate increases.\nIn personal lines, our reserve strengthening happened largely in the short-tailed fixing vehicle coverages. In these coverages, we can recognize and react to new trends relatively quickly, and we feel good about our reserve levels today. That being said, reserves are estimates and change over time based on evolving trends.\nAs for the effects of Florida House Bill 837. In March, we estimated the reserve changes we believe we needed to capture the effect of the legislation, including the flood of lawsuits triggered by the law change. The reserve increases we took in March represented our best estimate of what we believe would be the full effect of the lawsuits on loss costs for prebill accident periods. Going forward, we believe the legislation takes positive steps to help manage the cost of auto insurance for Florida consumers. However, the situation is evolving, and we will continue to assess and react to information as it develops.\nIn commercial lines, again, we believe we are adequately reserved today and are monitoring trends in frequency and severity to ensure we remain adequately reserved. Of course, any assumption on reserve adequacy comes with a caveat that trends can change. If they do, we will react to them as appropriate.\nThe follow-up to the reserving adequacy question is, how did you miss reserving trends in the recent past? And given that, how can you be confident in your current reserve adequacy? I'll address these questions individually. The business of insurance is predicting the future. We never know our full cost of goods sold until years after premiums are collected. As such, our reserves are, by nature, estimates of our exposures based on assumptions.\nWe use historical data, extensive knowledge about our business and customers and advanced analytics to predict ultimate loss costs usually with an extremely high degree of accuracy, Predicting the future is hard, however, and we didn't fully predict trends that developed during the quarter. We saw higher-than-expected severity trends in previously closed claims in personal auto, primarily in fixing vehicle coverages.\nWhile I won't speculate on why these trends change, I can tell you that we reacted quickly and decisively to adjust our reserves for these short-tail coverages. I'm confident in the people and processes we have in place to ensure we're adequately reserved. For the 5 years ending 2022, prior year reserve development averaged about 0.25 points unfavorable on our year-end combined ratio, which I believe supports the statement that we always strive to set reserves adequately.\nHopefully, these questions and answers address some of the most sought-after explanations of the first quarter. Rest assured that no one is more acutely aware of the results of the first quarter than myself, my team and all the people at Progressive. I continue to be confident in the long-term direction we're headed, and I a little doubt will continue to do everything we can to achieve our goals.\nThank you again for joining us, and I will now take your questions."

Constantine\n\nDirector of IR, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Fourth Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website. This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team.\nThe introductory comments by our in the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team.\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event.\nAdditional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was among the toughest years of Progressive's 85 years. The continued effects of the pandemic, high inflation and the largest hurricane in our history all played a role in a tumultuous environment. Throughout these challenges, Progressive people came together in unity and delivered once again beating our goal of a calendar year '96 combined ratio while growing both written premiums and policies in force.\nThe pride that I feel in all of the people of Progressive is indescribable. We have met all challenges head-on and continue to deliver the best-in-class results our stakeholders expect. Our ability to meet these challenges is embedded in our culture, which is built on our newly updated 4 cornerstones: which are who we are, which is our core values, why we are here, which is our purpose. We revised our purpose to be, we exist to help people move forward and live fully.\nOur modified purpose builds on the legacy of our core values and our history of challenging the status quo to accelerate progress and equity. We modified the purpose to better unify and guide our organization.\nWhere we are headed, which is our vision. We expanded our vision to include business owners, so it now provides a more holistic view of all the customers we are privileged to serve. And how we will get there. which is the 4 pillars of our strategy. We've updated these 2 cornerstones to better reflect the evolution of our company and to ensure our culture adapt to the ever-changing environment we operate in. While our business will continue to progress, we will always seek to maintain the things that make Progressive progressive.\nIn today's call, we once again focus on the strategy cornerstone and specifically, we'll discuss the pillar of competitive prices. Competitive prices means not just offering the best rate, but also the most accurate rate driven by pricing accuracy, expense discipline and industry-leading segmentation.\nAs we have said for the last few quarters, we believe the major Personal Auto rate increases are likely behind us. In the fourth quarter, we continued to raise Personal Auto rates but at a pace slower than in late 2021 and early 2022. While some states are still waiting on filings to be approved by their respective regulators, we believe the majority of states are nearing rate adequacy, and our intent is to continue to increase rates commensurate with future loss trends.\nBased on public rate filings, we know that our competitors are raising rates to address their own profitability concerns. And as they have done so, we've seen our relative competitiveness improve, which has resulted in improving retention strong quote growth and high conversion.\nWe've now actually seen some competitors surpass our post-COVID rate take, which should help us sustain those improvement trends. As a result, we finished 2022 with the best fourth quarter for Personal Auto new application volume in our history, which contributed to growing our Personal Auto PIFs 3% in 2022 and while also running a lower acquisition expense ratio than 2021. We're continuously evaluating our media budget, and we'll continue to use media efficiently as we enter 2023, and we will look to capitalize on this hard market.\nThe higher direct acquisition expense ratio in January is indicative of our opportunistic stance, and it reflects the confidence we have of current rate levels in most states at this time. Of course, if the last 3 years have taught us anything, it's that the future is unpredictable. So we will continue to monitor the business carefully and navigate its data to grow as fast as possible while delivering a calendar year '96 combined ratio.\nAs I said in my annual shareholder's letter, segmentation is a key facet of our competitive prices, and nowhere is that more evident than in our investment in usage-based insurance products, which will be the topic of today's presentation.\nProgressive was a first mover in usage-based insurance. We have had a UBI offering since 1996 when we launched our first product called Autograph. This first effort was limited by the technology at the time and required a professional mechanic to install equipment in a customer's car at a considerable expense.\nThat first attempt evolved to TripSense in 2004, which was our first self-install option. And then in 2008, we launched MyRate, which is where we first employed cellular technology to upload data to our systems. And then in 2010, we launched Snapshot, which we consider the start of modern UBI program. We moved from our discount-only model to one that included the possibility of a surcharge in 2014. And in 2016 launched a Snapshot app, which allowed the customer to use a mobile phone app instead of the plug-in device. Our most recent addition is Continuous monitoring, which began its rollout in the summer of 2022.\nIn parallel to our efforts in Personal Lines, we were developing UBI for commercial auto products. This culminated in our first broad commercial offering, Smart Haul, in 2018, which allows us to provide usage-based insurance to truckers in partnership with providers in electronic volume devices. We also expanded the Snapshot program for commercial auto with Snapshot ProView in 2020, which includes fleet monitoring services to small businesses.\nThroughout our history of usage-based insurance, we have collected billions of miles of data and invested in a process of continuous improvement in our UBI products. Today, UBI is our most predictive rating variable and it provides unparalleled rate accuracy to our customers. Through this, we've continuously educated our customers were today, UBI adoption is at near historical highs.\nTo highlight our UBI products on this call, we've invited two Progressive leaders who have made significant roles in our UBI development. First to speak will be Jim Haas, business leader for our Personal Auto usage-based insurance. Jim is a 20-year progressive veteran. And for the last 5 years, he has led our Personal Auto UBI team. Jim will discuss the advances we have made in Personal Auto UBI.\nFollowing Jim will be Cory Fischer. Cory is a 19-year Progressive veteran. For 9 years, Cory has been our business leader for Commercial Lines R&D. And as of last month, Cory accepted a new role to lead our agency distribution group. During his tenure in commercial lines, Cory led R&D during the successful rollout of both our Commercial Auto UBI products. Cory will be highlighting all of the advances we have made in Commercial Lines UBI, once again giving progressive first-mover advantage in this important technology.\nAgain, thank you for joining us this morning. I will now hand it over to Jim Haas. Jim?\n\nJim Haas\n\nThank you, Tricia. As Tricia mentioned, my name is Jim Haas, and I lead Progressive's Personal Lines telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to tell you about how we've built on that long history in telematics that Tricia discussed. Starting with how we've continued to improve our core Snapshot program, then moving on to discuss how we can now bring in data from outside sources to improve rating accuracy during the new business quote. And finally, wrapping up with the discussion of some value-added services we'll be bringing to market soon.\nFirst, let's recap how our program has worked for a number of years. Individual states may vary a bit, but I'll describe here how it works in most places. We or the agent present the customer with the offer to enroll a Snapshot during their initial quote. If the customer elects to sign up, they'll receive an immediate discount of up to 10% for participating in Snapshot, that will be applied to that quote. So long as the customer stays in Snapshot, that discount stays on the policy during the whole first term.\nDuring the quote, the customer also elects whether they want to monitor using a plug-in OBD 2 device that we send them or via an app on smartphone. The customer then has 45 days to plug in the device or get the app set up. That point, all they need to do is drive, we'll let them know how they're doing along the way. Just before their policy comes up for renewal, we'll use the driving data collected during that first term to calculate the renewal discount or surcharge. That rate adjustment will be included in the renewal quote and will be applied to future policy terms. At that point, the customer can delete the app or send us back to device and they'll be done monitoring.\nI'd mentioned that the rate could go down or it could go up, that is we would apply a discount or a surcharge. But that's not how our program started. In the early days, the program is structured a little bit differently, but a customer's rate couldn't get worse by participating in Snapshot. Customers could receive a discount of up to 30%, but the rate couldn't go up no matter how risky they're driving looked. Many companies still employ a model like this today.\nOf course, no rating variable in insurance only suggests giving discounts. It's about segmentation and matching rate to risk. So the data would suggest that some customers should see the rate increase while others should see a decrease. While only offering discounts might encourage more people to participate in the program makes the economics a lot more challenging and limits the accuracy of the overall pricing. We all know that pricing accuracy is critical in auto insurance.\nSo starting in late 2014, we began introducing a surcharge. We set our factors so that about 1/5 of customers received a surcharge, a share that we've kept about the same over time. The surcharge was small at first, but start us on the path to greater accuracy. It's also when we introduced the participation discount, which is down 10% in most states.\nOver time, we've moved the price closer and closer to what the data would tell us. First, by increasing the maximum surcharge from 10% to 15%, then increasing it to 20%. And finally, to where we are today. We offer larger discounts than we did in the past, now of up to 30%. But we also have larger potential surcharges than in the past 2, now up to 40%. We've come a long way since the days of only offering a discount, but it's important to note that about 75% of customers still receive a discount and only about 1/5 received a surcharge.\nNot surprisingly, we see better retention on customers who earn a discount and worse retention on those were in a surcharge. Renewal rates for the safest drivers who are earning the biggest discounts are about 6% higher than average while they're about 16% lower for the riskiest drivers who aren't receiving a discount.\nSo the program systematically helps us retain lower risk drivers and shed higher risk ones. And because of the changes we made to our Snapshot pricing over the years, we're more accurately priced than ever before on those customers that do stay with us. While these changes have certainly improved the accuracy of our pricing, there is still a limitation to our approach. We only use data from a single term, typically 4 to 5 months to set the price for the life of the policy. This made it so we wouldn't know about material changes in an individual's driving behavior would lead to less accuracy over time.\nWe had experimented with a continuous program a long time ago, back in the late 2000s. At the time, though, consumer acceptance of telematics generally was still growing and collecting data on an ongoing basis was quite expensive. So we decided to move forward with a partial model. Things have changed a lot since then and in early 2022, we started migrating to a continuous version of Snapshot. The basic process isn't all that different. Customers still choose whether and how to participate in Snapshot during the quote and they still receive a participation discount. They still have 45 days to plug in the device or set up the app and then they can just drive.\nThe difference comes after the renewal. As instead of sending the device back or deleting the app, we ask them to continue to monitor and we'll adjust their rate at each renewal to reflect their more recent driving. Additionally, that participation discount is larger now at 15% instead of 10%, which encourages more people to participate in the program.\nHaving more recent data also improves the predictive power of UBI, which means we can price even more aggressively. We've increased the size of the maximum potential discount to 45% and the maximum potential surcharge to 60%. We're one of the few companies to combine a continuous model with the possibility of surcharges. As of the end of 2022, we had deployed this new continuous model in 12 states, representing over 1/4 of our net written premium and plan to roll out to most of the rest of the country during 2023.\nSo while we've been steepening these factors and requiring longer monitoring to make our pricing even more accurate, what's happened to take rate? The answer is that the share of our Personal Auto customers participating in Snapshot has moved steadily upward. In fact, it's up nearly 40% across both channels combined since January of 2019. So today, more people participate in Snapshot than ever before, providing data for longer periods of time that we can use to price more accurately than ever before.\nSo that's the update on what's been going on with our core Snapshot program, which provides great incremental segmentation over what is available via attritional rating variables on renewal policy terms.\nNow I want to talk about how we're working to bring this pricing accuracy to where it's most useful at the time of the new business quote. Since in this scenario, the customer is only now just coming to us, we'll have to use telematics data that was collected by others. Our long telematics experience has helped us learn how to use this data and how to make it predictive.\nWe currently have 2 initiatives in market. The first is a lead generation program that works by inviting good drivers to come and quote with us. While the other begins when a customer comes to Progressive directly to get a quote, and we find and incorporate driving data from third parties into the right we present them.\nLet me start with the lead generation program. Here, a partner like Credit Karma, invites their customer to opt into collecting driving data to see if they could save money on their car insurance. In a privacy-friendly way where we don't receive personally identifiable information, we can let Credit Karma know who's likely to receive a discount so they can invite them to quote with us. Only when the customer chooses to quote, are we able to personally identify that data and are then able to apply that discount to that individual's quote, improving pricing accuracy immediately.\nOur second program involves working with data collected by automakers. Over the last several years, more and more of them have been equipping their vehicles with technology to collect driving data. They've been working to show the value of these programs to their customers so that they'll sign up to share that data with them. And we've been able to tap into that. When a customer comes to us to quote and their driving data is available, we'd ask the customer if they like us to use it to determine their price. They say, yes, we bring that data in and apply the UBI discount or surcharge to their quote immediately. Again, pushing that rate accuracy to where it matters most, the new business quote.\nBecause of our long experience with UBI and in working with both OBD and mobile data and the fact that we attract so many insurance shoppers every year, we're well positioned to execute and benefit from this. To be clear, automakers are in various, often early, stages of getting the necessary equipment into their cars and making this data available to insurers. Additionally, just because new cars coming off the assembly that have the hardware, it takes a long time for the fleet to turn over.\nSo this isn't common yet, but we're excited about the opportunity it represents. We're already working with 2 of the largest automakers, General Motors and Toyota and it's clear that this population will grow over the coming years.\nLastly, I'd like to share some exciting news that doesn't involve using telematics data to more accurately rate policies but instead, builds upon our telematics heritage to provide a valuable service to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we've experimented with offering a service to detect and respond to major accidents to some of our Snapshot customers to learn if they value the service and to better understand how it could be useful in handling claims. We've been encouraged on both fronts as customers have consistently told us that this kind of service is something that they really do value and our claims representatives have seen a telematics data can help them settle claims more quickly and efficiently.\nSo we know that despite how times have changed, there is a large segment of customers who don't want their insurance premium to be based on their driving data. That means that if we limit this just to our Snapshot customers, we'd be leaving out a lot of others. So in March, we plan to start making accident response available to all of our auto customers, not just those who were in Snapshot. We'll use data from the sensors on the phone to detect when a serious crash is likely to have happened. We'll reach out to the customer to confirm the accident and to see if they need help.\nIf we don't hear from a customer at all, and it seems particularly serious, we'll request that the police conduct a well check to make sure our customer is okay. Since we know the customer's location from the telematics data, we know just where to send them.\nWe know there are other accident response services available. We think what we're offering has several key benefits, though, that distinguish it. First, many services come at an additional monthly expense. Ours will come included in the policy. There is no additional charge. This adds value to the customer's relationship with us and can become another reason to choose and to stay with Progressive.\nAdditionally, while other insurers offer crash detection to their UBI customers, we'll be making it available to all of our Personal Lines auto customers, whether they're in Snapshot or not.\nThird, we're deliberate about dispatching EMS. We certainly wanted to get EMS dispatch as quickly as we can when a customer needs it. But we also don't want to waste EMS resources and bother the customer when they don't. This can be challenging since the sensor data for a near miss and an actual accident can look awfully similar. So we try to contact the customer more than once using different methods so they can let us know if there was an accident and if they need help.\nWe only send help if the customers has requested or if we haven't been able to reach them after several tries and the accident looks severe. While most customers in these accidents don't actually need ambulance, many do need a tow truck. We're able to build on our roadside assistance experience to meet this need. We understand that if these tows are even more urgent than a typical roadside request, we can also help customers notify their family members.\nLastly, after an accident, one of consumers' top concerns is how to get their medical bills paid and how to get their car back on the road. As their insurer, we're the ones positioned to help them get there. By detecting these accidents and having this telematics data available. We're able to get their claim started more quickly and able to handle is more efficiently. In fact, if an ambulance or tow is dispatched, we'll actually get their claim started on their behalf.\nLet me show you an example. This is a real claim that was detected via accident response. In the loss pictured here, our customer was driving on an urban boulevard when they hit some ice, lost control of the vehicle, first striking barricade to their left before striking the barricade on the right. Fortunately, no other vehicles we're involved. As you can see, the airbags deployed and there was pretty severe damage to the front of our insured vehicle. In fact, this vehicle is a total loss.\nAdditionally, our customer and two of their passengers were injured in the crash. Within 2 minutes of the impact, we reached out to our customer. While they didn't respond to our initial push notification, they did respond to a subsequent call from a live agent, which occurred less than 5 minutes after the accident. That agent dispatched an ambulance and tow truck to the scene. Only a few minutes later, the claim was filed. Altogether, it took only 10 minutes from the time of the accident to when we had a claim in our system.\nWe've surveyed some of our accident response customers, where we've gotten has some great feedback. For instance, this customer showed that they were \"unable to call for help at the time but help called me\". This service helps us help our customers when they need it most. It's not just the immediate response to the accident that can help customers though.\nHere's another example. This customer collided with another vehicle when changing lanes. We detected this accident as well, dispatched the tow for them and have the claim filed within 12 minutes of the accident. What I want to highlight in this case, though, is that this customer had this accident just 2 days after buying their policy. Some of the first steps in handling any claim include establishing the facts of loss and determining if the loss is covered.\nUnfortunately, there are people who buy insurance after they had an accident and then try to make a claim for it. This means that honest customers are inconvenienced as we need to take the time to verify that the accident happened when they told us it did. That was pretty easy in this case, however, since we detected the accident in the first place and arrange for the tow truck to pick up the car. And we can see from the telematics data that the crash happened where . and importantly when our customers said it did. Therefore, we were very confident that this loss did occur after and not before the customer purchased the policy, which let us move forward more quickly with getting the customer back on the road.\nSo it's not just the accident response service self, but its promise to improve the claims experience that can benefit our customers. They've told us they value accident response, and we're excited to make it available to them. We'll start that process in March and expect to make it available to all of our Personal Auto customers over the next year or so.\nTo wrap up, we're not just jumping on the telematics bandwagon. We have decades of experience here. We're clear-eyed about the challenges but also see the great opportunities telematics offerings present. But this is just this is just the Personal Line side of the story. My colleagues in Commercial Lines have been developing their own approach about how to use telematics data in their markets.\nAnd Cory Fischer, who's led Commercial Lines R&D for the better part of the last 10 years is here to tell us about it. Cory?\n\nCory Fischer\n\nThanks, Jim. As Tricia shared, I'm Cory Fischer, and up until recently, I was the business leader for Commercial Lines product research and development, which includes responsibility for commercial telematics efforts. Today, I'd like to share the progress we've made since introducing our commercial telematics programs, some early observations and how we're thinking about future investments in this space. The chart on the lower left was shared in a prior Investor Relations call. It's why we're excited and have been investing in telematics. Pricing segmentation is an important part of how we compete. The group I've worked with is charged with advancing our Commercial Auto segmentation leadership position in the market. Telematics is the most predictive rating variable we have by a lot.\nTo build on that segmentation leadership position, we need to be a leader in telematics. For context, we have 2 branded telematics programs. Smart Haul is the first program we introduced in 2018 after several years of data collection studies and pilots. It targets truckers that are required to maintain hours of service logs. The launch intentionally coincided with the federal mandate requiring these truckers to move from paper logbooks to electronic logging devices. We recognized those devices provide continuous monitoring and capture very similar data to our snapshot devices, including location information. With the customer's consent, we use the data from the truckers electronic logging device to generate a score and apply a rating factor.\nIdeally, we access the data during the core process, just like the process Jim discussed using data to price new business. If we're not able to get the data, either they are newer venture without driving history, or we don't have immediate access to their ELD vendor. We provide a participation discount on the quote. Snapshot ProView, on the right, is more similar to what Progressive Personal Auto has offered. Its target is essentially anyone that doesn't have an electronic logging device. We market snapshot ProView as safety and savings.\nFor customers that enroll, we provide a participation discount at new business and send a Snapshot device that they can easily plug in. Given how small businesses have employee turnover, this program has continuous monitoring. We'll then use the driving data to generate a score in a factor that applied at renewal. This factor could be a discount or a surcharge.\nIn addition, we provide access to a free driver portal. Our customer can see where their vehicles are and how they're being driven. It's a fairly simple way to keep tabs on their fleet and driving behavior. Since we deployed these programs, we've been monitoring a number of key metrics. The chart on the right shows a version of take rate. That is percentage of new business apps and rolling into a telematics program.\nWe've seen from prior program launches, it can take a while and require a sustained effort to get meaningful adoption. Though we've identified opportunities for increasing take rate, we're genuinely happy with how quickly adoption has occurred and the trajectory it's on.\nIn addition to adoption, we've seen that when quoters enroll into a program, they convert at a higher rate than the cohort that's eligible but chooses not to enroll. We also see that our telematics book of business performs better from a profitability standpoint, even after the discount is applied. That's not the longer-term goal. Our intent is to accurately price all segments of target.\nBetween our significant footprint in the Commercial Auto market, healthy adoption rate and conversion lift, we've built a substantial Commercial Auto telematics book of business. That book would be a top 15 commercial auto insurance carrier on its own.\nIn summary, we're really pleased with the growth and performance of our telematics efforts. But we've learned a lot since introducing these programs. One recognition, getting into telematics is not easy. It's not just as simple as adding a new rating variable. It takes broader and sustained effort, new capabilities and investments.\nFor example, we're asking our partners in the independent agent channel to take additional steps to enroll customers, which can include a supplemental app and working through customer reservations with sharing their driving data. That requires an incremental level of support and training.\nWith telematics, we're now dealing with hardware and data transmission. Were also in the logistics business, sending out devices, tracking inventory levels and recently, dealing with global supply chain issues. That's a different set of vendors, technical challenges, systems and business processes that we've had to work through.\nI think the biggest difference is the amount of data that these devices generate. We have to ensure that data is being managed effectively. It's imperative as the data is being transmitted and stored that it's handled securely. Also, as the largest commercial auto insurer in the United States, we have a lot of data and have developed effective tools, processes and skills to manage and model those more traditional data sets.\nTelematics is an entirely different situation. One truck alone might generate over 1 million records per year. Our traditional approaches aren't nearly as effective performing big data sets into variables that we can test and model off of. A big advantage to us is that Personal Auto through its efforts and investments over the past 20-some years has established a lot of these capabilities or learnings that we can leverage.\nFor example, our Snapshot ProView program uses the Personal Auto Snapshot device. Given the Volume that Personal Auto has generated, we have a very competitive cost per device, and that device is already set up to transmit the data back to our secure storage solutions.\nIn terms of big data, Personal Auto helped us move to their cloud solution, essentially a highly scalable, cloud-based data storage and analysis service. This significantly reduces our processing time to analyze data and at a much lower cost than traditional alternatives. They've also provided support as we upskill our team to use these new tools.\nTo summarize this slide, getting into telematics requires a lot of effort. A competitive advantage that we have in Commercial Lines is that our colleagues and Jim's group have already laid a lot of that groundwork that we can either use or learn from. It takes a lot to stand up a leading telematics program and to maintain that leadership takes ongoing investment.\nI'll share some of those ideas with this slide. Near term, there's a lot that we can do to improve the experience. We have data that shows where customers drop out of the funnel or hit operational hurdles by granting data-sharing consent or installing the plug-in device.\nWe have worked with our vendors and have new business processes that will improve both. We have several manual processes in place that support these programs. By automating those, we will lower our program expenses and improve the customer or agent experience. There are a few segments that are currently eligible for one of these programs. We're looking to expand eligibility.\nOne example is for our small fleet customers that have their own telematics service, but not electronic logging devices. This could be a service fleet like plumbing. Our intent is to enroll them into a program and access the data from their telematics service provider. Through these near-term plans, we'll continue to grow our telematics book and with that additional data continue to refine and improve our scoring models.\nWe're also excited about new data sources and applications. We're seeing better reception from segments that we target to having dashcams. We've been doing a pilot with dashcams for over a year. There's data from video that we don't capture today like following distance, which could be valuable. And as Jim shared, we're interested in how telematics can help with the claims process. Dashcams would be an additional input that could be meaningful for claims.\nWe're also using the data to support our underwriting efforts. For now, that might mean verifying other information on the application like radius of operations or garaging ZIP Code, which are important for us to assess where the vehicle is operated. Sometimes, we need to follow up to confirm that the information on the application is correct.\nWe can use telematics data to better target which risks we should follow up on. Our telematics score is currently bolted on to our core model. Given not everyone is in a telematics program, we solve our core model first and then add a telematics score factor for those enrolled. Over time, we plan to move more of the telematics data into the core product, especially where we have those insights at time of quote.\nHere's an example. This shows on trucks driving pattern for 60 days. On the application, the insurance address and garaging Zip is Elizabeth, New Jersey, and they've listed their operating radius as 25 miles. Our model would use information closest to that address to determine a territory factor. Some customers had a garage there might never go into New York City. This truck goes lots of different places, but it turns out there's a fairly regular pattern of going into the city. It's hard to tell from this map. But from the data, let's say, 75% of the trips go from Elizabeth into New York City before turning around.\nA territory factor that puts more weight on the New York City experience would be more suitable. Part of our roadmap is to integrate telematics deeper into our model. I don't see a time we have a telematics-only model. We know we get valuable segmentation from non-telematics variables, but there are variables like garaging address and radius, that proxy driving location and where the actual telematics data would be a superior solution.\nWrapping up, we've got a great start to our telematics journey. We've got a significant benefit from the experience and investments our colleagues in personal auto have made, and I'm really excited about how we'll continue to use telematics to drive competitive advantage going forward.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nDirector of IR, The Progressive Corporation\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Jim Haas and Cory Fischer, who can answer questions about the UBI presentation. The Q&A session will be audio only (Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question. Stacy?"

Constantine\n\nDirector of IR, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Second Quarter Investor Event. I'm Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be the moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted on the company's website.\nThis quarter marks a return to our typical format, which is a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with the leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team.\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2022, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I am pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, we continue to work through the challenges handed to us through the macroeconomic environment. Uncertainty has been the theme of our post-COVID world, and that has continued into the second quarter. I continue to be encouraged by the way the organization has responded. Flexibility was our theme for the 2021 annual report, and our people have continued to exhibit flexibility into 2022.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to feel the impact of inflation with used car prices still near all-time highs and continued rising cost to repair vehicles. On the other hand, record high fuel costs and the resulting reduced driving provides a modest tailwind to auto frequency. We will continue to monitor the environment closely and are taking proactive steps to ensure we meet our promise to 96 combined ratio.\nAs we stated in the first quarter, we believe our major personal auto rate revisions are behind us. and that's reflected in our slowing pace of second quarter rate changes. In the quarter, we raised rates in 17 states, which had about a 2% increase countrywide, bringing our year-to-date rate increase to about 9% and our year-over-year rate increase to about 16%. While these rate changes continue to have the expected effect on PIF growth, I'm encouraged by recent results.\nAs competitors took rate and we increased our investment in direct acquisition in many markets, we have seen prospect volume rise, and June marked the first month since May of 2021 with year-over-year new app growth in our direct channel. While the path ahead undoubtedly contains many obstacles, I'm encouraged to see our efforts bear fruit.\nI'd now like to change focus to the main topic of today's presentation, which is our property business. While our state expansion to write property insurance has enabled us to increase our addressable market and accelerate growth in the important Robinsons segment, it's no secret that we have faced challenges.\nOver the last 5 years, we've been unable to consistently run the business at our target margins. And between 2017 and 2021, have posted an underwriting loss. We were the first to admit that we have work to do to get this business on track. As I mentioned in my letter, our current pricing and underwriting activities do not adequately address weather-driven volatility. And we are in the process of executing a number of steps to turn the business around.\nWe realize these actions will require more time than originally anticipated to ensure consistent delivery of our target combined ratio for the property business. As such, we have revised our expected underwriting profitability over the coming years, which led to a write-off of $225 million of goodwill, primarily related to our purchase of ARX Holding Corp. The remaining $228 million of goodwill is also primarily attributable to the acquisition and reflects the increase in addressable market we gain for our Agency auto product that bundling represents.\nThe team of people working on our property business continues to focus time on improving our underwriting, managing risk concentration and more precisely matching rate to risk at a much more granular level. For the last 5 years, Dave Pratt, our soon-to-be retired Property General Manager, has worked closely with senior leaders from ASI as they transformed our property business from a regional carrier to the tenth largest property carrier in the country, now writing in 47 states.\nWith Dave's impending retirement next year, Tanya Fjare, who has more than 20 years' experience at ASI and Progressive has taken over leadership of our property P&L and is partnering with supporting groups across Progressive from product, claims, IT, legal and finance to ensure we're building the products, experiences and team to create the broadly available and competitively priced and profitable product offering that we've all grown to expect from Progressive. While we cannot change course overnight, today, we will share the steps we are taking today to reach our goal.\nFor our main presentation today, first, Pat Callahan, our Personal Lines President and nearly 20-year Progressive veteran, will discuss our market opportunity and our investments in property product distribution. Following Pat, Dave Pratt will go into more detail on our results, the investments we've made in people and product and a real-world case study on how our actions have resulted in favorable results. Dave is a 31-year Progressive employee who has held numerous roles throughout his illustrious career. Dave has been an important part of Progressive's success over his decades of service, and we will miss him upon his upcoming retirement.\nThank you again for joining us. And now I'll hand it over to Pat. Pat?\n\nPatrick K. Callahan\n\nPresident of Personal Lines, The Progressive Corporation\n\nThanks, Tricia. While our focus has historically been on vehicle insurance, we've always recognized that property insurance is an important segment of U.S. personal lines. And as we continue to grow our personal auto business, meeting the property needs of our growing auto customer base is increasingly important.\nOver more than a decade, we've regularly shared our investments to meet those needs as part of our Destination Era strategy. These began back in 2008 through our Progressive Home Advantage partnerships. And today, Dave and I will restate the business case for investing in property, share our progress driving market share growth and more importantly, the initiatives underway to ensure that we deliver profitable property growth in support of becoming consumers' and agents' #1 choice and destination for auto, home and other insurance.\nThe U.S. property and casualty market is almost $800 billion in premiums written and more than 90% of that isn't yet insured with us. Today's focus is on the $381 billion U.S. personal lines market, where we enjoy about 10% of the combined U.S. auto and home market share. We're the third largest auto writer with almost 14% share, while today, we write just below 2% of the U.S. homeowners market.\nDespite many reports of its demise due to technology advancements reducing accident frequency, U.S. auto direct premiums written grew about 4% annually over the past 5 years. And at more than $260 billion, the U.S. auto market continues to represent a growth opportunity. The U.S. homeowners market continues to grow faster than auto, at more than 5% annually over the past 5 years and more than 8% growth in 2021.\nRecent inflationary forces, loss cost increases and resulting rate increases are further accelerating growth in both the U.S. home and auto markets. Let's break this down by channel and segment.\nI expect that many of you are familiar with how we think about consumer market segments across channel, protection needs and auto and home bundle status. The rows on this table are the 3 largest U.S. distribution channels: captive agent, independent agent and direct-to-consumer. While all 3 channels have been growing premiums written, channel share has been slowly migrating from captive agents to direct as technology adoption drives continued e-commerce migration across industries. The independent agent channel continues to maintain share due to its strong consumer value proposition, which combines local agent expertise with the breadth of product availability and depth of carrier options that deliver the ease and savings that consumers value.\nThe columns here are Progressive's consumer segments from simple needs inconsistently insured, auto-only households or Sams; to continuously insured renters, Dianes; to consistently insured but unbundled homeowners, Wrights; to our well-known bundled auto and home Robinsons. You'll note that our market share is approaching 20% for the combined Sam, Diane and Wrights market, while we remain underpenetrated with Robinsons at less than 3% share. Note that this Robinson share does not include the more than $1 billion written by unaffiliated carriers through the direct Progressive Advantage Agency.\nYou'll also note that more than half of the combined U.S. auto and home market is bundled. And more than 80% of that is bundled through an agent. The captive agent channel currently over-indexes on Robinson's share, but as more Robinsons migrate to the direct and independent agent channels we'll benefit due to strong market share across each of those channels. Our focus on Robinsons is driven by our untapped potential in this large and growing market segment, which makes up more than half of the total U.S. personal lines market.\nWe've shared in prior investor presentations that current period financials fail to fully reflect the hidden balance sheet of future growth as our current customers both continue to renew and expand their relationship with Progressive, which delivers both top and bottom line financial benefit for years to come. Investing to expand our offerings to better penetrate the existing approximately $200 billion Robinsons market creates value in 2 critical ways.\nFirst, we drive top and bottom line calendar period unit, premium and underwriting profit growth through acquiring customers who bundle their auto and home today. As I shared on the last slide, more than half of the U.S. auto and home market is bundled. So when these customers shop and switch, it's critical for us to have a competitive bundled offer to meet their needs. The nature of these Robinsons bundled homeowners is inherently more stable than other customer segments. And they also have approximately 3x the policy life expectancy of our Sams segment. Acquiring Robinsons drives growth both today and in future periods.\nSecond, for more than 85 years, we've been a leader in acquiring simpler needs, monoline auto customers, and we continue to view this as an important pipeline of future growth. Ensuring we have broadly available and competitively priced renters, condo and homeowners offerings is essential to ensure we meet the needs of these customers throughout their lifetimes. As we nurture these younger and simpler needs customers throughout their life events, we create and capture value for the firm today and unlock future growth potential.\nSince embarking on our Destination Era strategy, we've made major investments in acquiring ASI, launching new quoting platforms across channels, building our in-house Advantage agency, creating a Platinum offering for our independent agent partners and investing well over $1 billion on bundle and save branding and marketing in just the past 3 years.\nThese investments are driving Robinsons growth across distribution channels, which validates the potential for us to grow in this important market segment. While our property profitability hasn't consistently met our expectations. We also write more than $3 billion in profitable auto premium for these Robinson households across channels. And while some of that would likely have been accessible without the complementary property offering, we're confident that having broadly available and competitively priced property is helping to drive this growth.\nAs I shared a few minutes ago, more than 80% of the bundled auto and home business we're looking to acquire is distributed through agents. The Robinson opportunity through independent agents alone represents more than $60 billion in annualized premiums written. And as the largest seller of auto through the independent agent channel, we are well positioned to leverage our massive distribution footprint and more than 85 years of experience selling through agents to grow our share in the channel.\nI wanted to highlight 2 key initiatives that facilitate our independent agent channel Robinsons growth. First, recognizing that Progressive has historically been an industry leader in ease of use for agents and customers, we built a streamlined quote experience for the home and auto bundle, which makes it fast and easy for agents to enter customer information once and quote and sell a bundle of most of the Progressive vehicle and property products, either upfront or over time as customers experience life events and need more and/or different protection products.\nSecond, shortly after buying and controlling interest in ASI, we launched our Platinum program, which affords unique customer and agent benefits for bundling home and auto with Progressive. Over the past several years, we've continued to expand this footprint, bringing our highly competitive nationally-branded and easy to quote and sell bundled offering to leading agencies across the country.\nBeyond gaining share of the currently bundled independent agent market, close to $100 billion of Robinsons premium is distributed through captive or exclusive agencies. And this is despite lacking the superior consumer value proposition that results from carrier choice or depth that is available through independent agents.\nAs a leading nationally-branded auto and home carrier, we believe we are well positioned to continue to both capture share of the existing bundled independent agent market, while also capitalizing on the ongoing shift from captive agents into the independent agent and direct channels.\nDespite the majority of Robinsons business being sold through agents today, more than 30% of total auto insurance is sold direct. And we believe as younger auto consumers go through the life events that increase the complexity of their household insurance needs, having broadly available online property insurance will become increasingly important to meet the needs of these future customers.\nProperty risks are complex. No two homes are alike. They don't come with VINs, and as such, property insurance products have historically been built to be sold through agents. Homeowners, especially first-time home buyers, often struggle to identify important property characteristics like roof shape, shingle type, plumbing type, et cetera. And as such, most property products don't easily translate to online or mobile direct-to-consumer quoting and binding. We continue to invest to make it easier for consumers to quote and buy property insurance online through our multi-carrier HomeQuote Explorer platform.\nThis proprietary system guide shoppers through the home coverage interview, leveraging data fill and imagery to simplify the quoting process and deliver a multi-carrier shopping experience. This investment is paying off as we continue to lead the industry in desktop homeowner quote initiations.\nAdditionally, while getting shoppers through the quoting process is half the battle, forcing online shoppers to go off-line and call to complete their sale is an antiquated and poor customer experience. And we've been investing to add online buy button functionality to the Progressive Home Direct property offering with availability now approaching 40 states.\nRecognizing the market opportunity ahead of us and the critical role that broadly available and competitively-priced property products play in our future success, let's transition over to Dave Pratt for an update on progress with our property product development and exposure management initiatives.\n\nDavid Pratt\n\nProperty General Manager, The Progressive Corporation\n\nThanks, Pat. I'll review the results in the property insurance business that's underwritten by Progressive, and then talk about the changes we're implementing to position this business for future growth and consistent profitability.\nPat described the huge market opportunity presented by the Robinson bundled customers. Since Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, we have invested to leverage Progressive's brand and distribution channels to attract and retain Robinson customers. We have rebranded ASI's Progressive Home, expanded the Platinum agent program and built online quoting and buying capabilities, as Pat just described. These investments have helped us more than double the size of this business reaching $2.2 billion in direct written premium last year. We're now the 10th largest homeowners insurer in the United States.\nWhile we're happy with the growth of the property business, we are not satisfied with its profitability. We've seen a consistent pattern over the last 5 years. Our underwriting expenses and non-weather losses have been consistent with our forecasts but weather losses have been much higher than the estimates that we included in our pricing decisions.\nIn order to diagnose how to address this problem, we'll look at our performance relative to the overall property insurance market. I'll provide an overview of our countrywide performance and then highlight a state case study, focusing on the actions we've taken in Texas.\nWhen Progressive acquired a controlling interest in ASI in 2015, 64% of the company's homeowners premium came from Florida, Texas and Louisiana. We have labeled those as legacy CAT states in the map here. Growth in other states has reduced that legacy CAT mix from 64% to 41% in 2021 direct written premium. But that's still a much heavier mix than the 22% that these states represent of the overall U.S. homeowners insurance market.\nThe challenges facing the Florida property market have been especially painful for Progressive since it represents almost 1/4 of our homeowners premium. Our Florida direct loss ratio over the last 5 years is 4 points better than the overall industry. But at 74.5%, it's still much higher than our target for the state.\nWe have grouped the remaining states based on their exposure to volatile weather perils. The yellow states in the center of the country experienced significant hail losses. Our mix of business in those states is consistent with their share of the total industry premium.\nThe red states labeled moderate volatility are exposed to hurricane risk on the East Coast and wildfires in California, but there are less risky areas inland and away from the areas of the high wildfire risk. Progressive was a new entrant in the California market in 2016 so our mix of business in the moderate volatility states is less than their share of the overall industry.\nThat leaves the less volatile states in green. As you can see, these more stable markets represented only 27% of our direct written premium last year, much lower than their 40% of total U.S. homeowners premium. In order to build a more stable homeowners book of business, we will limit growth in the volatile states and work to grow our share of premium in the less volatile markets.\nYou've seen this growth and profitability chart in the past for our auto insurance business. It shows combined ratio on the X-axis and premium growth in the Y-axis. Each dot represents one of the top 10 insurers with the industry total represented by the black dot. We want to be in the upper right quadrant, representing profitable growth.\nOver the 5 years from 2017 through 2021, the U.S. homeowners insurance market grew at a 5% annual rate and suffered a combined ratio over 100. As we noted earlier, we're happy with Progressive's growth over that period, but we're certainly not satisfied with our position on the profitability axis.\nI talked before about our heavier than industry mix of business in the legacy CAT states. If we adjust Progressive's results by weighting our state level results using the industry's mix of premium by state, our combined ratio would match the industry.\nLet's take one more look at our results over the last 5 years before moving on to our plans for shifting the mix to less volatile states. This chart shows our 2017 through 2021 direct homeowners loss ratio for the groups of states described earlier. As you'd expect from the mix adjusted comparison of our results against the industry on the last page, our loss ratios are close to industry results within each group of states. This has been a difficult period for the industry in states with significant exposure to catastrophic weather and our relatively high mix of business in those states has driven our overall property results to be worse than the industry.\nI should note that California accounts for 45% of total industry homeowners premium in the states that we've labeled moderate volatility. But California is less than 20% of Progressive's premium from those states. While I'm happy to say that our loss ratio was better than the industry in 5 of those 6 states, our relatively low exposure to California's wildfires in 2017 and 2018, exaggerates our relative performance advantage for this group of states.\nIt's encouraging to see that Progressive's loss ratio is very close to the industry average in the less volatile states since we have relatively little experience operating in these markets. We hope to see our relative performance improve as we roll out product model improvements. These regional comparisons simply reinforce the point that we need to shift our mix of business to build a property book that is consistently profitable.\nI'll talk next about the actions we're taking to accomplish that shift. As Tricia mentioned in her first quarter letter to shareholders, we have begun implementing a plan to shrink our business in Florida and limit growth in the other states with significant exposure to catastrophes. We've taken a number of actions in these states. We've increased rates, particularly for homes with older roofs; we've expanded underwriting eligibility restrictions to ensure that we're writing only business we expect to be profitable; we've introduced targeted nonrenewals in areas with concentrations of risk or segments that are unprofitable; we've introduced cost-sharing initiatives such as higher deductibles and actual cash value coverage on roofs that are nearing the end of their useful lives; and we've improved agency management, including a reduction in our agency force in select markets.\nWhile these changes are important, they're not sufficient. We can't shrink our way to success. So we also need to continue investing in product improvements that will support growth in the less volatile states.\nOver the last 4 years, we've made significant investments to develop the organizational capability to build and deliver best-in-class property insurance products. As you can see in the graph on the right, our product teams have grown from just 21 people in September of 2018 to 134 people at the end of this year's second quarter. We have added auto-like capabilities to a team with significant amount of property experience and expertise. I'll briefly describe the new teams that we've added in the product area.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, we introduced an underwriting analytics team created to advance the science of underwriting and improve our risk selection. In the fourth quarter of that year, we introduced a dedicated research and development organization to focus on product model development and segmentation improvements. In the first quarter of 2019, we introduced a dedicated pricing team. And finally, in the second quarter of last year, we introduced a new rate revision and product delivery team to improve our speed to market so that we can take these new model enhancements and roll them out more quickly. These investments have helped us to improve our product offerings with more improvements still to come.\nIn 2019, I described our 4.0 property product, which added new coverage features and expanded eligibility to meet the expectations of preferred agencies outside of our legacy CAT states. We have since introduced the 4.1 product model, which allowed us to price the water peril more accurately. These 2 product versions are now live in 41 states that represent 93% of our non-Florida premium.\nWe'll move to full by-peril rating with the 5.0 product model. We've completed the research work for this new model and IT development work is in process now. The first state is scheduled to go live during the first half of 2023. We expect 5.0 to offer more competitive rates for a majority of shoppers and allow us to further expand the range of risks that we can accept. We will need these improvements to achieve our growth ambitions in the less volatile states.\nNow let's look at a case study for how these product improvements can help us improve results. In 2017, our Texas business was too concentrated in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with that region representing 40% of our Texas business compared with roughly 20% of the single-family homes in the state. We also had too many customers with low wind/hail deductibles, especially in the northern half of Texas that experiences frequent hailstorms. Our customers are often encouraged to file claims after these storms by aggressive marketing from roofers.\nWhile a free roof initially sounds appealing, we found that customers with higher deductibles are less likely to file a claim for minor damage. In order to address these problems, our Texas product manager increased rates, introduced higher deductible requirements for new customers, and improved price segmentation with the introduction of the 4.0 and then 4.1 product models. We have seen significant shifts in our Texas book of business as a result.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth mix is now in line with that area's share of homes in the state, our average wind/hail deductible is up 50% and we're attracting more bundled customers and fewer customers with roofs that are nearing the end of their useful life. These changes have resulted in improved performance relative to our competitors in Texas.\nIn 2018 and 2019, our Texas combined ratio was 10 points worse than the industry. As we've shifted the mix of business, we started to see improvement in 2020 and our 2021 combined ratio was 15 points better than the overall industry in Texas. We were able to accomplish these shifts without shrinking the total business in the state.\nWe now expect to achieve our target profit margins over time or in an average year, but it's important to note that Texas homeowners results are naturally volatile due to the state's exposure to big hurricane and hail events. That's why we have decided to limit growth in Texas as part of our overall plan to shift our mix to less volatile states. Texas is now well positioned for profitable growth but we wanted to represent a smaller share of our total property premium over time.\nI'll close with 2 topics that many of you have asked about. The first is the effect of inflation on our Property business. The table on the left on this page shows our filed rate changes over the last 2.5 years in our core homeowners product. But that table doesn't fully explain the changes in ultimate premiums that our renewing customers experience.\nLet me explain that process in a little more detail. When we sell a new homeowners insurance policy, we estimate the cost to replace the home in the event of a total loss. We insist that the agent insure the property for at least that amount to ensure adequate coverage for the customer. We update this replacement cost at every renewal event. If the estimated replacement cost has gone up, we automatically increase the coverage limit to maintain adequate coverage.\nUntil recently, these renewal adjustments typically increase coverage limits by 2% or 3% at each policy renewal. The blue line in the chart on the right shows the average year-over-year change in these coverage limits by quarter. And you'll see that inflation-driven cost increases during the second half of last year jumped from the traditional 2% to 3% to double-digit increases in average coverage limits.\nThe orange line shows the average renewal premium increase paid by customers who renewed with us in each quarter. So that orange line is a function not only of our filed rate change, but also the increases in coverage limit to ensure adequate coverage. And then any mix changes that might have resulted from some segments of customers renewing with us at a higher or lower rate as we've changed our product over time.\nWhile we would certainly prefer to keep prices more stable for our customers, this automatic adjustment to maintain appropriate coverage helps us to maintain appropriate rate levels to compensate for increases in claims severity.\nAnd finally, I'll provide a brief update on our reinsurance program. We use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital in the event of an unusually severe catastrophic event in addition to protecting against unusually volatile property results. Progressive is a large and consistent purchaser of coverage using both traditional reinsurance and ILS markets. We've developed long-term trading relationships with our reinsurance providers, and we strive to keep them well informed about our business results and plans.\nWe currently retain the first $200 million in loss from a single catastrophe event with reinsurance coverage available above that amount up to a limit of $2.6 billion for a single Florida hurricane. We also have $175 million in coverage available for aggregate losses from 2022 catastrophe events in excess of $575 million. While the total coverage limit and per event retention will continue to evolve to fit the growth of our business, we expect to remain a consistent purchaser of reinsurance coverage. Consistent with this history, we were able to fully place our desired coverage at both the January 1 and June 1 renewal events.\nSo let me summarize briefly before we take your questions. As Pat described earlier, a competitive property insurance product is required for Progressive to attract and retain bundled auto and home customers. And this segment represents a huge growth opportunity for Progressive.\nIn the direct channel, our multi-carrier property agency and market-leading quote volume, are driving success. We're investing to improve the profitability in our underwritten property business to support continued Robinson growth in the independent agency channel. Through rate increases, coverage limitations and underwriting eligibility restrictions, we have improved results relative to our competitors.\nBest-in-class product design will support growth in the less volatile states, while a reduction in our Florida exposure and growth limits in our other states exposed to volatile catastrophe risk will reduce the volatility of our overall property, results, and we will continue to use reinsurance to protect Progressive's capital from extreme events.\nThanks again for joining us this morning. We'll now begin our live question-and-answer session."

The company will not make detailed comments related to quarterly results in addition to those provided in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted on the company's website, although CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make a brief statement. The company will then use the remainder of the event to respond to questions.\nActing as moderator for the event will be Progressive's Director of Investor Relations, Doug Constantine.\nAt this time, I will turn the event over to Mr. Constantine.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nDirector of IR, The Progressive Corporation\n\nThank you, Emily, and good morning. Although our quarterly investor relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. (Operator Instructions)\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by our 10-Q reports for the first quarter of 2022, where you'll find discussions of the risk factors affecting our business, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face.\nBefore going to our first question from the conference call line, our CEO, Tricia Griffith, will make some introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Anniversaries are a natural time to look back on the past, and since this is the first investor call of Progressive's 85th year, I wanted to do just that.\nWe have grown from a scrappy start-up trying to find a foothold in The Great Depression to the 10th largest homeowners carrier, the 3rd largest personal auto carrier and the #1 commercial auto carrier. In just the last 5 years, our total company-wide written premium has nearly doubled.\nNowhere has growth been more remarkable than in Commercial Lines, which just passed a major milestone of over $9 billion in written premiums on a trailing 12-month basis. We grew Commercial Auto premiums over 200% in the last 5 years, all while generally achieving a better-than-average industry profit margin, and ended March just shy of 1 million Commercial Lines policies in force. It has truly been an incredible run with significant opportunities still waiting to be captured. Congratulations to the Commercial Lines team, and thank you to all Progressive employees and customers who have made the last 85 years so extraordinary.\nThroughout our 85-year history, we've worked through many hard and soft markets, and we continue to address the hard market we're in today. While some indices suggest the value of used vehicles is leveling or even beginning to decline. Used vehicle values are still significantly above those of early 2021. Steady but increasing trends in bodily injury severity has also contributed to the increase in loss costs we've experienced. Further, as the country emerged from the Omicron wave, we saw Personal Auto vehicle miles traveled recover to fourth quarter 2021 levels, which were in the 9% to 10% range below the prepandemic baseline.\nOur response to these trends have been to reduce marketing expenses, increase underwriting scrutiny, limit build plan options. And in the first quarter, we implemented rate increases of 7 points in Personal Auto that's still into (inaudible) which is in addition to the 8 points we took in 2021. While we're making progress, we still have more work to do to ensure all of our states reach rate adequacy.\nOur rate and nonrate actions have had the expected effect on Personal Auto growth. While Personal Lines PIF growth is still positive on a year-over-year basis, sequential PIF growth is negative. New applications are down year-over-year, and our policy life expectancy is also declining. When we look across all the metrics we track, it seems likely that we're ahead of our competitors in increasing rates, which explains a large part of our slowdown in growth. As we look forward to the rest of 2022, we're optimistic as more states reach rate adequacy, we expect to be able to increase marketing spend and reengage the growth engine. Because of the advantages we believe we have in the way we buy media, we can adjust marketing spend at the local and segment level and in such a way to ensure the new business we write meets our economic goals.\nAnd since we believe we're ahead of the competitors in taking rate actions, we hope to continue our long-term trend of writing more than our fair share of quotes. Even as we face these macroeconomic pressures, we have not slowed our pursuit of segmentation superiority. Our U.S. Personal Auto product model is now available in over 8 -- in over half the states and is showing early promising results, especially among more preferred segments.\nWe have also further expanded the footprint of our 4.1 homeowners product into 4 additional states in the first quarter, bringing the total to 12. Our new normal since the onset of the pandemic has been disruptions in the economy that has buffeted our business. While there are many paths the future can take, I'm confident in our strategy and our people and believe our greatest successes are still to come in the next 85 years.\nThank you, and I'll take your questions."

Constantine\n\nDirector of IR, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us today for Progressive's Fourth Quarter Investor Event. I am Doug Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be the moderator for today's event.\nThe company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q in the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.\nThis quarter, we will have a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO and the presentation were previously recorded. Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we'll use the balance of the 90 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with leaders featured in our recorded remarks as well as other members of our management team.\nAs always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event. Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, where you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face. These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.\nTo begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Tricia?\n\nSusan Patricia Griffith\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Progressive Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today. As I stated in my letter, 2021 was a year like no other. We were forced to confront the new normal imposed on us by the pandemic. We faced business challenges unlike those we've ever previously seen, all while continuing to serve our customers at the level they have come to expect from Progressive.\nOur people are flexible. They can see the challenges coming and react appropriately to ensure we meet our business objectives. Our ability to respond like this is supported by our corporate culture, which is built on our 4 cornerstones: who we are, which is based on our 5 core values; why we are here, which is our purpose; where we are headed, which is our vision; and how we will get there, which is our strategy. This construct guides us so we're all headed in the same direction regardless of the bumps in the road.\nTo achieve our vision to become consumers and agents, #1 choice and destination for auto home and other insurance, we need to execute on our 4 strategic pillars. In our quarter 2 call, I spoke in detail about our pillars and their importance to our business, and I continued that discussion in my annual letter to shareholders.\nWhile each pillar is equally important to support our strategy, today, we're going to focus on a single pillar, competitive pricing. Competitive pricing does not mean having the lowest rate all the time, although we strive to do that as much as possible. Rather, it means having the correct rate to match the risk we are trying to ensure, while at the same time, delivering more value to the customer. We believe that if we could out-segment our competition, settle claims accurately and manage expenses appropriately, providing attractive rates to our customers will come naturally.\nIt's no secret that the insurance industry is going through a period of immense change brought on by catastrophic weather events and macroeconomic headwinds. Our business is no exception. The changes in Personal Lines results, which is our largest line of business, were especially pronounced. Personal Lines results continued to benefit in the first quarter of the year by lower frequency brought on by the pandemic. However, the last 3 quarters delivered challenges. Frequency started to rise, returning to near prepandemic levels.\nWhile the increase in frequency did not surprise us as people started driving more, what was a bit of surprise were the increases in severity, especially the cost to repair and replace vehicles. It was these rising trends that forced us to increase rates.\nOnce we realize these developments were not temporary, our product managers acted quickly, and in the second quarter, started taking Personal Auto rate increases, which were in advance of many in the industry. We've continued to increase rates through the fourth quarter with a total of 8% taken in calendar year 2021. In addition to rate changes, we also had to make some difficult decisions to reduce expenses and increase underwriting scrutiny to hit our profitability goal of a 96 combined ratio, which is the expected impact of reducing growth.\nWhile these decisions are tough to make, and the short-term results can be difficult to acknowledge, we believe we have built a better mousetrap. History has shown that following times of industry disruption, we have grown our Personal Lines business faster than our competitors with better profitability. Further, it has been after times like this that we have made some of our greatest strides to achieving our vision.\nToday, we will spend some time talking about the mousetrap that allows us to react faster and we believe more accurately than the industry as a whole.\nOur first topic today will be on the science of Personal Auto pricing. We will discuss how we take massive amounts of incoming data and apply tools to make risk-based decisions and provide an accurate view of rate adequacy. John Curtiss, our national product development leader, will be presenting this topic. John currently leads our Personal Auto product R&D and pricing groups and has held numerous roles throughout his 19-year career with Progressive.\nNext on the agenda is Kanik Varma, who will demonstrate the real-world execution of the science used by our product managers. Kanik has been with Progressive for over 20 years and was recently appointed as the General Manager of the West region. Kanik currently leads a team of about 12 product managers and draws on many years of direct product management experience to lead the team. Kanik will wrap up the presentation by talking about Progressive's deployment capabilities.\nFollowing the presentations, we will, of course, have our Q&A session. Again, thank you for joining this morning. I will now hand it over to John Curtiss. John?\n\nJohn Curtiss\n\nThanks, Tricia. Today, Kanik and I will give an update on the rate-making process in our Personal Auto business. We have structured our discussion in a Q&A format based upon common questions we receive from our investors.\nThere are many facets to managing rate level in our Personal Auto business. And today, we're going to focus on 2 key aspects. First, we will share how we determine our rate need to support our operational goal to grow as fast as we can at or below a 96 combined ratio. This can broadly be categorized into 2 areas: segment level and aggregate level. Segment level pricing is largely the responsibility of our product R&D group. While very important, we are not going to discuss this in detail today. You might remember that Pat Callahan and Sanjay Vyas discussed our approach to product segmentation back in our third quarter 2018 Investor Relations call.\nToday, we're going to focus on aggregate rate level, ensuring we are collecting enough premium in total to cover our expected future loss costs and expenses to achieve our 96 combined ratio goal. We will provide an overview on 2 key aspects of how we do this. The first topic that I'll cover is the role of our auto pricing team who is responsible for the pricing indication process and providing product managers with an accurate estimate of rate need to ensure they hit rate revision profit targets. The second topic that Kanik will cover is how our product managers leverage these pricing indications, their broader tool kit, and local knowledge and expertise to set the pricing strategy for their respective states to ensure they hit not only rate revision targets, but also our calendar year goals. We will close the presentation with an overview of our deployment capabilities.\nIn our Personal Auto business, it is very common for us to do hundreds of rate revisions per year, which involves many groups at Progressive. This is an area we've invested significantly in over the years to ensure we have industry-leading speed to market and the agility to adapt our resources to meet the dynamic needs of the marketplace.\nSo let's start with the first topic on how pricing and product management work together to determine our aggregate rate need. Before I go into details on our pricing tools, I will introduce 6 key concepts that we will be covering today. The first is compliance. Our product and rates need to comply with all state regulations, which can vary in each jurisdiction and often include limitations in our ability to use specific variables to rate policies.\nThe second is that we price to cost. Our primary goal is to match the rate we charge with the expected cost to ensure our customers. To determine our aggregate rate need, we need to consider loss and loss adjustment expenses, operating and acquisition costs, and our profit load.\nThird, insurance pricing is prospective. Insurance is unique as we do not know our cost of goods sold when we write a policy. As a result, we need to estimate future losses and expenses and ensure we charge enough premium to cover these and earn our profit load.\nFourth, our rates need to comply with actuarial standards. The 3 primary considerations are to ensure rates are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. And for clarity, when I say unfairly discriminatory, I mean not tied to underlying loss costs.\nFifth, when managing our business, product managers need to consider both accident year and calendar year results. Our pricing decisions are based on accident year data, which is determined by the actual timing of a loss or accident as our product offering provides coverage for accidents we expect to occur during our rate revision. Our calendar year results consist of all the losses and premiums for the year, which include the current accident year plus any runoff from prior accident years.\nFinally, we will discuss our premium earnings convention. Unfortunately, we can't change rates on our entire book of business overnight. Rather, rate changes start earning in when a rate revision goes live, either upon filing or after approval by a Department of Insurance, and that depends on the state. While new customers see the rate changes immediately, existing policyholders rates will change at their next renewal event. As a result, it takes time for rate changes to earn in. Fortunately, Progressive writes mostly 6-month policies, which allows us to earn rates faster than many competitors who issue a higher mix of annual policies.\nLet me start with the auto pricing group. Pricing's goal is to deliver best-in-class tools to enable product managers to make risk-based decisions and to provide an accurate view of rate adequacy for our auto business. Think of this as the science behind the rate-making. Given our beginnings as a nonstandard writer and evolution to become a leader in segmentation and product innovation, we've honed our pricing sophistication for nearly 85 years. We continue to invest in attracting and retaining high-quality talent, building systems and processes to make sure we can accurately price a very complex product in a high-quality manner and advancing the science of pricing to improve our assessments of rate adequacy.\nThe pricing indication is the key tool we use to determine our indicated rate need. It helps product managers answer the question how much do I need to raise or lower rates in my next rate revision to achieve the target combined ratio or better on an accident year basis. The indication is based upon 2 primary loss ratio calculations. The numerator is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we expect for policies that we will write in the upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. The denominator is the target loss ratio. This is the loss ratio we need to achieve to have enough premium left over to cover our prospective non-loss costs and profit load. The difference between these 2 ratios is the indicated rate need for the next revision.\nLet me provide more detail on how we determine the target loss ratio. Our goal is to price policies in a way that we will collect enough premium to cover our expected loss costs, loss adjustment expense, operating and acquisition costs, and have enough left over to hit our 4% profit margin. The chart on the slide depicts the various components to determine this loss ratio. And in this example, as you can see, our target loss ratio is 66%.\nIt's very important to note that changes in our non-indemnity cost structure can result in changes in our target loss ratio. And thus having a low cost structure is very important. All else equal, if expenses are lower, our target loss ratio will be higher and we can charge customers less for the same protection.\nThe other key input into our indication is the projected loss ratio. This is our best estimate of the loss ratio we would expect for policies we are going to write in an upcoming rate revision at our current rate level. As I said earlier, we do not know what our loss cost will be when we write policies. And given our 4% profit target, we need to be very accurate in our projection.\nSo how do we get there? This requires us to adjust our historical accident year losses and premiums to reflect our best estimates of the future. Let me talk a little bit about the adjustments we make to our losses first. The first consideration is loss development, which is the process of estimating the ultimate frequency and severity of our claims. Since rate-making his perspective, we need to know how much will recent claims change from what we know about them today. We also need to know how many more claims will be reported from this time period and how much they will cost and change over time.\nTo develop our historical frequency and severity, we analyze historical development patterns using a variety of methodologies to help us achieve accurate estimates.\nSecond, we also need to adjust for weather, which can be highly volatile over time. Our goal here is to price to a longer-term average to make sure that we are not over or underreacting to recent weather events. Once losses are fully developed, both frequency and severity are trended to the midpoint of the rate revision period. The midpoint represents the average cost of goods sold of losses during the revision.\nThere are many factors that can impact our loss trends from macroeconomic variables such as inflation and gas prices to improve safety technology, to law changes and even our mix of business. We monitor these to understand where frequency and severity may be headed, and we update our trends on a monthly basis.\nOn the premium side, we make 2 important adjustments. First, we adjust historical premium levels and bring them to current rate level to reflect our most recent pricing. Second, premiums also have trends, which are largely a function of changes in our mix of business. We need to account for the fact that our premiums can change due to the segments we write. We do not want to change rates simply because our mix of business changes over time.\nOur indications contain many inputs to help us project the future. And as a result, there is pricing risk. Let me share a few examples of the strategies we employ to manage this. First, when possible, we'd like to rely on the most recent accident periods, which allow us to be responsive to our most recent experience and limits the trending period. Here, our data scale is a big asset as it affords us increased precision and prevents us from reacting to noise. The second is our high frequency of rate revision. This allows us to price to a shorter rate revision length and to be more responsive to changes in our indications.\nYou have probably heard us say that we take smaller and more frequent bites at the apple. As a result, it is common for product managers to complete multiple revisions in a year. This is true in general, but not always as we are currently taking much larger bites in the current rapidly escalating loss cost environment to ensure rate adequacy.\nThe third is our high mix of 6-month policies. As I mentioned earlier, once a rate revision goes live, it takes time to earn into the book because we need to wait for policies to renew into the new rate level. As you'd expect, 6-month policies earn in roughly twice as fast as annual policies. Our high mix of 6-month policies dramatically increases the speed with which new rates earn into our results.\nAs you can imagine, COVID was a massive shock to our business and has forced us to adapt our pricing indications in multiple ways. Today, I'm going to use collision coverage as a quick case study to highlight the impact on our loss trends and to share our responses. This slide contains a time serious view of our collision coverage frequency, severity and pure premium through the end of 2019. It represents a pre-COVID period. The solid line is monthly data. You will notice that this data can be bumpy, which is largely due to seasonality. The dotted lines represent the trailing 12-month average.\nAs you can see, during this time, our trends are relatively stable. Pure premiums were increasing on average by slightly more than 3% per year, with frequency gradually decreasing and severity growing faster than the rate of inflation. During this time, we were tracking a variety of variables that could help inform where we thought trends might be headed in the future. One thing we did not expect was a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.\nOn this slide, the data has been updated through April 2020 to reflect the onset of COVID. As you are aware, a massive decrease in driving significantly reduced our collision frequency. This also dramatically changed our data and challenged us to think of new ways to project trends. The key question we needed to answer was how quickly will frequency rebound.\nTo help us answer this question, we leveraged a variety of data elements to inform future projections of frequency. This data came from a variety of sources. First, we closely monitor our claims frequency data to understand both monthly changes and comparisons to pre-COVID levels. Second, we leveraged our extensive snapshot data, which we know is highly correlated with frequency. This data provides a daily view of vehicle miles traveled and important segment-level data on driving patterns such as time of day and day of week. Third, we utilized input from product managers who brought local knowledge about changes to driving in their respective states.\nBy analyzing this data over time, we could start to quantify with what likelihood, by how much and when frequency might return to pre-COVID levels. This analysis is conducted at a state, channel and coverage level, and we update it very frequently.\nThis slide shows the same 3 graphs through the end of 2021. As you can see, our collision pure premiums have rapidly accelerated to well above historic levels. While frequency has rebounded, it is still below where it was prior to the pandemic. However, collision severity has dramatically increased driven by supply chain disruptions and the soaring prices of used cars. Like frequency, our response for severity has been to leverage new data sources like the Manheim index to explain the causes of these increases and where they might be headed in the future.\nIn collision, more than half of our lost dollars are from total losses as we pay to replace total vehicles damaged beyond net cash value. This plot is showing the average value of used cars from Manheim in orange and the estimate of actual cash value, or ACV, of the vehicles we write estimates on in blue. Not surprisingly, what we see is a very strong correlation between these 2 metrics with ACV lagging Manheim by a few months. Given this, signals of upward movement in car values are a leading indicator of ACV, estimates and severity. With this data, we are better able to evaluate scenarios of where severity may be headed in the future, with the cones representing the fact that there is still a high level of uncertainty.\nGiven there's a high level of uncertainty of where our trends and, therefore, our rate need might be headed, I want to share with you how we ensure we are getting our latest views of rate adequacy to product managers in a timely manner.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our goal is to frequently update our trend analysis and pricing indications so that product managers can quickly respond to changing market conditions. Our indications are updated quarterly for each state, channel and coverage combination, which generates thousands of pricing recommendations per year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we updated our loss trends and premium trends on a monthly basis. Given the rapidly changing trend environment due to COVID, we are now able to update the trend portion of our indications monthly, which provides product managers even more up-to-date data on changes to their rate indications. This allows product managers to adjust their plans as the needs of their business change.\nAnd now I'll hand the presentation over to Kanik, who will provide an update on how product managers leverage our pricing science to deliver our operational goal of growing as fast as possible at or below a 96 combined ratio.\n\nKanik Varma\n\nThanks, John. The goal of the product management organization is to deliver profitable growth at our target margin through adapting Progressive's products to win in our local markets. This organization comprises of highly talented individuals. They're results-oriented and were attracted by profit and loss ownership. They want accountability and decision rights, and we empower them to make decisions at the local level. Think of them as Chief Operating Officers of their own businesses.\nThere are several aspects to our product managers job at Progressive. Each product, state, channel is different, and our product managers design strategies to meet our goals within the individual businesses.\nCompliance is mandatory. Profit is our second priority. Growth at target margins comes next. Managing legislative, regulatory developments and relationships are key levers in order to respond to economic conditions and the competitive environment within their states.\nToday, I'm going to focus on one aspect of their role, tactics to deliver our target margins. And this is especially relevant in the current environment. The first step in consistently hitting our target margins is to give our product managers very clear operational goals. You know it as our grow as fast as you can at a 96 objective. Just a reminder, that's a composite calendar year target number. Product managers manage to their respective targets within their channel product or geography down to the line coverage level. Each business fulfills their role within the overall portfolio to meet this composite goal.\nOur product managers have multiple tools that help us operationalize this goal. We call it the product manager tool kit. Product managers actively monitor results with daily reporting on volume measures and monthly data across all other KPIs. The tool kit affords both diagnostics and informs actions to ensure we deliver segment-level results that roll up to our aggregate objectives.\nAt the macro aggregate level, operationalizing this objective is like riding a wave. It requires a very delicate balance. Go too fast with rate, and you will be ahead of the market in compromise growth. However, if you move too slowly and fall behind on rate, it's incredibly hard to catch back up, and you will miss profitability targets. Product managers continuously adjust rate level to match changing conditions, and the capability to be nimble is a source of competitive advantage for Progressive.\nOur product managers are not just trying to hit 96 at the macro level but are making sure they are pricing each individual segment the same target margins. That's very important. We don't have a bias towards any specific customer segment. We want to drive growth across the spectrum, provided those (inaudible) price accurately. This approach enables us to deliver on our broad acceptance or what we call take nearly all comers philosophy.\nOur heritage starting out writing less preferred customers required us to align our entire business around matching rate to risk. And as we've expanded our (inaudible) over the past decades, this approach remains foundational to our strategy. We have to make sure we are continuously matching rate to risk.\nOur scale provides us credible data and to make data-driven decisions at the micro level, which is a competitive advantage versus many industry competitors. Product upgrades in each state allow us to add new rating wearables to our algorithms that feeds the virtuous cycle of risk selection.\nWe've talked about this at length in the past. So today, I'll just focus on how product managers manage profitability at the macro level. The aggregate rate level is determined for each state and channel. Each product manager decides how much rate to take and how often to take that rate for the state and channel they manage. This decision-making relies very heavily on the advanced analytics John talked about earlier.\nProduct managers also incorporate multiple local inputs into their decisions. I'd like to group these local inputs into 3 broad categories: state-specific loss trends, regulatory framework within the state, the mix of business we ensure in each state as that drives the earnings cadence.\nLet's walk through each one of these one-by-one. The first category of inputs is state-specific loss trends. Each state is unique, and states have different loss trends at any given point of time. There are many reasons for this in the auto product. Coverages and limits offered are based on unique state laws. State laws change often and have a direct effect on loss cost going forward. Examples of this would be injury limit increases, fee schedule changes and new case law. States have unique weather patterns that impact loss costs. For example, hill states differ from hurricane states, and we use different weather loads in these states.\nClaims processes are different by state, and we keep improving them to make sure we are paying accurately. Process changes like labor rate changes. Litigation and fraud mitigation strategies can have an impact on loss costs and (inaudible). These are all different by state.\nAnd during the COVID pandemic, states had different lockdown and reopening laws. Product managers work closely with our cross-functional partners in their states. These partners provide valuable local market input, and we incorporate those into our decisions.\nThe second input that impacts decision-making at the state level is rate regulations. At a very basic level, there are 2 types of rate regulation mechanisms, filing used and prior approval. In filing new states, we can elevate rate changes literally the day after we file. The approval for the revision in these states can come months and, in some cases, years after the rates are effective. Prior approval means that state (inaudible) needs to approve the revision before it's effective. This framework requires more time to get rates to the Street. But even before approval and prior approval states, we typically go through a back and forth with regulators as they ask questions and we explain our data and answer their questions about what's changing with the specific revision. We call this the objection process. But don't be confused, these are questions raised to clarify and understand and not fix barriers to implementing our product changes.\nOver decades, we've built incredibly strong relationships with our regulators as both credible and transparent operators, and we continue to work closely with regulators to ensure they're comfortable with what we're doing, why we're doing it and how what we're doing ensures we deliver rates that are adequate are not excessive and are not unfairly discriminatory. When trends change, usually, we're the first carrier to share the latest credible data with state regulators. So it's fairly normal for them to react to new information and ask questions and ask for support to confirm understanding.\nIn practice, though, there are 51 different enforcement mechanisms, no do or alike. Each has to be managed independently. We have built institutional knowledge and dedicated resources to put together filings and additional support, to ensure we get the right price into every local market as quickly as possible. Each product manager has in-depth understanding of the state's regulatory mechanism. They are on top of the unique deviations, which means we have to know how to calculate rate need on the state's template, how much rate can be approved under a certain mechanism, the flex bands, and how often we can file in a year. They also manage the approval time lines, which can vary based on the type of filing within each state.\nWhile we price our policies to run consistently at or below a 96 accident year combined ratio prospectively, we also manage our results to a calendar year 96 combined ratio target. In order to do that, product managers need to plan for the time it takes for rate changes to earn into our financials. It's important to note that because we have a large book of in-force business, rate changes don't affect all policies at the same time. All new policies going forward are written on the new rates, but existing policies don't see a rating until they come up for renewal.\nOur combined ratio is a function of losses and expenses divided by earned premium. To put things into perspective, this is a chart of how much time it takes for that earned premium to reflect the new rates on our Personal Auto policies. With a predominantly 6-month book of business, if we increase rates by 5% today, 5 months from now, our earned premium, which is the denominator for the combined ratio, would have increased approximately 3.5%. And by month 7, we will be close to that 5%. So the rate we took in the second half of 2021, around 6%, will have largely earned into the financials by midyear.\nAny rate we will take now will partially offset the first half and, more materially, the second half's combined ratio. For comparison, if a carrier had 75% of their policies as annuals, it will take even longer as only 65% of the premium would be at the right rate level 7 months after the change. This is a big reason we've limited distribution of 12-month policies to primarily our Platinum agencies, while over 90% of our Personal Auto policies are 6-month policies. And at times like these, we benefit from a shorter lag period to realize rate changes in our book.\nLet's use one example to show you how one auto product manager made high-level decisions over the last couple of years. This is a real example from one medium-sized state. The gray line on the chart is monthly pure premium in that state, while the blue line is a trailing 12-month average pure premium. This takes out the weather-related seasonality in the state.\nIn 2019, the state was running under a 96 combined ratio, and our loss cost trends were fairly stable in the state. With stable trends, the product manager was focused on growth strategies, which typically include lowering rates to convert more shoppers or increasing demand generation spend to generate more shoppers.\nAs early COVID-related frequency drop came through our data, the product manager responded, first, by participating in our April relief efforts. That included $1 billion of premium credits during the immediate post-COVID period. That was followed by an aggregate rate level decrease a couple of months later.\nIn early 2021, as this product manager was evaluating their aggregate rate level, based on the data available at the time, they expected trends to start returning to pre-COVID level at a fairly slow pace. The state's pure premium expectations at the time are shown in the orange line.\nAt this point of time, our tools indicated no immediate rate action, nor did local conditions in the state weren't anything different. Our ability to review trends and rate level every month allow this product manager to very quickly spot a change in trend shortly after making their rate decision. This change in loss cost trend was supported by UBI data in the state, which you're driving returning at a faster pace than previously expected. There was enough credibility in the data for the product manager to react and the adjusted rate level upwards to reflect the change in frequency trend.\nAs time went on, severity continued to rise at a faster pace than expected back in May, especially in collision comprehensive property damage coverages. Frequency also continued to see modest positive trend as driving behavior reverted back to normal. At this point, the product manager took another rate adjustment to ensure they would hit the accident year 96 and calendar year 96 combined ratio objectives.\nSince we're in the business of trying to predict the future, there is near certainty that we'll be wrong. However, our business model is to minimize this error by shortening our future pricing time horizon to provide more frequent opportunities to adjust our future prices to market conditions. Our product managers have the advantage of getting updated indications and other diagnostics often and have the resources to act when needed. This allows us to react very quickly when conditions are changing and when the regulatory framework allows it.\nAs Tricia shared, this approach of taking more frequent smaller bites of the apple continues to serve us well as our rates are more closely aligned with true underlying costs, which enables us to deliver more consistent underwriting profitability and more competitive rates that drive long-term growth.\nIf a [carrier] either does not have the ability to review data often and/or does not have the flexibility to react quickly, you can fall behind on rate need. The margin of error grows, the longer you have to wait to react. This is why we have invested heavily in the tools to evaluate trend quickly, and the systems to react as fast as possible.\nThis chart also illustrates the challenge in states with longer approval times. Our product managers deploy different strategies to manage rate revision length risk in states where we aren't afforded the flexibility to change rates as often as necessary to accurately match rate to risk. Our product managers typically act earlier and more conservatively to ensure we have adequate rates while making sure they are not excessive. They also have a full tool kit of levers available to deploy, to protect the book and meet their target margins.\nWe just talked about the science and the product manager tool kit. Now let's talk about how we deploy changes to the market. Having data and analytics to inform pricing decision-making is necessary, but not sufficient to effectively manage a book of business. You must also have decision makers and the deployment resources to file in a timely manner, get regulators comfortable with our actions and the IT infrastructure to get the updated pricing to market.\nIn the example I shared, this particular product manager implemented 10 rate revisions in the state in the last 2 years alone, 5 each for direct and 5 for agency. These actions resulted in the state meeting its profit targets, both years in a very dynamic market and achieving 7.4% earned premium growth last year or over 25% earned premium growth over the 2-year period while continuing to keep us ahead of the industry on segmentation.\nThe backbone of our deployment capabilities is our rate revision factory. We have the ability to act multiple times in a year in every state. Our resources dedicated for product upgrades are incremental to those for rate increases.\nJust to give you an idea. Last year, we deployed over 4 rate revisions per state in auto, and approximately 60% of our premium picked up the latest product model. It's also important to note, each tool in the product manager tool kit is supported with dedicated IT infrastructure. These are separate systems and resources that are incremental to our rate revision factory. That gives us added flexibility to deploy our tools as needed in individual states.\nWe have long seen revision deployment and cadence as a potential source of competitive advantage, which is why several years ago, we invested in the factory to increase its throughput and improve its quality to ensure we can continue to lead in both pricing and segmentation. We believe this investment has provided us with best-in-class capabilities. And this is just a view of our auto product. Each business, commercial, recreational lines and property, have, incremental dedicated capabilities.\nOur ability to react early to changes in market conditions creates opportunities for us. The last time the market hardened, we followed our playbook and reacted fast and decisively. We believe faster response times help us compress the industry cyclicality during both hard and soft markets. That continues to drive our growth during times of change.\nThis market cycle may be different in magnitude but requires a similar playbook. We reacted as soon as we saw trends turned in 2020 in addition to the $1 billion April relief effort. Trends changed direction in 2021, and we reacted immediately. We've had a head start, and we'll continue to react quickly as we see changes in the results in either direction.\nWhile we can't know if this cycle will play out exactly like cycles of the past, we do continue to have trust in our process and believe it will help us deliver the best possible results. Thank you.\n\nDouglas S. Constantine\n\nDirector of IR, The Progressive Corporation\n\nThis concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including John Curtiss and Kanik Varma, who can answer questions about the rate level presentation.\n(Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Casey Capparelli, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Capparelli, you may now begin.\n\nCasey Capparelli\n\nThank you, Julian, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. Bob Bradway, will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Peter Griffith, Murdo Gordon and Bob Bradway. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement. And please note that actual results could vary materially. Over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nOkay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Amgen delivered another strong quarter, driven by rising demand for our medicines and meaningful progress across the pipeline. Volume growth once again paced our progress in an environment where selling prices are declining across the industry. This volume growth reflects the strength of our portfolio and the value our medicines provide to patients and prescribers. We saw growth across all 4 therapeutic areas this quarter. Revenues were up 12% year-over-year and volume up 14%. The 1 of our products grew double-digit rates and 14 are now annualizing at over $1 billion in sales.\nOur Broad base of innovative medicines is generating powerful momentum and gives us confidence in our ability to sustain long-term growth. We've also been working to expand access to our medicines. And we recently launched Amgen Now, a new direct-to-patient platform that allows qualified patients in the U.S. to access Repatha at one of the lowest prices in the world. This is an important step forward in helping more people benefit from the kind of innovation that's represented by Repatha.\nLet me take a moment to recognize the scale and complexity of what we do in biologics manufacturing, which is both an art and a science. And at Amgen, we've built one of the most advanced capabilities in the world in making large molecules. We benefit from 45 years of experience in this space and from having a manufacturing network that's predominantly based here in the U.S., serving American patients and patients all around the world since our inception. We continue to invest in manufacturing with more than $3 billion in planned investments in the U.S. this year alone. This builds on over $40 billion invested in manufacturing and research and development since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. This foundation positions us well to support growing global demand for our products.\nNow let me just turn briefly to each of our 4 therapeutic areas. In General Medicine, we're expanding impact across underserved disease areas with substantial runway. Cardiovascular disease remains the world's leading public health challenge with tens of millions of patients at risk for heart attack and stroke. At the upcoming American Heart Association meeting, we will share data on Repatha, showing important benefits in preventing a first heart attack or stroke. We had a powerful signal for the impact or potential impact of Repatha in primary prevention. In bone health, EVENITY is a transforming care for postmenopausal limit at high risk of fracture. It is the first and only bone-building therapy that increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption. EVENITY continues to deliver strong performance and with treatment rates still low among women with high fracture risk, we believe there is significant room for growth. We expect this product to remain a growth driver throughout its life cycle.\nLooking ahead, both MariTide and olpasiran offer additional pathways for growth in obesity and cardiovascular disease, 2 of the world's most pressing health issues. In rare disease, our portfolio of growth drivers are all early in their life cycle. These products are performing well now, and we expect them to continue to grow well into the future. For example, with new indications such as IgG4-related disease and generalized myasthenia gravis on the horizon for UPLIZNA, we're excited by what this product can offer an increasingly broad range of patients. I would also say that the progress that we are seeing with UPLIZNA across a range of different diseases, reaffirms our belief for the potential of CD19-directed therapies to address a wide range of rare autoimmune diseases. In inflammation, we've been a leader for decades, and we are very encouraged by what we're seeing with [indiscernible] as physicians are increasingly comfortable with its profile, increasingly comfortable with the fact that it is a well-tolerated and broadly effective agent able to intervene upstream in the inflammatory cascade. We remain highly encouraged by the long-term prospects for Test buyer.\nIn oncology, we're continuing to establish new standards of care, and Delta has generated strong clinical enthusiasm in small cell lung cancer. LINTA is, of course, now firmly established as the standard of care in frontline consolidation for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. And we are seeing encouraging project -- progress rather with Zalurydamic in prostate cancer as it advances through Phase II. Meanwhile, our biosimilar strategy continues to deliver results as well. You can see that in the quarter, our revenues were up more than 50% year-over-year and are now annualizing at roughly $3 billion in sales. To close, let me just say that we continue to engage with policymakers in Washington and elsewhere around the world to support policies that improve access protect innovation and strengthen the biomanufacturing ecosystem, especially here in the U.S. We've built a strong springboard for 2026. The products that will drive our next wave of growth are in hand, supported by compelling data reinforced by readouts this year and still early in their life cycle. We're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in the business and confident in our ability to deliver innovation and growth well into the next decade. I want to extend my thanks to our colleagues around the world for their commitment to patients. With that, let me turn it over to Peter for a financial update. Thank you.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. We are pleased with our strong third quarter performance and remain on track with our 2025 full year goals and long-term objectives. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 and 7 of the slide deck. In the third quarter, revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $9.6 billion, reflecting the continued strong performance of our 6 key growth drivers, Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, and our innovative oncology, rare disease and biosimilar portfolios. The quarter also benefited from discrete items, including roughly $250 million from favorable changes to U.S. estimated sales deductions and a government order for endplate of $90 million. I would also note that the third quarter included $105 million in sales for [indiscernible] a small molecule within the rare disease portfolio, for which we now have a generic competitor as of October.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin was 47% and reflects significant investments across the business, led by non-GAAP R&D growth of 31% year-over-year. This includes several business development transactions, resulting in roughly $200 million of incremental R&D spending. Excluding these business development transactions, Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses rose 14%, and non-GAAP R&D grew 19% year-over-year. reflecting increased investment in our late-stage pipeline. Our continued investments in programs, including MariTide, [indiscernible] zyuritamic and rare disease will drive sustainable, long-term growth and strengthen our leadership and innovation. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $568 million expense. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with $4.5 billion of debt retired in 2024 and and $6.0 billion of debt retired in 2025. We are pleased to report that we have returned to our pre-Horizon capital structure ahead of plan, and we will achieve greater than $500 million in pretax cost synergies in 2025 in connection with the acquisition.\nOur non-GAAP tax rate increased 4.8 percentage points year-over-year to 18.2% primarily due to the change in earnings mix. We generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, reflecting operational momentum across the business rigorous management of working capital, all while continuing to invest in innovation. In addition to the increase of 31% in non-GAAP R&D described above, we continue to advance and accelerate technology and AI across the value chain from discovery to development to manufacturing and through to commercial execution. AI and trial enrollment, manufacturing optimization and customer engagement are all among [indiscernible] leveraging innovation to drive productivity at speed and scale. We're also accelerating molecule design and other aspects of early-stage research powered by modernized AI and data platforms.\nFor 2025, we now expect capital expenditures of roughly $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion to expand network capacity for our products across the portfolio and our innovative pipeline, including Maritime. Our capital expenditures reflect significant investments across the United States, including Ohio, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, California and Massachusetts. We expect our projects to continue to be on budget and on time. In addition, we returned capital to shareholders through competitive dividend payments of $2.38 per share, representing a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nTurning to the outlook for the business for 2025 on Slide 8. The benefit of our portfolio was clearly seen this quarter, and coupled with momentum across the business, we are raising our 2025 guidance ranges for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. We expect 2025 total revenues in the range of $35.8 billion to $36.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $20.6 and and $21.40. This guidance includes the estimated impact of implemented tariffs. It does not account for tariffs or pricing actions announced or described, but not yet implemented.\nIn addition, let me highlight a few updates to our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we now expect other revenue to be approximately $1.5 billion. Non-GAAP R&D expenses are now expected to grow at a mid-20s percentage rate year-over-year in 2025. We -- this is driven by increased investment in our late-stage programs and the previously mentioned Q3 business development transactions. We now anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion in 2025. We now expect a non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 15.0% to 16.5%.\nAnd for [indiscernible] in the United States, we continue to expect quarterly sales to fluctuate and do not expect any sales in the fourth quarter. And let me remind you of prior items that have not changed. We continue to expect the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 45%. The outlook continues to reflect our investments in advancing key late-stage programs, including maritime all pass ran rare disease and [indiscernible] and leveraging technological advancements, including artificial intelligence. Our operating margin outlook also includes incremental launch and commercial investments.\nWe're focused on delivering sustained long-term growth and value for patients and shareholders by doing what we innovation in areas of high unmet medical needs and maintaining rigorous financial discipline. We continue to focus on execution excellence across the enterprise and remain well positioned for sustained growth throughout the long term. I'm grateful to work with all of our colleagues worldwide in serving patients. This concludes our financial update. I'll now hand it over to Murdo for an update on our strong commercial progress in the quarter. Murdo?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations\n\nThanks, Peter. In the third quarter, sales increased 12% year-over-year, driven by 14% volume growth. products delivered double-digit or better growth, clear evidence of the strength of our portfolio and the disciplined execution of our teams around the world. Starting with General Medicine. Repatha delivered $794 million in the third quarter sales, up 40% year-over-year and now annualizing at approximately $3 billion.\nSince Repatha's launched a decade ago, the PCSK9 inhibitor class remains underutilized with these therapies currently reaching fewer than 5% of patients eligible for [indiscernible] therapy. With roughly 100 million people still in need of effective LDL-C lowering Repatha has a substantial opportunity to expand its use to address cardiovascular disease, the world's #1 public health crisis.\nAs you'll hear from Jay, we have recently announced important data from the Vesalius CV outcome study, which met its dual major adverse cardiovascular events or MACE endpoints in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk without prior heart attack or stroke. I've worked in litho management for more than 30 years, and I've witnessed numerous landmark statin studies demonstrating how intensive LDL cholesterol lowering reduces cardiovascular risk. The [indiscernible] CB results demonstrate that Repatha provides additive benefit above and beyond stats, delivering even more reduction in cardiovascular events in primary prevention patients at higher risk. Currently, greater than 95% of patients insured in the U.S. have coverage for Repatha and most insured patients pay less than $50 out of pocket per month. The prior authorization requirements for many of these patients have also been removed or substantially reduced. In the U.S., we're taking bold steps to improve access with the launch of Amgen Now our new direct-to-patient program.\nRepatha is the first therapy available through Amgen Now at a monthly price of $239 or roughly $8 a day. This is nearly 60% below the current U.S. list price, which is already one of the lowest in the world. The launch of this program is a meaningful step toward providing additional affordability and access to Repatha for American patients. EVENITY delivered $541 million in third quarter sales, up 36% year-over-year. In the U.S., sales grew 44%, driven by higher prescription volumes from both established and newly activated prescribers EVENITY is the only therapy that builds bone and slows bone loss, which is a unique advantage in helping postmenopausal women reduce fracture risk. In the U.S., EVENITY continues to lead the [indiscernible] segment with over 60% market share and approximately 270,000 patients treated to date. However, many remain at high risk of fracture. With close to 90% of the roughly 2 million very high-risk patients still not receiving appropriate therapy.\nIn Japan, if entity has been prescribed to approximately 800,000 patients since launch, making it the leader in the bone builder category with greater than 50% market share. The success of EVENITY in Japan underscores the significant untapped in the U.S., where improvements in screening and diagnosis and increased treatment could meaningfully expand patient reach and drive continued growth.\n[indiscernible] delivered $1.1 billion in sales, an increase of 9% year-over-year. The biosimilars have launched today in the U.S., and we see competitive dynamics evolving in line with expectations. In future quarters, we expect increased competition to negatively impact Pro sales. Our rare disease portfolio grew 13% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, now annualizing at over $5 billion with strong performance across the board. [indiscernible] sales increased 46% year-over-year to $155 million. The launch of UPLIZNA IgG4-related disease is progressing well with significant uptake of rheumatologists and key academic medical centers. while IgG4-related disease is a recently defined condition, our educational efforts are rapidly building awareness and diagnosis. We've seen over 300 unique prescribers since launch across multiple specialties, demonstrating breadth of adoption of UPLIZNA in this indication. UPLIZNA is a leading FDA-approved treatment for NMOSD with growth driven by increased new patient demand and strongly so treatment initiations and adherence.\nAdditionally, launch preparations are underway for the anticipated approval of UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis or GMG, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder driven by pathogenic B cells. We look forward to the potential of serving more patients who can benefit from UPLIZNA's differentiated profile, including its durable efficacy and convenient dosing and administration.\n[indiscernible] grew 15% to $560 million in the quarter, driven by increases in inventory and price. We're encouraged by our launch in Japan, where more than 800 patients have been treated with ADESA since December. In the U.S., approximately 25,000 patients have received treatment since launch to reach even more patients who can benefit from TEPEZZA. We continue to engage a broad prescriber base who have indicated an increasing intent to prescribe. Tape sales were $107 million in the third quarter, an increase of 34% year-over-year, driven by strong volume growth. more than 6,700 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with tabs in the U.S. over 3,800 health care professionals of now prescribed [indiscernible] representing a 31% increase in the prescriber base so far this year.\nIn inflammation, TEZSPIRE delivered another strong quarter with sales up 40% year-over-year to $377 million and has now achieved over $1 billion in sales year-to-date. TEZSPIRE is well positioned to help many more patients in the U.S., given its differentiated and broadly applicable profile to treat multiple triggers and drivers of severe uncontrolled asthma. In addition, TEZSPIRE has recently been approved in the U.S. for add-on maintenance treatment in adults and [indiscernible] aged 12 years and older with inadequately controlled chronic rinsinositis with nasal polyp. This disease is associated with elevated eosinophils and has observed in roughly 20% of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma.\nThis reinforces TEZSPIRE proven efficacy in eosinophilic disease. Importantly, in this registrational trial, TEZSPIRE demonstrated a reduction in the need for surgery further expanding its view and potential to help an even broader in population. Our innovative oncology portfolio, which includes unit $3 billion growth in oncology is fueled by our industry-leading bispecific T cell engager platform. The foundation for [indiscernible] these medicines are redefining standards of care in difficult-to-treat cancers and extending survival for more patients worldwide.\nIMDELLTRA generated $178 million in third quarter sales, fueled by strong clinical conviction and rapid adoption across care settings. IMDELLTRA is widely recognized as the standard of care for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer who are progressing on or after chemotherapy. Over 1,400 sites of care in the U.S. are now administering IMDELLTRA with more than half of the doses occurring in the community setting. Following superior clinical entrance in the Phase III [indiscernible] the NCCN guidelines have been updated to reflect IMDELLTRA as the highest recommended therapy in the second-line setting. We look forward to the anticipated full confirmatory approval later this year.\nBLINCYTO grew 20% year-over-year to $392 million in sales, driven by broad prescribing across both academic and community segments. We see [indiscernible] in combination for both adults and pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell [indiscernible] similar portfolio delivered another strong quarter with sales increasing 52% year-over-year to $775 million and now annualizing at $3 billion. Since our first product approvals in 2018, our biosimilars have generated nearly $13 billion in sales. Additional launches are providing meaningful top line growth and durable cash flow.\n[indiscernible], a biosimilar to EYLEA continues to gain momentum in the third quarter. Retina specialists have responded very positively to launch of [indiscernible] citing is convenient prefilled syringe format and Amgen's high-quality biosimilar manufacturing as important advantages. I'm very pleased with our performance in the quarter, fueled by the unwavering commitment of Amgen employees around the world to deliver on the company's mission to serve patients. And now I'll hand it over to Jay.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter was a period of strong and disciplined execution across R&D. We advanced multiple late-stage programs and deepen the evidence base for our marketed medicines. Starting with MariTide, both of our Phase III chronic wave management studies are fully enrolled. Interest was significant, enrolling approximately 5,000 adults in roughly 6 months. We have rapidly advanced into additional Phase III studies with strong enrollment momentum in MariTide CV and MariTide HF for the study of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure, respectively. Recall, in our Phase II chronic wave management study, we observed statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, triglycerides and ADAS CRP, a key marker of [indiscernible] inflammation. These statistically significant improvements in validated cardiovascular risk factors highlight the potential impact of MariTide beyond weight loss. We have also recently initiated 2 Phase III studies in obstructive sleep apnea. With 6 global Phase III studies now underway, we're building a robust evidence base for Maritime. In addition to MariTide, we are advancing our early-stage portfolio for obesity and obesity-related conditions. This includes AMG51B presently in Phase I and a number of ride and preclinical candidates for both incretin and nonincreasing targets, featuring both oral and injectable routes of administration. Beyond obesity, in general medicine, as Murdo noted, the Repatha Phase III [indiscernible] CV clinical trial met its dual primary endpoints, demonstrating significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events or MACE, in higher-risk individuals without a prior heart attack or stroke. Vesalius CV asked a clinically vital question. can people at higher risk for a first heart attack or stroke benefit from Repatha when it is added to optimize lipid-lowering therapy.\nThis landmark study enrolled over 12,000 patients, approximately 85% of whom were maintained on moderate to intensive statin-based LDL-C-lowering therapy. At a median follow-up of approximately 4.5 years, both primary [indiscernible] endpoints were met and no new safety signals were observed. We are very excited to share the full results from this trial at the American Heart Association Scientific session on November 8 and and would encourage all to review the detailed data when presented. In addition to the Vesalius CV data, we will also present several real-world studies that report on the state of current lipid management and the effectiveness of Repatha treatment in clinical practice as well as new data from the FOURIER open-label extension study. Together, these data reinforce Repatha's long-term benefit and established safety profile while providing new insights into atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk management. The size, scope an ambition of our cardiovascular program, including efficacy from clinical trials and effectiveness from real-world data demonstrates Amgen's unwavering commitment to people living with heart disease and the impact that affordable transformative medicines like Repatha can have on their care.\nTurning to Olpasiran, our promising best-in-class small interfering RNA medicine targeting Lp(a), we are pleased by the conduct and progression of the fully enrolled event-driven OCEAN A Phase III cardiovascular outcome study. We continue to follow the aggregate endpoint accrual rate which is lower than initial predictions. As the study matures, we will update on the date for primary analysis as appropriate. We retain strong conviction in the potential of lowering Lp(a) to reduce cardiovascular events owing to very compelling genetic and epidemiological data that link elevated Lp(a) to cardiovascular disease. Moving to our rare disease portfolio UPLIZNA we recently presented additional data from the Phase III MITIGATE trial in IgG4-related disease, featuring subgroup analyses stratified by baseline characteristics and organ involvement such as the pancreas, kidney and bile ducts. These data demonstrate benefits comparable to those seen in the overall trial population, supporting UPLIZNA's potential across the spectrum of IgG4-related disease patients.\nFor UPLIZNA generalized myasthenia gravis, we look ahead to the December 14 PDUFA date and continue to receive encouraging physician feedback that heights the need and opportunity for highly active durable and convenient treatment options for patients with gMG. In inflammation, we are excited by the FDA and European Commission approvals of TEZSPIRE for the add-on maintenance treatment of inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps for the benefit of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 and older. The Phase III data supporting this approval [indiscernible] rapid and sustained symptom improvement and a meaningful reduction of systemic steroid use. Notably, among patients treated with TEZSPIRE, we observed a near uniform avoidance of surgical intervention.\nAdditionally, our 2 Phase III studies of TEZSPIRE and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are enrolling patients with moderate to very severe COPD with blood [indiscernible] counts greater than or equal to 150 cells per microliter. Our Phase III study in eosinophilic esophagitis continues to mature. By targeting [indiscernible], or TSLP, at the top of the alarm and inflammatory cascade, TEZSPIRE targets the root cause of serious inflammatory diseases driven by Th2 inflammation.\nMoving to oncology. Our bispecific T cell engager or BiTE platform is delivering outstanding clinical results for patients facing advanced cancers. IMDELLTRA, our DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule now established as standard of care in second line small cell lung cancer is generating compelling data in combination and in earlier lines of therapy. In September and October, we presented results from multiple arms of the DeLLphi-303 Phase Ib study of IMDELLTRA in patients with small cell lung cancer, tested in combination with a [indiscernible] inhibitor as first-line maintenance therapy.\nIMDELLTRA demonstrated a promising overall survival of 25.3 months, approximately doubling survival observed in other studies featuring the existing standard of care. In separate arms of DeLLphi-303 IMDELLTRA tested its first-line treatment in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in a PD-L1 inhibitor, demonstrated 12-month overall survival of 81% and with median overall survival not yet reached. In both settings, the safety profile was manageable and consistent with the known safety of each component. We are now evaluating these combinations in the pivotal DeLLphi-305 frontline maintenance and DeLLphi-312 frontline induction and maintenance Phase III studies. Previously, we shared the remarkable results of the DeLLphi-304 study, evaluating IMDELLTRA versus standard of care in subjects with relapsed extensive stage small cell lung cancer after platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. The U.S. regulatory submission has been accepted by the FDA with a PDUFA date of December 18, 2025.\nRegulatory reviews are also underway in a number of additional geographies. We are developing IMDELLTRA for expansive impact in small cell lung cancer and other DLL3-positive malignancies including Phase Ib studies evaluating novel agent combinations, less frequent dosing regimens and subcutaneous delivery. As an oncologist, let me share that the impact of IMDELLTRA for patients facing such a challenging disease as small cell lung cancer is honestly very moving. This disease has seen little innovation in decades and IMDELLTRA is now benefiting so many in this fight with BLINCYTO, our CD19-targeted BiTE medicines, we continue to work to improve and evolve the standard of care for patients here with B-cell acute plastic leukemia. Recently, we initiated a potentially registration-enabling study of subcutaneously administered blinatumumab in both adult and adolescents with relapsed or refractory [indiscernible]\nOur first-in-class [indiscernible] CD3 bispecific T-cell engager [indiscernible], is advancing in Phase III clinical development with 2 studies now underway. The first study, [indiscernible], is enrolling patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have previously been treated with [indiscernible] chemotherapy, comparing [ xaluritamig ] monotherapy versus investigator's choice of standard therapy. The second study, Valiance is evaluating the combination of xaluritamig and [indiscernible] versus investigator's choice of standard therapy in patients with chemotherapemia naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We are also exploring xaluritamig and other combinations and in earlier stages of prostate cancer with multiple Phase Ib studies ongoing. Across IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO and xaluritamig, we see meaningful long-term potential from our bispecific T-cell engager platform and remain committed to bringing transformative and innovative therapies like these to patients with cancer.\nLastly, we are disappointed to announce that FORTITUDE-102, a Phase Ib/III study of bemarituzumab plus chemotherapy nivolumab in patients with first-line gastric cancer was stopped for an adequate efficacy at an ad hoc analysis requested by the data monitoring committee. We are deeply grateful to the patients, investigators and partners who made this study possible. We remain committed to creating and developing medicines for challenging cancers where unmet need is significant as for patients with gastric cancer. Here, however, the magnitude of observed efficacy did not meet our standard for an Amgen medicine. On these innovative medicines, our next wave of biosimilar candidates is advancing in Phase III clinical development, featuring biosimilars to Opdivo, KEYTRUDA and OCREVUS. With breadth and depth across 4 therapeutic areas, we are excited about the potential to deliver for patients, and we are well positioned to deliver sustained long-term growth.\nIn closing, thank you to the Amgen teams whose disciplined execution and patient-first mindset make this progress possible. I'll now turn it over to Bob for Q&A.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Why don't you remind our callers of the procedure for asking questions, and we'll try to get to as many of you as possible. I know it's a couple of minutes past the top of the hour now. So we'll try to get through these. And if we don't get to everybody on the call, we'll be available afterwards to answer any outstanding questions. So let's get started.",

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.\n\nJustin G. Claeys\n\nVice President of Finance & Treasurer\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Jay Bradner and Peter Griffith.\nThrough the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results could vary materially. Over to you, Bob.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you'll hear, Amgen delivered another strong quarter, driven by growing demand for our medicines across the board. With net selling prices for medicines declining across the industry, volume growth is a key differentiator. And once again, this quarter, that's what we delivered. We did this, of course, while also advancing a world-class pipeline.\nIn the quarter, revenues grew by 9% year-over-year and volume increased at an impressive 13%. 15 of our products delivered at least double-digit sales growth, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our portfolio.\nAs you're all aware, there's a focus on pricing and tariffs in our industry. And I would just say that we are actively engaged in discussions with our government officials and share the objectives of improving patient access, affordability and expanding biopharma manufacturing in the U.S. We believe the world needs more innovation, not less, and we're continuing to invest heavily in innovation to support long-term growth. We're, of course, doing that while building on a track record of success, including multiple Phase III readouts in the first half of 2025.\nWe also believe that AI will be additive to the innovative capacity of our industry, and we feel we remain well positioned to accelerate progress through the convergence of biotech and technology, including the application of AI across the company. Let me turn to a few key drivers behind this quarter's momentum. I'll remind you that we're focused in 4 areas, and each are performing well.\nIn General Medicine, we're reaching large underserved patient populations with multiple products that have significant room for growth. For example, in cardiovascular disease and bone health. In addition, our obesity pipeline programs are advancing broadly.\nIn rare disease, we have 4 key growth drivers which are all early in their life cycles and well positioned for robust long-term growth, with attractive pipeline molecules following closely behind. In inflammation, where we've enjoyed decades of leadership, we're excited about the progress we're seeing in difficult-to-treat diseases where innovation is most needed. In oncology, we're delivering therapies that are redefining standards of care and changing what patients can expect from treatment. Our industry-leading biosimilars portfolio continues to contribute meaningful growth as well. And we've proven to be a leading competitor in this field, and it remains an attractive area for us.\nTo close, this was an exciting quarter, not just because of the financial results, but because of what it signals about Amgen's future. In-line brands are delivering. We're launching new products, and we're advancing the next wave of late-stage programs. Amgen is well positioned to deliver innovation and growth not just this year, but for the long term. And I want to thank our colleagues around the world for their dedication to our mission to serve patients.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Murdo for an update on the commercial progress in the quarter.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations\n\nThanks, Bob. In the second quarter, sales increased 9% year-over-year, driven by 13% volume growth. As you heard from Bob, 15 products delivered double-digit or better growth, a clear demonstration of the strength of our portfolio and quality of our execution.\nTurning to General Medicine. Repatha delivered $696 million in the second quarter, up 31% year-over-year. Improved access is enabling more patients to benefit from Repatha. With an estimated 100 million people in need of effective LDL-C lowering, the opportunity to expand our impact remains substantial.\nIn the U.S., we saw continued demand growth across both cardiology and primary care, supported by an expanding prescriber base and deepening engagement across key customer segments. Our direct-to-consumer campaign continues to make a positive impact, with more patients actively asking their doctors about Repatha. On pricing, we expect less net price erosion than we've experienced historically.\nEVENITY sales increased 32% year-over-year to $518 million in the second quarter. In the U.S., EVENITY grew 41% with increased prescription volume from both established and newly activated prescriber [ cats ]. In Japan, EVENITY is positively impacting many people, with over 700,000 patients treated since launch. As the only therapy that both builds bone and slows bone loss, EVENITY is uniquely positioned to reduce fracture risk in women who are postmenopausal. Approximately 250,000 patients in the U.S. have been treated with EVENITY today. However, many remain at high risk of fracture, with about 90% of the roughly 2 million very high-risk patients still not receiving appropriate therapy. This represents a meaningful opportunity to drive growth by ensuring more patients receive the protection they need from EVENITY.\nProlia sales declined 4% year-over-year in the second quarter to $1.1 billion, driven by lower net selling price. In the U.S., 3 biosimilars have now launched. And while it remains early, initial market dynamics are unfolding in line with our expectations.\nI'll move to our rare disease portfolio, which grew 19% year-over-year, delivering nearly $1.4 billion in sales in the quarter and now annualizing at over $5 billion. TEPEZZA grew 5% in the quarter to $505 million in sales. Since launch, TEPEZZA has had a positive impact for thousands of patients living with thyroid eye disease. We're continuing our efforts to engage a broad prescriber base of oculoplastic surgeons, ophthalmologists and endocrinologists, and we're encouraged by the feedback we're receiving from the medical community, including an increase in intent to prescribe reported by endocrinologists during the second quarter. We launched TEPEZZA in Japan in December, and we're happy with the progress to date.\nUPLIZNA sales increased 91% year-over-year to $176 million in the second quarter. UPLIZNA continues to be the #1 prescribed FDA-approved treatment for NMOSD. UPLIZNA growth is also bolstered by the FDA approval in April for use in IgG4-related disease. Our launch in IgG4-related disease is going well, with strong uptake amongst [ rerantologists ] and key academic medical centers. Additionally, launch preparations are underway for the anticipated approval of UPLIZNA for use in generalized myasthenia gravis or chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. We look forward to the potential to bring UPLIZNA to patients living with gMG who can benefit from UPLIZNA's differentiated profile, including its durable efficacy over time and convenient dosing and administration.\nMoving to inflammation. TEZSPIRE delivered another strong quarter with sales up 46% year-over-year to $342 million. Adoption of biologic agents in severe asthma has accelerated meaningfully over the past 5 years, almost doubling as physicians increasingly recognize the value of these treatments. Yet with U.S. biologic penetration still under 25%, there remains substantial opportunity for continued growth. TEZSPIRE not only helped expand the category, but continues to grow faster than the market, gaining share from legacy products based on its differentiated and broadly applicable profile to treat patients with multiple triggers and drivers of severe uncontrolled asthma.\nOur innovative oncology portfolio, which includes BLINCYTO, IMDELLTRA, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA grew 14% year-over-year, generating $2.2 billion of sales in the quarter. At the core of this growth is our industry-leading bispecific T cell engager or BiTE platform, which led to the discovery of both IMDELLTRA and BLINCYTO. With these products, we're helping to redefine the standard of care and improve overall survival rates in difficult-to-treat cancers, creating meaningful opportunities to reach more patients and drive long-term growth.\nOur U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA for the treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer who are progressing on or after chemotherapy continues to build momentum, generating $134 million in sales in the second quarter. We see strong conviction in IMDELLTRA as a standard of care in second line small cell lung cancer. IMDELLTRA is being administered broadly across sites of care, including academic cancer centers, regional cancer hospitals and community oncology clinics. Over half of all IMDELLTRA doses are now administered in the community setting, indicating growing comfort with this important new cancer therapy.\nBLINCYTO grew 45% year-over-year to $384 million in sales, driven by broad prescribing across both academic and community segments. In the U.S., recent updates to the NCCN guidelines position BLINCYTO as a preferred consolidation therapy in combination with continued multi-agent chemotherapy for both adults and pediatric patients with [ Philadelphia ] chromosome-negative B-cell ALL.\nIn the second quarter, biosimilar portfolio sales grew 40% year-over-year to $661 million. Since the first launches in 2018, our biosimilars have delivered almost $12 billion in sales, representing a significant contributor to top line growth and generating meaningful cash flows. Within this portfolio, our launch of PAVBLU, a biosimilar to EYLEA, continues to gain momentum, reaching $130 million in the second quarter. Retina specialists are responding very positively to PAVBLU, expressing appreciation for this high-quality Amgen biosimilar delivered in an easy-to-use prefilled syringe.\nI'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, powered by life-changing medicines, disciplined execution and a clear and enduring commitment to the patients we serve. And now I'd like to hand it over to Jay.\n\nJames E. Bradner\n\nPresident-Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research & Member-Executive Committee, Novartis AG\n\nThank you, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter marked a period of strong momentum and execution across the R&D pipeline. We delivered high-quality rapid progress advancing multiple late-stage programs.\nStarting with MariTide, our investigational therapy for obesity and obesity-related conditions. In June, data were presented at the ADA and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Let me highlight some of the key points that define the differentiated profile of MariTide for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related conditions. MariTide is convenient, the most advanced obesity treatment in development with monthly or less frequent dosing. Efficacy is strong, with up to approximately 20% weight loss at 52 weeks without a plateau and with a clinically meaningful improvement in cardiometabolic parameters, including hemoglobin A1c.\nMariTide is safe, very well tolerated at target doses. We've significantly improved GI tolerability with dose escalation without compromising weight loss efficacy. The Phase III program is underway, well informed by prior data and utilizing a refined 3-step dose escalation approach to optimize tolerability. Enrollment momentum for chronic weight management is strong across multiple geographies, reflecting broad investigator enthusiasm, participate interest in these trials and significant remaining unmet need.\nSince June, we initiated 2 additional Phase III studies. The first, [ MariTide CV ] evaluates cardiovascular outcomes in adults living with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and obesity or overweight. The second, MariTide HF, evaluates reduction of heart failure events and cardiovascular risk in adults living with heart failure with a preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction and obesity.\nIn summary, MariTide represents a promising treatment advance for people living with obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. With 4 Phase III studies underway and obstructive sleep apnea set to initiate this year, we are well positioned to deliver a robust and comprehensive clinical knowledge base.\nBeyond MariTide, in General Medicine, we remain excited about data from the Repatha VESALIUS Phase III primary prevention study expected later this year. Turning to olpasiran, our promising best-in-class small interfering RNA medicine targeting LP(a), the fully enrolled event-driven OCEAN(a) Phase III cardiovascular outcome study continues to mature. This medicine and study reflects our precision missing approach to cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with elevated Lp(a) levels.\nMoving on to our rare disease portfolio. In UPLIZNA, we look forward to the upcoming December 14 PDUFA date for generalized myasthenia gravis, recognizing ever more, the significant unmet need for durable, convenient therapies consistently highlighted to us by treating physicians. We are pleased by the European Commission's approval of TEPEZZA for the treatment of adults with thyroid eye disease. Additionally, enrollment is complete in our Phase III study examining subcutaneous administration of teprotumumab, representing another step forward towards improved patient convenience and treatment accessibility.\nIn inflammation, our 2 Phase III studies of TEZSPIRE in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease continue to enroll patients with moderate to very severe COPD with blood eosinophil counts greater or equal to 150 cells per microliter. Beyond COPD, enrollment was recently completed in our Phase III eosinophilic esophagitis study, and we look forward to the October 19 PDUFA date for TEZSPIRE in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.\nMoving to oncology. In June, interim results from the global Phase III DeLLphi-304 trial of IMDELLTRA, the first and only FDA-approved delta-like ligand 3 or DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule, were presented and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These compelling data showed IMDELLTRA significantly reduced the risk of death by 40% and significantly extended median overall survival by more than 5 months compared to standard of care chemotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer who progressed on or after 1 line of platinum-based therapy. Additionally, IMDELLTRA significantly improved patient reported outcomes of [ dysmea and cough ] and was numerically better tolerated on numerous parameters when compared to standard of care chemotherapy. Regulatory filings are underway.\nTogether with the remarkable DeLLphi-301 data already reported, as Murdo highlighted, IMDELLTRA has the potential to become the new standard of care for second-line small cell lung cancer. We continue to investigate IMDELLTRA in earlier lines of small cell lung cancer. Currently, 3 additional Phase III studies are underway across limited stage and extensive stage disease, along with Phase I studies evaluating IMDELLTRA in combination with novel agents to potentially further improve patient outcomes.\nWe are also focused on enhancing patient convenience by evaluating less frequent dosing and subcutaneous delivery. We continue to investigate our CD19 directed BiTE medicine, BLINCYTO, in earlier treatment settings, while also advancing a subcutaneous formulation. In June, Phase Ib and II subcutaneous blinatumomab data were presented and simultaneously published in the [ Lancet Hematology ], demonstrating 89% to 92% remission rates and manageable safety in adults with relapsed/refractory CD19-positive [ Philadelphia ] chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Subcutaneous blinatumomab has the potential to improve both the patient experience and efficacy, and we remain on track to initiate a potentially registration-enabling study in both adults and adolescents later this year.\nOur first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific T cell engager xaluritamig is advancing in Phase III clinical development. We are also exploring xaluritamig in combination therapy and in earlier stages of prostate cancer with multiple Phase Ib studies ongoing. Collectively, IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO and xaluritamig exemplify the significant growth potential of our robust bispecific T-cell engager platform and reinforce our commitment to bringing groundbreaking treatments to cancer patients worldwide.\nBeyond our T cell engagers, in June, we announced data from the Phase III FORTUNE-101 study of first-line bemarituzumab, our first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody. Bemarituzumab plus mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy met its primary endpoint of overall survival at a prespecified interim analysis in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic, FGFR2b positive HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.\nIn closing, I want to extend my gratitude to our colleagues for their dedication to achieving these critical milestones and their unwavering focus on improving outcomes for patients facing serious diseases. I'll now turn it over to Peter.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance and remain on track with our 2025 full year goals and long-term objectives. The financial results are shown on Slides 31 and 32 of the slide deck.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered revenues of $9.2 billion, reflecting our key growth drivers highlighted on our Q4 earnings call. Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE in our innovative oncology, rare disease and biosimilar portfolios. Our non-GAAP operating expenses rose 8%, led by a non-GAAP R&D growth of 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in our late-stage pipeline, including MariTide, olpasiran, IMDELLTRA, xaluritamig and rare disease.\nOur non-GAAP OI&E was favorable $213 million year-over-year, driven by gains from early retirement of debt and lower interest expense. Recall, we retired $4.5 billion of debt in 2024 and have retired $4.3 billion in the first half of 2025.\nOur non-GAAP tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points year-over-year to 14.2%, primarily due to the change in earnings mix. The company generated $1.9 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, reflecting operational momentum across the business while continuing to invest in innovation. We invested $1.7 billion in non-GAAP R&D spend, an increase of 18% year-over-year, and expect to build on this momentum in the second half of the year with increased investment in our innovative late-stage pipeline.\nWe are accelerating innovation and productivity through AI investments across the value chain, from discovery to development to commercial execution and in G&A. This is enabled by digitized workflows, modernized data infrastructure and global access to advanced generative AI tools. For 2025, we continue to expect capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to expand network capacity for our products across the portfolio and our innovative pipeline, including MariTide. In addition, we returned capital to shareholders through competitive dividend payments of $2.38 per share, representing a 6% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024.\nTurning to the outlook for the business for 2025 on Slide 33. We expect our 2025 total revenues in the range of $35.0 billion to $36.0 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $20.20 and $21.30. This guidance includes the estimated impact of implemented tariffs. It does not account for tariffs or pricing actions announced or described but not implemented.\nIn addition, let me highlight a few updates to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We now expect full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 45%. Our outlook now includes several business development transactions, resulting in roughly $200 million of incremental R&D expense expected in Q3. The outlook continues to reflect our investments in advancing key late-stage programs, including MariTide, olpasiran and IMDELLTRA and leveraging technological advancements, including artificial intelligence. Our operating margin outlook also includes incremental launch and commercial investments, starting in the third quarter.\nIn line with these priorities and reflecting the business development transactions of roughly $200 million, we now expect non-GAAP R&D expense to grow over 20% in 2025. We now anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be approximately $2.2 billion in 2025. For WEZLANA and AMGEVITA sales in the United States, we continue to expect quarterly sales to fluctuate and do not expect any sales in the third quarter.\nAnd let me remind you of prior items that have not changed. For the full year, we continue to expect other revenue to be approximately $1.4 billion. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.5% to 16.0%. We expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2025.\nWe are focused on delivering sustained long-term value for patients and shareholders by doing what we said we would do, growing leadership in the United States and internationally, driving innovation in areas of high unmet medical need and maintaining rigorous financial discipline. We continue to focus on execution excellence across the enterprise and remain well positioned for sustained growth through the long term. I'm grateful to work with all of our colleagues worldwide in serving patients.\nThis concludes our financial update. I'll now hand it back to Bob for our Q&A session.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nJulianne, could you now open the call for questions and just remind our callers of the procedure for submitting their question to us. Thanks.",

    "content": "Q1 2025 Amgen Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2025 Amgen Inc Earnings Call\n\nAMGNNASDAQMAY 1, 4:30 PM\n\nOperator\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to our Q1 2025 Earnings Call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Jay Bradner, and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a strong start in 2025, and this was an exciting Q1 with strong volume growth across the enterprise, important new product launches, and positive phase III data. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Volume grew 14%, reflecting growing patient demand for our innovative medicines. 14 of our medicines delivered double-digit sales growth spanning general medicine, rare disease, inflammation, and oncology.\nOur industry-leading biosimilars portfolio added to this performance, delivering more than $700 million in revenue this quarter, which was up 35% year-over-year. Beyond the strong financials, this quarter demonstrated the breadth and depth of our portfolio and the strength of our execution. We delivered multiple positive phase III readouts, initiated four new phase III studies, and launched three new products or indications. With that, let me turn to some of the key drivers of our momentum. Starting in general medicine, we're addressing large underserved patient populations with multiple products which have significant room for growth. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally.\nRepatha, now a multibillion-dollar product, continues to grow as access improves for patients. We're also advancing the Olpasiran clinical program which addresses an important residual risk factor in heart disease. It's currently being evaluated in a large phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial. In bone health, Amgen is the global leader, and we expect continued long-term growth in this area. EVENITY, which is the only bone builder which also slows bone loss, reduces fracture risk for millions of postmenopausal women. We're rapidly advancing MariTide, having initiated the first chronic weight management phase III studies of our clinical program in obesity and obesity-related conditions.\nTurning to rare disease, our four key growth drivers, TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA, and TAVNEOS are all early in their life cycles and well positioned for long-term growth. UPLIZNA is a differentiated B-cell depleting therapy. It's the leading biologic for the treatment of NMOSD and recently launched as the first and only FDA approved treatment for IgG4-related disease, which is a serious and underserved autoimmune condition. We're encouraged by the positive reception from patients and physicians in the early stage of the launch. We've also filed phase III data for UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis with the FDA, and we're exploring its potential across additional B-cell mediated diseases. In inflammation we remain focused on difficult to treat diseases where the need for innovation is the highest.\nTEZSPIRE is a first-in-class therapy that targets TSLP, a differentiated mechanism with broad potential across a number of diseases. In severe asthma, it continues to build strong momentum with high prescriber confidence. We've also delivered compelling phase III data in rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and most recently initiated two pivotal phase III studies in COPD, the world's third leading cause of death. In oncology, our leading bispecific T cell engager platform continues to develop new standards of care. BLINCYTO has moved into frontline treatment and continues to grow. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for Bemarituzumab for subcutaneous treatment of B-ALL, which Jay will speak to shortly.\nIMDELLTRA provided an overwhelming survival benefit at an interim analysis in a phase III study in second-line small cell lung cancer beating chemotherapy as a standard of care. These data represent a meaningful milestone for patients and will be presented at ASCO in June. Xaluritamig is enrolling well in our phase III study in advanced prostate cancer patients. Next, our industry-leading biosimilars portfolio continues to contribute meaningfully to our long-term growth. We have a proven approach in this area being in the first wave of launches and ensure a safe and reliable supply. We're seeing that formula deliver again this quarter with our next wave of US launches underway including PAVBLU, WEZLANA, and BKEMV.\nI recognize there's a lot of uncertainty at the moment related to tariffs and taxes. Given the long lifecycle of our business, clarity on these issues is important to us, and I'm sure it's important to all of you as well. While it's premature to speculate what the outcomes of tariff and taxes might be for our business, I would remind you that we've proven our ability to adapt and we've demonstrated the operating agility necessary to navigate change and deliver long term growth. With respect to manufacturing, I want to point out that following the 2017 tax reform, we invested nearly $5 billion in US capital projects as measured through 2024 and in addition we've recently announced nearly $2 billion expansions in the states of Ohio and North Carolina. We're actively engaged on policy matters and we remain focused on meeting the growing demand for our medicines. To the extent that changes in taxes or tariffs require us to adapt, we'll do so accordingly. Let's go back to where I started.\nThis was an exciting quarter, not just because of the financial results, but because of what those results signal about our future. In-line brands are delivering. We're advancing positive phase III studies, we're launching new products, we're earning breakthrough designations, and we're initiating the next wave of late-stage programs. We're operating in a volatile environment, but what hasn't changed is the growing patient demand for our medicines and the unwavering focus of our people. Amgen is well positioned to deliver innovation and growth not just this year, but for the long term. I want to thank our nearly 28,000 colleagues around the world for their dedication to our mission serving patients.\nWith that, I'll turn over to Murdo for a commercial update.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThanks, Bob. We've entered 2025 with strong momentum driven by strategic focus, disciplined execution, and an unwavering commitment to the patients we serve. In the Q1, global product sales grew 11% year-over-year. In the US, our largest region, product sales grew 14%. Globally, 14 products deliver double-digit or better growth, underscoring the breadth and depth of our portfolio and ability to deliver consistently and at scale. Turning to general medicine, Repatha sales increased 27% year-over-year, delivering $656 million in sales in the Q1.\nRepatha is a brand built on deep clinical conviction. We're making meaningful improvements in access, helping more patients benefit from Repatha. With 100 million patients globally in need of effective LDL cholesterol lowering, we see significant opportunity ahead to further broaden our impact and deliver long-term growth. In the US, Repatha sales grew 26% in the Q1, with volume up 42%. This growth reflects steady expansion in the base of primary care prescribers and enhanced depth of prescribing among cardiac cardiologists. We're driving increased patient activation through direct to consumer efforts, leading more patients living with cardiovascular disease to ask their physicians about Repatha.\nAccess in the US has never been stronger with many payers eliminating prior authorization requirements, making Repatha more accessible and affordable for patients. Outside the US, Repatha continues to deliver strong growth across major markets, demonstrating sustained leadership amidst rising competition in the segment. EVENITY sales increased 29% year-over-year to $442 million in the Q1. EVENITY is the only therapy that builds new bone and slows bone loss, uniquely positioning it to help reduce fracture risk in women who are postmenopausal. Despite this clear clinical value, fewer than 250,000 patients in the US have been treated to date, while millions remain at risk. Today, more than 90% of very high risk patients are not receiving appropriate therapy, and that's a significant gap, and a meaningful opportunity to drive growth by ensuring more patients receive the protection they deserve from EVENITY.\nIn the US, EVENITY delivered 36% sales growth in Q1, and we focused our US bone field force on EVENITY and increased investment in brand awareness. These efforts are driving meaningful growth in prescription volume across established and newly activated prescriber accounts. Prolia sales grew 10% year -over-year in Q1, with 13% volume growth, reaching almost $1.1 billion in sales. I'll move to our rare disease portfolio, which grew 3% year-over-year, delivering $1 billion in sales in the quarter. I would note that within this portfolio, sales of Repatha and KRYSTEXXA were adversely impacted in the quarter by changes to US wholesaler inventory levels. We do not expect similar reductions in inventory levels for the remainder of the year.\nSince launch, TEPEZZA has had a positive impact for thousands of patients living with thyroid eye disease. In the US, there are roughly 100,000 patients suffering from TED who could benefit from TEPEZZA and to reach them we've intensified our efforts to engage a broad prescriber base of oculoplastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, and endocrinologists. We're encouraged by the feedback that we're receiving from the medical community, including an increase in intent to prescribe reported by endocrinologists during Q1. Access has also improved for patients with more than 85% of medical plans, removing clinical activity score requirements. We're advancing our international expansion of TEPEZZA in Japan. TEPEZZA is now the first and only approved therapy for active thyroid disease, and in the first full quarter since launch we've seen strong uptake and positive physician engagement.\nIn the European Union, we're preparing to launch following the recent positive opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on the approval of TEPEZZA for the treatment of moderate to severe thyroid eye disease in adults. This marks a significant step forward for patients living with TED who currently have no approved disease modifying therapies available to them in Europe. UPLIZNA sales increased 14% year-over-year to $91 million in Q1, driven by continued growth in treating patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. In April, UPLIZNA was the first approved breakthrough therapy in the US for the treatment of adults with immunoglobulin G4 related disease, or IgG4, a chronic and debilitating immune mediated inflammatory condition that can affect multiple organs. The launch is underway, and the first patient with IgG4 disease was treated shortly after approval. Amgen's many years of experience with rheumatologists have been helpful in establishing urgency to diagnose and treat patients suffering from IgG4-related disease with the plasma.\nIn inflammation, TEZSPIRE delivered another strong quarter, up 65% year-over-year. Adoption among pulmonologists is growing, driven by TEZSPIRE's unique profile to treat patients with multiple triggers and drivers of uncontrolled asthma. We see significant growth opportunity for TEZSPIRE to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide who suffer from this challenging disease. Our innovative oncology portfolio including BLINCYTO, IMDELLTRA, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, and XGEVA, grew 10% year-over-year, generating over $2 billion in sales in the quarter. At the core of this growth is our industry-leading Bispecific T cell Engager platform which developed both BLINCYTO and IMDELLTRA. With these products we're not only addressing critical unmet needs in oncology, we're helping to redefine the standard of care in difficult to treat cancers, creating meaningful opportunities to reach more patients and drive long-term growth.\nBLINCYTO sales were $370 million in the quarter with year-over-year growth of 52% driven by broad prescribing across both academic and community segments. We see strong conviction in BLINCYTO as the standard of care for both adults and pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative B-cell ALL. Our US launch of IMDELLTRA for the treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer who are progressing on or or after chemotherapy continues its strong momentum, generating $81 million in sales in the Q1. To date, IMDELLTRA has been administered in patients in academic cancer centers, regional cancer hospitals, and community oncology clinics, indicating broad adoption and comfort with this important new cancer therapy. In April, we expanded our global reach with the launch of IMDELLTRA in Japan, marking an important step forward in our commitment to bringing innovative oncology therapies to patients around the world. Momentum behind IMDELLTRA is being reinforced by compelling new data.\nWe recently announced new clinical data demonstrating that IMDELLTRA met the primary endpoint of superior overall survival in small cell lung cancer compared to standard of care chemotherapy. This is a meaningful confirmation of IMDELLTRA's efficacy for patients facing one of the most aggressive and difficult to treat cancers, and our field teams are acting with urgency in their educational efforts with the medical community. Biosimilar portfolio sales were $735 million in Q1, representing an increase of 35% year-over year. Sales of PAVBLU, the biosimilar to Eylea, reached $99 million in Q1. Retina specialists are responding very positively to PAVBLU, expressing appreciation for this high-quality Amgen biosimilar delivered in an easy-to-use pre-filled syringe. Importantly, on 1 April, PAVBLU received its permanent reimbursement Q-code, which will facilitate easier access for patients.\nWe're also pleased with the successful US launches of WEZLANA, a biosimilar to Stelara, and BKEMV, a biosimilar to Soliris. Both launches have been received well by our patient and prescriber communities. We expect these recent launches will further enhance the robust growth and attractive returns from our biosimilar portfolio. 2025 is off to a strong start with double-digit growth across our broad and deep portfolio. Looking ahead, we see significant growth potential powered by disciplined execution, a high performing team, and above all a clear and unwavering commitment to the patients we serve. I'll now hand it over to Jay.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThank you, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. The Q1 has been exceptionally productive for R&D, extending our track record of high quality, on-time execution, and highlighted by significant clinical and regulatory achievements. Most notably, we received FDA approval for UPLIZNA, an IgG4-related disease, the second approval in a series of B-cell-mediated diseases we are studying with this medicine. We also announced positive data from phase III studies of Rocatinlumab, UPLIZNA, and IMDELLTRA while initiating multiple phase III trials of MariTide and TEZSPIRE. Let's begin with MariTide, our investigational therapy for obesity and obesity-related conditions that features a unique and differentiated profile. In March, we initiated two phase III studies in chronic weight management as part of our comprehensive MariTide phase III program.\nThese trials will evaluate MariTide in two distinct populations, adults living with obesity or overweight without type 2 diabetes, and adults with obesity or overweight with type 2 diabetes. Both studies will assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of three target dose levels of MariTide preceded by an optimized dose escalation regimen to improve the patient experience. The primary endpoint for each study is the change from baseline body weight at 72 weeks. Beyond these first two studies, we anticipate initiating additional MariTide phase III studies later this year evaluating MariTide in specific obesity-related conditions. Last November we presented top line results at 52 weeks from our phase II chronic weight management study which highlighted MariTide's monthly or less frequent dosing, consistent, predictable, and sustained weight loss across all doses without a weight loss plateau through 52 weeks and MariTide's clinically meaningful impact on cardiometabolic parameters including hemoglobin A1c. At the American Diabetes Association or ADA annual meeting this June, the underlying details from this phase II study at 52 weeks will be presented.\nClear from these data is the important finding that dose escalation, which was studied in two of the treatment arms, meaningfully improves tolerability in particular rates of nausea and vomiting as compared with fixed dose administration which was used in the other seven treatment arms. This finding is consistent with the clinical experience to date with GLP-1 based therapies and was further supported by our phase I pharmacokinetic study that tested even lower starting doses of MariTide. Details from this study will also be discussed at ADA. These learnings have informed the design of our two phase III studies of MariTide for chronic weight management, which are open and enrolling robustly. Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, we expect key data for MariTide, including both the ongoing phase II type 2 diabetes study, which has completed enrollment, as well as end of treatment period data from part TWO of the ongoing phase II Chronic Weight Management study. MariTide represents a promising treatment advance for people living with obesity and related conditions, especially given its monthly or less frequent dosing, predictable and sustained weight loss, and clinically meaningful impact on cardiometabolic parameters.\nWe are committed to fully realizing its therapeutic potential. Beyond MariTide in general medicine, we look forward to data from the Repatha VESALIUS phase III primary prevention study in the second half of this year. Given the profound and sustained benefit of Repatha in the secondary prevention setting, we're optimistic about these data and the potential opportunity to reach additional patients at high risk of a first cardiovascular event. Turning to Olpasiran, our promising best in class small interfering RNA medicine targeting LDL, we are bringing a precision medicine approach to cardiovascular risk reduction for the many patients with Lp(a) elevation. The fully enrolled OCEAN(a) phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of Olpasiran, continues to progress. Moving on to our rare disease portfolio, we are very excited about UPLIZNA's expanding potential to improve the lives of those facing rare inflammatory conditions.\nIn April, the FDA approved UPLIZNA as the first and only treatment for adults living with immunoglobulin G4 related disease, delivering durable disease control in this recently described chronic and debilitating immune mediated inflammatory condition that often affects multiple organ systems. UPLIZNA is an innovative biologic that targets CD19 positive B-cells and addresses a core driver of IgG4-related disease, significantly reducing disease flares and dependence on harmful long term steroid treatment. Additionally, we recently presented compelling 52-week data from our pivotal phase III MINT study evaluating a UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis. These results demonstrated durable and sustained efficacy of UPLIZNA in patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody positive generalized myasthenia gravis with only two doses a year following an initial loading dose. The 52-week mITT results highlight a UPLIZNA's promise as a new standard of care in generalized myasthenia gravis, offering durable and sustained symptom relief with a simplified treatment regimen while minimizing steroid use. Since the publication of these data, we have met with numerous opinion leaders who are also enthusiastic about a UPLIZNA's profile highlighting the unique mechanism of action, patient-centered every six-month dosing schedule, and durable sustained efficacy.\nWe are also pleased to announce that the FDA has accepted the regulatory submission of the UPLIZNA MINT phase III generalized myasthenia gravis data with a PDUFA date of 14 December 2025. The recent FDA approval in IgG4-related disease and the strong clinical evidence in myasthenia gravis underscore Amgen's ongoing leadership in developing innovative treatments targeting CD19 positive B-cells in cancer, inflammation, and in rare disease more generally, where only 5% of the estimated 10,000 rare diseases have available treatments. In inflammation, we and our partner AstraZeneca have initiated two phase III studies of TEZSPIRE in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease targeting patients with moderate to very severe COPD with blood eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 150 cells per microliter. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death, and we're excited about the impact TEZSPIRE could have in this setting. Beyond COPD, we completed the regulatory submission of TEZSPIRE's phase III data for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and look forward to a PDUFA date of 19 October 2025. In March, we announced data from three additional phase III studies from the Rocatinlimab ROCKET Program in atopic dermatitis, notably IGNITE, which met its primary and key secondary endpoints. We look forward to additional data from the ROCKET Program in H2 2025.\nIn oncology, we recently announced compelling results from IMDELLTRA from our DeLLphi-304 phase III trial, where at a planned interim analysis, the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit. DeLLphi-304 evaluated IMDELLTRA in patients with small cell lung cancer who progressed on or after initial platinum-based chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. These randomized data are the first to show a substantial survival improvement head-to-head against standard-of-care chemotherapy, offering new hope for patients with this difficult disease. Together with the remarkable DeLLphi-304 data already reported, IMDELLTRA has the potential to become the new standard of care for second-line small cell lung cancer. As an oncologist, I'm really encouraged by IMDELLTRA as a new and highly efficacious therapy for an aggressive and common solid tumor for which there has been very little progress. We look forward to sharing more detailed results at the upcoming ASCO meeting in early June.\nIn addition to DeLLphi-304, we continue to investigate IMDELLTRA in earlier lines of small cell lung cancer. Currently, two phase III studies are underway, and we are pleased to announce plans to initiate DeLLphi-312, a phase III trial evaluating IMDELLTRA as induction and maintenance therapy in first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer here in combination with carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalimab. We also continue to investigate our CD19-directed BiTE medicine BLINCYTO in earlier treatment settings while also advancing a subcutaneous formulation of blinatumomab. In April, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for subcutaneous blinatumomab in the treatment of adults with relapsed refractory CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on our experience to date, subcutaneous blinatumomab has the potential to improve both the patient experience efficacy. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific T-cell engager xaluritamig is advancing in phase III clinical development where we are rapidly enrolling patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer who progressed following taxane-based therapy.\nWe are also exploring xaluritamig combination therapy and in earlier stages of prostate cancer with multiple phase 1b studies ongoing. Collectively, IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO, and xaluritamig exemplify the significant growth potential of our robust bispecific T-cell engager platform and reinforce our commitment to bringing groundbreaking treatments to cancer patients worldwide. Beyond our T-cell engagers, our first in class fibroblast growth factor receptor 2B directed monoclonal antibody Bemarituzumab is advancing to frontline gastric cancer therapy. We expect data this quarter from FORTITUDE-101, a phase III study of Bemarituzumab combined with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. In the second half of 2025, we expect data from FORTITUDE-102, a phase III study of Bemarituzumab combined with chemotherapy and nivolumab versus chemotherapy and nivolumab alone. On biosimilars, we are rapidly advancing three phase III programs evaluating our biosimilars to OPDIVO, KEYTRUDA, and OCREVUS as the next wave of Amgen biosimilar products.\nIn closing, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for delivering on a number of important milestones so far this year and for their relentless focus on the patients we serve. I'll now turn it over to Peter.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nThank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong Q1 performance and are on track with our 2025 full year goals and long term objectives. The financial results are shown on slides 29 to 30 of the slide deck. In the Q1 we delivered revenues of $8.1 billion and 9% increase year-over year. This reflects double digit sales growth of 11% driven by 14% volume growth from key brands including Repatha, BLINCYTO, TEZSPIRE, and EVENITY, partially offset by 6% lower net selling price. Our non-GAAP operating expenses rose 4% led by non-GAAP R&D growth of 12% year-over-year reflecting continued investment in our late stage pipeline including MariTide, Olpasiran, and rare disease. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 45.7%.\nThis is above the outlook we gave on the Q4 Earnings Call, in part due to the timing of R&D spending now expected primarily in the Q2, including milestone payments and other investments. The Horizon integration has progressed well, and we expect to reach the previously announced $500 million in pre-tax cost synergies by the end of this year. Our non-GAAP OI was down $53 million year-over-year driven by lower interest expense through retirement of debt, including $4.5 billion in 2024 and $2.9 billion in the Q1 of 2025. In addition, we repaid $1 billion today as we continue to progress the strengthening of our balance sheet. Since the announcement of the Horizon acquisition, we have now retired $10.8 billion of debt. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 0.8 percentage points year-over-year.\nPrimarily due to the change in earnings mix. The company generated $1.0 billion in free cash flow in Q1, reflecting continued investment in growth and operational momentum across the business. We spent $400 million in Q1 on capital expenditures driven by investments across our manufacturing sites including Ohio, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico. For 2025, we expect no change in our capital expenditures outlook of $2.3 billion, which will support our products across the portfolio and our innovative pipeline including MariTide. Our commitment to innovation is also evident as we deploy artificial intelligence across the value chain, informing molecule design and discovery research, enabling faster trial enrollment and streamlining regulatory filings in clinical development, and enhancing our responsiveness to customers in commercial operations. In addition, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividends of $2.38 per share representing a 6% increase compared to Q1 2024.\nLet's turn to the outlook for the business for 2025 on slide 31. We are reaffirming our 2025 total revenue guidance in the range of $34.3 to 35.7 billion and also reaffirming our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance between $20 and $21.20. This guidance includes the estimated impact of implemented tariffs but does not account for any tariffs that could be implemented in the future, including potential sector specific tariffs. In addition, let me highlight a few updates to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expense to grow approximately 20% in 2025 versus growing mid-teens previously, reflecting increased investments to advance key late-stage pipeline assets including MariTide and Olpasiran. We now anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2025.\nWe now expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.5% to 16%. For WEZLANA in the United States, we now expect quarterly sales to fluctuate and do not expect any sales in Q2 following a large sales order in Q1. Let me remind you of prior items that have not changed to our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect other revenue to be approximately $1.4 billion. We continue to project that full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 46%. We expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2025.\nWe continue to expect 2025 free cash flow performance to be roughly comparable to 2023. As mentioned on our Q4 Earnings Call, this decline is primarily driven by 2024 working capital favorability and incremental capital expenditures. Free cash flow in the Q2 will be impacted by the shift in 2024 tax payments to Q2 2025 and the final $1.8 billion repatriation tax payment. I know there's a lot of interest in taxes and tariffs. We understand the impetus for increasing US investment in manufacturing. Amgen has a robust manufacturing presence in the United States, including Puerto Rico, and, of course, has invested for decades in United States-based research and development to build on the manufacturing base in the US.\nWe agree with our peers that the most effective answer is not tariffs, but tax policy. In fact, for Amgen and others, investment in manufacturing has significantly increased since President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In part based on the expectation of continued pro-growth tax policy, we recently announced, among other investments in the United States, that we are more than doubling down on our investments in manufacturing capacity in North Carolina and Ohio. We are focused on delivering sustained long-term value for patients and shareholders by doing what we said we would do, growing leadership in the United States and internationally, driving innovation in areas of high unmet medical need, and maintaining rigorous financial discipline. We continue to focus on execution excellence across the enterprise and remain well positioned for sustained growth through the long term. I'm grateful to work with all of our colleagues worldwide in serving patients.\nThis concludes our financial update. I'll hand it back to Bob for our Q&A session.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nRemind our callers please of the procedure for asking questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press star followed by one. Again. To ask a question, press star one. Our first question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on all the progress. You know, I was just wondering, Jay, if you could help frame for us what we should be looking for at ADA with respect to MariTide. I know this is going to be the first detailed presentation of the phase II data. But what do you think kind of the key message, and key learnings coming out from that will be? And then the kind of related question is, I know there's a lot of focus on the potential CVOT trial that you guys are likely planning to conduct with MariTide in the design.\nSo just wondering if you'd comment at all on the potential control arm there. Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Terence, for the question. Really looking forward to the ADA. You know, we've already shared the salient data from the phase II chronic weight management study, weight loss and excellent tolerability at 52 weeks, or what we call part one on that trial, as well as data from a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetic study. The key insights remain unchanged. Strong efficacy, no plateau to 52 weeks. monthly MariTide, very well tolerated at the target dose, that the dose escalation works and comes without any compromise to weight loss.\nAlso, strong activity on cardiometabolic parameters, including A1c. So the ADA will focus on these insights as well as some underlying details of the two trials. It'll feature some new mechanistic data, including some recently published data in Nature Metabolism that serves to really validate the mechanism of action, the dual mechanism of action of MariTide. We're looking forward to sharing these details at ADA, hearing from the presenters who are true leaders in the field. Following the session, we intend to have an IR call after the event to take questions, reflect on the results through 52 weeks. Here at Amgen, we're on to phase III.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOn the CVOT.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nOh, yes, and on the CVOT study, we won't share any details today regarding the CVOT study, but with our two phase III chronic weight management programs now open and enrolling, we are working to initiate a broad phase III program that includes ASCVD, heart failure studies, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and other indications of interest. Well, we'll have more to share in the fullness of time about the details of these trials.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, thanks, Julieann. Let's go to the next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nLead Analyst of the U.S. Biotechnology Sector, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to UPLIZNA in IgG4, given the recent approval, as well as myasthenia gravis, could you just help us understand the commercial strategy, including the relevant prescribers and patient identification efforts for the former? Thank you.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYep. Salveen, it's Murdo, thanks for the question On UPLIZNA. We're obviously quite excited about the opportunity to be the first approved therapy for IgG4. It's a condition that is primarily diagnosed, and I should say recently there's been the evolution of a diagnostic code which really only was introduced in October of 2023. So it's been a relatively recent phenomenon to actually have formal diagnostic criteria and a code for this disease, but primarily diagnosed and managed by rheumatologists. You do see on occasion gastroenterologists, sometimes neurologists.\nJust given the way in which the disease might manifest and the organ involvement, obviously because of Amgen's very long history dealing with inflammation and autoimmune diseases, we've got very good presence here with the key customer types and key prescribers. We have had a field force deployed for several months now, profiling and engaging with the relevant physician community. So we're hitting the ground running, so to speak with the approval, the epidemiology here is roughly 20,000 patients in the US, and we're excited to have an impact. This is a horrible disease. People really do not fare well when this flares. And UPLIZNA is a highly effective product.\nAs part of the clinical data generated thus far. And then on gMG, we're really thrilled with the opportunity to go into a competitive category with a very different mechanism than the drugs that are available today. Again, this is a therapeutic area where we have an installed presence with the key prescribing community. So optimistic that when we secure approval for this indication that we'll be thrilled. I don't know. Jay, would you want to add anything on gMG?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, and I mean reflecting also on IgG4, you know, we think a lot about how will this fit into the standards of care in both diseases. IgG4-related disease has no standard of care. These are patients with chronic inflammatory painful protean symptoms, recurrent flares, and you know, we saw an 87% reduction in disease specific flare activity. So this hopefully becomes a powerful new standard of care. Then in gMG this medicine stacks up really well to what physicians and patients have access to today. We had a chance to share back in April, and it was also simultaneously published in the New England Journal.\nThe really strong data from the phase III MINT trial, and we put up just outstanding efficacy data against the myasthenia gravis activity of daily living score. We showed activity in both important subpopulations of patients, acetylcholine receptor positive, and MuSK+, and this medicine provides a durable benefit to patients. It's given every six months, I think, which really suits the lifestyle of people who will then feel hopefully very healthy, and it's quite convenient for them to receive. But most importantly, it targets the core biology. This is a disease caused by pathologic autoantibodies. And here we are targeting the cell that elaborates those antibodies.\nSo we feel very hopeful that UPLIZNA will be an important new standard of care in generalized myasthenia gravis.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julian, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Great. Good afternoon. Maybe for Jay. I often hear about two narratives on the obesity program. One is the tolerability remains high, and I know you've gone to a lower titration, so I'm curious about your confidence that we will see very competitive tolerability and very strong efficacy, and that that narrative will hold up. And secondly, that there's a competitor out there who's now put up oral data which apparently is going to have a huge market share.\nAnd so you don't have an oral. Maybe you could respond to either of those and how you're going to be competitive against these developments that have played out. Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, Mike, thanks. Why don't I start on tolerability and then, Murdo, ask you if you wouldn't mind, to weigh in on the development of oral medicines and their importance. Mike, we feel very confident. I feel very confident about the tolerability and efficacy that we stand to observe in the phase III clinical study. It is very well informed by the strong efficacy that we saw in phase II, part one, the 52-week data where we observed across the range of doses significant benefit to patients with measurable weight loss as high as 20%. The tolerability.\nWe learned, as have others in the field, that GLP-1-based mechanisms of action benefit from dose escalation, benefit from lower starting doses. We confirmed these insights in a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study. We've taken the directionality of those two trials into the design of phase III, which when we can share this with you. will surely underscore that the design is constructed to deliver competitive both efficacy and tolerability in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Murdo, about orals?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYes, thanks, Mike. We have obviously accounted for a segment of the market to be an oral market. We do anticipate, given the size of the obesity category, a relevant opportunity for orals to come in. Thus far, of course, we haven't seen necessarily the same degree of weight loss being achievable with orals as we've seen with MariTide. And of course, MariTide really, given its monthly or even less frequent dosing, we think will be less vulnerable to orals, which are certainly going to come in and displace some of the weekly GLP-1s that are incumbent in the market today. I would also just say that we are pursuing other products in our early pipeline that are both large molecule, small molecule, oral, and self-administered incretin and non-incretin.\nSo we really are looking at oral and non-oral mechanisms ourselves.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nAll right Julianne, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Trung Nguyen from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTrung Nguyen\n\nProgram Manager, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question. Just on Repatha, which has been doing well for a number of quarters now, in our recent doc checks, some have pointed to an increasing preference for Novartis' LEQVIO because of the buy and bill program for that drug. Do you see increasing commercial competition from LEQVIO in general? And going forward, there is going to be some late stage data or oral PCSK9 this year. What's your thoughts about the entry of those products?\nThanks.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYes, thanks for the question and thanks for noticing the growth in REPA and the trajectory that we're on. The short answer to your question is yes, there's competition in the market and yes, LEQVIO is definitely treating patients both in the US and in some other markets around the world. I would say though that we still believe we have the best profile in the PCSK9 category, given the ability to profoundly lower LDL cholesterol, the fact that we've generated cardiovascular event reduction, we have ongoing additional clinical trials to further expand the understanding of how Repatha, when added to conventional therapy, can actually further reduce cardiovascular risk in a primary prevention high risk population. So we do think that the class here is so under penetrated in terms of the millions, tens of millions, quite frankly, of patients who are at risk that really there is room for competition.\nAnd the fact that we have the momentum that we have despite the growth of some of the other products in the category should tell you that we continue to find ways to help new patients receive the Repatha therapy that they should. The last piece of this, of course, is we have done a lot of work as Amgen to open up access and affordability for patients, and so we now have commercial insured patients in the US, 50% of which have no prior authorization requirement to receive approval for their therapy. They're really the barriers that once we're there in obtaining Repatha have largely dissipated. We're growing nicely. We continue to promote the primary care. We've invested in direct to consumer advertising now, and we expect a strong growth trajectory to come.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julian, let's take the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Trung. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. So with the Q-code in place, can you help us think about the near term uptake of tableau in the field? And are you seeing any pronounced shift to the biosimilar following the defunding of the patient's assistance charities?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThanks for the question, Evan. We're obviously pleased with our biosimilar portfolio in general. We had a strong quarter there. Pablo has been well received by the retina specialist community. They like the high-quality biosimilar. They really like our prefilled syringe device that we launched.\nWe expect to continue to be able to help many patients and serve many patients with this product. We're working on contracting with larger retina specialist groups, and we'll have more to say as the year progresses. Amgen is happy to support patients through the charitable donations that we make to various agencies.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nAll right, let's go to the next question, please. Julia.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the question. Just a question on the Enbrel payer environment. I think we've seen some concern in the market today about more aggressive payer behavior with the CVS Wegovy announcement. I'm just interested in how you're thinking about these payer dynamics, potential new entrants in that space over time. Thank you.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYes, thanks for the question, Chris. Look, our focus in any payer environment, and it will be with obesity categories, to help make our products as available as possible to a large segment of the population. I think we're still all understanding what happened with the recent decision. I believe you'll be referring to the CVS change that was announced. I do think overall, PBMs and manufacturers alike are trying to make sure that more patients have access to reimbursement for obesity medicines, and we look forward to being able to do that when we enter the market.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julianne. We'll go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nYaron Werber\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotechnology Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. I have two interrelated questions about MariTide. Maybe just the first one at ADA: is there a chance to get maybe even the 76-week data from the obesity study from the phase II, including some of the less frequent dosing, the Q2 and Q3 monthly dosing? And then secondly, would you consider doing a switch study where patients switch from prior GLPs right into MariTide and doing less frequent dosing as an additional strategy to ultimately follow with? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nJay. Go ahead, Jay.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks Yaron. First answer is no. The ADA presentation will focus on some mechanistic studies, some of the underlying details of part one, the first 52 weeks of the phase II study, as well as additional data from the phase I pharmacokinetics study, and reflections from these external key opinion leaders that we can't wait to hear ourselves. So no, I would not expect to see interim data from part two, which is ongoing and we intend to share these data when we have them at the end of the year. Your second question. Welcome to the MariTide development team. It's great to have you thinking about next trials.\nI take from your question that we agree actually that patients and physicians will want to know how they can start on MariTide if they're on another weight loss medicine that maybe is working, but is inconvenient, or maybe isn't working well enough. We do intend to generate data to support such a consideration. There'll be more to share on that in the future.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nPerfect. Let\n's go to the next question. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. It's a question I've been thinking about for a while on the myasthenia gravis market dynamic. Specifically, a lot of times when some of the cross trial comparisons have been made for plasmapheresis, they're often versus the max efficacy we see on FcRns. We know FcRns have this waxing-waning because as per label you have to get off the drug. My point being the true commercial price would actually be 2x for FcRns if you truly dose them through without the dosing holiday, which is apparently what a lot of clinicians are doing. So my question is, are peers aware of this dynamic and what do you see as a realistic market share aspiration?\nKnowing that your competitor might potentially be 2x the price, could you aim for like a 40% to 50% market share in MG? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nLet's try and take this in two pieces, Umer. I think on the clinical piece, Jay, if you want to add any perspective, but on the market, obviously, Murdo, you, you can share our perspectives on the payer environment and so forth.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen",
    "content2": "Yeah, thanks Bob. You know Umer, thanks for the question. The gMG space will surely be shaped by the efficacy and the target product profile of the medicines available to treat the patients primarily. And here we think IMDELLTRA has some really favorable considerations. It's very hard to do trial by trial comparisons, but suffice it to say that the significant observed efficacy by MG-ADL that we saw all the way out to week 52 and the durability of living in a randomized controlled trial environment through week 52 is indeed very strong. Targeting the core biology, one might expect higher efficacy.\nThe steroid sparing that was built into our study will be an advantage to get people onto a single medicine. At which point, the durability and the convenience with every six-month dosing after a loading dose are quite attractive, we believe, and we're receiving that feedback from prescribing physicians who weighed in on these data in the program. Murdo, do you have any comments about the pricing dynamics?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYes. In general, in categories and diseases like this, the medical policies from the payers will follow the indications in the label and/or the inclusion criteria that were provided for the clinical trial. So there's likely to be fairly broad access to these products. Now with real world experience and our ability to generate real world evidence in this category, I would think that the hypothesis that there might be a cost advantage to treating with UPLIZNA versus other agents could be borne out.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julianne, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Umer. Our next question comes from David Amsellem from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nDavid Amsellem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood question. On Otezla. I feel like over the past couple of years, even talking expansively about a wider physician audience, getting in front of more prescribers, raising awareness. The product hasn't been growing, so I guess what's it going to take to see an inflection here, or maybe put differently, do you think there has to be some externality like the availability of a subQ form to get the product really moving? Again, thanks.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThanks for the question, David. I think we're actually making quite good progress in broadening the prescribing base for TEPEZZA. It is, as you mentioned, it is a progressive evolution given that the product started its journey in more serious higher-cost patients treated by the oculoplastic surgeon surgical community. And that's really what drove the initial uptake of the product. Going beyond that means that we have to activate general ophthalmologists and endocrinologists, who are really two challenges that we're working on with them. One, getting them to actually take the time not just to diagnose Graves, but to diagnose thyroid eye disease, and two, to initiate treatment with an infused biologic and then find a site of care.\nSo all of that does take some time and some progress. But as I mentioned in prepared remarks, we're seeing a nice increase in intent to prescribe from endocrinologists, and that's the earliest leading indicator. We hope to follow that with an actual increase in prescribing. And then it will take time between when that intent and that prescription is written to when we can get that patient started on their first infusion. Navigating the paired process, finding a site of care does take some time as well. So it's not going to be a rapid change in the trajectory of the product, but it will be a progressive one.\nAnd then last but not least, definitely a subcutaneous administration will help here because it simplifies the site of care selection and affords more opportunities for patients to be initiated with their treatment. But I would anticipate both being able to grow prior to the availability of a subcutaneous form and then being able to accelerate that thereafter.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nMurdo, maybe you want to touch on the international progress?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Justin. We've been making great progress with TEPEZZA internationally, with the recent approval in Japan. We've been approved in Saudi Arabia, Brazil. We have a positive opinion CHMP in Europe. We anticipate launching there in the back half of the year. So the international expansion is progressing very well, and I would say ahead of schedule compared to what we thought we'd be able to do when we made the acquisition.\nOverall, the rare disease portfolio of products, it's a very young portfolio of products where we're really just beginning to address the severe diseases that these drugs treat. And whether it's TEPEZZA, UPLIZNA, KRYSTEXXA, or TAVNEOS, these are going to be key growth driving products for us over the long haul, both in the US and internationally.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nSpeaking of youth, David, it's Peter here. Just a reminder that the transaction closed on 23 October 2023. So you mentioned a couple of years. It's been about a year and a half. Although so much has happened in the world, it might feel like more than that. So we're delighted with the progress so far.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks, we're right on target with pre-tax cost synergies, and we're right on target with getting back to our pre-Horizon capital structure by the end of this year. So thanks for the question.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, David. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJay Olson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOh, hey, congrats on all the progress. Thank you for providing this update. Can you help us understand what to expect on the Bemarituzumab phase III study readouts coming up here in Q2? And how are you thinking about the market opportunity for Bima? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Jay, for the kind words. Bemarituzumab is our first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor 2B-directed monoclonal antibody. This is a protein that appears on the surface of malignant gastric cancer cells with some frequency. And as you point out, we're conducting two prospective phase III clinical trials, one that we call the doublet study or FORTITUDE-101. We expect this to read out in Q2 of this year. As I shared in the opening remarks, what to expect here, we're very hopeful that this will meaningfully contribute to improved overall survival in this patient population.\nWe've designed an outstanding study that's fully enrolled, and we hope to have data to share in the next quarter. FORTITUDE-102 is the triplet study. This is where we combine Bima with chemotherapy and checkpoint therapy nivolumab. Both of these are frontline gastric cancer studies. As more patients today receive or should receive chemotherapy with nivolumab in the front line of this disease, we're very hopeful that Bemarituzumab can work on top of that with the data readout in the second half of this year. Bemarituzumab showed pretty strong data in phase II, especially in the target population that we selected.\nSo we're hopeful that this will become a component of frontline standard of care for this disease. I guess more to follow next quarter. Murdo?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, the addressable population here is quite large. This is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, over a million new cases globally, 25,000 cases in the US. The initial addressable patient population, about 7,000 in the US, much larger worldwide and a real opportunity in Japan and Southeast Asia just in terms of the epidemiology of gastric cancer. And I think what really helps is as Jay outlined the combinability of Bemarituzumab with other available agents that treat this very difficult cancer.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julian, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. My apologies. Our next question will come from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGregory Renza\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst of Biotechnology Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thanks. Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on the quarter. Thanks for the question. Maybe just keeping with the oncology portfolio and maybe moving earlier down the pipeline a little bit. As you build on the LUMAKRAS experience, just wanted to ask that you elaborate a bit on the KRAS franchise strategy. Just particularly with the AMG 410 asset, which was recently highlighted at AACR. We have a world with a competitive landscape for KRAS drugs.\nJust curious if you could just elaborate how confident you are in the potential for 410 to be best or even better in class as you learn more about this molecule. Thanks so much.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nAll right, Greg, thank you so much for picking up on the AMG 410 presentation at the AACR this week. This is a very interesting molecule, and I think you've covered two key attributes which is the properties of the molecule itself that make it exciting and then the moment at which it reaches human clinical investigation. For others on the call that don't know the medicine, this is a low-molecular-weight, orally bioavailable structure, a small molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C. Already we were first to develop KRAS therapy as a reality with LUMAKRAS targeting the G12C allele selectively through cysteine covalent chemistry. But to get the other alleles, that trick doesn't work. There's no cysteine handle.\nAnd so we worked to develop a reversible pan-KRAS inhibitor that hits wild-type G12D, G12V, G12C actually as well, and G13B. It binds an allosteric pocket that is shared by other clinical-stage KRAS G12C inhibitors. This one is what's called a dual off- and dual on-state inhibitor. It has outstanding selectivity for KRAS over HRAS and NRAS of more than 100-fold, which should confer excellent tolerability, a strong therapeutic index. And so we're developing this medicine in an expedited way in a number of target solid tumors both alone and in combination in a combined phase I, two design. So it's a stunning molecule. Now, it's a competitive space, and this is great for patients.\nWe enter this space with AMG 410 being the leader in KRAS therapeutics. And so our eyes are wide open to some of the competitor programs that are more advanced in clinical study. I was very pleased to hear the reception from the leaders in the KRAS community at AACR, who, on social media and in private conversations, were really bullish about the properties of 410 and the need. Some of the KRAS inhibitors have shown a more narrow therapeutic index than one might have hoped for. So, competitive space, but an excellent offering and we hope to learn a lot in expedited phase I and II clinical development.\n\n[Company Representative] (Amgen)\n\nCompany Representative, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, I think we've got time for two more questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Matt Phipps from William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Phipps\n\nPartner and Group Head of Biotechnology Equity Research, William Blair\n\nThanks for taking my question. I actually wanted to ask about the market opportunity for TEZSPIRE and CRSwNP with nasal polyps, an indication that gets talked a lot about, but particularly how much overlap there is with asthma patients, and maybe your thoughts on the ability for biologics to move ahead of surgery longer term.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Matt, for the question. There is indeed a real opportunity here with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. We're looking at roughly one to two million patients in the US that suffer from this. It is significantly overlapping with severe asthma. Roughly 40% of asthma patients will present with some nasal polyp. Sorry, some chronic sinusitis involvement, and some of them with nasal polyps. Indeed, these patients undergo some very difficult treatments, inclusive of surgery.\nWe were able, in our clinical trials, to show that we can reduce almost entirely the need for surgery. So there is an opportunity, I believe, for us with TEZSPIRE, which has performed exceptionally well in severe uncontrolled asthma, to go in and help these patients with this, quite frankly, a miserable condition and help their overall quality of life, as we demonstrated in the clinical trial.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nAll right, let's go to our last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Matt. Our last question will come from Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for taking the question. So what's your expectation for a future market split between Rocatinlimab and centerpiece competitor OX40? Are you thinking a 50-50 split in, let's say, the atopic dermatitis market, or how are you kind of thinking about that shaking out? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure. Murdo, why don't you fire away?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nAs we said in the past, we're really looking carefully at the Rocatinlimab opportunity. Atopic dermatitis is clearly a condition that has opportunity for continued improvement in terms of the number of treatments that are available. There's a large refractory patient population out there with respect to what they currently have available to them and how they respond. It's hard for me to speculate on what our market split's going to be versus agents that are still in clinical development, but we're quite confident that there's a very nice opportunity in the market for Rocatinlimab.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nAlright, well, thank you all for joining our call. We appreciate your interest. Justin and his team will be around for the balance of the day. If you have any questions that you just get a chance to ask, and as you can tell, we're excited about the momentum of the business, excited about the current performance as well as what we see coming down the pike."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question and answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks.\nIn order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. To ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, please press star one again. I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our Q4 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Jay Bradner, and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today. We will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking. Statements which are qualified by our safe harbor statement and please note that actual. Results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nGood afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 capped another year of strong execution at Amgen. Our operations teams supplied every patient every time, our clinical teams reliably delivered quality results across the portfolio, and our commercial teams grew the business across our four therapeutic areas and in each of our geographic regions. The operating rhythm that we've established in our business will serve us well for 2025 and the longer term. Looking ahead, our objective is to deliver long-term growth while navigating regulatory and political, declining net prices, and losses of exclusivity.\nWe have a track record of doing just that. If you consider the past decade, we grew revenues above a mid single-digit percent level and EPS at approximately 9% per year over the period, despite facing biosimilar and generic competition across products that accounted for about 50% of our revenues. As we look to the next decade, our novel medicines are well positioned to address patient demographics in a rapidly aging world, and we expect that our operating discipline to enable us to scale to meet the needs of patients while continuing to deliver for our shareholders.\nReflecting on our marketed products in 2024, we exited the fourth quarter with 14 medicines, each annualizing at over $1 billion, and notably several of these will be key drivers of growth through the decade. Let me highlight a few. starting in general medicine, Repatha and EVENITY continue to deliver attractive growth. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, and Repatha, now a multi-billion-dollar product, continues to expand as access improves worldwide. We are the leader worldwide in bone health, addressing the huge need for fracture prevention in those living with osteoporosis.\nThe clinical performance of EVENITY since its launch demonstrates the leading role it can play in reducing fracture risk for millions of postmenopausal women in rare diseases. 2025 will be an exciting year. We look forward to regulatory approvals for TEPEZZA internationally and launches in new indications for UPLIZNA, further strengthening the growth trajectory of our rare disease business.\nIn inflammation, we continue to be inspired by the strong performance of TEZSPIRE and the progress we're making advancing into new indications including COPD, which is the third leading cause of death, where we intend to initiate phase III studies, and of course in chronic rhinosinusitis, which runs in parallel with other respiratory diseases.\nIn oncology, our leading bispecific T-cell engager platform provides further opportunities for growth with BLINCYTO moving into frontline treatment and demonstrating compelling survival benefit in B-cell ALL, IMDELLTRA showing impressive efficacy in hard-to-treat small cell lung cancer, and xaluritamig advancing into phase III in advanced prostate cancer.\n2025 promises to be another milestone year for our rapidly advancing pipeline with important phase III data readouts for programs including across our general medicine, rare disease, inflammation, and oncology portfolios. Beyond these readouts, we'll be initiating several new phase III trials of MariTide in obesity and related conditions. This is an exciting time for innovation in our laboratories, in our factories, with the science of manufacturing, and in leveraging technology across the company.\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, we're finding new opportunities across our business and AI is helping us deliver innovative medicines to more patients even faster. To wrap up, 2024 demonstrated the strength of our business, the depth and breadth of our portfolio, and the power of our pipeline. As we step into 2025, we're poised to deliver continued growth and innovation in the near term through 2030 and beyond. I want to thank our global team for their exceptional contributions and dedication to our mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Murdo for an update on our commercial organization.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThanks Bob. In the fourth quarter, product sales grew 11% year-over-year, capping off a year of growth fueled by strong execution across the business. For the full year, product sales grew 19% and 10 products grew by double digits or better, creating strong momentum for growth in 2025 and beyond. Two products on a strong growth trajectory are Repatha and EVENITY, which together grew 35% year-over-year, driven by 39% volume growth and accounting for nearly $1 billion in sales growth in the year. Both of these important brands serve large patient populations that are mostly untreated.\nDespite the availability of highly impactful therapies indicating robust growth potential, Repatha sales increased 36% in 2024, reaching over $2.2 billion in sales. There are 100 million patients globally in need of effective treatment for lowering their LDL-C and we see strong potential for growth of Repatha around the world as physicians, patients, and payers recognize the importance of therapies like Repatha for patients at risk. Major cardiovascular events. In the United States, Repatha sales grew 44% in 2024 with volume growth of 54%.\nThe majority of patients with elevated LDL-C are in the primary care setting and in 2024 our increased investment focused on primary care physicians improved the number of Repatha prescribers by 50%, supporting future growth strategy. Our direct-to-patient education efforts doubled the number of patients who asked their doctor for Repatha. Volume growth was further supported by Repatha's broad access and reimbursement and we see more payers seeking to ease or even remove prior authorization barriers making Repatha more accessible and affordable for patients.\nCardiologists and primary care physicians reported in a recent survey that Repatha access has improved significantly versus two years ago. Outside the US Repatha continues to grow across major markets despite increased competition in the segment. Over the past several years, the price of Repatha has been impacted by an expansion of coverage in the US and the growth of new markets around the world. Moving forward, we expect less price erosion for Repatha with 2025 net price expected to decline by mid single digits or less.\nEVENITY sales increased 35% in 2024, reaching almost $1.6 billion in sales. EVENITY is the only therapeutic that both builds bone and slows resorption, which can play a critical role in reducing fracture risk for millions of women who are postmenopausal. Despite this significant need, only 210,000 patients in the US have been treated with EVENITY to date, while millions remain at risk. With over 90% of very high risk patients not currently receiving appropriate treatment, we see a significant opportunity to grow EVENITY in 2025 and beyond. In the US, EVENITY continues to be the segment leader in the bonebuilder market.\nWe drove a 14% quarter-over-quarter increase in new customers ordering EVENITY and saw an increase in prescription volume from both established and new EVENITY prescribers. We've increased our investment in EVENITY and have fully shifted the focus of our US Bone field force towards EVENITY. Our move to our rare disease portfolio, which delivered over $4.5 billion in sales in 2024. TEPEZZA, our largest product in the rare disease portfolio, generated sales of $1.9 billion in the year, representing 5% year-on-year growth. Since launch TEPEZZA has had a positive impact for thousands of patients living with thyroid eye disease.\nThere are roughly 100,000 patients suffering from thyroid eye disease in the US who could benefit from TEPEZZA, and to reach them we've intensified our efforts to engage a broad prescriber base of oculoplastic surgeons, ophthalmologists, and endocrinologists. We're moving quickly in international markets to secure regulatory approval for TEPEZZA, which will drive additional growth, and we've successfully launched TEPEZZA in Japan where it's the first and only medicine approved to treat active thyroid eye disease. In 2025, we expect to launch TEPEZZA in seven additional countries.\nIn inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with nearly $1 billion in sales in the year, a 71% year-over-year increase. We've driven increased adoption by pulmonologists supported by TEZSPIRE's unique profile to treat patients with multiple severe uncontrolled asthma triggers and drivers. TEZSPIRE has strong future growth potential given the need to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Our innovative oncology portfolio including BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA, and IMDELLTRA contributed almost $8 billion in sales for the full year.\nYear-over-year sales grew 11%, driven by volume growth and higher net selling price. Our leading Bispecific T cell Engager platform, which developed BLINCYTO and IMDELLTRA, continues to address critical unmet needs in oncology while providing significant opportunities for future growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 41% for the full year, reaching over $1.2 billion in sales. We expect continued strong growth in 2025 driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments.\nPhysician prescribing is growing, and compelling new clinical data is redefining BLINCYTO as the standard of care for both adult and pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-Cell ALL. Our US launch of IMDELLTRA for the treatment of patients with extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer who are progressing on or after chemotherapy is off to a strong start, generating $115 million in sales in seven months since launch. We see increasing breadth of adoption in both academic and community settings driven by strong clinical conviction for IMDELLTRA's transformational efficacy.\nIMDELLTRA has treated approximately 2,000 patients since launch. Each year an estimated 8 to 10,000 patients progress to second-line treatment for extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer. Our medical and commercial teams are operating with urgency to bring IMDELLTRA to more patients living with this aggressive disease. Sales of our biosimilar products were $2.2 billion in 2024, an increase of 16% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter our team readily executed the launch of PAVBLU, a biosimilar to Eylea with nine weeks of sales totaling $31 million.\nResponse from retina specialists to PAVBLU has been very positive, with strong intent to purchase and administer this high-quality Amgen biosimilar delivered in an easy-to-use pre-filled syringe. The next wave of biosimilar launches continues in 2025. In January, building on the strong introduction of PAVBLU at the end of 2024, we launched WEZLANA, a biosimilar to STELARA, and in the second quarter we expect to launch BKEMV, a biosimilar to SOLIRIS.\nWith this next wave of launches, we anticipate robust growth and attractive returns from our biosimilar portfolio. 2024 was a strong year of execution across Amgen. We view execution as a team effort. The tightly coordinated integration between research and development, manufacturing operations, and our commercial teams enables us to serve record numbers of patients across the portfolio and around the world. This relentless cross enterprise focus will accelerate our ability to reach even more patients with Amgen medicines in 2025, and with that I'll hand it over to Jay.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThank you, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. At this time last year we planned a very ambitious R&D agenda, and I'm very proud to say we delivered, meeting or exceeding almost all enrollment targets and generating impact and value across the portfolio. Specifically, in 2024 we received two important US regulatory approvals in oncology, completed five positive phase III studies, and initiated three new phase III trials while advancing the broad MariTide program. Let's begin with MariTide, a therapy with a unique, differentiated, and highly competitive profile.\nSince our phase II data disclosure last November, we have engaged extensively with key opinion leaders and have received strong enthusiasm and support. This excitement stems from MariTide's ability to deliver consistent, predictable, and sustained weight loss through 52 weeks without hitting a weight loss plateau, and convenient monthly or less frequent dosing, a clear advantage over current weekly therapies. Additionally, key opinion leaders conveyed their excitement for robust and clinically meaningful improvements in cardiometabolic parameters including hemoglobin A1C demonstrated by MariTide treatment.\nWith a further optimized simple dose escalation schedule and significantly fewer injections per year, we expect to improve persistent and long-term health outcomes. MariTide represents a promising treatment advance for people living with obesity and related conditions, and we are committed to fully realizing its potential in H1 2025. We expect to initiate the first studies in our broad phase III MariTide program and expect to present the full MariTide phase II data set at a major medical congress in the second half of 2025.\nWe expect key data readouts from both the ongoing phase II type 2 diabetes study and part 2 of the ongoing phase II chronic weight management study. Beyond MariTide in general medicine, we look forward to data from the Repatha VESALIUS phase III primary prevention study in the second half of this year. Having demonstrated profound and sustained benefit of Repatha in the secondary prevention setting, we're excited about these data and the opportunity to reach additional patients at high risk of a first cardiovascular event.\nTurning to olpasiran, our promising best-in-class small interfering RNA medicine targeting Lp(a), we are bringing a precision medicine to cardiovascular risk reduction for the many individuals with Lp(a) elevation. The fully enrolled OCEAN(a) phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress, and we expect to initiate an additional phase III outcome study in patients with elevated Lp(a) and at high risk for a first cardiovascular event late this year or in the first half of 2026. Shifting to rare disease, we are very excited about UPLIZNA's potential to serve even more patients facing rare inflammatory illnesses.\nIn 2024, we generated compelling data from the UPLIZNA phase III Mitigate study in patients with IgG4-related disease, a serious inflammatory condition with no approved therapies. These data are now under FDA priority review with a PDUFA date of 3 April 2025. The FDA also granted orphan drug designation to UPLIZNA for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis based upon 26-week data from the phase III Mint Study. This study showed UPLIZNA to be highly effective on multiple clinical outcomes, also reducing the need for steroids with patient-centered convenient dosing.\nWe eagerly anticipate the 52-week data later this year, which will provide further insight into response and long-term durability. With two anticipated approvals on the horizon in IgG4-related disease and generalized myasthenia gravis, we are more confident than ever about UPLIZNA's expanding impact on the management of rare inflammatory diseases in inflammation. We remain on track to initiate phase III studies of TEZSPIRE in COPD targeting patients with moderate to very severe COPD with blood eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 150 cells per microliter.\nCOPD is the world's third leading cause of death, and we're excited about the impact TEZSPIRE could have in this setting beyond COPD. Regulatory submissions are underway in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps supported by positive phase III data, and we continue advancing a phase III study in eosinophilic esophagitis. The rocatinlimab phase III rocket program in atopic dermatitis is progressing with additional data expected throughout 2025. These studies will provide deeper insight into rocatinlimab's profile beyond atopic dermatitis.\nWe continue to explore rocatinlimab in moderate to severe asthma and prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin condition characterized by extreme itchiness. As previously indicated, we are pursuing B cell depletion in autoimmune disease with both blinatumomab and inebilizumab. Our initial focus is on systemic lupus erythematosus with plans to expand into additional indications. 2025 will be an important year in oncology where we expect three key phase III data readouts. I will start with our rapidly advancing BiTE portfolio.\nLast December, very exciting BLINCYTO data were shared at ASH and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. In a phase III study conducted by the Children's Oncology Group, BLINCYTO added to chemotherapy improved three-year disease-free survival to 96% compared to 88% with chemotherapy alone in the upfront treatment of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are also advancing a subcutaneous formulation of blinatumomab with a potentially registration-enabling study in adults and adolescents with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL expected to begin in the second half of 2025.\nBased on our experience to date, subcutaneous blinatumomab has the potential to improve the patient experience, efficacy, and tolerability. Our second approved BiTE therapy, IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer, is rapidly advancing into earlier lines of therapy. Phase III studies are ongoing in both extensive-stage and limited-stage disease. Data from DeLLphi-304 are expected in the first half of 2025. This study compares IMDELLTRA with standard-of-care chemotherapy in second-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\nOur first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific T-cell engager xaluritamig has entered phase III clinical development with a study in post-taxane metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We are also exploring xaluritamig in combination therapy and in earlier lines of prostate cancer. With multiple phase Ib studies ongoing, we remain excited about the growth potential of our BiTE platform and the opportunity to reach additional cancer patients with BLINCYTO, IMDELLTRA, and xaluritamig.\nBeyond our T-cell engagers, bemarituzumab, our first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b-directed monoclonal antibody, is advancing to frontline gastric cancer therapy. We expect data in the first half of 2025 from Fortitude-101, a phase III study of bemarituzumab combined with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. In the second half of 2025, we expect data from an analysis of Fortitude-102, a phase III study of bemarituzumab combined with chemotherapy and nivolumab.\nOn biosimilars, we are rapidly advancing three phase III programs evaluating our biosimilars to Opdivo, KEYTRUDA, and Ocrevus, the next wave of Amgen biosimilar products. In closing, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their unwavering commitment to patients facing grievous illnesses and for their focus and collaboration throughout a highly productive 2024. We look forward to an exciting year ahead and continued pipeline momentum. I'll now turn it over to Peter.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nThank you, Jay. We're pleased with our execution excellence in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2024, and we remain on track with our long-term objectives. The financial results are shown on slides 28 to 30 of the slide deck. Full year total revenues of $33.4 billion grew 19% year-over-year driven by 21 products with record sales. Product sales increased 19% year-over-year driven by 23% volume growth excluding products acquired from Horizon. Product sales for the full year increased 7% year-over-year driven by 11% volume growth for the full year. We delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 47%.\nWe continue to invest in advancing our pipeline with non-GAAP R&D spend increasing 25% year-over-year for the full year to a record $5.9 billion due to investments in the late-stage pipeline including MariTide, rocatinlimab, bemarituzumab, and IMDELLTRA, as well as Horizon-acquired programs. Excluding Horizon, non-GAAP R&D spending increased 15% year-over-year. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach the previously announced $500 million in pre-tax cost synergies by year three post-acquisition. The acquisition was accretive to non-GAAP EPS for the full year 2024.\nFull year non-GAAP other income and expense was up $1.1 billion year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from the Horizon acquisition. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with $4.5 billion of debt retired in 2024. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2 percentage points year-over-year to 14.5% for the full year, primarily due to the change in earnings mix, including the addition of the Horizon business, and net favorable items. The company generated $10.4 billion in free cash flow for the full year and $4.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter.\nThese results reflect strong momentum in the business and favorable timing of collections at year-end. We executed capital expenditures in 2024 of $1.3 billion in line with the guidance provided, with the cash outflow being $1.1 billion and the remainder to be paid in 2025. Our commitment to innovation is also evident as we deploy artificial intelligence across the value chain, including informing molecule design and discovery research, enabling faster trial enrollment and streamlining regulatory filings in clinical development, and enhancing our responsiveness to customers in commercial operations.\nIn addition, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividends of $2.25 per share in the fourth quarter. This represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. We expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2025 on slide 31. We expect our 2025 total revenues in the range of $34.3 to 35.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $20 and 21.20. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across each of our therapeutic areas.\nWe expect continued growth across a number of products led by our near-term growth drivers: Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, our innovative oncology portfolio, our rare disease portfolio, and biosimilars. This growth will more than offset declines due to the upcoming denosumab patent expiration as well as continued price declines across our portfolio in 2025. For total company revenues, we expect each quarter of 2025 to have a relatively similar year-over-year growth rate.\nA reminder as you model the first quarter of 2025, and consistent with our historical trends, we expect Otezla and ENBREL to follow their typical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters. Also note that biosimilar sales in the US can significantly vary quarter to quarter depending on customer ordering patterns. For example, we expect Q1 AMJEVITA sales in the US to be in line with Q3 2024 for the full year. We expect other revenue to be approximately $1.4 billion in 2025. We are driving R&D investments to support our promising late-stage pipeline, including MariTide and olpasiran.\nAs a result, we project a full-year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 46%. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 18% to 19 as a percentage of product sales for 2025. This projection reflects the ongoing impact of sales mix, including profit share and royalties. We expect non-GAAP R&D expense to grow year-over-year in the mid-teens in 2025, with investments increasing to advance key pipeline assets, including MariTide and olpasiran. We see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock these opportunities.\nFor the non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect the 2025 full year amount as a percentage of product sales to decline by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points year-over-year as we continue to drive efficiencies and prioritize resources, including leveraging both automation and our newly established innovation and technology hub in India. Overall, the operating margin of roughly 46% indicates our commitment to investing in the best innovation while also driving execution, excellence, efficiency, and prioritization across the organization, consistent with prior years and in line with typical lower product sales in Q1.\nWe expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margin to be the lowest of the year at roughly 42%, and then accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We anticipate non-GAAP OINE to be approximately $2.4 billion. In 2025, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 15% to 16. Similar to 2024, we expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2025. We expect the share count in the first quarter of 2025 to be flat to the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion in 2025.\nThis is consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business and scale capacity for growth in marketed products and the pipeline. We expect to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings as we continue to generate strong free cash flows, strengthen our balance sheet, and remain on track to return to our pre-Horizon capital structure by the end of 2025. In 2025, we expect free cash flow performance to be similar to 2023. This decline is primarily driven by 2024 working capital favorability and incremental capital expenditures.\nFree cash flow in the first half of 2025 will be impacted by strong 2024 year-end collections, timing the shift in 2024 tax payments to the second quarter of 2025, and also the final $1.8 billion repatriation tax payment in the second quarter of 2025. Our long term outlook remains strong, and I'm grateful to our colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. This concludes our financial update. I'll now hand it back to Bob for our Q&A session.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, just to recap before we go to the Q and A session, as you can see, our results highlight the breadth and depth of opportunities across our business, and we exited the fourth quarter with 10 products growing at double-digit sales rate and 14 products annualizing at over $1 billion. For the year to repeat, we had 21 products delivering record sales. This momentum supports our outlook for 2025 and through the long term. With that, we'd be happy to take questions.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nJulianne, if you could please remind our participants of the procedures here.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press star followed by one again. To ask a question, press star one. Our first question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nYaron Werber\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotechnology Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a couple of things. On 513, the one that's on clinical hold for obesity, can you comment? Was that an incretin or not an incretin mechanism? Secondly, maybe just for Murdo, a few things looked really strong. AMJEVITA was extremely strong at $294. Is that sustainable from now on? What drove that? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nAll right, take it in two parts. Jay, you want to address the 513, I think it is.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThanks, Jerome. AMG 513 is a novel investigational medicine for patients with obesity. It's currently in phase I investigation. We have not disclosed the mechanism of action. This remains a competitive space, as you know.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nJeroen, it's Murdo here. We're pleased with overall biosimilars performance, and our biosimilar portfolio, as I mentioned last year, grew about 16%, and we're confident we can continue to grow that portfolio going forward. One of those growth contributors will be AMJEVITA.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nGreat, Julianne. We'll go to the next question. I will remind folks we have quite a full queue today, so if you can limit yourself to one question, that'd be great.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi all, thanks for taking my question today. I wanted to ask a little bit about Repatha. Obviously we're seeing kind of strong growth there, and there's new indications coming, particularly in the primary prevention space. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of how you anticipate this market evolving? As we think about the oral PCSK9s and Merck's CORALreef Lipids trial that is also scheduled to read out later this year, there seem to be suggestions that that could perform as well as an injectable in terms of the efficacy. Just wanting to understand how you would position. Thank you.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Courtney. We're obviously very pleased with the performance of Repatha in 2024, putting up some very strong growth both in volume and in revenues, both in the US and outside of the United States. We expect to see that continue. We expect to be able to treat the many patients who have not had their LDL cholesterol optimized. There's millions upon millions of these patients. We're barely scratching the surface when it comes to treating them. We think that Repatha offers a really ideal solution for patients to receive it and for prescribers to prescribe it.\nWhat we're really pleased about is the perception amongst prescribers now that Repatha is an easy to access medicine and an affordable medicine. That's thanks to the efforts of our access teams around the world making sure that Repatha is appropriately reimbursed and positioned on formularies with PBMs. You know, we've been successful in removing those barriers. We really are at an inflection point in Repatha's performance and feel very, very good about the trajectory and momentum we established in 2024 with new competition. You know, obviously there's more than just LDL cholesterol lowering evidence that needs to be introduced here.\nRepatha has clearly demonstrated benefit in secondary prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular sequelae. The goal, of course, as you mentioned, is that with VESALIUS, which reads out later this year, we'll be able to show that you can actually lower the risk of a first heart attack or stroke or other cardiovascular event.\nWe're kind of in the mode of helping treat hard endpoints now in this market and not just lowering LDL. We'll see what the evidence is and how it accumulates with not just the orals, but other competitors that are trying to come into this market. Again, obviously, Repatha is a very important growth driver for us now and into the future.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Courtney. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In the context of your 2025 sales guidance, can you speak to where you feel the street is underappreciating growth, and discuss how you factored in the Part D redesign to your projections? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nLet me take it in two pieces. Murdo, why don't you first start on the Part D redesign, then Pete, why don't you jump in?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nSure, yeah. The Part D redesign at a total portfolio level for us is relatively neutral between summer. Given that chronic care cardiovascular products at an affordable price like Repatha tend to do well when patients' out-of-pocket is capped and smoothed, that's what we believe will happen for products like Repatha going forward.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nPeter, great. Murdo, thank you. Salveen, thank you for the question. I would just remind you what we've said, which is let's start from 10 products with double, 13 products annualizing or at blockbuster status of a billion or more, and 21 that were records in 2024. Strong in-market portfolio, Salveen. When we look at 2025, I'd really like to start with two and then add four more on to think about. Murdo talked about Repatha, as he said, 100 million people around the world needing treatment. VESALIUS is coming later this year and less price erosion, maybe mid single digit or less this year.\nOn that, you talked about the strong access globally. You know, we expect Repatha to continue to be a strong medicine going forward. The second on EVENITY, you know, it's got low single-digit penetration, you know, greater than 90% of the high-risk patients in the US, you know, haven't been treated. There's a significant unmet need there with EVENITY. We think those two are very, very important. Let me also share, TEZSPIRE up 71% in 2024 to almost a billion dollars. I think it was $972 million of product sales. Innovative oncology up 11%.\nThe seven innovative oncology products we have in 2024, we think that's a very strong portfolio to help patients with oncology and hematology disease, rare disease, up to about $4.5 billion in 2024. They've got a ways to go. When we think about those four, we see a lot of growth there and a lot of opportunity. We get to biosimilars. We shared with you 16% growth up to about $2.2 billion in 2024. We've got some launches coming this year. We continue to see a lot of growth in that.\nWe think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow this business in a strong way in 2025 and going forward. As I shared in my opening remarks, we see that driving us right past the expiry on denosumab. I'll leave it there. We're very pleased with the business, and most importantly, we expect more medicine to more patients in 2025 around the world.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from David Amsellem from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Amsellem\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotechnology Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. So, wanted to switch gears and get your thoughts on some of the Horizon products. KRYSTEXXA, how are you thinking about similar down the road and then also how you're thinking about the competitive landscape for TEPEZZA. Thanks.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure Murdo go ahead.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThank you, David. KRYSTEXXA had a very strong year of growth year-over-year. When we look at. If we include the Horizon performance from the prior period, KRYSTEXXA was up 23%, UPLIZNA up 40%. TAVNEOS is up 111% and TEPEZZA up 5%. This is as Peter mentioned, overall it's a portfolio of products very early on in their life cycle with more data to flow, as is the case of course with UPLIZNA. With our IgG4 data and additional GMG data coming on 52 weeks.\nWe have a number of catalysts that we'll grow our business in the US and then we have catalysts for growth outside the US with of course, international launches and expansion, which is well underway with the recent approval of TEPEZZA in Japan. With respect to KRYSTEXXA overall, again, even though KRYSTEXXA is part of our rare disease portfolio, severe uncontrolled gout is not a rare disease, it's not a rare condition.\nThere are lots of patients out there who suffer continuously, and with the immunomodulation data, we are now able to help many of those patients and so we see continued robust opportunity for growth there. We're also looking to develop additional pipeline assets. Jay and his team are looking at those opportunities.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, David. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey guys, thanks for the question. Other than MariTide, you know you've had one or two obesity assets have some slip ups. Can you maybe comment about your strategic view about where you'd like to be in a couple years if you are so confident on MariTide, given that everyone's chasing a multiple asset portfolio including orals, and you seem to be pretty early stage outside of MariTide, so maybe just comment about your appetite there and whether you can add to the portfolio. Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure, Mike. I'm not sure we'd accept the premise, but anyway, let's talk about the portfolio of obesity programs. Go ahead, Jay.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Mike. Akin to what Bob said, I wouldn't call these flip ups at all. Early phase clinical investigation here at Amgen has a really high bar for what medicines go forward, and the next medicine up after MariTide did not meet that bar. Our obesity efforts fit very well with our strengths in cardiovascular disease, nephrology, and more generally the emerging presence in primary care. We're very confident that we have all the talent, capabilities, ideas, and rising medicines to be a major player in obesity for the fullness of time, which we've studied for more than a decade.\nThe research and early development pipeline has ideas targeting integrins, also non-integrins. We have medicines that will be given orally, others by subcutaneous administration. We're also interested to open partnerships through external innovation. We're very confident in MariTide and very confident in the pipeline behind it.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSorry, Jay, just to clarify one thing, the 513 is still, we still expect to have that development.We don't believe the issue that we referenced is related to the drug, but we'll go through the usual steps with the regulators on that. But Jay was referring to another product that we're no longer advancing that was previously in the clinic. So when he said it didn't pass the hurdle. But again, we're excited about the program and the molecules that are coming forward to the clinic out of the obesity portfolio.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJay Olson\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOh, hey. Congrats. Update.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nHey, Jay. Jay, we can't hear you. Jay, sorry, we can't hear you. You want to take another. Take a. Take another start.\n\nJay Olson\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOh, can you hear me better now?\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nYes, go ahead.\n\nJay Olson\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOh, okay. Could you describe the key lessons you expect to learn from the Repatha VESALIUS CV outcome study results? Can leverage those lessons across your portfolio, including olpasiran, MariTide, and any synergies you plan to capture across these programs. Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure, Jay?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nSure. Why don't I start, and then Murdo invite you to speak to synergies and the like. We've learned a lot from Repatha already. We have a leading capability in population genetics and epidemiology. And now the broad use of Repatha and secondary prevention is a fantastic set up for VESALIUS. As you know, this is a phase III large cardiovascular outcomes study of more than 12,000 patients, placebo-controlled patients at high cardiovascular risk without prior MI or stroke. This is ongoing. We have an event driven readout expected in the second half of this year.\nThis will be a large and valuable data set for us to mine to understand the further improvement of cardiovascular outcomes for patients as relates to LDL-C but also for other parameters. We have already harvested so many insights from Repatha and carried that into the design and execution of the olpasiran phase III program, which as you heard, has an event driven outcome expected a readout in the second half of next year. So very valuable data set that will no doubt prompt significant further insights.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThanks, Jay. The synergies here are significant and substantial given the leadership presence we have in LDL lowering and being able to apply that to Lp(a) lowering with olpasiran obviously is successful in the readout of our phase III trial. I do think there's going to be some differences though, given that Lp(a) cannot be modified by lifestyle, diet, and exercise. There are no other generically available or branded available products that can lower Lp(a). We do think that the intentionality and the speed to move to a pharmacotherapeutic for Lp(a) lowering will be different than it has been for LDL.\nBut nonetheless, we're clearly engaged with all of the different stakeholders in the lipid lowering and atherosclerotic market. We're engaging them as appropriate to make sure that they understand the profile of olpasiran and the design of the trial that Jay mentioned and ultimately when we have results to share.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Alex Hammond from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks for taking the question. So, with more and more companies looking to China for innovation, what is Amgen's stance on looking overseas for clinical stage assets? And I guess more broadly, what is your appetite for M&A now post the Horizon acquisition? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOur position on business development remains pretty consistent, Alex. We're focused on molecules that we think we can add value to, irrespective of where they come from. We have had and maintain a very active search for interesting opportunities for licensing and acquisition all around the globe. Yeah, we're open for business looking for those opportunities.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Alex. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, thanks so much for the question. Also just wanted to say my thoughts are with all those Amgen employees and everyone in the LA area who's been impacted by the devastating wildfires. I had a two-parter on MariTide. You know, I know you're doing part two of the phase II to explore quarterly dosing. Just wondering if there's an interim look there so you can incorporate that schedule into the phase program if you decide to. Then was wondering if you can tell us if ADA is a fair assumption for presentation of the full MariTide phase II obesity data. Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure. Jay?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThanks, Terence, for your question, and really appreciate the call out for the associates here and the area residents facing these fires. We have, as you know, an ongoing part 2 of our phase II study in chronic weight management. That is a 52-week study, and we expect data readout late this year. I can confirm that we look forward to presenting the phase II part 1 data at the ADA meeting in June this year in Chicago and look forward to seeing you there.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much. I have sort of a simple question. Clearly you've provided a lot of helpful pipeline updates on the call, so thank you for that. My question, Jay, is could you just explain why you're announcing today the plans to initiate a new olpasiran phase III trial in high risk patients when it's not going to be initiated until late 2025 or early 2026. What is pending, you know, initiating that trial. Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSorry again, Dave, maybe I just clarify. I mentioned this in January at JPM in the context. This is Bob speaking, Dave, in the context of what to expect for the year. Jay, go ahead and address the specific piece of the question if you'd like.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, no, nothing more to add. We have already announced our intention to initiate phase III clinical investigation of olpasiran and primary prevention. This is a strong hypothesis for protecting patients with elevations of Lp(a). We hope to initiate this study, intend to initiate this study in the second half this year or in the first half of next year. We just have a total commitment to the benefit of patients facing, in this case, genetically defined risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Dave. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Just wanted to talk through TEPEZZA and just how we should be thinking about growth in both the US and internationally here. I guess specifically, can you talk about ex-US, the Japan opportunity in some of these new markets, and can we think about the rapid ramp that we saw in the US kind of repeating itself in those markets or were these more gradual ramps as these roll out? Thank you.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen",
    "content2": "Yeah, hi Chris, it's Murdo here. Thanks for the question. On TEPEZZA in Japan, the epidemiology is quite significant here. Roughly 25,000 patients. What we're talking about. The care model in Japan does reduce the friction that prescribers and patients experience in terms of finding access to the right physician and then access to a site of care. So we do expect there to be a pretty good uptake in this market. Not sure about the bolus dynamic that we saw in the United States. That did have some impact because it was a launch during the COVID period.\nI'm not sure I would compare curves there, but I would expect steady penetration of the Japanese patient population. We know there have been over 550 patients already identified by prescribers. I was there for the launch at the end of last year. The weekly data are showing some pretty good steady momentum. And so Japan will be a very good source of growth for TEPEZZA internationally. As I mentioned, we've got seven other markets that we'll be launching in hopefully this year pending regulatory approvals. We do see that international catalyst, that international growth as a catalyst for the overall brand.\nIt's obviously one of the things that drove the acquisition, the ability for Amgen's global footprint to bring these medicines to more patients in the US. We continue to focus on broadening the prescriber base for TEPEZZA, so helping general ophthalmology and endocrinology diagnose not just the Graves' disease, but also the thyroid eye disease and then find a site of care for patients to receive TEPEZZA treatment. Just one overarching comment I'll make on TEPEZZA. It does follow the pattern we see in some other products in our portfolio where that first quarter this year will be a little bit lower than the other three quarters.\nMostly a function of people having their insurance reverified and or purchasing patterns in the market. So just something to watch out for. But long-term Otezla growth is looking very good given the international approvals and the momentum that we plan to generate in the US.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Chris. Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey guys, thank you for taking my question. Any color on the indications for the MariTide trials that will start in first half 2025? And can you say anything on whether or not MariTide will have head-to-head against incumbents such as tirzepatide or sema at this point? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThank you, James. The MariTide phase III program has a focus on chronic weight management, on cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, heart failure, and possibly additional indications. As our discussions are at a rather mature state with the federal regulators, it would be premature to talk through any design principles around these trials at this time, but we look very much forward to initiating the MariTide phase III program.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, James. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I know Amgen commonly says it doesn't get enough credit by the street for its biosimilar business, so I'd like to ask about that and just one product in particular, PAVBLU, the Eylea biosimilar. Why can't that be a very significant product for you guys, as the only seller into that large market, probably for the next few years. Seems like it could, you know, get to a $1 billion+ type sales level. Can you give us some idea of what's in your 2025 guide for this? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, Tim, we couldn't hear very clearly the beginning of your question, but it seems that you're asking about biosimilars. Perhaps you suggested we don't get enough credit for what we do in biosimilars. If that's what you said, we're grateful. We are a world leader, as you know, in biosimilars, and our focus has been to reliably supply biosimilars when we're appropriately able to enter the market. Our objective is to be among the first wave of biosimilar entrants. That's what we've achieved with PAVBLU. But as to the specifics, Murdo, do you want to address Tim's question?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, Tim, as you know, we don't give product specific guidance, but given your comments, I would say we're very pleased with how the launch is going. We, as Bob mentioned, always try to target being in the first wave. We find ourselves being the only biosimilar available in the market right now. And of course that represents an opportunity that we will capitalize on. The current feedback from retina specialists that we've been talking to is very enthusiastic, very positive.\nThey are pleased that Amgen is bringing yet another high-quality biosimilar in a very easy-to-use pre-filled syringe. Given the number of administrations these retina specialists do each and every day, that device is quite important. Thanks to our legal colleagues, our manufacturing operations, and process development teams, they've done a very, very nice job of making sure that we have a path to helping many more patients with another Amgen biosimilar.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nMaybe to add on just a little bit, Murdo and Bob, I would suggest, Tim, we build what we think obviously is an industry-leading biosimilar franchise. We operate very efficiently, we leverage the broader Amgen footprint, including manufacturing and operations. We believe we're earning attractive returns for our shareholders in this, when we pursue an opportunity we deliver.\nTo date, I would remind you that we have 100% success rate of FDA approval once we enter the clinic. With $10 billion in cumulative biosimilar sales through 2024, we're on track to double 2021 sales to over $4 billion by the end of the decade. I think this reinforces our leadership and ability to deliver attractive returns. It's a really important question. We're delighted and we think this is a good use of shareholder capital.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nConor MacKay\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi there. This is Conor MacKay on for Evan. Thanks for our question and congrats on the quarter. We just had one question on the phase III ROCKET program with several readouts coming over the balance of the year. What are you looking to see from those readouts to get comfortable with your competitive positioning in the atopic dermatitis market and sort of any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about that? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. Rocatinlimab, our T cell rebalancing monoclonal antibody targets the OX40 receptor, as you note, we are reading out this year a number of studies of this ROCKET program. This eight-study, more than 3,300-patient program really gives a lot of granularity. To answer your question around the target product profile, the safety and tolerability of Rocatinlimab and its full efficacy in patients with atopic dermatitis. In the Shuttle study, we study Rocatinlimab combination with topical steroids or calcineurans in adults with moderate to severe AD, data first half of this year.\nIn the IGNITE study, we study monotherapy in adults with moderate to severe AD first half of this year, and then in the back half of the year we have two studies, Ascend and Astro. Ascend will help us understand maintenance in adults and adolescents. Then ASTRO is an adolescent study with moderate to severe AD. So as you can tell, we're going to generate a lot of information about the potential to contribute to better therapy for this very common and in many cases morbid disease as well as the tolerability profile.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nGreat. Julianne, I think we've got time for two more.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Thank you, Evan. Our next question will come from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGregory Renza\n\nSenior Biotechnology Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Bob and team Bob, as you and the team talk about the global footprint and leveraging and penetrating new markets, I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit about the opportunity in China and namely just about the commercial opportunity for those oncology medicines and how that's being achieved through your partnership with Beijing and maybe just longer term, how is that Beijing or B1 arrangement just factoring into those longer term goals. Thank you very much.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nMaybe we'll take it in two parts. Let me just, at the high altitude, reiterate what I said at the beginning, Gregory, which is that, but the business is growing globally. All three of our geographic regions are growing. Our Japan, Asia Pacific business is the most rapidly growing of our regions right now. We're really pleased with the performance in Japan, China, and elsewhere in the region. The collaboration with Beijing continues to go well. Murdo, feel free to jump in and address any specifics about the portfolio there and the plans.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, both elements of our business in China are performing well. The Amgen affiliate business is growing nicely. That's essentially Repatha and Prolia, both products doing well. Both products listed on the national reimbursement drug list, and growing rapidly as Bob described. And with B1, formerly Beijing, our partnership, I think, has exceeded our expectations in China. The team executed extremely well across KYPROLIS, BLINCYTO, and XGEVA, and we continue to enjoy that partnership and feel good about it. Obviously, we continue to work closely with them on the other R&D projects that we've partnered on. Overall, pleased with that.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, we'll have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Gregory. Our last question will come from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question regarding denosumab and mostly franchise, mostly in the first sense. How should we think about the cadence of biosimilar erosion with the biosimilar coming, I'm assuming it is more back half loaded, but would love to get any color on how you are thinking about that?\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure. Murdo, you want to address that for Mohit?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Mohit. Well, we have a bit of a clearer understanding on the timing of when biosimilars will end, given the settlements that we've reached. I would agree that the slope of the biosimilar erosion is going to be, by definition of the timing, more towards the back end. I would just encourage everybody to remember the cadence of biosimilar erosion in general and the fact that we've got two slightly different situations here with XGEVA largely used in the oncology setting and Prolia used in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The slopes there could be different.\nOverall, we are in a good position given our participation in the biosimilar market. It teaches us lessons on how to defend successfully on the innovator side. We have a fairly large team of account executives that have been calling on our XGEVA and Prolia accounts for many years now. We are the bone market leader. And so there's a certain incumbency that we have that we think physicians as well to defend against other biosimilar competition as they enter the market.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay. Well, thank you all for your interest and appreciate you joining the call. We look forward to catching up after the next quarter. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our 2024 Q4 and full year earnings call. You may now disconnect."

We will also make some forward-looking statements which are qualified by our Safe Harbor Statement. Please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay. Well, thank you, Justin. Let me thank all of you for joining the call today. We're especially grateful, in light of all the volatility in the markets, that you would carve out the time to be with us. So thank you. Through the first half of the year, our business is performing well, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth. We're achieving strong results the same way we always have, which is by providing innovative medicines to address challenging diseases. Starting with the in-market portfolio, second-quarter revenues grew 20% to $8.4 billion, with numerous medicines delivering double-digit sales growth, including, in general medicine, Repatha and EVENITY, in oncology, of course, BLINCYTO, and in inflammation, TEZSPIRE.\nThen turning to rare disease, which delivered more than $1 billion in the quarter, I would highlight that KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA , and TAVNEOS each delivered at least double-digit sales growth in the quarter. TEPEZZA grew 8% year over year and 13% quarter over quarter. All of these first or best-in-class medicines are still early in their life cycles and have plenty of room to run through geographic expansion, new indications, and/or new formulations. You'll hear more about these brands in a moment. Turning to research and development, we believe our pipeline looks very promising as well, not just in obesity but across all of our therapeutic areas. We told you at the beginning of the year that we were anticipating more than a dozen significant pipeline milestones in 2024. Well, so far, so good.\nIn the second quarter alone, we received accelerated approval for IMDELLTRA, a landmark new medicine for small-cell lung cancer. In fact, the physicians I've spoken to since approval are really excited about this drug as the first meaningful innovation in decades for these patients. We also received approval for BLINCYTO in the front-line treatment for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on significantly improved overall survival rates. The front-line approval meaningfully expands the potential impact of BLINCYTO for all patients with BALL. We announced impressive Phase III data for UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease, which is a grievous illness for which there are no currently approved therapies of any kind. Building on our success with TEZSPIRE in treating severe asthma, we announced exciting data from our Phase II study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that earned this molecule breakthrough therapy designation.\nCOPD is the world's third leading cause of death, and new treatment options are very much needed. We look forward to additional data readouts later this year across therapeutic areas, highlighted, of course, by top-line data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study. We're encouraged by the emerging data in this field, particularly in cardiovascular and renal disease, areas of longstanding strategic focus for us. We are laser-focused on preparing to launch a broad Phase III program for MariTide that includes obesity, obesity-related conditions, and type 2 diabetes, and we're further ramping our investment to support MariTide and the rest of the pipeline. You'll hear more about that pipeline shortly on this call. All in all, this is a very exciting time for us at Amgen. As always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues all around the world for their enduring commitment to patients.\nNow let me turn things over to Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP, Amgen\n\nThanks, Bob. Execution was strong in the second quarter, driving 20% year-over-year sales growth, and all of our regions delivered attractive growth. Sales of 12 products grew at least double digits, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, TAVNEOS, and BLINCYTO, all brands that are important to our future growth. Starting with our general medicine portfolio, sales of Repatha, EVENITY, and Prolia collectively grew 20% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to $532 million for the second quarter, now well on its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 46%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we see increased recognition of the importance of lowering LDL cholesterol by healthcare providers, payers, and patients, which has significantly accelerated volume growth for Repatha.\nOur efforts have broadened insurance coverage and removed prior authorization requirements by several payers. In a recent survey, roughly 95% of cardiologists responded that Repatha is accessible and that access has improved significantly versus two years ago. EVENITY sales increased 39% year-over-year to $391 million for Q2. In the U.S., volume growth was supported by both increased prescription volume from existing EVENITY prescribers and an expansion of new prescribers. In Japan, EVENITY has been prescribed to approximately 600,000 patients to date and continues to be the segment leader with 45% of the bone builder segment. There are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to postmenopausal osteoporosis. We're encouraged by the growth momentum we are driving and have conviction in the potential for EVENITY to help even more patients. Prolia sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.2 billion for Q2.\nVolume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence demonstrating Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $234 million in sales in Q2. Sales increased 76% year-over-year, primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. We see strong growth opportunity for TEZSPIRE given its unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Otezla sales decreased 9% year-over-year for Q2, with 2% volume growth offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the U.S., we saw 3% year-over-year growth in new patient prescriptions in the quarter, driven by strong execution by our dermatology sales force, and increased Otezla direct-to-consumer media activity.\nWe've seen an increasingly competitive environment in dermatology with the introduction of novel topicals and new biologic treatments. Otezla retains an important role in this landscape given its broad label, safety profile, and unique positioning as a first systemic treatment option for patients with psoriasis. Enbrel sales decreased 15% year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by lower net selling price. Going forward, we expect continued declining net selling price and relatively flat volumes. Enbrel is known for its efficacy and trusted by physicians. Its substantial health benefits and cash flow generation provide a solid foundation for our business. Turning now to biosimilars, where sales of our biosimilar products were relatively stable year-over-year for the second quarter. We're positioned for future growth with upcoming launches. WEZLANA, a biosimilar to Stelara, and BEKEMV, a biosimilar to Soliris, are both expected to launch in the U.S. in Q1 of 2025.\nOur vertically integrated biosimilar business model ensures efficiency and provides attractive cash flows and returns for our shareholders. In oncology, sales of our seven innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA, and IMDELLTRA, grew 12% year-over-year for Q2, driven by volume growth and higher net selling price. In total, these products contributed almost $2 billion of sales in Q2. BLINCYTO's sales grew 28% year-over-year to $264 million for Q2, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B-cell ALL. BLINCYTO was recently granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a front-line consolidation treatment for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL. Our commercial and medical teams are engaging key academic, regional, and community customers in establishing BLINCYTO as a standard of care in this setting. LUMAKRAS sales increased 10% year-over-year to $85 million for Q2.\nWe see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 9% year-over-year to $270 million for the second quarter, now annualizing at over $1 billion. We also drove strong performance of KYPROLIS, which grew 9% year-over-year, and Nplate, which grew 12% year-over-year. Since our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA in mid-May, we generated $12 million of sales in the second quarter. IMDELLTRA was recently approved for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. We're seeing strong clinical conviction in IMDELLTRA in both academic and community settings. While very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the adoption of IMDELLTRA and look forward to its potential to bring new possibilities to patients living with this aggressive disease.\nI'm pleased with our execution in the quarter, driving accelerated performance for our most important growth brands. With that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who'll cover our rare disease portfolio.\n\nVikram Karnani\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations and Medical Affairs, Amgen\n\nThank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, which delivered product sales of over $1.1 billion in Q2. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, second quarter sales were $479 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. Recall that there are roughly 100,000 TED patients in the U.S., and penetration is currently only in the single digits. The main growth opportunity is within the roughly 80% of TED patients who have a low clinical activity score, or CAS. We are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many of the low CAS patients who can benefit from TEPEZZA.\nThe impact of thyroid eye disease on quality of life is often underestimated, so our focus is on educating healthcare providers about the significant effects on patients, even those with less visible symptoms. In addition, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology with a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space. We are also making significant strides in improving access thanks to the recognition of TEPEZZA's efficacy by payers. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 65% of U.S. covered lives, compared to 50% last quarter and just 5% roughly one year ago. We expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. International expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA, with regulatory filings complete or underway in multiple geographies, with Japan as the next significant launch expected by early 2025.\nWe also initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA, for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered $294 million in sales in Q2, representing 20% year-over-year growth, driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulation continues to redefine the standard of care for uncontrolled gout. UPLIZNA , for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, delivered $92 million in sales in Q2, representing 35% year-over-year growth. International expansion of UPLIZNA is also underway, with launches in multiple ex-US markets, including Canada, which launched earlier this year. In addition to NMOSD, we are excited about the impressive Phase III results with UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease and the potential it has to address a debilitating condition that impacts more than 20,000 patients in the U.S..\nWe also look forward to the Phase III readout for UPLIZNA in myasthenia gravis later this year. Jay will address these in more detail in a moment. Sales of TAVNEOS were $71 million for Q2. Sales increased 137% year-over-year, driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 3,500 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with TAVNEOS. Over 2,300 healthcare professionals have now prescribed TAVNEOS, a roughly 35% increase in the prescriber base so far this year. The integration of the legacy Horizon business is progressing nicely as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing and process development, and extensive global footprint. Now, I will pass it over to Jay for our R&D update.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. In second quarter, we rapidly advanced our broad clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. We received two approvals in the quarter, a breakthrough therapy designation, and delivered exciting clinical data for many programs while eagerly awaiting additional data readouts later this year. Let's begin with general medicine. As previously mentioned, based on the interim analysis, we are seeing a differentiated profile with MariTide and are confident it will address important unmet medical needs in obesity, obesity-related conditions, and type 2 diabetes. We remain on track and look forward to top-line 52-week data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study in late 2024. We are actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program in obesity, obesity-related conditions, and diabetes, along with a Phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity.\nBeyond MariTide, we continue to progress our early obesity programs that consist of both oral and injectable incretin and non-incretin approaches. We expect one of these programs to enter clinical development later this year. Also in GenMed is Olpaceran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine. The fully enrolled Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of Olpaceran continues to progress. To remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor that is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist. In oncology, we continue to deliver on high-conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering transformative clinical benefit for patients. Let's begin with IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager, or BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3 for small-cell lung cancer.\nWe're very pleased that the FDA granted accelerated approval to IMDELLTRA for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Further, we are pleased that the NCCN guidelines have been updated to include IMDELLTRA as a preferred option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval less than or equal to six months, and as another recommended treatment option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval greater than six months. Based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second- and third-line therapy, we are rapidly advancing IMDELLTRA into front-line therapy with three Phase III studies underway in both extensive and limited stage disease. One of these studies, DeLLphi-304, our confirmatory Phase III study in second-line small-cell lung cancer, has completed enrollment. Notably, IMDELLTRA is the first bispecific T-cell engager approved to treat a common solid tumor.\nThe present study of tarlatamab in earlier lines and in the context of lower tumor burden draws from our experience with our first approved bispecific T-cell engager, BLINCYTO, in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we observed a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease-negative patients along with improved tolerability. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T-cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells that are drivers of recurrence. This June, based on the profound survival benefit observed in the treatment of front-line disease, the FDA approved an additional indication for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients one month or older with CD19 positive, Philadelphia chromosome negative, B-cell ALL in the consolidation Phase of treatment here, regardless of minimal residual disease status.\nWe continue to seek to expand the impact of BLINCYTO in newly diagnosed BALL through ongoing studies and with the further investigation of subcutaneous administration. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, has also demonstrated profound clinical activity in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, importantly demonstrating our ability to target a second common solid tumor with a bispecific T-cell engager therapy. We are rapidly advancing this program and have now fully enrolled the monotherapy Phase I dose expansion as we continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts. Further, we are advancing the study of xaluritamig earlier in the prostate cancer treatment paradigm with combinations of xaluritamig and enzalutamide or abiraterone ongoing, while we plan additional studies in earlier disease settings. In sum, we regard IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO, and xaluritamig as major advances, further establishing the broad potential of our leading bispecific T-cell engager platform.\nTo round out oncology, we have completed enrollment of FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab, a first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody administered in combination with chemotherapy in first-line gastric cancer. We are also rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor developed for MTAP-null solid tumors as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Additional data from the Phase I dose escalation and initial dose expansion study of AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-null solid tumors will be presented at ESMO in September. Lastly, we are pleased also to share that the FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to AMG 193 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Turning to inflammation, we are encouraged by the data arising from our Phase II study of TEZSPIRE in patients with moderate to very severe COPD.\nTogether with AstraZeneca, we are actively planning for Phase III development in COPD. We are also pleased to announce that the FDA recently granted TEZSPIRE a breakthrough therapy designation as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD characterized by the eosinophilic phenotype. Beyond COPD, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in separate Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis, and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top-line data are expected later this year. Turning to rocatinlimab, a first-in-class T-cell rebalancing monoclonal antibody targeting the OX40 receptor. The comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase III rocket program has successfully enrolled over 3,100 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Five of the eight studies are now fully enrolled.\nThe Phase III Horizon study, part of this rocket program, evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and it is ongoing with data readout anticipated in H2. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore the potential of rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a Phase II study in moderate to severe asthma, as well as a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Shifting to rare disease, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid to late-stage opportunities. UPLIZNA , a CD19 B-cell depleting therapy, offers a differentiated mechanism of action than other autoimmune therapies, durable efficacy with a convenient every six-month IV dosing schedule. This could be very important for chronic inflammatory diseases.\nRecently, we were excited to announce positive top-line results from a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing an astonishing 87% reduction in the risk of IgG4-related disease flare as compared to placebo during the 52-week placebo-controlled window. All key secondary endpoints were also met, and no new safety signals were identified. This is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate efficacy in the IgG4-related disease patient population. Regulatory filing activities are underway, and full data from the trial will be presented at a future medical meeting. We are also studying UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis through the ongoing Phase III MINT study.\nThe MINT study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis, who are of a comparable disease severity and a comparable treatment experience to other recently approved biologic therapies. We are investigating UPLIZNA in the two predominant antibody serotypes that drive this disease: acetylcholine receptor positive and in muscle-specific tyrosine kinase positive patients. MINT is the only trial attempting to demonstrate efficacy while removing the treatment benefit of steroids. Patients in the MINT trial who entered on steroids had a protocol-specified taper by 24 weeks. We look forward to data readout the second half of 2024. To expand the impact of our CD19-directed therapeutics to even more patients suffering from serious inflammatory diseases compelled by both biological inferences and insights from small studies of CD19-directed therapies, we are launching a development program targeting CD19 positive B-cell-mediated autoimmune disease with UPLIZNA and blinatumomab.\nThis is an exciting and promising space. With Amgen's strong capabilities in inflammatory disease and two well-characterized assets, we are very well positioned to lead in this rapidly advancing field. We will have more to say about these programs in due course. Lastly, in May, the FDA approved BEKEMV as the first interchangeable biosimilar to Soliris, or eculizumab. Also in biosimilar development, registration-enabling studies are underway for ABP 234, a biosimilar candidate to KEYTRUDA, and ABP 206, a biosimilar candidate to OPDIVO. In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness, their intense focus, and spirited collaboration during this momentous year, and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business through this portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. I'll now turn it over to Peter.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nThank you, Jay.\nWe're pleased with our strong second quarter performance and are on track with our 2024 full-year goals and long-term objectives. We have a strong long-term growth outlook across our four therapeutic areas, driven by the breadth and depth of our innovative pipeline and in-market products serving patients with serious illnesses around the globe. Starting with our second quarter results, as shown on slide 27 of the slide deck, we delivered $8.4 billion in total revenue, a 20% increase year over year. It's the highest quarterly revenue in Amgen history, achieved with 26% volume growth. This means more patients than ever are receiving Amgen medicines. Excluding the addition of Horizon products, sales increased 5% year over year, driven by 10% volume growth. In the second quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 48.2% as a percentage of product sales, with total non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 30% year over year.\nNon-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher royalties and profit share due to changes in sales mix. Non-GAAP R&D spending in the second quarter increased 30% year over year as we strategically invested in the late-stage pipeline, including MariTide, rocatinlimab, and bemarituzumab, as well as Horizon acquired programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 36% year over year, primarily driven by the addition of Horizon. Excluding the addition of Horizon, non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 14% year over year, driven by investment in Repatha, Otezla, and EVENITY. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $700 million expense, up $400 million year over year, almost entirely due to increased interest expenses from the Horizon acquisition. We remain on track to deleverage, with line of sight to retiring greater than $10 billion of debt by the end of 2025.\nThis includes $1.4 billion of debt retired in the second quarter and $2.0 billion year to date. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.5 percentage points year over year to 14.9%, primarily due to the change in sales mix from the inclusion of Horizon. In the second quarter of 2024, the company generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, a decrease of $3.8 billion, a decrease from $3.8 billion in the previous year, driven by the timing of tax payments. In 2023, federal tax payments, including our repatriation tax, were made in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2024, these payments were made in the second quarter. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach $500 million in pre-tax synergies by year three post-acquisition, with roughly 50% to be realized by the end of this year. We expect decrease in the non-GAAP earnings per share in 2024.\nWe continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. We're investing in the best innovation, both internally and externally, to rapidly advance an innovative pipeline with multiple potentially first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines across the four therapeutic areas. As I said earlier, this is reflected in our Q2 non-GAAP R&D spend of $1.4 billion, an increase of 30% year over year. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth. We are expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, including investments to support MariTide. Beyond manufacturing, we are opening a new global technology and innovation center in Hyderabad, India, which will attract talent at scale and accelerate digital capabilities across the organization, including artificial intelligence, data science, life science, and medical. And third, we return capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividends of $2.25 per share in Q2. This represented a 6% increase compared to 2023.\nTurning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on slide 29, we expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.8 to 33.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $19.10 and $20.10. I will mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. On revenues, we expect mid-single-digit growth quarter over quarter in the fourth quarter compared to Q3. Our full-year non-GAAP R&D expenses are now expected to increase more than 25% year over year as we further invest in our late-stage pipeline to support multiple late-stage studies underway across all therapeutic areas. As a result, we now project the full-year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 47%, with Q3 operating margin lower than Q2. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter are expected to grow at a similar rate to the first two quarters of this year.\nWe expect OI&E to be approximately $2.5 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 15% to 16% range, including the full-year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. As we have previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide manufacturing capacity. To support these initial efforts, we now expect capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2024 versus our most recent guidance of $1.1 to 1.2 billion. Our long-term outlook remains robust, and I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. This concludes our financial update. We will now begin our Q&A session. Julianne, please remind our participants of the process. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press star followed by one. Again, to ask a question, press star one. Our first question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nYaron Werber\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotechnology Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. And very nice result. Thanks so much. Jay, maybe a question for you, actually. I want to start with UPLIZNA . And we noticed a few things. The MINT study was supposed to have completion around mid-May, and Amgen just posted a whole bunch of new job postings for gMG. And you have a slot on 15 October at the MGFA to present the data. As you noted, you're doing steroid tapering.\nIt's a different trial design, but you also did steroid tapering in the other two indications, NMO and IgG4. Can you talk a little bit sort of what are you hoping to see and what are you expecting to see from the data? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThank you, Yaron, for the question and for following the program so closely. We're very excited about UPLIZNA . This CD19 B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody is showing really remarkable activity. The result in IgG4-related disease as a bellwether is quite dramatic, with a hazard ratio of 0.13, a P value of, what, five to the minus seven. This was a stunning result and the first positive Phase III for patients with IgG4-related diseases. As you nicely picked up in your question, one of the opportunities of UPLIZNA is to get patients off steroids.\nThis is therefore a predefined ambition of UPLIZNA in both IgG4-related disease setting and that study, as well as in the generalized myasthenia gravis setting. Now, these results won't be available until the second half of this year, and so I have no further update on that timing. But do stay tuned. We're so hopeful that this once every six month CD19 B-cell-depleting therapy can differentiate substantially from available treatments like steroids and other B-cell-targeting therapies and make a big difference for these patients.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nGreat, Julianne. Let's go to the next question.\nThank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nManaging Director of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.\nJust following up here on Yaron's, could you speak to the clinical bar for UPLIZNA and myasthenia gravis, both on a placebo-adjusted basis and also an absolute basis, given the notable steroid taper, which I believe the other therapies did not have included in their design? And with regard to this MGFA scientific session meeting, should we expect top-line results before that presentation? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThanks, Salveen. As I just mentioned to Yaron, we won't be providing further guidance on the timing of the results from the UPLIZNA study, the MINT study, and myasthenia gravis, but do stay tuned. And as also I shared, knowing that patients with myasthenia gravis are repeatedly and over many, many months of treatment challenged by the requirement for persistent steroids, we built in a taper on steroids onto this study.\nThese results, to read out in the second half of this year, will bring to light exactly how successful we are at liberating patients from steroids with every six months of UPLIZNA .\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Well, not a huge growth driver. I'd love it if you could characterize some of your negotiations with CMS on Enbrel. Many of your peers are pleased with kind of the fair price that they negotiated with CMS. Do you feel the same way? We'd also love to know how you're thinking about the impact of Part D redesign. Thank you so much.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP, Amgen\n\nThanks, Evan, for the question. It's Murdo here.\nOverall, Enbrel continues to do well in the market despite a very competitive market in psoriatic arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis. We also continue to have relatively stable volume despite all of the conversion that's going on in adalimumab with biosimilars. So we're quite pleased with prescribers' adoption and continued value of Enbrel safety and tolerability, which is well established over a long period of time now, many, many years of experience. The process with CMS has concluded. We do have our price. I would just remind you that roughly 25% of Enbrel revenues come from Medicare Part D, so that will in part mitigate the impact of the CMS price reduction. And we continue to see that this is not a good mechanism to incentivize and reward innovation and that it does not resemble what one would commonly describe as a negotiation.\nSo we've concluded that process, and we continue to look to help patients and support them with Enbrel in the market. We will watch the Part D redesign closely. We will look to see how PBMs redesign their formularies, and we will look to see how patients are impacted by the new model. While the cap may help, the out-of-pocket for many patients may actually rise. So we're watching it closely.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, next question, please.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nThank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Mike Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMike Yee\n\nManaging Director in Healthcare Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you for the question. Pivoting to obesity, I know that you are on track for data later this year for the injectable product, which you claim is differentiated. As other competitors have moved quickly, both with their programs with injectables, but also orals, multiple companies are putting orals.\nCan you just comment about how you feel about your positioning in this space, given others have multiple products moving to late stage, and how you feel you can position yourself here, given just 133? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThanks, Mike. Why don't I get started? And Murdo, perhaps you could add on at the end. We are very pleased with the results that we've seen at the interim, with the overall conduct of the Phase II study. Though there's been no further analysis since the interim, as of the interim, all the arms were active, dropout had not been an issue, and we saw a differentiated profile with MariTide and remain confident that this medicine can address significant and important unmet medical need in obesity, obesity-related conditions, and in particular, type 2 diabetes, as shared earlier in the call.\nThere's no question that there is quite a democratized and broad base of innovation in this space, and potentially oral medicines could serve to address some of that still vast and remaining unmet need, and we follow these programs very closely. Still, the development of MariTide is advancing very briskly as we now move to rapidly initiate a broad Phase III program, and we remain confident in what MariTide can offer for patients with obesity-related conditions as well as diabetes. Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP, Amgen\n\nYep, thanks, Jay. I think the data continue to emerge in the obesity and obesity-related conditions landscape and show clear benefit that reducing weight will indeed, with GLP-1-based mechanisms, will indeed improve outcomes in many disease settings. So that continues to expand the market and grow it.\nI do agree with Jay that there will be patients who may seek oral options, but I continue to believe that we have a very good differentiated product here and that monthly dosing, or even less frequently, will continue to help patients persist on their weight loss medication and achieve, hopefully, some of those hard endpoint risk reductions that we're seeing in clinical trial presentations. I would say that we would purport that we have a really good, convenient dosing here with a single-use pen that we're working on and that weekly injectable products are probably more vulnerable to orals than a convenient monthly dosing.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nNext question, please, Julianne.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mike. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on MariTide, if I may. Two-part question.\nFirst, it looks like your competitors are moving forward to Phase III on either smaller data sets or further along from a Phase II, Phase III perspective. Just curious why you thought you definitely needed 52-week data. Was that mostly conservatism, or was that some FDA feedback as well? And then also on CapEx, I feel like the $150 million guidance increase seemed relatively trivial, but it does imply CapEx being up 80% over first half. Could you please expand on whether it's API-related or something else you have in mind? Thank you very much.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYes, thanks, Pete. Why don't I start on the overall development plan for MariTide and the value of the Phase II data that we'll have at the end of this year? Umer, as you know, this medicine coming out of Phase I showed a quite remarkable impact on obesity with a dramatic reduction in BMI.\nIt actually proved quite durable after just three doses of MariTide in that Phase I study. We saw persistent weight loss really out 150 days or more at some doses. The Phase II study is a much larger concern. This is a 592-patient study. It has 11 arms. It tests monthly, or as Murdo said, even less frequent dosing. It has a part II that allows us to really follow up on this durability signal, and it will allow the precision selection of dose or doses that patients and their practitioners really desire. This also conforms to regulatory requirements entering into Phase III.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nUmer's feedback on CapEx, as we previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide's manufacturing capacity to support those efforts. I said we now expect CapEx of $1.3 billion in 2024 versus the most recent guidance, which was $1.1 to 1.2 billion.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJay Olson\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOh, hey. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on all the progress, especially in your BiTE platform. Can you talk about any feedback you're getting from clinicians on the IMDELLTRA launch and potential lessons learned from BLINCYTO that you can leverage for IMDELLTRA, especially since you're launching BLINCYTO now in B-ALL and developing a subcu formulation? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nTake it in a couple of parts here. Murdo, do you want to share what we're learning from the launch?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Jay. Obviously, it's very early given that this was a mid-May approval, but I have to say we are extremely pleased with how both thought leaders and community oncologists are receiving IMDELLTRA in the market. Their clinical conviction is very high.\nThey are moving quickly to establish care pathways for these patients given the monitoring requirement for IMDELLTRA. And this disease setting, as you know, is a really difficult disease setting. Patients can progress relatively rapidly after platinum-based chemotherapy in the front line. And so we're obviously moving very quickly with our medical teams, our account management teams, and our sales organization to build rapid awareness and to help both academic and community oncology accounts be able to treat patients easily and safely and have the appropriate settings for care follow-up. So very early, but this product is seen as a major transformation in this disease setting. Jay?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Jay. You picked up on something really interesting, and that's leveraging the learnings of BLINCYTO. This really is a platform capability that we enjoy with bispecific T-cell engagers.\nAlready in the development of IMDELLTRA after its first approval, we are seeing significant read-through of the BLINCYTO lessons, moving from later lines of therapy to earlier lines of therapy to drive efficacy in the setting of reduced tumor burden. The utility of these medicines in combination, which is so much easier to access and assess than other complex modalities, say, like CAR-T, and moving these medicines to the point of therapy where they can have their greatest impact, namely front line, also pathways to reduce monitoring. Jay, we are leveraging all the learnings of BLINCYTO to drive and expedite the development of IMDELLTRA to be a component of front line small cell lung cancer therapy, both with extensive stage and limited stage disease. As Myrtle shared, we do this work really quite inspired by the impact of the medicine even so early in its launch.\nSignificant demand to learn and access and offer this medicine.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nJay, I might just add that when it comes to xaluritamig, I think your question applies well there too. So stay tuned. We'll talk more about xaluritamig as data emerge, but we're optimistic about how we can apply the lessons of BLIN and IMDELLTRA to that as well. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question for Jay. Again, on MariTide, is there any reason to think that MariTide may or may not exhibit a different profile versus [Zepbound] on parameters such as lipid, blood pressure, or C-reactive protein?\nAnd how important is benefit on those parameters while you design your Phase III trial, something like outcomes trial or not? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thank you, Mohit. I can surely understand the interest. And indeed, we are making all these measurements and more. We won't dimensionalize what we mean when we say differentiated profile at this time. We're so focused on completing this ongoing and well-conducted MariTide Phase II study. But do expect to learn this and more when ultimately we're able to be in a position to share the outcomes of part A of the Phase II study. We are taking a comprehensive assessment to optimize dose and schedule and impact of this medicine.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Great. Thanks.\n\nGregory Renza\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst of Biotechnology Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nCongratulations on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. My question is just on the obesity franchise. As you and the team had mentioned, to expect one of the early obesity programs to enter clinical development later this year. Just curious if you could elaborate on what lens you're using to nominate that first or that next program. I'd imagine it's rather complex in the assessment, and any color you have on determining that choice and how to take that forward would be great. Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nGregory, thank you. This is Jay. Thanks for following the early pipeline and its development. It's developing very nicely.\nAs we've shared our strategy in the development of obesity medicines and medicines for obesity-related conditions, we're interested in really harvesting the insights of the Incretin pathway, but also moving beyond this pathway to other novel targets, some supported by genetic inferences, but all of them supported by strong preclinical development packages. So it is a multifactorial assessment that leads to the decision to resource the medicine in human clinical investigation, but it's a high degree of conviction that's required as the bar is ever rising within our portfolio for that resource as well as in the field. So more to follow on the mechanism and characteristics of this new medicine that we're intending to advance into clinical investigation in the second half of this year.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nAll right. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nYour line is open.\n\nChris Raymond\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. And if I may, another obesity question. Just on MariTide, and I've heard you guys now talk for a long time about planning for a broad Phase III program, but I don't think you guys have ever talked, even in general generalities, when exactly this will happen. Can you maybe give a range here for when you anticipate kicking off enrollment in that program?\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nChris, as you can expect, we're focused now on completing the Phase II trial and moving as swiftly as appropriate into Phase III. So we'll have more to say that over the course of the coming year. You can appreciate it's a competitively intense field, so we're not giving dates at this point.\n\nChris Raymond\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood afternoon.\nThank you for taking the question. For Peter, on August 2nd, the U.S. Tax Court entered a decision against Coke. Their litigation was often referenced as sort of the best benchmark for sort of what you're facing. Appreciating that you took the deposit earlier this year, but why shouldn't there be read-through from that case? And maybe you could speak to your overall confidence in the outcome. Thank you.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nYeah. No, thank you very much for the question, Carter. Nothing has changed in our evaluation of the case. Court date set for November 4th. We're confident in our position, right where we've always been. We're confident in our reserves are at an appropriate level. And what I would say is, first of all, I don't think, and Coke hasn't been as much a reference, and I won't get into making comparisons.\nWe refer once in a while to the Medtronic situation. But in general, what we've seen is that the tax court in the last several years has reinforced the value of manufacturing down in Puerto Rico. So we look forward to stating our case. We're very confident where we're at. That's all we've got to say at this time. No change. We're at where we were in terms of confidence, which has been the same place for the last two and a half or three years now.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, next question, please. Thank you, Carter.\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Pharma & Biotech Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Peter, another one for you here.\nI appreciate the incremental guidance on CapEx, but just was wondering if you could speak directionally about margins in 2025 given the likely scope of the MariTide obesity program. Thank you.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen",
    "content2": "Terence, as you know, we don't guide long-term margins. But let me just comment on what you're seeing this year. I'm happy to speak to that. And I think it's important. At Amgen, we're committed to a capital allocation hierarchy where we first invest in innovation and first internal innovation. And so with that in mind, Terence, we've consistently said that we would flex out margin, which remember, with us, it's a percentage of product sales, not revenue, if there were opportunities to achieve strong after-tax cash returns on our investment in excess of our hurdle rate, and that we would communicate that ahead of time.\nSo this year, we shared with you at the beginning of the year we felt operating margin would be about 48%. We see an opportunity here during the year to make some investments in the research and development activities with an emphasis, I would say, on development. That's up 30% year-over-year in the quarter, non-GAAP R&D. We now see non-GAAP R&D spend up over 25% year-over-year for 2024, which we think is great because you've heard about the deep, mid, and late-stage pipeline we have driving MariTide in that deep, mid, and late-stage pipeline. We're always focused, Terence, whether it's this year or next year, on productivity and prioritization, always looking for opportunities to generate capital, to allocate the innovation. We've got a new program called Technology and Workforce Strategy that we're moving along at speed and scale.\nI spoke about opening a new technology and innovation center in Hyderabad, India, that we're doing everything we can to preserve that margin, reallocate capital innovation, and be the disciplined spenders of capital that Amgen always has been.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nAll right. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. Just had a question on MariTide and your plans in that Phase II diabetes study. Company, obviously, very excited about the broader opportunity for the drug, but it does seem like diabetes is a more established market with maybe less of the capacity constraints than we see in obesity. So could you just talk a little bit about what you think you need to see to be able to compete here and dislodge incumbents?\nCan you also confirm that this study is not needed to move forward in the Phase III obesity studies? And it's just a completely separate program related to the diabetes piece of things. Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nI think that goes into pieces again. Jay, why don't you address the first piece, and then Murdo, feel free to jump in.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYes. No, absolutely. As you nicely identified, later this year, we will initiate an additional dedicated Phase II study that will characterize MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. And this new study is not a gating step at all for the Phase III program for patients with obesity, but conforms to regulatory guidance and, importantly, allows us to optimize dosing for the diabetic patient, where medically, I can say, Murdo, I invite your considerable perspectives.\nI'm unaware of a highly efficacious monthly or less frequently administered medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP, Amgen\n\nYep. Thanks, Jay. I would agree with you that the differentiation that we've talked about for chronic weight management would hold in a robust way in type 2 diabetes. And while there are lots of products that can control hyperglycemia and provide HbA1c control, there is a significant benefit if you can improve adherence and persistence. And we do believe that our monthly dosing could do that.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nNext question, please, Julianne.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nBiotech Equity Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Another obesity question, but slightly tangential. I'm not sure if you've talked about this before, but there's been conversation about muscle preservation in people who are losing weight on GLPs.\nHave you evaluated this aspect with MariTide? Do you see this being a problem broadly in this space? And if so, where do you think MariTide would fit into that landscape? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure. Jay, why don't you jump in there?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nSure. No, thank you for your question. We, as you apparently do as well, are following this class, banded class of medicines that provoke remarkable weight loss for the impact on healthy tissues, including but not limited to muscle. And the associated muscle loss that has been reported in the literature may relate mechanistically. It may also relate to the quite dramatic cadence of weight loss of patients treated with these medicines. And in the fullness of time, we and others will have that answer.\nAs you can imagine, we're making many of these measurements on our own study and don't have any report, any data to report to you here today. But we too are following this and also the progress of some organizations that are seeking to administer medicines to support muscle loss with obesity medicines. That is quite interesting to us given our legacy of muscle biology. But I would say these are early insights from the field. To my knowledge, they have not proven as yet to be debilitating to the patient. But we, like you, follow with interest.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, seeing we're getting to the top half of the hour here, maybe we'll just take two more questions.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Thank you, Kripa. Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nFor the next obesity asset that's entering clinics later this year, can you specify whether this asset is aimed to fill in for 786 and whether this next obesity asset will work in tandem with 133? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThanks, James. We won't today provide any further insight into this medicine. It's just too early, and as Bob shared, this is, nicely for patients, a very competitive space. But as I shared earlier, in our deeper pipeline in obesity, we remain interested in incretin pathway. We remain interested in injectable. We're also pursuing oral medicines. And so in the fullness of time, we'll have a chance to share more. We're really playing the long game to drive true differentiation, benefit to the patient, and to access segments of the market that are not well addressed even by the current medicines.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP and Head of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nAnd Julianne, let's take our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, James.\nOur last question will come from Gary Nachman from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nOkay. Thanks. Good afternoon. So shifting to TEPEZZA, when do you think we'll see more of an acceleration in the low CAS patients? How has reimbursement been improving for those patients? And describe how much the Japanese opportunity could help next year. And then just talk about the overall resources you're putting behind TEPEZZA and the rest of the rare disease portfolio that's obviously a much bigger focus for you now. If that continues to ramp up, at what pace, and when you might get more operating leverage from that rare disease business? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nThere's a lot of questions there, Gary, but I want to take it in a couple of pieces. Go ahead, Vikram.\n\nVikram Karnani\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations and Medical Affairs, Amgen\n\nYeah. So thanks for the question, Gary.\nLook, we're pretty pleased with how we've been executing on TEPEZZA this year and driving it towards growth. As you rightly observed, there are a significant number of low CAS patients or low clinical activity score patients that are suffering from this disease who are not being appropriately treated. And specifically, that's about 80,000 out of the 100,000 addressable patients in the U.S.. What we have been doing is seeing significant momentum on expanding our prescriber base, which now, in addition to oculoplastic surgeons, also includes ophthalmologists, and endocrinologists. And this is a really important element here. The strategic focus in endocrinology is really important so that we can serve those low CAS patients, the low CAS patients, favorably. You asked about improving access. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 65% of U.S. covered lives.\nAnd if you compare that to 50% last quarter and just over 5% about a year ago, I think we've made pretty good progress in enabling patient access using our Phase IV data that had become available last year. So we continue to see a significant growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S., while also recognizing that as we make progress with a lot of our execution efforts, there continues to be a time lag between when we knock down barriers for access, expand our prescriber base, and see patients get on therapy.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nIn Japan, Gary, we expect that there'll be, again, an attractive market and that this will be well received in that country. And we'll talk about that once we've launched there during the course of next year.\nWith respect to leverage, I think I would just offer that we're on track with respect to our synergy targets there, and we'll begin to get even more leverage as we're able to take full control of the supply chain for the rare disease products. And then I would just further observe, as we've said many times, that we feel fortunate that there's a good overlap between some of our existing capabilities in sales and marketing and the needs of those rare disease products. So all in all, remain really excited about what we're able to do for rare disease patients, the position we have, and the likelihood of that just improving over time. So with that, let me thank all of you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nI know we've gone a few minutes over the set time, but thank you all for participating in the call, and we'll look forward to regrouping with you after the third quarter. Thanks."

Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures, describe our performance, and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary.\nMaterially. Over to you, Bob.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, thank you, Justin, and thank you to our callers for joining us today. This is a busy and exciting time here at Amgen, and as you can see from our results, we're reaching many more patients around the world with our existing medicines, advancing a broad range of potential first in class medicines in our mid and late stage pipeline, and redefining what's possible in research as we integrate wet and dry lab capabilities and harness transformative technologies. I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter that give me great confidence that we're on a path to deliver attractive long term growth. First, we have a number of products across general medicine, oncology, and inflammation that have strong momentum and still plenty of room to grow. These include Repatha, which was up 33%, BLINCYTO up 26%, and up 80%.\nWith BLINCYTO. We expect an approval in June that should accelerate our efforts to integrate into earlier treatment lines for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with . We'll share data later this month that reflect the attractive potential of this medicine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death. Clearly, new treatments are very much needed, and we're excited by 's potential to make a difference there. Second, our newest pillar of growth, Rare Disease, contributed nearly $1 billion of sales in the quarter, up 14% compared with the sales of these products from a year ago. We see significant upside potential for first-in-class early life cycle medicines like TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, , and TAVNEOS, and we're pursuing launches in new geographic markets, new indications, and/or new formulations for each.\nAs an example, we announced last week our imminent plans to file TEPEZZA for approval in the European Union. Overall, the integration of Horizon, its people, products, and pipeline is proceeding well, reflecting the strong fit between our organizations. Third, we're rapidly advancing a number of promising new medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline spanning all four of our therapeutic areas. We are awaiting approval for tarlatamab, for example, and look forward to bringing this transformative innovation to patients with small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first T cell engagement therapy to demonstrate significant clinical activity against a common solid tumor. A watershed moment in a field that Amgen pioneered and continues to lead. Looking to the rest of the year, we anticipate data readouts from five phase III trials.\nIn addition, we announced today the development of a biosimilar to Keytruda as we look to build upon the global leadership we've established in biosimilars. In sum, we have a broad range of medicines in hand today and coming through our pipeline that will enable us to meet the needs of millions of patients around the world and deliver strong growth through the end of the decade and beyond. Now, let me just add one other important update. Whereas we don't normally comment on interim data, especially for a phase II trial, we recognize there's significant interest in obesity and MariTide. So we'll provide additional commentary today.\nThe interim phase II analysis for this study is complete, and we are very encouraged with the results that we've seen thus far and with the conduct of the trial. Following the interim analysis, I would say we're confident in MariTide's differentiated profile and believe it will address important unmet medical needs. We are actively planning a broad phase III program including obesity, obesity-related conditions, and diabetes. Obviously, we expect to carefully complete our ongoing phase II trial before then moving as swiftly as appropriate to establish the safety and efficacy of this potential medicine. In phase III trials, we've initiated activities as well to further expand manufacturing capacity with both clinical and commercial supply in mind. Jay will provide a few additional remarks with respect to this ongoing study.\nI would ask you to recognize that to protect the integrity of the study beyond this update, we would not expect to discuss these data in further detail before completion. As always, I want to thank our employees around the world for their commitment to our business and to the patients we serve. Jay, I'm going to turn it over to you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nThank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with MariTide. Reiterating Bob's comments, we are very pleased with the results to date of MariTide thus far, and we're very pleased with the overall conduct of the ongoing phase II trial. All arms remain active, patient dropout has not been an issue, and we're fully on track for top-line 52-week data from this 11-arm phase II study in late 2024. We're seeing a differentiated profile with MariTide and are confident that it will address important unmet medical needs, obesity, obesity-related conditions, and diabetes. We look forward to completing the ongoing phase II study and working with regulators to move rapidly to the broad phase III program. Later this year, we plan to initiate an additional dedicated phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity.\nThis new trial is not a gating step for our phase III program in patients with obesity. Informed by dose and schedule insights from the ongoing phase II obesity study, the dedicated phase II study in diabetes conforms to regulatory requirements for phase III and is the next step towards the diabetes indication for MariTide. In terms of patient experience, we expect to deliver MariTide in a convenient handheld patient-friendly auto injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single injection administration. Assuming eventual approval across the portfolio, we are presently prioritizing differentiated medicines, those that stand to provide the greatest benefit for patients. Given the profile we've seen with AMG 786, we will not pursue further development. Instead, in obesity, we're differentially investing in MariTide and a number of preclinical assets beyond MariTide.\nIn the first quarter, we rapidly advanced our diverse clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. Looking ahead, the remainder of 2024 promises to be an exciting time for research and development with two PDUFA dates in June for tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer and BLINCYTO in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as five phase III data readouts. Each of these milestones could represent a significant advance towards our mission to deliver groundbreaking treatments to patients in real need. Moving to olpasiran, we're pleased to announce we've completed enrollment of the Ocean A Outcomes trial, a phase III cardiovascular outcome study of olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine.\nReflecting both our commitment to patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and the strong interest of the medical community, we successfully enrolled 7,297 patients across the globe in just 15 and a half months. To our knowledge, this is the fastest enrolling phase III outcome study of its size. To remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor which is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist in oncology. We continue to deliver on high conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering large effect size for patients. Starting with tarlatamab, a first-in-class BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. We remain on track with an FDA priority review for a 12 June PDUFA date.\nWe're excited about tarlatamab as potentially the first selective therapy for small cell lung cancer based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second- and third-line therapy. We are rapidly advancing tarlatamab into frontline treatment with three phase III studies now initiated in both extensive-stage and limited-stage disease. The rationale for studying tarlatamab in earlier lines in the context of lower tumor burden draws from our experience with BLINCYTO and B-cell ALL, where we saw a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease-negative patients. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T-cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells, which are primarily the drivers of recurrent disease.\nWe're hopeful we can build on this insight with Tarlatamab where comparable activity in early stage small cell lung cancer patients would very meaningfully improve outcomes for patients facing the challenge of this aggressive cancer. In sum, we regard Tarlatamab as a major advance as the first bispecific T cell engager to demonstrate efficacy in a common solid tumor, further establishing the broad potential of our bispecific T cell engager platform. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule Xaluritamig has also demonstrated unambiguous activity in a solid tumor, namely prostate cancer, continues to advance following the presentation of encouraging phase I data last fall. We have now fully enrolled the monotherapy phase I dose expansion and continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts.\nFurther combination studies with Xaluritamig and novel hormonal therapies are progressing in dose escalation studies with near term plans to initiate dose expansion cohorts. To round out oncology, we are rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor targeting MTAP-null solid tumors. We've moved forward with monotherapy dose expansion studies and have initiated two additional phase I studies targeting MTAP-null tumors in thoracic, gastrointestinal, biliary tract, and pancreatic cancers, exploring relevant combinations with standard of care in our inflammation portfolio. We're encouraged by the results of the phase II a proof of concept study which investigated in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. This study was designed to test TSLP inhibition across an intentionally broad range of eosinophil levels irrespective of inflammatory drivers, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and smoking status.\nWhile achieved a clinically meaningful 17% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo. This result fell short of statistical significance, likely owing to the broad overall patient demographic. However, even greater reductions in COPD exacerbations were observed in a planned subgroup of patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts greater than 150 cells per microliter, with a trend for further reduction in a small number of subjects with baseline counts greater than 300. We're excited by these data, which will be presented in an oral session of the American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting later this month. Together with our partner AstraZeneca, we're actively planning for phase III development of and COPD.\nBeyond COPD, we continue to explore in separate phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top-line data are expected in the second half of this year. The Rocatinlimab Rocket phase III program for rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, has successfully enrolled over 2,800 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Indeed, three of the eight studies in the rocatinlimab Rocket Study Program are now fully enrolled. The phase III Horizons Study, part of this Rocket Program, evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and remains on track for top-line data readout in the second half of this year.\nBeyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to broadly explore rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a phase II study in moderate to severe asthma with plans to initiate a phase III study in Prurigo Nodularis in the second half of this year. We're encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline as well with several mid- to late-stage opportunities starting with UPLIZNA. We anticipate important phase III data readouts this year in Myasthenia Gravis and IgG4-related disease, both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients. Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40 ligand inhibitor fusion protein, has entered phase III for Sjogren's Disease with two studies now enrolling patients. This follows encouraging phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden.\nBemarituzumab is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in the latter patient population. Lastly, in our biosimilars portfolio, we've initiated a phase III study of ABP 234, a biosimilar candidate to Keytruda, in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We're also pleased to announce that Wezlana, our biosimilar candidate to Stelara, has received a positive CHMP opinion. In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business to our portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines, and I'll now turn it over to Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThanks, Jay. I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Strong execution resulted in sales growth of 22% year over year, which, with robust volume growth across the four therapeutic pillars of our business, we drove compelling growth across our regions with 10 products delivering at least double-digit volume growth, including Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, TAVNEOS, and BLINCYTO.\nOur integration of the Legacy Horizon business continues to progress well with that portfolio generating $914 million in the quarter. Sales in our general medicines business, including Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY, and Aimovig, grew 18% year over year in the first quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 33% year over year to a record of $517 million for the first quarter, and Repatha is now well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business.\nIn the quarter we saw year over year volume growth of 44% partially offset with 13% lower net selling price.\nExpanded formulary coverage for Repatha in the US has accelerated volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from higher rebates to support and expand access for patients. We expect this expanded formulary coverage, along with the removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers, will lead to increased cardiologist and primary care physician adoption. Outside the US, we also delivered strong growth helping even more patients reduce their cardiovascular risk. EVENITY had record sales of $342 million for the quarter, and in the US volume growth was supported by an expansion of EVENITY prescribers.\nIn Japan, EVENITY continues to be the segment leader with 46% of the bone builder market, and while we're happy with the growth of EVENITY, this, there are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to their postmenopausal osteoporosis, and we see exciting growth potential for EVENITY to combat this risk, and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure EVENITY reaches all the patients who need it. Prolia sales grew 8% year over year. Volume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence reaffirming Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture. In our inflammation business, Otezla sales increased 1% year over year for Q1. In the US, we saw strong new patient volume growth early in the quarter.\nThis was disrupted in February and March by the Change Healthcare cybersecurity issue which created challenges for some patients trying to fill prescriptions at specialty pharmacies. We've seen a return to accelerating new patient prescription growth in recent weeks. We see significant potential for future growth of Otezla given its established efficacy and safety profile, excellent payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements, and of course ease of administration. To realize this potential, we've increased our investment in dermatology field force and Otezla direct-to-consumer media, focusing on efforts to educate physicians and patients on the importance of treating psoriasis systemically, and the safety and efficacy profile of Otezla.\nI'm also pleased that Otezla was recently granted pediatric exclusivity and approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients six years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. This is the first pediatric indication for Otezla. Enbrel sales decreased 2% year over year for Q1 driven by volume decline, partially offset by higher inventory levels. Moving forward, we expect modest volume growth offset by declining net selling price. continues its strong trajectory with $173 million in sales in Q1. Sales increased 80% year over year primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. In our rare disease business, sales of TAVNEOS were $51 million in Q1. Sales increased 122% year over year driven by volume growth.\nIn the US, more than 3,000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 2,000 healthcare professionals. Looking forward, we'll continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 12% year over year for Q1, with volume growth partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price decline. We expect continued growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches in oncology. Sales of our six innovative products BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, Kyprolis, Nplate, and Xgeva grew 4% year over year for Q1 driven by volume growth.\nBLINCYTO sales grew 26% year over year to a record $244 million for the first quarter, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The US Food and Drug Administration has set a PDUFA date of 21 June 2024 for its decision on approving BLINCYTO as a treatment for patients with early CD19 positive B cell. As we see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization in frontline treatment. Lumakras sales increased 11% year over year for the first quarter to a record $82 million. We see future growth opportunities for Lumakras coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 6% year over year driven by higher net selling price, and volume growth partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact.\nKyprolis sales grew 5% year over year to a record $376 million for Q1, primarily driven by volume growth outside the US. Enbrel sales decreased 12% year over year for Q1, primarily driven by volume decline. In comparison to Q1 2023, which included a US government order of $82 million. Excluding the Q1 2023 US government order, Enbrel sales grew 13% year over year. I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter and the momentum across the four pillars of our business, and we look forward to serving many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. With that, I'll turn it over to Vikram.\n\nVikram Karnani\n\nEVP of Global Commercial and Medical Affairs Rare Disease, Amgen\n\nThank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on Rare Disease, Andrew's fourth therapeutic Pillar of Growth, which delivered product sales of over $950 million in Q1, beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease or TED. First quarter sales were $424 million, reflecting growth of 5% year over year when compared to results from the Legacy Horizon business. As we discussed at our Rare Disease Investor meeting a few months back, TED is often assessed using the Clinical Activity Score or CAS, which covers a number of different signs and symptoms including pain, redness, swelling, and function. We now refer to TED in terms of High and Low Clinical Activity Score or high and low CAS for the approximately 100,000 TED patients in the US who could benefit from TEPEZZA. The majority of these patients, roughly 80%, are in low CAS settings.\nWe continue to focus on this large number of low CAS patients not being appropriately treated. As we previously discussed, one of the main hurdles in the patient journey in this setting is access. To help patients overcome that challenge, we have generated favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of US covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. In addition, we are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many low CAS patients. The impact of TED on quality of life is often underestimated, so our focus is on educating healthcare providers about the significant effects on patients and even those with less visible symptoms. In addition to our focus on educating ocular surgeons and ophthalmologists, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology and creating a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space.\nInternational expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA, which is currently approved in Brazil and Saudi Arabia. As a reminder, in January we filed for high CAS approval in Japan and our phase III trial in low CAS is continuing to enroll. We have completed additional regulatory submissions in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and most recently with the European Medicines Agency. We initiated a phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation.\nKRYSTEXXA for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered $235 million in sales in Q1, representing 26% year-over-year growth driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. UPLIZNA, the fastest growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $80 million in net sales in Q1, representing 49% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-US markets, including Canada, which launched in January of this year.\nThe integration of the Legacy Horizon business continues to be on track as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing, process development, and extensive global footprint. Now I will pass it over to Peter for our financial update.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nThank you, Vikram. We're pleased with our performance and on track to meet our 2024 full goals and long-term objectives. Our strong growth outlook is driven across each of our four therapeutic pillars by our innovative pipeline and in-market portfolio products, which serve patients with serious illnesses around the globe. I'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2024 guidance as shown on slide 23 of the slide deck. In the first quarter, we delivered $7.4 billion in total revenue, a 22% increase year over year. This reflects 25% volume growth including over $900 million from acquired Horizon products and also key brands including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia, and BLINCYTO. Excluding the addition of Horizon products, sales increased 6% year over year driven by 9% volume growth.\nOur non-GAAP operating expenses rose by 33% reflecting investments in Horizon-acquired products along with other late-stage pipeline medicines including rocatinlimab, MariTide, and tarlatamab. As a result, our Q1 operating margin was 43% consistent with our guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in $549 million expense, up $334 million year over year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from debt issued for the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by higher interest income and gains from debt repurchases. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2.4 percentage points year over year to 15.4% primarily due to the change in earnings mix, the inclusion of the Horizon business, and net favorable items in the quarter.\nIn Q1 the company generated $0.5 billion in free cash flow, a decrease from $0.7 billion in the previous year, primarily impacted by a planned $800 million tax deposit to the IRS to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions as we discussed on our Q4 earnings call. As a reminder, there is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal position as we prepare for trial later this year. This impact on free cash flow was partially offset by the timing of working capital items. The Horizon integration is on track and we expect to reach our pre-tax $500 million synergy target by year three post acquisition. We also expect to achieve roughly 50% of this synergy target in our annual run rate by the end of this year 2024.\nWe expect accretion to non-GAAP EPS in 2024 and anticipate maintaining strong cash flow generation. While we continue to execute on our deleveraging plan to return to our pre-acquisition efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. We remain on track to achieve the pre-acquisition leverage ratio normalized for certain other non-cash items including fair value, market value adjustment of equity investments, and Horizon acquisition-related costs. We remain committed to our multiple capital allocation priorities. We continue to prioritize investing in the best innovation both internally and externally with increased spending on late-stage programs including Olpasiran, Bemarituzumab, MariTide, and Rocatinlimab. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth including expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.\nOur North Carolina site is expected to be operational by 2026, and Amgen Ohio opened in the first quarter and is utilizing artificial intelligence and extensive robotics to boost operational efficiencies. We're actively integrating generative AI across the enterprise to spearhead innovation and reinforce our leadership in the industry. This strategic commitment to innovative technology enables us to lead advancements, streamline drug development, and enhance patient care more effectively. Finally, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid dividends of $2.25 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 6% increase over that paid in each of 2023's four quarters. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 25, we expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.5 billion to $33.8 billion and anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $19 and $20.20.\nI'll mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year versus our prior guidance to you of roughly 20% year-over-year. We're making incremental investments based on our confidence in our late-stage pipeline. Our R&D investment reflects our commitment to innovation, accelerating our pipeline, focusing on advancing multiple potentially first-in-class and best-in-class medicines, including supporting MariTide, two PDUFA dates scheduled for June, and five phase III data readouts throughout the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses over Q2 and Q3 are expected to grow at a rate comparable to Q1. The Q4 rate will normalize with a comparable expense base in Q4 2023.\nSince the Horizon transaction completed in early October 2023, we continue to anticipate our operating margin will improve over the next three quarters. We expect OIE to be roughly $2.6 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%, primarily being driven by a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income, which includes the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.1 billion in 2024. We've initiated activities to further expand manufacturing capacity for MariTide. We project full year Enbrel sales of approximately $500 million. Our long-term outlook remains robust. I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. So this concludes the financial update.\nI'll hand it now back to Bob for our Q&A session.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, thank you, Peter. Before you open the line, Julianne, let me just point out that obviously we have a lot of exciting opportunities here and we're excited about the ways we think we can make a difference for patients in terms of the opportunity and obesity. Again, we recognize that there's significant interest, and we provided today's update to keep you apprised of our plans in this area. I would just reiterate, we're focused on successfully completing and maintaining the integrity of the ongoing phase II study. As we turn to Q&A, just bear in mind that we're going to have to be very limited in what we can say beyond what we've already delivered in our prepared remarks on obesity and MariTide. With that in mind, Julianne, maybe you could remind our callers of the process for asking questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press * followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press * followed by one again. To ask a question, press *one. Our first question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question on MariTide here. Just given the move forward to phase III, can you just remind us what?\nYou were looking to learn in the phase II trial and likely did here, but that enabled you to kind of get confident here with the program on the Ford?\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nSure, Salveen, thanks for the question. Why don't you jump in, Jay?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Salveen, for your question. Look, we're benefiting from a really well designed and well executed phase II study, a study that can teach us a lot about this medicine and how it's best dosed and received. We're seeing from these data in aggregate a broad and differentiated profile that will guide and also encourage a phase III clinical investigation.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey guys, thanks and appreciate the update.\nI think we all do.\nJust to clarify or to ease any investor concerns, is it safe to say that your interim looked at all doses and you feel comfortable, including the highest doses and safety metrics, including bone and all of that was looked at to date? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nThanks a lot, Michael. I'll take this one as well. Again, a very well designed and well executed study. A study that's replete with measurements. This is an ongoing study, so we have to be careful to avoid introducing an inadvertent bias or unblinding. And so we just can't comment on individual characteristics. But we're very pleased with the results to date. We're moving rapidly forward with the phase III program.\nAs well as the diabetes phase II. I would reiterate that all the arms remain active, and we haven't had an issue with patient dropout to date.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nI think. Again, Michael, as Jay said, it's a well designed study and you can be sure that we reviewed the data carefully.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nOkay, let's go ahead and take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.\nThanks for taking the question. Jay, you mentioned on MariTide, seeing a differentiated profile, recognize you're limited in what you can say, but as we think about, you know, areas of differentiation, it's clearly efficacy, tolerability, and dosing interval. So just wondering if you can comment on which of those areas you're differentiated on. And then what benchmark are you looking to? Is it Semaglutide, Tirzepatide?\nBoth of those.\nThank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nThanks, Terence. Again, we can appreciate the desire to get into that detail, but maybe Murdo, you want to speak to the competitive differentiation, and then Jay, if there's anything you feel appropriate to elaborate on, you can jump in after Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Terence.\nThanks, Bob.\nObviously, we're watching the in-market products very closely with respect to differentiation. We're also looking at products that are in the clinic being developed. We continue to feel very confident in our ability to have a differentiated and broad profile for MariTide as we develop it in this phase II and as we consider a broader phase III development program.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, I'd just add, you know, this is, Terence, a very exciting, very dynamic area. We follow the development of obesity medicines very closely. I think in this case the actions we're taking speak for themselves. We're hard at work planning a comprehensive and competitive phase III program.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nGreat, Julianne.\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJay Olson\n\nResearch Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nOh, hey, congrats on all the progress and thanks for providing the update.\nMaybe just to shift gears a little.\nBack to Tarlatamab. With the potential launch rapidly approaching, can you just talk about the work you're doing to prepare for that launch and the strategy behind the initial launch in the late line and then the clinical and commercial work to go behind expanding the profile and potential for Tarlatamab. Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nYeah, let's take that in two pieces and maybe Murdo, you can talk about the launch and then I'm sure, Jay, you'd like to elaborate on the thinking for the clinical development of this.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nSure, Jay, thank you for the question on another exciting product in our portfolio, one that I think will deliver a lot of benefit for patients with small cell lung cancer, which is a very, very difficult diagnosis with very little in the way of highly effective treatments that deliver any kind of durable response in small cells. So we're, we're anxiously awaiting approval from.\nThe FDA, but we are well prepared.\nHave been for some time across our field organizations. All our field personnel, including our medical teams, are trained and prepared. We have very clear plans to reach treating physicians in very short order post approval. We have very clear understanding of making sure that we can provide broad access to Tarlatamab when it's approved. We feel really good about this. This is a very important moment, not just for Amgen, but for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer where quite frankly, the survival in the late stage setting is really dismal and as a matter of single digit months. So we have a huge opportunity here to impact, and we're not wasting any minute, any hour, or any day in our planning to do that.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nJay, thanks for highlighting the potential of this medicine, which we consider a major advance. The treatment of this disease has really not meaningfully evolved since I trained as an oncologist in the mid-90s with upfront chemotherapy and meaningful but incremental benefit to immuno-oncology therapy with PD-L1 agents today. So this is a case where time just can't move fast enough to get this medicine into earlier lines of therapy. We have initiated three phase III studies, and as you asked, I'll just give an architecture of them. Briefly, we have a study that will compare Tarlatamab to standard of care chemotherapy. This is in the second line, for patients with a primary endpoint of overall survival. This study is enrolling.\nWe really want to get this medicine tested in frontline therapy, whereas you must know, patients progress so quickly that a great many of them never reach the chance to receive second- and third-line therapy. So in a pair of trials, one for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, and one for limited-stage small cell lung cancer, we'll study the contribution of tarlatamab immediately following upfront therapy with response. We've learned through the development of these BiTE molecules that they work best when they're given as early as possible in the course of treatment for a disease. That has been the case with ALL as we move into frontline. We've also learned that they work best when there's a low burden of disease. So the design of these three phase III studies will bring this medicine to earlier patient therapy lines.\nI'll say there's been intense interest and great hope in this community. So we expect to enroll these studies expeditiously.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\nThank you for taking my question and congrats on the progress. I have a question regarding the manufacturing of AMG 133. Could you help us understand how complicated or simpler it is versus the traditional GLP-1 once-weekly peptide-based in terms of complexity, as well as cost, and what kind of investment do you think we should be expecting as you go, as you embark on this journey?\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nThank you, Mohit. I don't think we're intimidated about the challenge on the manufacturing or the process development front. I think again, we've established ourselves firmly as a world leader in biotherapeutic manufacturing. And as you know, this is a therapy that's based on antibody backbone. So it's right down the middle of the fairway for us. It's not lost on us that these competitors who are in the market now have found it difficult to maintain supply of these medicines. And I'm sure that's not lost on the patients either. And we're determined to do our best to make sure that we uphold our long tradition of supplying every patient every time in the marketplace. So again, we think this is down the middle of the fairway in terms of the technical challenges that we need to address.\nWe think that we look forward to being able to do that. Again, as I said, maintaining our track record of every patient every time.\nIn terms of your question about what it will require from us over time, obviously, to the extent that that becomes meaningful, Mohit will have the opportunity to address it down the road. But as Peter said in his remarks, our capital expenditure guidance for the year embraces the activity that we have underway to make ourselves ready for the clinical and commercial challenge that we see imminently.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, next question.\nPlease.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI, please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nEquity Research of Biotech, Pharma-major, Speciality Pharma, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys, thanks for taking my question, and I'll spare all my curiosities on your ongoing trial, but I will ask this one on manufacturing capacity.\nI'm curious, is your aim to have?\nOne to two million patients worth of capacity or five to 10 million? You can imagine from a modeling perspective, from a CapEx side this would be relevant knowing obviously how much manufacturing experience and capacity you guys have.\nAnd then secondly.\nIs it a pen device?\nI know you mentioned it's a quote.\nUnquote, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector, which.\nIs a single injection? But is it a pen device or?\nIs it something else? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nYeah. So Umer, I don't think we're going to say anything more about the delivery expected delivery device at this point. I think we were as clear as we could be that we think it'll be patient-friendly, convenient, and. Sorry, with respect to the quantity of patients that we expect to serve, we recognize that the unmet need here is very large, and we want to be in position to supply the patients that we think will be interested in the differentiated profile of our medicine. I would point out to you, and I hope you're aware that we are already serving millions of patients today around the globe with our biotherapeutics. So again, we're used to supplying many millions of patients with antibody-based therapies. I think we're pushing up on eight million Prolia patients right now worldwide.\nWe understand what it takes to supply large quantities of antibody therapies and what it means to do that with successful delivery devices. I'm sure it's not lost on all of you that the fact that, as Jay said, the delivery dosing schedule is likely to be monthly or less frequently implies far fewer injection devices than competitors who, for example, are administering a weekly therapy. Again, all in all, we recognize the reasons for your questions on supply, but I hope you recognize as well the reasons why we're confident that we'll be up to that challenge.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulia, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGregory Renza\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, great.\nGood afternoon Bob and team.\nCongrats on the updates as well. Just a question on your larger obesity and cardio metabolic strategy. Certainly with the news on 786 and.\nAs you speak to MariTide's efforts on.\nConvenience, how are you thinking about oral options within your portfolio now that you are certainly levered towards MariTide as the lead asset? I'm just curious how oral options should fit in with the portfolio longer term. Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, Gregory, thank you. This differentiated profile that we're seeing with MariTide really raises the bar for Amgen obesity medicines. The profile for 786 just did not meet that bar in our assessment. We do have a pipeline, a strong pipeline of earlier assets. They're incretin as well as non-incretin based. Some are injectable and some are oral. We believe that the heterogeneity, the diversity of the marketplace, of, honestly, the different types of patients that will need medicines for obesity and all the obesity-related conditions, demands medicines with different profiles, and we are hard at work on that.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulia, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much. On MariTide, I'll ask a question on differentiation that I think you should be able to answer, which is, can you remind us what in the past you felt would be differentiating based on what the phase I showed? So I'm not asking you to comment on what you just recently saw, but just a reminder of past comments on what you felt the data seemed to.\nShow on that front.\nLess frequent dosing frequency, of course, is the obvious one, but what else? Thank you.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYes, Tim, I think we've been fairly consistent on what we believe an opportunity is to differentiate in the market. Both in the past and obviously as we see the interim analysis of these results, we think that we have a broad opportunity to differentiate with MariTide. And by that I mean a broad differentiated profile on a number of fronts. And we continue to believe that we will be able to move into the market with a differentiated product, establish.\nMaritide.\nAs a really good opportunity and address unmet medical need and provide access for millions of patients as we go forward.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nNext question please, Julianne.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber, from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nYaron Werber\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat.\nAnd congrats on the update. So I'm just going to ask a question to see if you can answer. It's a little technical in nature. In the interim analysis for MariTide, was.\nit blinded, or not blinded?\nJust remind us, is there dose titration in that study?\nThank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nSure.\nThis is Jay, Yaron. Thank you.\nThe interim analysis, we as RD leaders, have had an ability to see the assigned treatment arms of the study. But importantly, this interim analysis is blinded to investigators and to participants to preserve the integrity of the study.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank ofAmerica\n\nHi, guys.\nThanks for the question. Yet another one on MariTide. Just given Amgen's cardio portfolio and focus, do you have any updated thoughts on expanding the program beyond just diabetes and obesity? Obviously recognizing that you now have a better picture of the safety and tolerability profile.\nThank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, thank you, Geoff, for asking and allowing a clarification. What we're observing with MariTide and what we intended for the development of MariTide continues at pace, and we're preparing for a broad phase III program that can work to address the unmet needs in obesity in a number of obesity-related conditions, and as you heard, in diabetes as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Geoff. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, guys.\nThank you so much for taking my question.\nI'm not going to ask one on MariTide, although I am tempted to. I actually want to ask one on Rocatinlimab. So with the Horizon and Rocket studies, you know, upcoming, can you just talk us through what the differentiation is you want to see and how would you position this asset versus, say, the entrenched Dupixent and Rinvoq in the atopic dermatitis space? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nJust in two pieces. Maybe Jay can address the clinical perspective on differentiation, and then to the extent it's appropriate, you can jump in on how to think about positioning it.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, it sounds as though, Evan, you're close to this work, but as you know, rocatinlimab's an OX40 directed monoclonal antibody, a fucosylated IgG1 strong ADCC. We have a program called Rocket that has over 2,800 patients enrolled. So to address differentiation, I'm going to limit that, maybe scope to the atopic dermatitis space. And here in the Horizon, so called Horizon study, it's a phase III randomized controlled trial. It's in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. It's 726 patients actually enrolled. And in this case it's rocatinlimab every four weeks against placebo for the 24-week treatment and readout. We have endpoints at 16 and 24 weeks. We will, you know, it's always apples to oranges to compare between trials, but we hope to observe and expect to observe in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a very competitive profile with strong efficacy and excellent patient experience and tolerability.\nHere we think about Dupixent and follow that work and its development closely. Murdo, I'd leave it to you to talk through how to best think about differentiation.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP Global Commercial Operations, Amgen",
    "content2": "Yeah, thanks Jay. Thanks for the question, Evan. We are studying, as Jay mentioned, a broad population of patients in atopic dermatitis. So we will have some patients that will have previous biologic experience as well as bio-naive. So we will know how to position this product effectively in the market.\nI would perhaps use.\nThe recent experience of how we launched TEZSPIRE and differentiated against Dupixent in a different indication using a highly differentiated mechanism. The fact is prescribers in this area are looking for alternatives to non-responsive patients and to bio-naive patients. So we feel good about the opportunity here, but obviously we have to await data and see the readouts of the clinical trials.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\nCould you just elaborate a little bit more on TEZSPIRE and its potential role in COPD post the phase II data? And maybe as part of that, how broadly do you expect to study this compound in phase III? I guess, given the efficacy across the different eosinophil counts that we saw in the phase II program. Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Chris. It's Jay again. And so the phase II COPD data will be presented in an oral presentation, as I mentioned, at the American Thoracic Society meeting later this month. And so as that work and its abstract are presently embargoed, there's a natural limit to what I'm able to share. But what I will remind, as you ask more mechanistically, is that TSLP comes from this family of what are called alarmins. And they do just what it sounds like they do. An epithelium inflamed, or irritated, or activated that's inflamed releases TSLP and triggers what's called type 2 inflammation. There are a number of signaling factors that participate in type 2 inflammation, but then TSLP then converges down in this type 2 T cell inflammatory milieu in response, also involving eosinophils. And that's why we often invoke that measurement in clinical investigation.\nThe rationale for COPD is as strong as it is for asthma. But COPD, as you must know, is a much more heterogeneous disease than asthma. And so the design of this clinical trial appreciated and understood that and built into it some predefined stratifications for analysis, one of which was this eosinophil threshold of 150 cells per microliter. And so we look forward to sharing the full data. We have already disclosed that there's clinically meaningful activity of the molecule in this randomized controlled trial. And so please expect more at the ATS. You ask about the more broad development. You are right that TSLP is not only a feature of an inflamed airway epithelium, but other epithelium epithelial surfaces as well. Hence our interest to develop it in Eosinophilic Esophagitis as well as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.\nAnd both of these diseases are characterized molecularly by type 2 inflammation.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nHey Julianne, let's move on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Chris. Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. This one is a little bit off the reservation.\nIt's for Jay and oncology.\nIt's for AMG651, the EGFR CD3. Just want to get your thoughts on that. I think there's going to be some data coming up soon and there's some other data that's come out recently from peers.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, well, I would say this, James, thanks for the question. You know, we have a large experience developing CD3 bispecifics, and we have learned over time to tune the potency of engagement to the cell surface antigen to the degree of engagement and activation of the CD3. And there is no news to share with you at this moment. We continue to study this and other solid tumor targeting T cell engaging bispecifics. Really buoyed by the confidence and the guidance from tarlatamab and xaluritamig. So I would expect more in the future on that medicine as well as other solid tumor targeting bispecific T cell engagers.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, let's go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, James. Our next question comes from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nYour line is open.\n\nKripa Devarakonda\n\nVP of Biotech Equity Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. I have a question on TEPEZZA and TED. Can you please talk about where you are with this Sub Q program? I think the phase III is ongoing. Just a little bit of update on that. And as you continue to treat more patients with TED, what are you hearing about concerns around safety concerns, and is that having any impact on uptake? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nLet's take it in two parts. Jay, you can address the clinical questions, and then, to the extent that Vikram, you want to share any thoughts on the marketplace, jump in.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. The development of a subcutaneous administration of TEPEZZA is a major priority for Amgen RD in the program. We've initiated a phase III study. This will be and this is in moderate to severe active TED, and the design is akin to what we have reported already with the intravenous label enabling studies completed to date. Vikram, if you want to speak.\nTo the clinical experience.\n\nVikram Karnani\n\nEVP of Global Commercial and Medical Affairs Rare Disease, Amgen\n\nYeah, I think so. Thanks for the question. I think the question was around.\nAES and if that is limiting growth. I imagine, Kripa, that you're maybe specifically referring to hearing loss or.\nAbout hearing loss. So let's start at the top. TEPEZZA as it very effectively treats TED, which we all know is a pretty severe and debilitating disease. IGF1 we know can be involved in hearing function. So during the clinical assessment and the clinical development of TEPEZZA, we very carefully.\nWe assessed hearing function. We now have included this in the warnings and precautions section of the PI along with the recommendation for assessment and monitoring. It's important because patients who use TEPEZZA should be monitored for.\nAny specific experience with hearing impairment? We're also working with professional societies to increase education. While many physicians do use a baseline hearing assessment, getting it in the label helps standardize this approach. After working through the management of this with HCPs, this has not generally turned out to be a barrier for growth as physicians generally understand the favorable risk-benefit profile of TEPEZZA.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nThank you. So Julianne, we're pushing up to the point at bottom of the hour here, but we still have a few questions in the queue. So we'll take a couple more and try to get through your questions. If we don't get to everybody, oh, Justin and his team will be around this evening to answer any questions, but let's try and click through these ones we can quickly, Julia.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. Thank you, Kripa. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Schmidt\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question.\nI had one on Blincito, which has recently gained some commercial momentum recently, and there was some interesting academic data reported last week in Nature Medicine showing some activity in RA, and so obvious.\nJust wondering if you have any plans.\nOr how you're thinking about potentially developing glynsites or maybe other BiTEs in autoimmune diseases?\nThanks so much.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nSorry. In autoimmune disorders.\n\nMichael Schmidt\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nYes.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for your question. You know, with very deep expertise here in CD19 directed therapeutics, with deep and committed expertise in inflammation autoimmunity, we've been following this space very closely. The early suggestive evidence from CAR T cell therapy and, more recently, this work that's been reported in systemic sclerosis. And as you noted, six patients with quite refractory rheumatoid arthritis is very exciting to see. So you can imagine that we're well organized around this opportunity and we found that work quite inspiring and we'll have more to report in the future.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nHead of Financial Planning and Analysis, Amgen\n\nJulianne, I think we've got time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Michael. Our last question will come from Gary Nachman, from Raymond James, please.\nGo ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat.\nThanks and good afternoon. So back to MariTide. Have to finish with that.\nAs you're planning for the phase III studies, do you have a sense of?\nWhen could you start those, how big?\nThose might be, and anything about design.\nOverall timing relative to other phase III studies in the space and any strategies you have to accelerate those studies as quickly as possible and how you'll incorporate both US and ex-US in the program? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nSo, Gary, again, we appreciate it and can understand why you'd be asking those questions. As I said in my remarks, we will do our level best now to successfully complete the phase II study and then work swiftly with regulators to agree the program that establishes safety and efficacy in phase III. And we'll do that as swiftly as we can. We recognize there's a huge unmet need still in the marketplace and we believe we have an asset that can help address that. But, Jay, I don't know whether you feel you can say anything more specific, but jump in if you do.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of R&D, Amgen\n\nYeah, I'd say the same, Bob. Gary, as you know, this is one part collecting the data that regulators rightly expect, and ongoing conversations around the design. This study is moving as rapidly as possible within this program, is moving as rapidly as possible within the organization. You can rest assured.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nCEO, Amgen\n\nOkay. Well, again, let me thank you all for joining the call and reiterate that Justin and his team will be around if you have any further questions. We look forward to having an opportunity to talk to you in the summer after the Q2 and provide update on the flow of information that we expect to generate between now and then on the many programs that we've referred to on the call, so thank you for your interest. Appreciate."

Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q4 2023 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, Jay Bradner, who I'm pleased to welcome and is joining us for the first time on our quarterly earnings call and Peter Griffith. Dave Reese will also be available during the Q&A session.\nGiven the timing of the Horizon Therapeutics acquisition close, the results as shown in our press release and slides include contribution from the Horizon business from 6 October onwards. For the avoidance of doubt, this will also be the basis for our filed financial results. To supplement this information, Vikram will also provide sales information for these products for the full Q4, including the first week of October as further context in his remarks.\nThrough the course of our discussion today, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary materially. With that, over to you Bob.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, thank you Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. 2023 was another year of performance and progress for Amgen, further positioning us to deliver attractive growth through the end of the decade and beyond. Last year we delivered double digit volume growth in all four quarters with balanced growth across products and geographies.\nEighteen of our medicines generated record annual sales including Repatha, Prolia, Evenity, Tezspire, Blincyto, Krystexxa, and Uplizna. The acquisition of Horizon, which is completed on 6 October 2023, gives us a significant new rare disease business that now stands as a fourth pillar of growth alongside our leading general medicine, oncology, and inflammation businesses.\nThe medicines we acquired are all very early in their life cycles and by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics manufacturing, decades of experience in inflammation, and our extensive global presence, we believe these products have the potential to reach many more patients around the world. Last year we also advanced the deepest and most diverse pipeline in our history with promising molecules at all stages of development, and across our four pillars of growth.\nWe anticipate well over a dozen significant pipeline milestones this year. We'll touch on a few. In general medicine, we'll generate phase II data this year for our lead obesity molecule MariTide, and we're excited, of course, to learn more about this asset. We're also advancing a number of early-stage assets in this space. In oncology, we have a 12 June 2024 PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its priority review of tarlatamab as a third-line treatment for small cell lung cancer.\nTarlatamab is the first bispecific T-cell engager shown to be effective in addressing a major solid tumor, in this case one for which there's been no new treatment in decades and which today has a five-year survival rate of just 3%. We're studying tarlatamab in earlier lines of treatment and hope over the fullness of time to be able to serve the tens of thousands of patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer each year in the US and major markets around the world.\nWe've done this very successfully now with our first BiTE, Blincyto, which has steadily moved into earlier lines of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We'll take the same approach with yet another promising BiTE, that being zaliridomag in prostate cancer. In inflammation, we'll have phase III data from rocatinlimab and atopic dermatitis from the first of what are now eight trials in the rocket program. In rare disease, we'll have phase III data from Uplizna and myasthenia gravis, and IgG4-related disease.\nAt a time when a rapidly aging global population needs more innovation, Amgen is delivering both with the medicines we have on the market today and with the promising new medicines that are advancing in our pipeline. We're also excited by the rapid convergence of biotech and tech, which is enabling us to innovate more quickly and confidently.\nWe've been preparing for this hinge moment for more than a decade and recently named Dave Reese as our first ever Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we're capitalizing on technologies like generative artificial intelligence, not just in R&D, but across the entire company. Succeeding Dave as Amgen's Head of R&D is Jay Bradner. Jay is a physician, scientist, and a seasoned R&D leader, having served for many years as President of the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research.\nJay previously also served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and prior to joining Amgen, was a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We're delighted to have Jay on board and excited by the work that he, Dave, and the rest of our team will do together to accelerate innovation at Amgen for the good of patients and for the long term growth of our business.\nWith that, I want to thank our 27,000 employees around the world for their many contributions to our success. Let me now ask Murdo to talk about our commercial performance in 2023.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThanks Bob. I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023. Execution was strong across the business, resulting in record sales in the year for 18 brands and robust volume growth across the four pillars of our business. Full year product sales increased 9% year over year. Volume growth was 15% with strength across our regions. US volume growth was 14% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East, and Canada region was 10%. Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 41% volume growth.\nThese results include $954 million of sales from the Legacy Horizon portfolio from the period of 6 October through 31 December. I'll start with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, Evenity, and Aimovig.\nOverall revenue for these four products grew 15% year over year in Q4 and 17% for the full year, driven by 18% and 20% volume growth respectively. Repatha sales increased 25% year over year in the Q4 with volume growth of 35% partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside of the US we saw 25% volume growth with strength across our regions. In the US volume growth of 48% was driven by a 66% increase in the number of new patients starting treatment.\nWe saw a decline in net selling price in the US primarily driven by new formulary coverage. We expect this additional coverage to lead to strong volume growth, which will more than offset declining net selling price. In addition, some payers have recently removed prior authorization for some patients which will further ease their access to Repatha.\nWe remain committed to the urgent need to educate physicians and patients on the importance of LDL-C lowering to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In the US, we activated more than 20,000 new prescribing physicians in 2023 in both the primary care and cardiology settings. While we're pleased with this progress, we'll continue to work tirelessly for the many, many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha.\nTransitioning to bone health, Evenity had record sales of $318 million for the quarter, driven by 39% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women, and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In the US, only 6% of very high risk patients with osteoporosis are treated with a bone builder, creating an urgent need for treatment with an effective therapy.\nEvenity is an important therapy to address this unmet need as it is the only bone builder that works with the Evenity's natural ability to increase bone formation and also decrease bone resorption. We see strong growth potential for Evenity and will continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure it reaches all the patients who need it. Prolia sales grew 12% year over year to a record $1.1 billion for Q4.\nVolume growth of 10% was supported by real-world evidence reaffirming Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture. Moving to our oncology business, which includes Blincyto, Lumakras, Vectibix, Kyprolis, Nplate, and Xgeva, sales of these six innovative products grew 5% year over year for the Q4 with 3% volume growth.\nFull-year sales grew 12% year over year driven by 12% volume growth. Blincyto sales grew 47% year over year to a record $241 million for Q4. Volume growth of 55% was supported by broad prescribing to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in frontline consolidation treatment. Long-term, we see significant growth potential for Blincyto from utilization earlier in the front line as part of induction treatment.\nLumakras sales increased 8% year over year for Q4. We see future growth opportunities for Lumakras coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 5% and Kyprolis sales grew 8% year over year for the Q4, both driven by volume growth. Nplate sales decreased 18% year over year for the Q4 driven by volume decline related to timing of orders placed by the US government, partially offset by volume growth across our regions.\nFull year sales increased 13%, primarily driven by volume growth including US government orders, excluding US government orders. Enbrel sales grew 23% year over year for the Q4 and 8% for the full year, transitioning to our inflammation business. So Tezspire sales increased 2% year over year for Q4 driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 3% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and lower net selling price.\nFull year sales decreased 4% driven by lower net selling price and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 2% volume growth. New patient starts for Otezla grew 6% in the Q4, driven by strong execution and increased investment. Competitor free drug programs had a reduced impact in the quarter. Otezla is uniquely positioned to grow in 2024 and beyond given its indication for all severities of psoriasis combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation, and convenient oral administration.\nEnbrel sales decreased 8% year over year for Q4 quarter driven by a 4% impact from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. US volume grew 1% in Q4 supported by an increase in new patients starting treatment as a result of improved payer coverage. Going forward, we expect net selling price to continue to decline year over year driven by higher rebates to maintain broad first line payer coverage and changes in patient mix.\nTezspire continues a strong launch trajectory with $177 million in sales in the Q4 and $567 million for the full year. Sales increased 10% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Our successful launch of a self-administered pre-filled single-use pen allowed us to expand coverage with major pharmacy benefit managers to over 80%, contributing to higher new patient growth as the year progressed.\nMoving forward, we expect this expanded coverage will allow Tezspire to help even more patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Sales of Tavneos were $44 million in the quarter and $134 million for the full year. In the Q4, we saw 17% quarter-over-quarter volume growth. In the US, approximately 2,700 patients have now been treated with Tavneos by over 1,700 healthcare professionals.\nLooking forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring Tavneos to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 10% year over year for the Q4, and 5% for the full year driven by 27%, and 29% volume growth. This volume growth was partially offset by net selling price decline over time. We expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules, and additional launches.\nOverall, our execution is strong across the business underscored by our foundational commitment to serve patients. The four pillars of our portfolio position us well to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that I'll turn it over to Vikram who will cover our rare disease portfolio.\n\nVikram Karnani\n\nEVP of Global Commercial and Medical Affairs, Rare Disease, Amgen\n\nThanks, Murdo. I am glad to share an update on our rare disease business now that we are four months past the close. We are now fully operating as part of Amgen with integration activities ongoing. As Bob has mentioned before, we are excited to be Amgen's fourth pillar of long-term growth. I wanted to make sure you're aware that we are not reporting the full quarter in press release and slides which reflect sales from 6 October onwards and total $954 million.\nThis excludes $41 million of sales that occurred in the first week of October prior to deal close. For the full quarter our rare disease brands from Horizon delivered product sales of $995 million representing 6% year-over-year sales growth. Throughout the remainder of my remarks I will reference full quarter product sales.\nTepezza, an IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for patients with thyroid eye disease, generated $467 million of sales during the entire Q4, representing 3% quarter-over-quarter growth. This is the third quarter in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth for Tepezza, with the growth largely driven by the US, we saw a number of positive leading indicators including a record number of unique Tepezza prescribers, total patient enrollment forms, and patient starts in 2023.\nAdditionally, thanks to our efforts we've been able to generate favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of US covered lives and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. We continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate to severe disease in the US who could benefit from Tepezza, with the majority of these patients in low clinical activity score settings.\nGiven positive leading indicators and high unmet need, we see a long-term growth opportunity for Tepezza in the US while also recognizing there is some time lag between our execution efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. International expansion also remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for Tepezza. Tepezza is approved in Brazil, and we are progressing towards approval in additional countries.\nOur expansion into both Japan and Europe is a high priority with regulatory review underway in Japan and filings in the EU throughout the year. Krystexxa, a pegylated uricase enzyme for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered a record $280 million in sales for the entire Q4, representing 30% year-over-year growth driven by continued strong commercial execution. Sales are now annualizing at a $1 billion run rate.\nPerformance was driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand generation, stakeholder engagement, and adherence to treatment. Uplizna, an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody which is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $70 million in sales for the entire Q4, representing 68% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with Uplizna now launched in multiple ex-US markets.\nOur remaining ultra-rare portfolio generated $178 million of sales for the entire Q4, primarily driven by our ultra-rare medicines Ravicti, Procysbi, and Actimmune. Looking ahead to 2024 by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics capabilities, decades of experience in inflammation, and extensive global presence, we are ready to reach more patients than ever before. I will now turn it over to Jay.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a minute to convey how thrilled I am to join the Amgen R&D organization and this leadership team.\nThe creativity of our discovery research, expert expedited clinical development, most authoritative biomanufacturing organization in the industry, all were well known to me before joining, but now on staff at Amgen, I appreciate the strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness, the like-minded commitment to growing the impact of our medicines and our business, and the shared conviction in this remarkable portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines.\nIn 2023 we executed with speed across our clinical pipeline, achieving excellent enrollment in key programs and setting up 2024 as a year with significant data readouts across the portfolio for medicines with the potential to transform patient care. Key highlights in 2023 included the delivery of promising data from four key oncology assets and the attainment of three breakthrough therapy designations in oncology.\nWe initiated pivotal phase III studies for tarlatamab and small cell lung cancer, Lumakras and non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, along with dazodalibep in Sjogren's syndrome in general medicine. As previously disclosed, top-line 52-week data from the 592-patient MariTide phase II study is expected by late 2024. Leveraging the durability of weight loss observed in phase I and rapid enrollment enjoyed in phase II, we recently added a part 2 to this study, which explores durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks.\nOur planning for a comprehensive phase III program across multiple indications remains on track. Lastly, you may have seen that yesterday Nature Metabolism published a manuscript from Amgen R&D that provides the integration of MariTide, preclinical, and phase I data. Beyond MariTide, our obesity strategy encompasses several assets with AMG 786 in phase I and additional preclinical assets advancing.\nOur approach is tailored to meet the dynamic needs of obesity treatment, demonstrating a longitudinal commitment to innovation and patient care in this field. The phase III outcomes study of Opasiran, our potentially best-in-class LP(a)-targeting small interfering RNA molecule for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, has enrolled more than 7,000 patients globally.\nThis rapid enrollment, accomplished in just one year across 34 countries and over 700 sites, underscores the medical community's strong interest in and the potential impact of Opasiran. We've deliberately expanded our initial enrollment target from 6,000 to over 7,000 patients to ensure comprehensive demographic representation and to satisfy regional regulatory requirements. We are on track to complete enrollment in the first half of1 2024.\nIn oncology, we're focused on approaching high conviction targets with differentiated therapies for large effect size. We're pleased to announce that the FDA granted priority review for Blincyto, an early-stage CD19-positive B-ALL with a PDUFA date of 21 June 2024. The ongoing phase III Golden Gate Study is enrolling patients to evaluate the effectiveness of alternating Blincyto with low-intensity chemotherapy in older adults diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL.\nWe're also planning to amend this study to evaluate subcutaneous administration of blinatumomab with initiation anticipated in H2 2024, potentially allowing us to serve more patients and treating physicians.\nLastly, we're pleased to announce that just today the American Journal of Hematology published a manuscript highlighting data from the dose expansion phase of our ongoing phase I-B study of subcutaneous blinatumomab as a single agent in adult patients with heavily pretreated relapsed refractory B-cell ALL. Of 27 evaluable patients treated, we observed an 85% complete response rate, of which 75% were MRD negative.\nSubcutaneous blinatumomab was well tolerated with no observed grade 4 cytokine release syndrome. Turning to tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule, the FDA granted priority review following promising results from the Phase II DeLLphi 301 clinical trial and a PDUFA date of 12 June 2024. We are rapidly advancing tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment where we have initiated two phase III studies and plan to initiate a third in the first half of 2024.\nXaluritamig, a first-in-class STEAP1 bispecific molecule being studied in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, continues to progress following the presentation of encouraging phase I data last fall. We are ahead of schedule with the monotherapy dose expansion and expect to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. We've opened a reduced monitoring cohort and are making significant progress in dose range finding studies in combination with novel hormonal therapy combinations.\nFor AMG 193, an oral MTAP-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, we're encouraged by nine responses we've seen across seven MTAP-null solid tumors. AMG 193 is a terrific example of a medicine targeting a genetically defined synthetic lethality and a first clinical translation of our induced proximity platform. We're now swiftly moving forward with dose expansion studies and plan to enter master protocols in thoracic and gastrointestinal malignancies, exploring combinations with standard of care in the first half of 2024.\nIn our inflammation portfolio, we continue to explore Tezspire and indications beyond severe asthma, including separate phase III studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps where top-line data are expected in the second half of 2024 as well as in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also remain on track to present phase II COPD data in the first half of 2024.\nOur ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, has successfully enrolled over 2,400 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We're introducing an eighth study to the ROCKET program to explore an auto-injector and we are planning to initiate both a phase study in prurigo nodularis and a phase II study in asthma this year as we seek to broadly explore the potential of rocatinlimab.\nLastly, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid to late stage opportunities. In December, Tepezza received orphan drug designation in Japan, but we've also recently submitted a new drug application for Tepezza and thyroid eye disease to serve additional patients in Japan. We have a phase III study underway in the setting of chronic disease with a low clinical activity score.\nBeyond Japan, we are progressing Tepezza subcutaneous administration to drive increased adoption and improved patient experience and plan to initiate a phase III study in thyroid eye disease this year. With aplisma, we anticipate important phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease, both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients.\nDazodalibep, an innovative CD40 ligand inhibitor fusion protein, has entered phase III for Sjogren's syndrome. This follows encouraging phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in this latter patient population. Closing out our rare disease efforts. We're excited about fipaxalparant, an LPAR1 antagonist being studied in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nOn track for a phase II proof of concept data readout in the second half of 2024. In closing, I'm delighted to report on the important progress we make advancing our innovative pipeline, and I'm looking forward to sharing more pipeline milestones through 2024. I'll now turn over to you, Peter.\n\nPeter Griffith\n\nEVP and CFO, Amgen\n\nThank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong execution and performance in the Q4 and for the full year 2023. In the Q4, total revenue of $8.2 billion US dollars grew 20% year over year, and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 US dollars grew 15% year over year. For the full year, we delivered total revenue of $28.2 billion US dollars, 7% growth year over year, and non-GAAP EPS of $18.65 US dollar, 5% growth year over year. As a reminder, both Q4 and the full year results include Horizon's results beginning 6 October 2023 when the acquisition closed.\nSo our financial results will exclude approximately one week of Horizon's results from our Q4 results. I'll review the details of our Q4 and full year financial results before discussing our outlook for 2024. The financial results are shown on slides 54 to 56 of the slide deck.\nTurning to our Q4's total revenue of $8.2 billion US dollars, we saw product sales increase 20% year over year, driven by volume growth of 23%, offset by net selling price decline of 3%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year over year, driven by volume growth of 9% full year. Total revenues of $28.2 billion US dollars grew 7% year over year. Product sales increased 9% year over year, driven by 15% volume growth.\nOther revenues decreased 16% year over year, primarily due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly in 2022. Strong expense discipline resulted in a 50% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales for the full year 2023. While we continue to focus on both internal and external innovation, investing $4.7 billion US dollars in our pipeline and $27.8 billion US dollars in our acquisition of Horizon.\nWith product sales volume growth at 23% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, we still efficiently manage the operating expenses of the business. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 18% year-over-year, while full-year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9%, excluding the impact of Horizon. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3%, and full-year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nQ4 cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was flat on a year-over-year basis at 16.3%; for the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased by 1.1 percentage points to 17.0%. The full year increase was primarily driven by higher profit share and changes in our product mix, partially offset by the replacement of the Puerto Rico excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023.\nNon-GAAP R&D spend in the Q4 increased 16% year over year and 8% year over year for the full year, primarily due to higher spend on later stage clinical programs and marketed product support, including spend on programs acquired from the Horizon acquisition and continuing investment in our pipeline including MariTide. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 20% year over year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition.\nFull year non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 5% year over year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by a decline in other marketed product spends. Non-GAAP OI&E were about $635 million in expense in the Q4, $168 million increase year over year, primarily driven by increased interest expense related to the debt issued for the Horizon acquisition.\nFull year non-GAAP OI&E was favorable $279 million year over year, primarily driven by the change in accounting for the Beijing investment to the fair value mark-to-market method and by gains related to early debt retirement, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate increased 2.5 percentage points year over year to 15.9% in the Q4 and 2.7 percentage points year over year to 16.5% for the full year, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change mentioned previously.\nThe company generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow in 2023 compared with $8.8 billion US dollars in 2022. The decrease is driven by the Horizon transaction and integration costs, higher repatriation tax payments, and higher capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows with the addition of Horizon and are on track with our deleveraging plans to return to our efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. In summary, we continue to execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation.\nOur increased spending and non-GAAP R&D of 8% in 2023 over 2022, coupled with the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, continues to broaden and strengthen our balanced portfolio across therapeutic areas. With our strong late-stage innovative pipeline moving forward through development, we expect our non-GAAP R&D to continue to increase in 2024.\nSecond, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. Amgen Ohio, our new advanced assembly and final product packaging plant, has just received licensure from the FDA for commercial production in January, roughly two years after we broke ground, and our innovative Drug Substance plant under construction in North Carolina is expected to be operational by 2026.\nIn addition, we've positioned the organization to accelerate investments in innovation including leveraging the power of generative artificial intelligence, and third, we returned capital to shareholders through growing dividends including $2.13 per share in the quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022's four quarters.\nTurning to the outlook for the business for 2024 first, because this is the first full year incorporating the impact of Horizon, we're providing some additional granularity in our guidance, which we don't expect to repeat to the same extent in the future. For 2024 we're expecting revenue of $32.4 billion US dollars to 33.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18.90 to 20.30.\nAs we continue to integrate Horizon, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2024, and we're on track to meet the synergies target previously communicated of at least $500 million US dollars in pre-tax costs by year three after closing or in 2026. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across our four therapeutic area pillars.\nWe will record a full year of legacy Horizon product sales, and we expect continued volume driven growth in our priority products Repatha, Tezspire, Evenity, Otezla, Prolia, and Blincyto. Consistent with industry trends in our recent history, we expect mid single digit price declines for our portfolio in 2024.\nAs a reminder, as you model the first quarter of 2024 and consistent with our historical trends, we expect first quarter product sales to be the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications, and increased copay charges. So we expect the Q1 of 2024 total revenue to grow roughly 20% year over year.\nFor the full year we expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.3 billion US dollars to 1.4 billion and we continue to efficiently run the business through our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses. In 2024, we're making incremental R&D investments to support our promising late stage pipeline including our rapidly advancing oncology programs as discussed following ESMO in October and other programs including MariTide.\nFurthermore, the addition of Horizon has an impact on the 2024 operating margin given the timing of when synergies are realized. As a result, we project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 48%. Note that we expect non-GAAP operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following Q1. There are primarily three reasons for this. First, typical lower product sales in Q1 as I mentioned above than in each of the following quarters.\nSecond, increased spend on our commercial brands will continue building on the investments we made in the second half of 2023, including Repatha, Otezla, and our bone portfolio of Evenity and Prolia. And third, Q1 2024 reflects the addition of Horizon, for which we are just at the beginning stages of realizing synergies given the acquisition close date of 6 October 2023, so we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be roughly 43% in Q1.\nI would reiterate that we expect operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 17% to 18 as a percentage of product sales for the 2024 year. Taking into account the full year of Horizon-related expenses, we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2024 to increase approximately 20% year over year, with investments also increasing to advance key pipeline assets including AMG 193, MariTide, rocatinlimab, and tarlatamab.\nWe see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock the opportunities ahead to create long-term value for patients, staff, and shareholders, and for non-GAAP SG&A spend. We expect 2024 full-year amounts as a percentage of product sales to be between 21% and 22%. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $2.6 to 2.7 billion US dollars.\nAs mentioned on our Q3 2023 call, the 2024 guidance includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17. Our guidance is primarily being driven by two factors. The first is the jurisdictional mix of income, including the full year benefits associated with the Horizon transaction and the legal entity rationalization undertaken in Q4 2023, in part to integrate the Horizon entities into our existing US-headquartered legal entity structure.\nThe second is the benefit from a planned payment to the IRS as an advance deposit, as we've done in the past to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions. There is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal arguments with the IRS as we prepare for trial given the interest rate environment. Although the deposit negatively affects our cash flow in 2024, if any of the deposit is returned to us upon the resolution of our litigation, those funds would accrue interest income.\nTherefore, the rate arbitrage makes this payment a prudent use of our capital. Once again, out of an abundance of clarity, this represents no change in our belief in the merits of the Tax Court case. The guidance also includes the impact of the adoption of the OECD 15% minimum tax by certain jurisdictions. Based on our individual footprint, we don't anticipate any significant effects of the new rules in 2024, but we're closely watching the global tax landscape for future impacts.\nAs the framework continues to be considered by additional jurisdictions and new rules take effect, we expect governments around the world, including the United States, to continue to look for more sources of tax revenue from large multinational corporations that could result in higher taxes in the coming years. Similar to 2023, we expect share repurchases now to exceed $500 million in 2024.\nWe expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion US dollars in 2024, consistent with our capital allocation priority, to invest in our business, including the Ohio and North Carolina facilities I mentioned ahead and into the rare disease pillar. In summary, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2023.\nOur confidence in the long term growth of Amgen is strong, and we believe that our new rare disease pillar, one of our four pillars, will be an important additive source of growth for the company. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to my approximately 27,000-plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to our mission of serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2023. I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, thank you. Let's open the line and we'll take questions from our callers. Julianne, why don't you remind them of the procedures so we can get through these questions here efficiently for everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press star followed by one again. To ask a question, press star one. Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Yee\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey guys, good afternoon, and thanks for good results and good guidance. We had a question on obesity on 133. Of course you had the publication yesterday. I feel like it was the most scrutinized phase I publication. Maybe you could just talk to, maybe Jay could talk to your interpretation of some of the markers, for example lipids, A1C, blood pressure, and all that kind of thing, and maybe talk about your confidence level about the profile versus competitors. Thank you so much.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks a lot, Michael. We really appreciate the consideration the phase I paper is receiving from the community. It's exciting to report these data for those who haven't seen it. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study: 49 patients looking at safety, PK, PD, single ascending dose, seven cohorts, multiple ascending dose, three cohorts, three monthly doses, patients with obesity, BMI greater than 30.\nWe were quite pleased with the outcome, looking at the 420 mg dose as an example, which was the highest dose study: 14.5% weight loss at only day 85 and, moreover, quite durable coming off of that medicine out to 150 days, all with relatively mild gastrointestinal side effects.\nTo answer your last question, first we find the phase I data which we're pleased to share with the community to be quite supportive of our ongoing work to develop this medicine to the greatest possible benefit of patients suffering from obesity. Now, you've asked questions around some of the measurements on this study, lipids, blood pressure, and A1C, and I would just caution that this is a phase I trial.\nThe numbers are very small, that the duration of treatment is rather short. But even with all of those caveats, while hard to draw conclusions from such small numbers, especially labile measurements like blood pressure and lipids, all are directionally favorable. And so we take no concern whatsoever from those measurements on the study.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSalveen Richter\n\nManaging Director of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Another one here on the obesity program. So post the published phase I data. How are you thinking about differentiation on GI tolerability? Is the dose range being evaluated in the phase II study similar to that in the phase I? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYes, thanks for the question. I'll take this one as well. As you may or may not know, the phase II study, which is ongoing at present and going very well, explores 11 dosing cohorts with relevant placebo controls. Through that study, we'll have a chance to gain an experience with a longer exposure to MariTide dosed in different ways. We've recently added a part 2 to this study that will allow us to explore even more durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks, enabled by just very rapid enrollment.\nThese four dosing cohorts will go on to test dose level and even less frequent dosing schedules than monthly. And so these phase II data, even by end of year, will be strongly instructive as to finding a safe and tolerated and efficacious dose to carry into phase III clinical investigation.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nYeah, the only thing I would add is we're starting from a basis of a monthly dosing cadence and schedule. And so the additional dosing cohorts would look at potential dosing schedule beyond monthly. And, you know, the data are pretty clear in the market right now that the GI toxicity or GI side effects are generally related to the day of dosing of the GLP1s, which are dosed weekly.\nWe see some of that same GI side effect profile in kind of the first dose part of the dose titration. But there's an opportunity here to potentially spread the dosing intervals out further and further improve tolerability in our program. And as Jay clearly described, we've got all of the different aspects of that being studied in the phase II program.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nThanks, Julianne. We'll go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nHello.\n\nJay Olson\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey, thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on the progress. Another question on 133. Talk about whether or not the data that we see later this year will include patients from part two of the study. And do you think it's possible that 133 could be dosed once every two or three months? And also if you could just comment on the rollover rate of patients from part one to part two. Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nJay, could you catch all that? Some of what Jay asked was broken up at the beginning.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThe third part was a little bit broken up of your question. I heard a better explanation of part 2, frequency of dosing, and then I did not hear your third part.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nIt was five months later.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nOh.\n\nJay Olson\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nIf you just comment on the rate of patients rolling over from part one to part two? Thanks.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nOkay. Yeah, thank you for the question, Jay. Let me give a little bit of context on this part two study that I think will help answer them. In part two, the intent is to really look at durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. And so by durable weight loss, patients eligible for part two, which begins at the end of 52 weeks, will be responding to this medicine. And then they'll be re-randomized to four cohorts that'll test dose level and again, this even less frequent dosing schedule.\nWe have not disclosed the granularity on the dosing schedule. This is a competitive environment, but we're afforded this chance because the ADC, antibody core of MariTide, like so many immunoglobulin therapeutics, allows for the opportunity to use it much less frequently. The rate of patients rolling over to part two will be established as the Phase 2 study continues to progress this year.\n\nJay Olson\n\nBiotechnology Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThank you.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nJulianne, go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, thanks very much. Just maybe to pivot over to Tepezza for a question. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for 2024? It seems like the products come back to growth, but I'm just trying to get a sense of now that Amgen owns the asset and has more time with it. What are your top priorities and how do you think about continuing to grow the new patient base here? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure. Chris, maybe we'll take it a couple parts. But Vikram, share your thoughts first.\n\nVikram Karnani\n\nEVP of Global Commercial and Medical Affairs, Rare Disease, Amgen\n\nYep. Thank you for the question. I think if you focus a little bit on what are the underlying factors that are driving Tepezza growth. We saw a record number of unique types of prescribers. We saw an increase in patient enrollment forms and patient starts. In addition, we've made pretty significant progress on payer coverage. As we've seen, our covered lives have now increased to greater than 50% of US covered lives.\nAnd that's important, educating some of those stakeholders on the new clinical data, updated indication. It continues to drive uptake across the full spectrum of TED patients. Finally, what holds all of this together is a really robust patient service model that supports patient access. I think we continue to make progress and execute towards each one of these important leading indicators. We shouldn't forget that there is still low penetration of the approximately 100,000 patients that can be eligible for this medicine in the US alone.\nNow, just one last point here is that as we've noted before, there continues to be a time lag between the execution of all of these efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. As we said before, it can take up to 90 days once a patient is identified for therapy, for that patient to actually get on therapy. But we're pretty happy with all of our leading indicators and the execution that we have seen coming out of last year.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nChris, the only thing I would add is building on what Vikram said in his prepared remarks. We're excited about the international opportunity as well, and I think he characterized that well previously. We're also excited about what we see as ongoing opportunities to invest in innovation for the benefit of TED patients. So all in all, we feel excited about the rare disease pillar that we've established and the role that Tepezza will play in that.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, next question. Julianne.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on Tezspire specifically in COPD. How are you planning to differentiate given the pretty competitive data we saw from Dupixent? And how should investors be looking at this data from an efficacy bar? Are there nuances in this trial that need to be clarified that might make it harder to do an apples-to-apples comparison?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah. Then thanks for the question. Murdo, why don't I start and then you add on? So it's a great and timely question. The phase II COPD study of Tezspire. We expect data in the first half of this year. This was a big study. 337 patients, moderate to severe COPD. They're having exacerbations despite being on triple therapy. And so reflective of the current unmet need and inadequacy of therapy for patients with COPD.\nThis is a slightly broader population than Dupixent that we're studying here. We're totally on track for the readout. We quite like the mechanism here. You must know that TSLP works as a signaling factor upstream. And by blocking it with our unique biotherapeutic, we block TSLP IL-25 IL-33 signaling. TSLP hits so many cell types modulating this airway type 2 response.\nBy hitting TSLP upstream, we think we can really have an impact on the disease biology. We see TSLP elevated in the serum of patients in bronchial mucosa and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It's released by airway epithelium. So there's just a lot of signals from the basic biology of this disease pointing to a medicine of this nature. And by looking at the broader population than they did with Dupixent, we have a chance to really figure out who the responder is. Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nI think you've covered all the bases. I would just add this, Evan, that with the unique and differentiated mechanism as Jay described, we hope we can treat a broader population of patients than perhaps the currently available therapies. We also recognize that there are patients who are refractory to those currently available therapies. We would obviously want to understand if they would be responders to Tezspire.\nI think we've got strong commercial capabilities, including with our partners at AstraZeneca, and are well positioned to take a product like this into the market if we're successful in phase III.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nGreat. All right, thank you, Julianne. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nUmer Raffat\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI",
    "content2": "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on AMG 133 as well. Two-part question. First, on the discontinuations at the high dose, we know five out of eight did not finish the full duration of the study. But there was a second arm also of this high dose 420 mg with 10 patients, which was not reported. This was the one with digital tools. Could you speak to the discontinuation rate in that arm?\nThis is a 420 done separately, which is not part of the paper. And secondly, I know there's a case of liver enzyme elevation at the 280 mg dose, but this patient also had COVID. Could you perhaps speak to the timing of liver enzyme elevation relative to the COVID episode? Thank you very much.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Umer. I won't be able to provide patient-level insights to the phase I study at this time, but I do appreciate your question and your interest in the report. I'll speak to the dropouts of the Phase I at the 420 mg dose, which was four out of the eight patients. First, it's notable to say that the high dose cohort in the multiple ascending dose receiving the three doses of 420 experienced real weight loss, real benefit of 14.5% after these three monthly doses.\nThis was the group that proved actually quite durable. Up to day 150. Four subjects declined to participate in this clinical study setting largely for logistical reasons. The AEs and other characteristics were comparable to all the other patients in the study. Now the second question around the digital group. I don't have insight into that, Dave, do you?\n\nDave Reese\n\nEVP and CTO, Amgen\n\nNo, I mean we can get back to you on that. I don't know that we reported those. Data in the discontinuation rate.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nAll right, good.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nJulianne, go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.\n\nColin Bristow\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGood afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a couple more on MariTide first. Could you provide some insight into the dosing? I mean, obviously these are pretty large doses, and if we look at like the dose of 420 mg takes over five minutes by infusion or three consecutive injections.\nSo I was wondering if you could give any insight there, and then in terms of the relative affinity for GIP versus GLP, MariTide seems to have or preferentially favor GLP much more than competitor molecules, and so do you think the ultimate clinical profile is more closely going to resemble that of a long-acting GLP-1 versus competitive GLPs? Thanks.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, Colin. I appreciate the deep consideration of the molecule, especially. I'd start by saying I don't regard these doses as high. I'm new here, but 420 mg for a biotherapeutic that's an antibody drug conjugate with a peptide antibody ratio 2 to 1 seems well in scope for a modern biotherapeutic product.\nI don't need to tell this community paying such close attention to Amgen that this is a very sophisticated biotherapeutics organization, and on the manufacturing side, just every patient every time, and we have all the capabilities necessary to deliver this medicine at whichever of these three or other doses and schedule we arrive at. So no concerns there for me whatsoever regarding the balance of the pharmacology. You know, you do invoke a difference between our medicine and medicines developed by pure pharmaceutical companies.\nNamely, mechanistically, the core antibody of MariTide inhibits the GIP receptor, whereas these other peptide medicines agonize it. We feel very secure in our choice to inhibit that receptor, supported by just the finest level of experimental data available: experiments of nature that genome-wide association studies in very large populations have pointed to a need, an opportunity, to inhibit the GIP receptor to deliver lower BMI, as observed with variants in that receptor and downstream signaling pathways that correlate with reduced body mass index in large populations.\nAs to the balance, which you ask, between inhibition of GIP receptor and agonism of GLP1, these are very difficult measurements to make in humans. But our modeling suggests that with the therapeutic doses and exposures that we observe, that we're achieving both.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nAnd Colin, it's Murdo. I would just add from a patient experience perspective, we've learned a lot from other biologics, and Amgen has a world class process development, manufacturing, and device team. We've done a lot of work on this one, and we anticipate a positive and simple patient experience on at least a monthly dosing schedule. And we've learned a lot from Repatha specifically, and there's more to follow on Repatha from that. But we continue to work to improve patient experience with our biologic injectables.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nJust as we go to the next question, let me observe that. We're almost up to the hour that we ask you all to set aside, but I know we still have quite a few questions in the queue. So we'll try to get one question per caller here and get through. We'll stay through the queue of calls or questions rather, that's still waiting for us. But I know some of you may have to drop, so let's move forward. Justin?\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nYep.All right, Julianne, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Colin. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (TD Cowen)\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nAll right, great, thanks. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one from us, actually, based on the data that you've seen so far and maybe some feedback from physicians that you've heard. This is on where do you kind of see a business fitting into maybe the MD treatment paradigm given all the competition there. But maybe more to the point, how you're thinking about expansion opportunities given all the different autoimmune indications you could potentially pursue.\nJust trying to kind of understand how you see longer-term growth there.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nFirst, why don't we ask Vikram just to address the performance of the product right now in NMOSD and then. A combination of Jay and Dave can talk about the other activities or other potential applications.\n\nVikram Karnani\n\nEVP of Global Commercial and Medical Affairs, Rare Disease, Amgen\n\nYep, thanks for the question. Yeah, Uplizna is actually growing quite nicely and quite well in NMOSD. As you know, it is now the fastest growing biologic in NMOSD. We continue to execute across a variety of fronts. I mean we see this product nicely positioned versus, you know, as it's appropriate for NMOSD patients and within the, within the competitive environment that we operate in.\nAnd we've continued to make significant progress over the last 18 months or so, maybe even longer, of continuing to drive more growth with newer prescribers and even depth with existing prescribers. So, you know, the product continues to do well and I think we hope to continue to deliver good execution on this medicine and NMOSD maybe. Jay, you want to talk about the second question?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, no, I'm happy to. As you may know, I'm a hematologist. I think CD19 is a terrific target. It's expressed really on all B cells and spares plasma cells and therefore considering indication expansion. As you've asked, there's a large number of diseases that could potentially be approached with a PLSNA to the real benefit of patients with unmet need far beyond the application of the prevailing CD 20s that target just a subset of B cells. This is not lost on our team, and we're working through indication expansion priorities presently.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nJulian, let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question regarding the subcutaneous delivery of Tepezza. You do have plan to initiate a phase III study. Can you talk a little bit about which technology you are using? Is this with the pre-existing Halozyme technology or are you using something else for this development? Thank you.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSorry, I had trouble understanding.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nEVP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen\n\nThe question is what technology we're using for the subcutaneous injectable form of Tepezza?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nMaybe I'll just jump in. Mohit, we're not commenting at this point on the provider. We just said that we're going forward with the sub-Q.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julianne, we'll go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey guys, thanks for the question. Another one on 133. When you think about the phase III program, just wanted to know what sort of informs the next indications you're going to go after. Is it unmet need? Is it the potential for differentiation on 133 and the timing of that? Do you think that you'd want to have the phase II data in hand or is this something that you could roll out sort of at risk?\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThank you. Yeah, thanks for the question, Geoff. Really appreciate it. As you know, obesity is a major public health crisis. Maybe 40% of Americans with a BMI over 30, massively costly, so huge burden to the global third-party payers and societies. The obesity-related disease list is quite long and expanding from cardiovascular disease and heart failure, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, NASH and NAFLD, kidney disease. These are chronic conditions that really demand medicines that can deliver durable and chronic weight loss.\nAnd so we think we have a really strong offering for these obesity-related diseases with our Phase 2 program. As you know, obesity has a strong genetic component and we locked onto GIP inhibition, you know, based on genetic insights. So the opportunity space is quite large. You ask the question, you know, what indications and perhaps even in what sequence. When we have all the requisite data, we'll remark in due course, but we intend all indications where this dual mechanism can improve public health.\nWe are actively planning and on track for an expansive phase III program.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nAnd in terms of Dave, you want to add to the regulatory piece?\n\nDave Reese\n\nEVP and CTO, Amgen\n\nYeah, I think you know, Jeff, this is Dave Reese. I would just add that, you know, we're planning a very expansive phase III program so you can expect to see multiple indications move forward in parallel. As Jay indicated, as we start to see data, we will begin launching those trials and we'll discuss them. Then, in addition, you know, as you're aware, regulatory authorities around the world require a certain body of safety data before phase III launches.\nSo of course we will be compliant with that. But our goal is to launch phase III as quickly as possible once we have the requisite data set and regulatory approval.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nAll right, Julianne, go to the next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Geoff. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much. So I have another question on AMG 133 please. Could you add some more color on your expectation for the impacts on blood pressure and lipids in Phase 2, specifically whether you anticipate tirzepatide-like efficacy on those metrics. Thanks very much.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks, David. I mean we're making all these measurements and I'm not going to try to forecast the outcome of that pharmacology at this time. As you've seen in our phase I program, the medicine's very well tolerated, delivering durable weight loss and benefit without significant excursion of some of those measurements. I just think it's too early to try to answer your question. And we'll have all that data at the end of the first part of phase II towards the end of this calendar year\n\nDave Reese\n\nEVP and CTO, Amgen\n\nAnd the best extrapolation that you can have this from the preclinical data that were just published.I'd urge you to take a look at that.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julianne, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, David. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Guggenheim Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nHey, it's [Yi Gaehyung] for Michael. Thanks for taking our questions. A quick one on Xaluritamig. Can you talk about your plan of data disclosure this year and your current thinking on the potential registration path? How do you think about the positioning of this agent relative to some of the other emergent agents based on different mechanisms such as ADC or AR degraders in prostate cancer? Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, thanks for this outstanding question, Michael. Xaluritamig is a very interesting and exciting molecule for those on the call. This is a STEAP1 CD3 bispecific. We have been studying this in advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We have expanded a cohort, the phase I monotherapy we're opening to reduce monitoring as well as as you invoke the existing and novel androgen receptor modulators, inhibitors, we're exploring combinations with novel agents in that domain as well.\nThe priorities for the program right now are to establish reduced monitoring. This will be important to reach just all the patients who can benefit. We're looking at the feasibility of reduced monitoring. We have great experience with these T-cell engaging bispecifics as well as the plausibility of outpatient therapy. The approach to the regulatory path will present in due course. There'll be no surprises there.\nThe path to bring medicines to patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer alone and ultimately in combination is well worn, thankfully, and we know how to deliver there. You asked about differentiation to other medicines. These are often apples-to-oranges comparisons. We have looked at that, of course, and we really like the offering of Xaluritamig.\nThe patients treated on our study had quite advanced disease, even more advanced disease than the demographics of the patients as reported on other mechanism medicines such as radioligand therapies. The response rates we're seeing are really clinically meaningful to patients. That gives us great encouragement to develop the medicine more ambitiously in the next few years.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nJay, in terms of the data sharing. Do you want to share?\n\nDave Reese\n\nEVP and CTO, Amgen\n\nYeah. In terms of data availability, you know, as Jay mentioned, we're nearly complete in terms of dose expansion, enrollment. As those data roll forward over the course of the year, we'll provide guidance as to when we might have the next look at that data, but that's probably the next meaningful set of data we'll get a look at either later this year or early into next year.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julianne, we'll go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you very much. So Eli Lilly today made a couple of sets of comments about, you know. This topic of GIP agonism versus antagonism. They also weighed in on the data you published yesterday. I'm wondering, you know, in as much as you heard that or read those comments, is there any context to add or anything that's factually incorrect or anything to refute? Because they covered quite a few points and you know, they continue to express their view, which is agonism is the best way, not antagonism.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nHey Tim, this is Jay. Open it up to anyone else that wants to contribute to this. You know. I don't believe that. Yeah, that engaging in a dialogue around this adds much to the, to the narrative. Rather, I'd say that the argument for GIP receptor antagonism comes from just the highest level of scientific data, the human experience across populations with a million patients studied.\nAmong those who have variation in the genes associated with this pathway, where that variation is directionally inhibitory, the BMI is lower. And so we're hoping to replicate that pharmacology with this medicine. We feel great about the offering in this domain.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julianne, we'll go to next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Truist Securities)\n\nAnalyst, Truist Securities\n\nHi, good evening. Thanks so much for taking my question. This is Nicole on for Robyn. So on Daxdilimab targeting ILT7 for lupus. Can you talk about your level of confidence in this target in light of the competitive landscape and what you expect to see near term from safety and efficacy?\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nSure, Jay and Dave.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nYeah, well, it's very early days with this medicine. There's strong preclinical support from the published literature and our own preclinical work. You know, it's nicely for patients a very competitive landscape. But this is, you know, the earliest phases of clinical investigation. And so, you know, we're going to approach this with total equipoise and bring the medicine to the patients that stand to benefit the best based on the biology underlying.\n\nDave Reese\n\nEVP and CTO, Amgen\n\nYeah, I would say, you know, the target, as you mentioned, is one that helps control some of the central signaling that drives some of the autoimmune diseases that are being investigated here. You know, at this point, I think, you know, it's all efforts towards generating the clinical data.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nOkay, Julianne, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Nicole. Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks for taking a question. I have one for Jay. I just kind of want to piggyback on what Tim was alluding to. The GIP antagonism versus agonism. I'm looking at the Nature paper. It looks like 133's 420 mg dose has a slight blip in triglycerides that eventually fades. But it does seem like antagonism is behaving a little differently from the literature for agonism. Is it too early to chalk it up to antagonism versus agonism in your view? Just wanted to get your thoughts there.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nThe short answer is it's too early to chalk it up to antagonism versus agonism. As I said before, and I meant it, that these lipids are labile and indirect biomarker of this pharmacology. This is an early stage study that had one or three monthly doses of the medicine. And so we are not reading anything into the lipids conclusively from this trial. We are making all these measurements in the active phase II.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nI think we have time for one more, Julianne.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, James. Our last question will come from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one on 786, can you walk through exactly what's sort of driving. Maybe, let me take a step back, maybe first kind of if you could outline sort of how you're setting expectations there and any color on what's driving the delay there. It seems like it's taking a long time to enroll 72 patients. Thank you.\n\nJay Bradner\n\nEVP of Research and Development, Amgen\n\nSure. No, thank you for your question. For the broader group, AMG 786 is an oral medicine being developed for obesity. It is not an incretin. Though we've not as yet disclosed its target or pathway. This study is progressing fine. The readout of the phase I is on track for the first half of 2024. We've completed initial dose escalation cohorts and we're just collecting and analyzing data, expecting the readout in the first half of this year.\n\nJustin Claeys\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Amgen\n\nJulianne, we're going to turn it back to Bob for some closing remarks.\n\nBob Bradway\n\nChairman and CEO, Amgen\n\nOkay. Thank you all for joining the call. As you heard, we're excited about the opportunities that we see for growing our business across all four of our pillars, general medicine, oncology, inflammation, and rare disease.\nLast October, we shared an in-depth look at oncology in connection with the ESMO medical meeting, and we plan to do an introductory review of rare diseases and our rare disease pillar in late February to give you more information about the medicines that we already have on the market, as well as some of those that are advancing through our pipeline.\nSo we're encouraged by the questions that we heard on this call about those molecules, and we're excited about them and their prospects. So we'll host a call which IR will share with you here over the next few days and look forward to having that opportunity in the meantime. Again, thank you for your support and we'll look forward to talking to you at the Rare Disease Day or at our Q1 results call. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\n\nArvind Sood\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter. We continued down the path of strong unit volume growth during the quarter that led to an improved outlook for the [indiscernible] for growth longer term augmented by some meaningful pipeline updates, particularly with an oncology development.\nOur Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call with some prepared remarks, followed by a broader review of our performance by other members of our leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we posted. Through the course of our discussion, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. And just a reminder that actual results can vary materially.\nSo with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you for joining our call. It was an excellent quarter across the board for Amgen and one that demonstrates why we remain very confident about our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth in sales and earnings. We delivered $7 billion in quarterly revenue, up 6% from a year ago, along with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 a share, up 8% over the prior year. Volume growth globally was 11% in the quarter, and that reflects all 3 of our therapeutic areas and all 3 of our geographic regions contributing to performance.\nFor example, volume in our General Medicine business grew by 21% in the quarter, while volume in our Asia Pacific region, which we have previously identified as a key source of growth for us was up 46%. At the time of product shortages in the industry are world-class manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to meet growing demand for our products and continue our long-standing tradition of serving every patient every time. Nine of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. This is consistent with my comments from our first quarter call in April, when I said we see the potential for many of our currently marketed products to reach significantly more patients over time and to contribute substantially to our long-term growth.\nIn April, I spoke about Repatha and the growing contribution it's making in the fight against cardiovascular disease. Today, I'll highlight Prolia which achieved $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, up 11%. Prolia is one of the first biologics to be widely prescribed by primary care physicians to treat a chronic disease, something we expect to see replicated over time in other categories like cardiovascular disease. For all of Prolia's success, though, we know that osteoporosis remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease, placing millions of elderly women at risk for life-changing fractures. With recently generated real-world data, we've established that Prolia is superior [ alendronate ], the most frequently prescribed [ bisphosphonate ] treatment in the U.S. in reducing fractures and not by a little, but by a lot.\nTo give you one data point. In May, we announced that in a real-world study, Prolia reduced the risk of hip fracture by 36%, compared to alendronate, that Superior. Prolia and EVENITY, which achieved 47% sales growth in the quarter, give us a powerful 1-2 punch against osteoporosis. A disease that will only become more prevalent as the world's older. You'll hear more from Murdo shortly about our very strong commercial performance through the first half of 2023.\nWe're seeing strong momentum in our pipeline, too. As you'll hear in detail from Dave Reese, we're sharing positive data today for our BiTE Tarlatamab, and in small cell lung cancer and for LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We are especially excited about the Tarlatamab readout. Not only because of what it may mean for patients whose prognosis is otherwise exceptionally poor, but also because it adds to our growing conviction that bispecific T-cell engagers are an effective way to treat solid tumors as well as liquid tumors as we have demonstrated with BLINCYTO. Elsewhere in our pipeline, we continue to advance registration-enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines, including Olpasiran in heart disease, Rocatinlimab and atopic dermatitis and of course, [indiscernible] in gastric cancer. We look forward to additional readouts from our pipeline in the[indiscernible] second half of the year.\nTurning to our planned acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. We remain very enthusiastic about what our companies can achieve together for patients suffering from rare serious diseases. Horizon has certainly accomplished a great deal as an independent company. Amgen's global commercial, manufacturing and R&D capabilities, especially for biologic products, will enable Horizon's medicines to reach even more patients more quickly than Horizon could have achieved on its own. As you know, this combination has been approved by regulators around the world with the exception of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States. The FTC's arguments in this case are based on speculation and hypothetical notions. Their arguments are not grounded in long-established antitrust law.\nNotwithstanding that and choosing to pursue this case, they've ignored the commitments we made to address their stated concerns. Life-changing medicines at Amgen and Horizon offer, treat different diseases and different patient populations. Simply put, there are no competitive overlaps and no incentives to bundle our drugs with theirs. We look forward to making our case in court in September and all confident rather than we will prevail.\nIn the meantime, we're working closely on integration plans with Horizon, so we can hit the ground running by mid-December, which is when we anticipate being able to close the deal. And let me just reiterate one more point before I hand over to Murdo. As the second quarter illustrates, Amgen's business is performing very well and our organic outlook for growth is strong. Adding Horizon will serve to enhance our growth prospects even further. And let me close by thanking my Amgen colleagues around the world for their unwavering commitment to patients and to our business. We're excited about the future and our ability to serve many, many more patients than we do today. Murdo?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations\n\nThanks, Bob. I'm very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, fueled by a commitment to deliver on our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for nine brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology/oncology portfolios.\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter global product sales grew 8% year-over-year, including the impact of foreign exchange product, sales increased 6% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 9% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 8%. And consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest-growing region with 46% volume growth in the quarter.\nStarting with our General Medicines business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and [indiscernible]. Overall revenue for these 4 products grew 19% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by a 21% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing public health crisis and the state of care for high-risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL-cholesterol [indiscernible] is family heart real-world analysis of 38 million high risk Americans, revealed at fewer than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. This is a clear call to action that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients. And so to meet this need, Amgen is committed to improving patients' ease of access and affordability. Today, we have best-in-class formulary coverage for Repatha helping 90% of eligible U.S. patients gain access to this important medicine. Improved access is enabling broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. So this has set the stage for growth for Repatha sales, which increased 30% year-over-year to a record $424 million in the second quarter.\nIn the U.S., volume growth of 34% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment. Outside the U.S., we saw 37% volume growth with momentum across our regions. We recognize there are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. And to meet that challenge, we are increasing investment to intensify our engagement with health care providers, bring our message directly to patients through direct-to-consumer media and drive urgency around LDL-C testing and adherence to treatment guidelines.\nTransitioning to bone health. Prolia sales grew 11% year-over-year to a record $1 billion in the second quarter, driven by 11% volume growth. As Dave will discuss in more detail, new real-world evidence data presented at the World Congress on osteoporosis in May demonstrates that Prolia significantly reduces fracture risk across multiple endpoints when compared to alendronate. Our sales teams are now equipped with these data and are actively helping physicians understand the superior ability of Prolia to reduce the risk refracture for their osteoporosis patients.\nEVENITY, which complements Prolia in our Bone portfolio had record sales of $281 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across markets. In Japan, EVENITY has achieved a 42% share of the growing Bone Builder market steadily increasing performance versus competitors and increasing initiation for [indiscernible] patients. EVENITY sales are now annualizing at over $1 billion. And given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of women who are postmenopausal our success in Japan, the first launch market for EVENITY enhances our confidence in the significant growth potential through this decade.\nOTEZLA sales increased 1% year-over-year, driven by 2% volume growth. OTEZLA remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic naive U.S. patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical treatment and can benefit from a systemic drug like Otezla.\nOur U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors, and we expect new patient demand will continue to be affected by these programs for the remainder of 2023. Despite this, we see a compelling opportunity to invest in growth of Otezla and to drive increased awareness amongst physicians and patients. We're confident in the growth potential of Otezla given his unique combination of established efficacy and safety profile, broad payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and a lack of testing required for initiation and of course, ease of administration.\nEnbrel sales grew 8 [indiscernible] quarter following the seasonal impact on price and a large drawdown of inventory during the first quarter in the U.S. Year-over-year, Enbrel sales increased 2%, driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and higher net selling price, partially offset by lower inventory levels. Although year-over-year volume was flat in the second quarter, the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 6%, driven by improved payer coverage. For the remainder of 2023, we expect this improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients. We also expect declining net selling price on a full year basis.\nTEZSPIRE continues to show robust growth with $133 million in sales in the second quarter. Sales increased 39% sequentially driven by 37% volume growth that benefited from the introduction of our self-administered, prefilled, single-use pen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. The pen offers patients a convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home, which improves accessibility and provides more flexibility in treatment options for all patients in the U.S. with severe uncontrolled asthma.\nSales of TAVNEOS were $30 million in the second quarter. U.S. volumes grew 28% quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the U.S., approximately 2,000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1,300 healthcare providers. Looking forward, Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with anchor associated vasculitis.\nAmjevita sales increased 29% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 60% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price. U.S. sales decreased 63% sequentially driven by inventory drawdowns after stocking to support the launch in the first quarter, partially offset by volume growth.\nMoving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Strong commercial execution and exciting new clinical data drove 12% volume growth year-over-year for these 6 innovative products. BLINCYTO sales grew 48% year-over-year with adoption across academic community and pediatric centers following positive data from the registration-enabling E-1910 study presented in December of 2022, and updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May, both the positive data and the updated guidelines support our confidence in the continued growth potential for BLINCYTO.\nVectibix sales increased 20% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 20% volume growth supported by promotional positive data from the Phase III PARADIGM trial, demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for patients with wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer.\nKYPROLIS grew 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. And LUMAKRAS reported $77 million of sales for the second quarter, year-over-year sales were flat in the quarters, 20% volume growth was offset by lower net selling price and inventory levels. We see future growth opportunity for LUMAKRAS driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program.\nOur execution is strong across the business, driving growth and exemplifying our dedication to serving patients. Our business is performing at a very high level and with the announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, we have the potential to serve many more patients who can benefit from our decades of leadership in inflammation and nephrology. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Reese.\n\nDavid M. Reese\n\nExecutive Vice President-Research & Development, Amgen, Inc.\n\nThanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. For R&D, the second quarter was one of high-quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with 2 important data readouts multiple registration-enabling studies on track and additional exciting data coming later this year. Beginning with oncology, we are exceptionally pleased to announce positive top line results from global Phase II DeLLphi-301 trial evaluating Tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer that progressed after 2 or more prior lines of treatment. Tarlatamab demonstrated an objective response rate, the primary endpoint that substantially exceeds what was previously reported in the Phase I study. Responses were durable and longer than what is expected with standard of care chemotherapy. Safety and tolerability were also more favorable compared to the Phase I study. This is the first time that a BiTE specific T-cell engager has shown unequivocal activity in a common solid tumor, a real milestone in the field.\nWe look forward to discussing these data soon with the FDA and other regulatory agencies and presenting detailed results of this potentially registrational Phase II study at an upcoming medical congress. Based on the data we have observed, we are moving into Tarlatamab into an earlier lines of therapy with DeLLphi-304, a Phase III study underway comparing Tarlatamab with standard of care chemotherapy in second-line small cell lung cancer. We are also planning to initiate 2 additional Phase III studies of Tarlatamab in earlier of small cell lung cancer. For my [indiscernible], I believe this molecule can be transformative and can't wait to share these data with the field.\nTurning to LUMAKRAS. We continue to execute on our comprehensive clinical program designed to generate the breadth of data necessary to understand KRAS biology and the role LUMAKRAS can play in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and other solid tumors. We are delighted to announce that the global Phase III CodeBreaK 300 trial evaluating LUMAKRAS combined with Vectibix in chemo refractory metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival for both the 240-milligram and 960-milligram doses. At comparable doses, efficacy results were consistent with what was previously observed in this setting with no new safety signals. We look forward to sharing these results with global health authorities in presenting the detailed results at an upcoming medical [indiscernible], breakthrough therapy designation for LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix for the treatment of patients with metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior chemotherapy based on data from the prior CodeBreaK 101 study.\nBeyond these data, we continue to explore novel combinations as we seek to move LUMAKRAS into the first-line setting. Recently presented data from the Scarlet study provide the rationale to initiate a Phase III trial of LUMAKRAS combined with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer patients with PD-L1 negative tumors and Phase Ib data in combination with Vectibix and chemotherapy support the initiation of a Phase III study of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix and FOLFIRI in first-line G12C-mutated colorectal cancer.\nIn June, the FDA approved the supplemental biologics license application for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients with CD19 positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 0.1%. The approval converts BLINCYTO's accelerated approval to a full approval. Global regulatory submissions are on track for E1910, a Phase III trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network Cancer Research Group that demonstrated superior overall survival with BLINCYTO treatment added to consolidation chemotherapy over standard of care consolidation chemotherapy in newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia negative-ALL who are MRD-negative following induction and intensification chemotherapy.\nThree important updates were made to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines in oncology in B-cell ALL. These included listing the BLINCYTO E1910 regimen as the only preferred regimen for the first-line treatment of Philadelphia negative adult patients adding BLINCYTO to multi-agent chemotherapy as consolidation in MRD-negative disease. And lastly, moving BLINCYTO in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor to the top of the treatment algorithm for MRD-negative Philadelphia-positive disease.\nFinally, in April, data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrating that BLINCYTO added the chemotherapy, improved 2-year survival in [ KMT2A ] rearranged B-ALL in infants compared to historical data. BLINCYTO 2-year survival was 93% versus 66% for chemotherapy alone. If you look at the totality of the data, it is clear that BLINCYTO is changing the paradigm for the treatment of B-cell ALL. In late-stage disease, in early disease, in young patients and in older patients. We remain excited about its future potential and are focused on further investigating BLINCYTO in earlier lines of treatment and improving patient convenience through subcutaneous administration.\nAs the first BiTE, BLINCYTO also provides a road map for the development of molecules such as Tarlatamab, which could have an enhanced activity in settings of lower tumor burden. Two additional early oncology programs to watch are Xaluritamig and AMG 193. Xaluritamig is a first-in-class DEEP targeting bispecific being studied in advanced prostate cancer or STEAP1 is expressed on almost all tumor cells. We are observing significant antitumor activity with this molecule and are rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts.\nXaluritamig provides another example of a bispecific T-cell engager demonstrating activity in a solid tumor setting. AMG 193 is a first-in-class small molecule MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor being studied in patients with advanced MTAP no solid tumors. The overexpression of PRMT5 in the absence of MTAP leads to the accumulation of MTA, and we leverage this biology in the unique design of AMG 193, which requires the presence of MTA to effectively inhibit PRMT5. Alterations in this pathway occur in approximately 15% of solid tumors are often associated with a poor prognosis and historically have been very hard to drive. We are currently enrolling a Phase Ib/II study of AMG 193 and -- while it is early, we are encouraged by the antitumor responses we've observed in multiple tumor types. We look forward to sharing data from both Xaluritamig and AMG 193 this fall.\nIn general medicine, we are advancing our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical trial execution. The Phase III outcome study of Olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class LP(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well as is a Phase II study of Maridebart cafraglutide formerly known as AMG 133 in patients with obesity, with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The goal of the Phase II study is to generate data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase III program, leveraging the unique properties of Maridebart cafraglutide that will deliver strong, sustainable weight loss.\nIn May, as mentioned, we presented data from a real-world study of nearly 0.5 million postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in the United States Medicare program showing Prolia's substantially reduced fracture risk in patients versus oral alendronate. In addition, the same study showed that longer duration of Prolia treatment was associated with a greater reduction in major osteoporotic fracture risk. These data are a great demonstration of the importance of Prolia in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis and the ability to study treatment effect in large patient populations using real-world evidence.\nIn inflammation, beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE, including separate Phase III studies in chronic [ rhinosinusitis ] with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have 2 Phase II studies, 1 in chronic spontaneous [ urticaria ] and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated imminently. The COPD trial was fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024.\nRocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase III clinical development program. We are also planning to initiate a Phase II study in moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma as we explore Rocatinlimab in this additional indication. Rounding out the clinical summary, we've continued to execute both on time and on budget with our biosimilars portfolio, including the recent initiation of a pivotal study evaluating the pharmacokinetic similarity of ABP 206 compared with OPDIVO, 1 of 6 planned new biosimilars.\nIn closing, I'd like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with [ T-scan Therapeutics. ] This is a multiyear collaboration that will use [ TSCin's ] proprietary target discovery platform, Target scan to identify the antigens recognized by T-cells in patients with Crohn's disease and represents a novel approach to investigating this tough to treat illness. I'd like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard the needs of the patients we serve.\nI'll now turn it over to Peter.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance, growing volume by 11%, increasing investment in research and development and delivering 8% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. This drives our confidence in delivering against our 2023 objectives and keeps us in position to meet or beat our longer-term commitments. I'll review our second quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a stand-alone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition.\nTurning to our second quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 41, total revenues of $7.0 billion grew 6% year-over-year and represents the highest quarterly revenues in Amgen's history. Product sales increased 8%, while total revenues increased 7% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year. We invested in and advanced our pipeline and accelerated growth across our priority marketed products, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52.6%, demonstrating expense discipline.\nNon-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting growing investments in our pipeline, driven by higher spending on late-stage programs and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 2.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.1%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and changes in product mix.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter decreased 6% year-over-year. We continue to focus on our continuous improvement operating model, prioritizing investments, digitalization and driving productivity and beginning and in other cases, continuing what we have already started historically to execute in any number of uses of artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $307 million expense in the second quarter. This year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by the change in Beijing accounting from equity methods to a mark-to-market investment with the impact included only in our GAAP results. As expected, our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 1.7 percentage points to 16.4%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023.\nWe continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our priority investments in the best innovation, both internal and external innovation. In Q2, we drove higher spend in late-stage programs such as AMG 133 and Olpasiran as well as support for our marketed products, including TAVNEOS. Second, we continue investing in our business. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels, driven by simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to begin to decline starting in 2024, with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant and capital expenditures will then begin to return closer to historical levels over the coming years. And third, we plan to continue to return capital to our shareholders. We paid dividends of $2.13 per share in the second quarter, representing a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2022.\nThe company generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2023 versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and includes higher interest income and higher operating income. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year, consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook that includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%.\nNow turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 43. Our guidance is currently provided on the [indiscernible] stand-alone business and does not include any Horizon projections. As the Horizon transaction is expected to close by mid-December, resulting contributions from Horizon would be included after that period. Given our strong performance, we are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion. Although our results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, we expect the third quarter sales may be lower compared to the second quarter due to the impact of the Medicare [indiscernible], which is more pronounced in the second half of the year and also to certain favorable changes to estimated sales deductions in the second quarter.\nRegarding our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we intend to increase investments in our internal innovation and priority marketed products from a position of strength, given the acceleration in our business and our pipeline. Reflecting our improved revenue outlook, along with our investment plans, we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.80 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.60 to $18.70. Again, although our results give us confidence to raise our full year non-GAAP EPS, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be lower compared to the second quarter, resulting from the expected Q3 sales and our investments in the business.\nImportant additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023. We project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $800 million and full year combined KANJINTI and MVASI sales of approximately $900 million. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that our third quarter 2022 results included about $90 million of other revenue related to our COVID antibody manufacturing agreement and the milestone we earned that we do not expect to repeat in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase by closer to 3% versus last year compared to our previous estimate of a 1% increase with higher cost of sales from projected increased sales, additional investments driving our innovative pipeline and increased support for Repatha and Otezla. We continue to expect the full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%, although it will vary in each of the remaining 2 quarters.\nWe continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase to about 5% year-over-year which is higher than our prior guidance of 3% to 4%. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be slightly down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. We now expect non-GAAP other income and expenses to be in the range of $11 billion to $12 billion, down from the prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.\nFor the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5% to 18.5%, down from prior guidance of 18.0% to 19.0%. We expect Q3's tax rate to be near the upper end of the revised range of 17.5% to 18.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately $925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong in the long-term outlook and long-term growth [indiscernible], and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon by mid-December, as Bob indicated, I'm incredibly grateful to our 24,000-plus colleagues for successfully executing on our mission of serving patients in the second quarter and beyond.\nThis concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Peter. And now we'll open the line for callers, so they can ask questions, and I'll just ask our operator to remind you of the procedures for doing that, please.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\n\nArvind Sood\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2023. Strong unit volume growth, that sets up the stage nicely for improved outlook for the balance of the year. These are some of the key themes that you're going to hear about today.\nOur Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call with some prepared remarks followed by a broader review of our performance by other members of our leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted.\nThrough the course of our discussion today, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. I'll begin by calling your attention to the 14% volume growth we delivered in the first quarter that illustrates 2 points worth keeping in mind when thinking about the remainder of the year and beyond.\nFirst, on the COVID front, we seemed to have finally turned the page on the pandemic in terms of its impact on the overall health care system. For example, we've seen year-over-year prescription growth across most specialties in the U.S., including cardiology and oncology. And that's good news because it suggests that patients are returning to their pre-pandemic routines with doctor visits once again enabling appropriate diagnoses and treatments. It's obviously something that bodes well for our portfolio of medicines.\nSecond, we're seeing that the demand for medicines is resilient despite the current macroeconomic challenges. Repatha, EVENITY BLINCYTO and KYPROLIS for example, all delivered record sales in the quarter driven by extremely strong growth in volumes of 33%, 55%, 49% and 18%, respectively. We don't see this volume-driven. Rather, we see this as the potential for these medicines and others in our portfolio to reach many more patients over time and contribute substantially to our long-term growth.\nTake Repatha. We believe there's tremendous upside opportunity for Repatha at a time when most high-risk cardiovascular patients still never reach their recommended LDL levels or do so only for a brief insufficient period of time. The global public health crisis and heart disease demands that all players in the system work together to drive change. And with Repatha, we've proven -- we have a proven innovation that we know can be an essential part of the solution.\nTwo of our newest medicines, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS, achieved quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the U.S. of 8% and 27%, respectively. TEZSPIRE has enjoyed strong adoption in the U.S. by both allergists and pulmonologists and recently approved -- or excuse me, a recently approved prefilled pen gives patients the option for self-administration. A few quarters into our ownership of TAVNEOS, we're convinced that our deep experience in rheumatology and nephrology will enable us to bring this first-in-class medicine to many more patients who can benefit from it.\nOutside the U.S., volumes grew more than 20% in the quarter. In the Asia Pacific region, in particular, we generated nearly 50% volume growth as we expand the number of patients we serve in Japan and China, 2 of the world's most rapidly aging nations, with medicines like Repatha and Prolia. Amgen's R&D investment was up 12% in the quarter. That growth reflects the investments we are making in registration-enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines including Olpasiran in heart disease; rocatinlimab in inflammation; and bemarituzumab and [indiscernible] in cancer. All 4 of these medicines are quintessentially Amgen for innovative molecules that deliver large effect sizes against serious diseases for which new treatments are very much needed.\nWe are pursuing a number of significant new indications for TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS as well. We look forward to several data readouts from our pipeline, mainly in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in early research, where we've built a differentiated set of capabilities over the past decade that position us well to take advantage of the rapid convergence of biology and technology that we see happening today.\nAt a time when the world marvels at ChatGPT, we've been deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning in our research labs for some time now, giving us dry lab capabilities that, when applied to biologics development, have already yielded improved success rates and reduce cycle times beyond our initial expectations. This is indeed an exciting time for biologic innovation.\nWe remain optimistic about our announced acquisition of Horizon. And similar to our experience with TAVNEOS, the more time we've spent with the team at Horizon, the more excited we become about the potential to bring Amgen's capabilities and presence to bear on Horizon's portfolio of first-in-class innovative medicines and its pipeline.\nIt's an exciting time for all of us at Amgen, and the demand for innovative medicines has proven to be resilient and growing around the world at the same time that our ability to innovate has never been greater. Always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to patients and to our business. Now let me turn it over to Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations\n\nThanks, Bob. We kicked off 2023 with strong execution of our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. We saw record sales for 10 brands in the first quarter with strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology, oncology growth brands, our inflammation therapeutic launch of AMGEVITA and the growth of TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS. And our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will soon add several important medicines to our portfolio. .\nVolume growth in the first quarter was 14% with 10% growth in the U.S. and 22% growth outside the U.S. Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest-growing region with 47% volume growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, first quarter global product sales grew 4%. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales increased 2% year-over-year.\nStarting with our General Medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these 4 products grew 13% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by 19% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing crisis. In the U.S., someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds -- for high attack or stroke. However, the state of care for high-risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL-cholesterol is shockingly poor.\nHowever, we have recently released from the FH Foundation of 38 million high-risk Americans showing that your than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. These statistics emphasize the importance of therapies like Repatha to address a significant medical need. And we're pleased that more and more patients are now benefiting from Repatha. And with volume growth of 33% in the first quarter, leading to an increase in sales of 18%, price erosion also slowed in the first quarter and declined less than prior year.\nIn the U.S., volume growth of 32% was driven by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. Outside the U.S., we saw a 34% volume growth with strong momentum across our international business.\nThere's clearly more work to be done to address this cardiovascular health crisis. This March, at the American College of Cardiology, we convened the first ever annual LDL-C Action Summit to address the state of cardiovascular care in the U.S. by identifying strategies and delivering solutions to improve lipid management among the highest risk ASCVD patients. By intensifying the focus on lowering LDL-C, a coalition of leading stakeholders in cardiovascular care have come together with Amgen to unite on a bold goal. By 2030, our ambition is to have the number of cardiovascular events in the U.S. We are confident that Repatha will play an important role in achieving this ambition.\nTransitioning to bone health. Prolia sales grew 9% year-over-year for the first quarter driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $254 million for the quarter primarily driven by strong volume growth across markets.\nNow to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla volume increased 5% in the quarter. Sales decreased 13% year-over-year driven by lower inventory levels and price declines resulting from patient and payer mix. Additional rebates were also provided to improve the quality of coverage. Growth of our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors, and we expect new patient demand will continue to be impacted by these programs throughout 2023.\nLonger term, we see strong growth potential for Otezla given its established efficacy and safety profile, strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic-naive U.S. patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a systemic treatment like Otezla.\nENBREL volumes in the U.S. increased 1% in the quarter, supported by improved payer coverage. Several important factors to consider when reflecting on ENBREL performance in the quarter, global sales decreased 33% year-over-year driven by declines in net selling price, lower inventory levels compared to previous years and the 9% unfavorable impact of changes to estimated sales deductions related to prior periods. Going forward, we expect low single-digit volume growth throughout 2023, lower year-over-year declines in net selling price and a gradual recovery in inventory levels.\nThe TEZSPIRE launch is progressing well with $96 million in sales in the first quarter, driven by strong adoption in the U.S. by allergists and pulmonologists. TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile offers broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. During the first quarter, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved TEZSPIRE for self-administration in a prefilled single-use pen, which offers patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. This improves accessibility and provides more flexibility in treatment options for all patients in the United States.\nSales of TAVNEOS were $23 million in the first quarter. U.S. volumes grew 27% quarter-over-quarter driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the U.S., TAVNEOS has now been prescribed to over 1,700 patients, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence allows us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.\nIn the first quarter, AMGEVITA launched as the first U.S. biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. We saw the first prescriptions to patients being fulfilled this quarter, and we're encouraged by the high awareness of AMGEVITA among gastroenterologists and rheumatologists. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience and inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to treat patients with this biosimilar medicine. Looking ahead, we expect Q2 AMGEVITA sales in the U.S. to be lower than Q1 sales as the majority of our U.S. AMGEVITA sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build.\nMoving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Sales and volume for these 6 innovative products grew 21% year-over-year for the quarter with KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO achieving record quarterly sales. Growth in our hematology and oncology business was supported by important new clinical data. BLINCYTO sales grew 41% in the first quarter, supported by strong adoption across academic and community centers following positive data from the registration-enabling E-1910 study presented in December of 2022. Vectibix sales increased 16% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 15% volume growth, supported by positive data from the Phase III PARADIGM trial, demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. KYPROLIS continued its strong trajectory with 25% growth in the quarter, driven by 18% volume growth.\nLUMAKRAS reported $74 million in sales in the first quarter and a 19% increase year-over-year driven by 40% volume growth partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been approved in 50 countries, and we're actively launching in over 30 markets and pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries.\nSales of our oncology biosimilars declined 27% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by lower net selling price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI, both hold leading shares in the U.S. we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches.\nGiven the strong performance of our hematology, oncology portfolio and the recent positive data on BLINCYTO and Vectibix as well as ongoing clinical development of LUMAKRAS in our oncology pipeline, I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. As we close out this first quarter 2023, I'm pleased with our strong execution across our portfolio both in the U.S. and internationally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Reese\n\nExecutive Vice President-Research & Development, Amgen, Inc.\n\nThanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. For R&D, last quarter was one of high-quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with multiple registration-enabling studies on track. In general medicine, we advanced our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical execution. .\nLet's start with Olpasiran. Phase III outcome study in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well. In March, we presented additional data demonstrating that Olpasiran markedly reduced Lp(a) concentration irrespective of baseline levels in individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) that was greater than 150 nanomoles per liter.\nWe also initiated the African American Heart study in collaboration with the Association of Black Cardiologists and the Morehouse School of Medicine. This study will measure the association between Lp(a) and atheroscotic cardiovascular disease in 5,000 African-American individuals. African-Americans show a higher average Lp(a) concentration than white individuals, but Lp(a) research to date has primarily been conducted in those of European descent. We are collaborating on the African American study to bridge this gap.\nTurning to obesity. We are rapidly enrolling a Phase II study of AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will investigate different dosing levels and regimens with the overall goal of generating data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase III program that will deliver strong, sustainable weight loss.\nA Phase I trial of AMG 786, a small molecule targeting non-incretin pathways in obesity is enrolling patients. Multiple preclinical molecules, all with different mechanisms of action in GLP-1 or GIPR-based therapies are also advancing towards the clinic.\nIn inflammation, beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE including separate Phase III studies in chronic rhino-sinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have 2 Phase II studies, one in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated in mid-2023.\nThe COPD trial is fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Emerging evidence suggests that TSLP is involved in chronic inflammatory disorders, including COPD, and the TSLP may be a key driver of the severe exacerbations experienced by COPD patients. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024.\nFor rocatinlimab, potentially first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase III clinical development program. This program is a suite of 7 studies that will establish safety and efficacy in a broad population in patients with atopic dermatitis, including biologic-naive, biologic- or JAK-experienced, diverse ethnic groups and adolescents. We're also testing different dosing regimens, including the potential for monthly or less frequent dosing.\nWe're encouraged to see Horizon report on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful top line results from a Phase IV clinical trial of TEPEZZA as revised. FDA label states, TEPEZZA is indicated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease regardless of clinical activity score or disease duration. Phase IIb studies in systemic lupus erythematosis alfa of Rozibafusp Alfa and [indiscernible] alfa were stopped for futility. These studies utilize novel adaptive designs, which enabled us to generate decision-making data more quickly and cost-effectively. SLE remains a challenging area for drug development, one that will be an area of focus for us as we further explore these data sets to advance our knowledge in the field. In addition to our organic pipeline, we look forward to incorporating the Horizon molecules upon deal close to further enhance our efforts to address inflammatory disease.\nIn oncology, global regulatory submissions are planned in the second half of 2023 for E-1910 and a Phase III trial led by the [ ECOG-ACRIN ] cooperative group, demonstrating that addition of BLINCYTO to standard of care consolidation chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival versus standard of care in MRD-negative adult patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL. Beyond this study, we are investing to move BLINCYTO into earlier lines of treatment and to improve patient convenience through subcutaneous administration. DeLLphi-304, a Phase III study comparing tarlatamab, site molecule targeting DLL3 and with standard of care chemotherapy in second-line small cell lung cancer will be initiated this month. We will have top line from a potentially registrational Phase II study of trauma and in heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung candor in the second half of 2023, a potential milestone for patients with small cell lung cancer.\nAs you are aware, we are exploring novel combinations with LUMAKRAS. Phase III study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in third-line colorectal cancer is fully enrolled with data readout anticipated in the second half of 2023. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of LUMAKRAS and chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer in PD-L1 negative patients.\nAt ASCO, data will be presented from studies of LUMAKRAS in combination with standard of care chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with Vectibix and standard of care chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. We also completed submission of the LUMAKRAS CodeBreaK 200 data, along with data from the Phase II dose comparison substudy to the U.S. FDA and to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.\nFor AMG 509, a steep on targeting bispecific now named [ zaleridamig ], we have determined target doses and open monotherapy expansion cohorts in patients with advanced prostate cancer. We look forward to sharing initial data in the second half of 2023.\nTo add to our growing biosimilars portfolio, we are pleased to announce that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for [indiscernible] biosimilar to SOLIRIS -- is the first biosimilar to SOLIRIS approved by the EC and is approved only for the treatment of adults and children with paroxysmal nocturnal area or PNH a rare life-threatening bone marrow disorder. We have also submitted the U.S. biologic license application to the FDA for this product.\nAdditionally, Phase III switching study to support an interchangeability designation in the U.S. using an investigational high concentration formulation of AMGEVITA met its primary end point of similarity for the primary pharmacokinetics endpoints. In conclusion, I would like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard to meet the needs of the patients we serve. I'll now turn things over to Peter.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. We're pleased with our execution and remain on track to deliver against our full year 2023 and longer-term objectives driven again by strong 14% volume growth across a number of products, including Repatha, EVENITY, BLINCYTO, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS. While we advance our late-stage pipeline and work to complete the acquisition of Horizon by the end of June, we continue to invest for long-term growth. .\nI'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a stand-alone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition.\nTurning to our first quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 38 of the slide deck. Total revenue at $6.1 billion declined 2% year-over-year. However, excluding the 2% negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, product sales increased 4% and total revenues were unchanged versus the first quarter of 2022. The 4 percentage point difference was due to an expected decrease in other revenue due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly.\nFirst quarter product sales are seasonally the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay expenses. In our first quarter, product sales increased 2% year-over-year driven by 14% volume growth partially offset by 5% lower net selling price, 3% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deduction, 2% lower inventory levels and the 2% impact of FX rates previously mentioned.\nFirst quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year driven by investments in research and development. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year with higher spending in later-stage program support, discovery research and early pipeline and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily due to changes in product mix and higher profit share expense. Now recall that cost of sales in the first quarter was impacted by a portion of the $125 million of Puerto Rico excise tax, the -- that was previously capitalized to inventory with the residual impact expected in the second quarter.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses in the first quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization and driving productivity. Non-GAAP OI&E benefited from higher interest income and approximately $110 million of gains from deleveraging related to the repurchase of a portion of our debt portfolio.\nAlso, recall, we now mark to market our investment in BeiGene, with the impact included on our GAAP income statement. In the first quarter, this resulted in a GAAP-only pretax gain of about $1.9 billion. As expected, our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.7 percentage points to 17.8%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023 as well as increased interest expense on our existing tax reserves.\nWe are committed to our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our investments in internal and external innovation that drive our long-term growth. Our increased spend in non-GAAP R&D of 12% and in Q1 '23, over Q1 '22, coupled with our acquisition of TAVNEOS and our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, will further broaden and strengthen our portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics to deliver to more patients globally.\nSecond, we continue investing in our business to further long-term growth. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels, driven by simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to decline starting in 2024 with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant.\nAnd third, we continue to return capital to our shareholders as we paid dividends of $2.13 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022's 4 quarters. Free cash flow for the quarter was driven lower by the timing of sales, rebates and incentives, lower operating income and higher capital expenditures from the building out of the state-of-the-art facilities in North Carolina and Ohio. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook that includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%.\nWe expect sequential growth in our free cash flow in the second quarter, although there may be an impact to Q2 and free cash flow from the expected closing of the Horizon acquisition due to the accounting treatment of certain items that were all expected in our Horizon acquisition financing and estimated deal costs as well as our previously announced restructuring in the first quarter.\nTurning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 40. Our guidance is currently provided on the Amgen stand-alone business and does not include any Horizon projections. We are raising our 2023 guidance. We're raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion versus previous guidance of $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion. This reflects our confidence in the underlying business and the improving overall market conditions for our patients to access their medicine that Bob and Murdo mentioned. We are also raising our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.60 to $18.70 versus previous guidance of $17.40 to $18.60 per share.\nLet me mention a few more important considerations as you model the remainder of '23. For product sales, we project solid volume growth at a portfolio level and consistent with the first quarter. We expect a mid-single-digit price decline for our portfolio in 2023. We now project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $700 million and full year combined KANJINTI and MVASI sales of approximately $850 million. We anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 1% over last year.\nWe expect the 2023 operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50% and expect our second quarter operating margin to also be roughly 50%. And we also expect cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%, non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to remain unchanged and estimated to increase 3% to 4% year-over-year; non-GAAP SG&A spend as a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year driven by our ongoing digitalization, continuous improvement and productivity imperatives.\nWe anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the first quarter deleveraging related to the debt repurchases I mentioned with the remainder of the year's OI&E expense to be evenly split over the remaining 3 quarters. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. We plan to continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We continue to expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023.\nOur capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately $925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong in the long-term outlook for Amgen and our long-term growth. We look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon. We expect to provide updated guidance as appropriate after the transaction closes. Many thanks, as always, to our 24,000-plus dedicated colleagues all over the world executing each day on behalf of our patients and our future patients.\nThat concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Amgen, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Peter. All right, Julianne, if you could remind our callers of the process for asking a question. And I know they've had a long day already. So we ask them to hold their questions to one each and do our best to get to everybody who has one for us.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\n\nArvind Sood\n\nVP of IR, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call to discuss the results for Q4 and full year 2022. 2022 was once again a year exemplified by great execution despite some of the macro challenges. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will make some opening comments, followed by prepared comments from other members of our senior leadership team.\nYou should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. And just a reminder that actual results can vary materially.\nSo with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We're beginning the year feeling confident about the long-term growth outlook for our business, and let me offer 5 reasons why.\nFirst, we have a number of innovative, volume-driven products that still have plenty of room to run, and we saw that in 2022. Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY each generated double-digit sales and volume growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect continued growth from these products in 2023 and beyond, with Repatha, in particular, helped by important new data from the FOURIER open-label extension study and new prescribing guidelines.\nOtezla delivered 7% volume growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year, benefiting from a label expansion that gives us the opportunity to reach millions of new patients in the U.S. with mild to moderate psoriasis. LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE collectively contributed more than $450 million in full year sales, and we're pursuing additional indications for both products. We're especially pleased to see TEZSPIRE being utilized by patients across all types of severe asthma. Murdo will share more about the performance of our in-line products in a moment.\nSecond, we moved 6 first-in-class molecules into Phase III or potentially registration-enabling trials in 2022, including Olpasiran for LP(a), rocatinlimab for atopic dermatitis, TEZSPIRE in eosinophilic esophagitis and, of course, bemarituzimab, tarlatamab and BLINCYTO in cancer.\nWe've also begun enrolling patients in a Phase II trial for AMG 133. Based on early data, this molecule, with its unique mechanism of action, looks like it may have an attractive profile for the treatment of obesity. And more on our pipeline from Dave Reese in a moment.\nThird, we have an industry-leading biosimilars business that will contribute to our growth over time. In 2022, we delivered positive Phase III data for our biosimilar candidates to EYLEA, SOLIRIS and STELARA, positioning us to be in the first wave of these launches, which we know is critical to success.\nWe're also less than 24 hours into the launch of AMJEVITA in the U.S. And AMGEVITA is the leading biosimilar to HUMIRA internationally. And with a 5-month lead over the next entrant, we're well positioned for success in the U.S. All told, we have 6 more biosimilar launches planned in the U.S. and markets around the world between now and the end of the decade, making this another source of long-term growth for us.\nFourth, we've often said that we would look to licensing and acquisitions in our stated areas of strategic interest. And that's what we've done, building on our decades of experience in inflammation with 2 significant transactions that will strengthen our presence in this space. Through the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we added TAVNEOS, a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis, and we're off to a strong start there.\nOur announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several additional first-in-class, early-in-life cycle biologic medicines, including TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA, that will add to our growth profile through 2030 and beyond. We're working our way through the regulatory review processes for that deal and are confident that the deal poses no anticompetitive matters. And we have received a second request from the U.S. FTC, and we'll work with them to answer their questions while remaining optimistic that we can complete the deal in the first half of the year.\nFinally, we've stayed true to our capital allocation priorities, investing in our business to drive long-term growth while also returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a growing dividend. You'll hear more from Peter on this shortly. And everything we achieved last year and everything we will achieve going forward is due to the hard work and commitment of our people. They're passionate about our mission to serve patients. They're clear on how their work contributes to our success, and they're ready to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges that await us. I'm grateful to all of them.\nI look forward to your questions a little later on, but now, let me turn the call over to Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. 2022 was another year of strong execution of our mission to bring innovative products to the millions of patients around the world who suffer from grievous illness. The evolution of our portfolio continue by record sales for 16 brands for the year. We saw strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology-oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the launch of TEZSPIRE and the acquisition of TAVNEOS, 2 first-in-class medicines that treat serious disease.\nIn addition, our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several important medicines to our portfolio. In total, volume growth for 2022 was 9%, with 7% growth in the U.S. and 14% growth ex U.S., as we continue to deliver on our international growth strategy. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, full year global product sales grew 4% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales increased 2% year-over-year.\nIn the quarter, we also saw strong volume growth with a 10% increase year-on-year. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, and Aimovig, overall revenue for these 4 products grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, driven by 19% and 21% volume growth, respectively.\nIn bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 11% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $225 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across markets. Repatha sales increased 22% year-over-year for the fourth quarter with volume growth of 31%, partially offset by lower net selling price.\nIn the U.S., we generated volume growth of 32% for the fourth quarter, aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022.\nOutside the U.S., fourth quarter sales of Repatha grew 36% year-over-year, driven by 31% volume growth. Globally, Repatha has treated over 1.5 million patients since launch. Repatha's strong prescribing history in cardiology and expanding use in the primary care setting position us well to bring Repatha to more patients globally. With the FOURIER long-term follow-up data, in addition to evolving and more aggressive treatment guidelines, there's a clear rationale that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients around the world.\nTransitioning to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the quarter and increased 2% for the full year. We saw 7% volume growth in both periods. This was offset by lower net selling price, stemming from enhancements to our co-pay and patient assistance programs to support new patients starting treatment as well as additional rebates to improve the quality of coverage.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our U.S. Otezla business was impacted by new patient demand from 3 drug programs by newly launched topical and systemic competition. We expect that impact to continue in Q1 of 2023. We also expect to see the typical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due primarily to the effect of insurance reverifications, co-pays and deductibles for patients. The combined effect could lead to first quarter Otezla sales being similar to or below those from Q1 of 2022.\nLonger term, we continue to see strong growth potential for Otezla, given its established safety profile, strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the 4 million U.S. patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, 1.5 million of whom have psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a first-line systemic treatment like Otezla.\nENBREL sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in volume and net selling price, partially offset by higher year-end inventory levels. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety.\nTEZSPIRE continues its strong launch with $79 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $170 million for the full year. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation of TEZSPIRE in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients.\nPhysicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE unique, differentiated profile and has broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. We're now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the prefilled pen in the first quarter, which will offer patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home.\nSales of TAVNEOS were $21 million in the fourth quarter. Our integration of ChemoCentryx is proceeding smoothly, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.\nWe're also excited about our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. Our combined portfolio, which will include TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA, will address serious inflammatory diseases and improve the lives of many patients. Amgen's commercial capabilities and global presence in approximately 100 markets will allow our combined team to deliver important therapies that will make a meaningful difference for more patients globally.\nToday, we announced the launch of AMJEVITA, the first U.S. biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to supply patients with this biosimilar medicine. AMJEVITA is the first significant U.S. biosimilar in the pharmacy benefit space, and we expect gradual uptake in the coming months as this market evolves.\nMoving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. These 6 innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 17% volume growth for the quarter. Full year sales grew 13%, driven by volume gains. KYPROLIS sales grew 14% in the fourth quarter. Nplate sales in the fourth quarter included $207 million related to a onetime order from the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our heme/onc portfolio in 2022 and the recent positive data on both BLINCYTO and Vectibix, I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio.\nLUMAKRAS reported $71 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $285 million for the full year. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 5% with 12% volume growth, more than offset by a lower net selling price, driven by a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from a reimbursement approval decision in France and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions.\nOutside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched LUMAKRAS in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. As we've noted before, the market for LUMAKRAS is focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from moving into earlier lines of therapy and expanding into additional tumor types.\nSales of our oncology biosimilars declined 40% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year, driven by lower price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines, driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year for MVASI and 51% for KANJINTI. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches.\nAnd as we start the new year, I'm inspired by the hard work of the thousands of Amgen employees around the world who wake up every day to serve our patients. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, further strengthened by the integration of ChemoCentryx and the announced acquisition of Horizon, position us well to serve many more patients globally.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Reese\n\nEVP of Research & Development, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. For research and development, last year was one of high-quality execution and on-time delivery of results as we continued to progress our innovative pipeline. In general medicine, we strengthened our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity assets, 2 areas of significant unmet need affecting millions of patients globally.\nRepatha, of course, is the cornerstone of these efforts. And last November at AHA, we presented FOURIER open-label extension data. These data were recognized by the American College of Cardiology expert consensus decision pathway, which indicated there appears to be no LDL cholesterol level below which benefit ceases. Additionally, LDL cholesterol recommendations were updated to reflect a reduction in target LDL levels in highest-risk patients from 70 to 55 milligrams per deciliter. This is a level that is not attainable for a large number of patients without PCSK9 inhibitor therapy.\nAnother molecule that we are excited about is Olpasiran. At AHA, we presented Phase II data where Olpasiran dosed 75 milligrams or higher every 12 weeks reduced Lp(a) concentrations by 95% to 100% in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with baseline Lp(a) levels of approximately 260 nanomoles per liter. Olpasiran appeared both safe and well tolerated in this study.\nWe are encouraged by these data, particularly our dosing frequency, safety and tolerability profile and degree of Lp(a) reduction. We have initiated a Phase III outcome study and 6,000 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and significantly elevated Lp(a) levels of at least 200 nanomoles per liter.\nNow turning to obesity. In December, we presented data from a Phase I study where AMG 133 appeared safe, well-tolerated and demonstrated a 14.5% reduction in body weight at day 85 following 3 monthly subcutaneous injections. Body weight reductions were observed up to 150 days after the final AMG 133 administration. Given these favorable attributes, we are now enrolling a 570-subject Phase II study to explore AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will also investigate different dosing levels and regimens.\n(technical difficulty)\n\nOperator\n\nAttention, everyone. Sorry for the mishap here. This call will be moving over to Webex. The numbers to call for Webex is 1 (844) 992-4726. The attendee password for the call is 198048.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nWe understand that our vendor lost the primary line and the backup line, so we've gone to an alternative, which is this WebEx, again, with apologies for the disruption. Let's ask Dave Reese to pick up where he left off before the call was interrupted, which was with a summary of AMG 133. Dave, over to you.\n\nDavid M. Reese\n\nEVP of Research & Development, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. Beyond AMG 133, we have other obesity molecules in our portfolio, including AMG 786, a Phase I small molecule plus multiple preclinical compounds are with different mechanisms of action other than GLP-1 or GIPR-based therapies.\nTurning to inflammation. We're excited about the recent CHMP approval of TEZSPIRE for self administration in a prefilled single-use pen. Beyond severe asthma, we're investigating additional indications, including 2 Phase III studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and in eosinophilic esophagitis, the latter was initiated in 2022.\nWe also have 2 Phase II studies underway, including chronic spontaneous urticaria where we expect data in the first half of 2023 and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is now fully enrolled. Rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, we are enrolling the ROCKET clinical development program, a suite of 6 studies that will establish safety and efficacy in a broad population of patients with atopic dermatitis, including biologic-naive, biologic or JAK experience, diverse ethnic groups and adolescents.\nWe also remain excited about our oncology pipeline. In December, data were presented from the BLINCYTO registration-enabling E1910 study conducted by the National Cancer Institute and the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, demonstrating superior overall survival with BLINCYTO plus consolidation chemotherapy versus standard of care in adults with first-line minimal residual disease-negative Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We anticipate that these data will change practice and look forward to submitting the data to regulatory authorities.\nWe also presented data from a Phase Ib dose escalation study of subcutaneously administered BLINCYTO that demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and anti-leukemia activity in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. Strong efficacy we've seen in first-line Philadelphia negative ALL, along with the subcutaneous data, provide confidence in the long-term potential of BLINCYTO. Filing activities continue on the LUMAKRAS CodeBreaK 200 and dose comparison studies, and we anticipate completing submission to the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the first quarter of 2023. Beyond these studies, we continue to explore novel combinations, which will be key to moving into earlier lines of treatment.\nOne study I'd highlight is a Phase III trial of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in third-line colorectal cancer with data readout now anticipated in the second half of 2023. In the bemarituzumab program, we have 2 Phase III trials underway in patients with first-line gastric cancer. We are also pursuing multiple Phase I studies intended to fully explore the potential of bemarituzumab in gastric cancer and other tumor types.\nTarlatamab, BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 continues to advance quickly in clinical development. In November, a recommended Phase II dose was agreed to with the FDA for DeLLphi-301, potentially registrational Phase II study of tarlatamab in heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer. This study continues to enroll patients with data readout anticipated in the second half of 2023. We also have multiple ongoing Phase I studies and plan to initiate a Phase III study evaluating tarlatamab in second-line small cell lung cancer as we seek to move the molecule into earlier lines of therapy.\nIn our biosimilars portfolio, Phase III studies to support an interchangeability designation in the U.S. for AMGEVITA and for ABP 654, an investigational biosimilar to STELARA, are ongoing with data readouts anticipated in the first half of 2023. Finally, from a discovery research perspective, we are pleased with the progress of our generative biology efforts, including our collaborations with Generate Biomedicines and Arrakis Therapeutics. We are equally excited about 3 new collaborations.\nThe first 2 are early research collaborations with LegoChem Biosciences and Synaffix focused on antibody drug conjugates. We view ADCs as another tool that will enable us to utilize the best modality to interdict a particular therapeutic target, with applications both within and outside of oncology.\nThe third partnership is a collaboration with Illumina and Nashville Biosciences in support of our human data efforts, where we perform whole genome sequencing on 35,000 black individuals, the group that has historically been underrepresented in genetic research.\nIn conclusion, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their dedication and commitment to delivering consistent high-quality results as we continue to progress our innovative pipeline and develop new technologies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Peter.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Amgen Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year execution, including our execution on our multiple capital allocation priorities. Recall that Amgen capital allocation is a forethought, not an afterthought. First, we continued our focus on internal and external innovation, investing over $4.3 billion in our organic pipeline while also making investments in external innovation demonstrated by our acquisition of ChemoCentryx with the first-in-class and best-in-class product TAVNEOS. Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics that we anticipate will close in the first half of 2023. These 2 acquisitions further strengthen our portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics.\nSecond, we continue to invest in our business, including advancing construction on our new environmentally-friendly facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. These facilities help ensure we supply every patient every time given the current and projected volume growth of our priority brands. And third, we returned capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.95 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q4 2021. During 2022, we also executed share repurchases, approximating 26.1 million of our shares for $6.3 billion.\nSo now let's walk through our fourth quarter and full year financial results before discussing our 2023 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slides 42 to 46 of the slide deck. Q4 revenues of $6.8 billion were unchanged year-over-year. Product sales grew 4%, driven by 10% volume growth. Full year revenues grew 1% year-over-year with product sales increasing 2%, driven by 9% volume growth. Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.09 declined 7% versus our recast Q4 2021 results. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, EPS declined 4%. Recall our Q4 2021 results included approximately $200 million of favorable impact to other income and expense resulting from a gain on our BeiGene investment.\nFull year non-GAAP EPS of $17.69 grew 27% versus our recast 2021 results. Non-GAAP Q4 operating expenses were unchanged year-over-year, while full year non-GAAP operating expenses declined 12%. The full year includes the impacts in 2021 of the $1.5 billion Five Prime IP R&D charge and the $400 million licensing payment to KKC for rocatinlimab. We advanced our pipeline and invested in product launch activities in 2022 while delivering a 51% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 1.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis down to 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased by 0.5 percentage points, down to 15.9%. Both the quarter and full year improvements were primarily due to fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by changes in our product mix.\nNon-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily due to higher business development activity in 2021, including our upfront payments in connection with our Generate Biomedicines and Arrakis Therapeutics collaborations, along with lower marketed product support. This was partially offset by higher support for key assets in early- and late-stage programs. However, adjusted for 2021 BD activity, Q4 2022 R&D investment increased 7% year-over-year. And for the full year, non-GAAP R&D spend declined 8% based on the same drivers of the fourth quarter. However, adjusted for BD activity, full year 2022 R&D investment increased by 5%.\nQ4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher marketed product support, including investments in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY and Repatha. For the full year, SG&A expenses were unchanged year-over-year as increased investments for all priority brands were offset by productivity gains, continuous improvement and reallocation for mature brands. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were about $470 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $250 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by the previously mentioned gains in 2021 that we recognized from our investment in BeiGene. For the full year, non-GAAP other income and expenses were approximately $1.7 billion.\nSo now turning to the outlook for the business for 2023. Our outlook is Amgen-only on a stand-alone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. It's important to remember that currently -- that current publicly available consensus estimates are derived from a combination of estimates of Amgen as a stand-alone company, along with estimates from some analysts who have already added Horizon into their estimates. So our 2023 revenue guidance is $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $17.40 to $18.60 per share.\nSo now let me review several key points related to our guidance. For total revenue, we expect the year-over-year comparison will not include about $700 million related to several items from 2022 that we do not expect benefit from in 2023. We assume we will not generate COVID-19 antibody revenues in 2023. We also assume a lower amount of Nplate sales in 2023 compared to 2022. Recall, 2022 included a significant purchase of Nplate by the United States government in the second half of the year.\nAlso several favorable changes to estimated sales deductions that occurred in 2022 and the sale of our generics business in Turkey, which closed late in 2022. For product sales, we project volume growth at a portfolio level, driven by strong growth in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Repatha, Prolia and TAVNEOS. Consistent with industry trends and our recent history, we expect mid-single-digit price declines in our portfolio in 2023.\nTurning to Neulasta and our oncology biosimilars. We expect the recent trends to continue through 2023. This will likely result in full year Neulasta sales less than $700 million. Further, we expect less than $750 million in combined product sales for our oncology biosimilars, KANJINTI and MVASI. And finally, we expect product sales of less than $300 million for EPOGEN as we transition through the expiry of our contract with DaVita.\nFor the full year, we're guiding other revenues to a range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that we recognized about $300 million of revenue from our COVID antibody collaboration with Lilly in 2022 that we don't anticipate repeating in 2023. So we will continue to manage our operating expenses consistent with our historical cost discipline. So even with increasing 2023 sales volumes, declining net selling prices and inflationary pressures on costs, we still project full year non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat versus 2022 as we continue our focus on driving productivity and cost efficiencies across the enterprise.\nWe project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 16% to 17% as a percentage of product sales. Recall that we mentioned during our Q3 earnings discussion that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June 2022 replaced the Puerto Rico Excise Tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax. This change will increase our income tax expense beginning in 2023 while reducing our cost of sales by roughly an equivalent amount. Note, however, there will be a negative impact in 2023 of approximately $125 million related to the amount of the PRET that is currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold in the first half of 2023, with most of the charge recognized in the first quarter without a corresponding tax benefit.\nWe expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase 3% to 4% year-over-year compared to our 2022 expenses as we advanced a number of the programs Dr. Reese referenced earlier. This is consistent with our first capital allocation priority to invest in the best innovation, and our operating expense discipline provides us the capital to do just that. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2023 amounts as a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements.\nThese all lead to a projected non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of roughly 50% on a full year basis. We expect non-GAAP other income and expense of approximately $1.4 billion. The expected year-over-year improvement is driven by a change in our accounting for our BeiGene investment we are making in 2023. Beginning in January 2023, we'll no longer record our share of BeiGene results in other income and expense under the equity method of accounting on our non-GAAP income statement. We'll now mark to market our investment with the impact recorded only on our GAAP income statement.\nWe expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. This rate reflects the new Puerto Rico income tax, which, as I explained earlier, replaced the PRET beginning in 2023. We expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023, and we expect that we will continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $925 million in 2023, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including in our new environmentally friendly facilities in Ohio, North Carolina. And after we complete those facilities, we expect our capital expenditures to return to their historical levels.\nI'd also like to make some specific comments around the first quarter of 2023. I'm encouraged that our business is performing as expected through the first month of the year. However, consistent with our historical revenue patterns, we expect revenue in the first quarter of the year to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year and slightly below revenue in Q1 2022. At a portfolio level, we expect product sales to be unchanged from Q1 2022, and other revenues to be lower on a year-over-year basis due to the reasons set out above, including about $225 million related to COVID antibody sales in the first quarter of 2022.\nWe anticipate about $80 million of foreign exchange headwinds in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022. The total of all these items creates greater than $400 million of headwinds versus the first quarter 2022. So these revenue patterns, along with the timing of expenses, are expected to translate into our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin being below 50% as a percentage of product sales, although we continue to expect operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% for all of 2023. Recall, this is all Amgen stand-alone. We will continue to focus on our legacy of execution excellence.\nIn summary, despite macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2022, keeping us on track with our long-term commitments to deliver through 2030 and beyond. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong, and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon during the first half of 2023, which will only strengthen our growth prospects. We would expect to provide updated guidance, as appropriate, at some point after the transaction closes.\nThis concludes the financial update. My thanks to our 25,000-plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2022.\nI'll now turn it back over to Bob for our Q&A.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Well, thank you, Peter and Dave, for soldiering on despite the technical difficulties. And again, apologies to all of you who've dialed in to join us on the call and who found some disruption in the proceedings here.\nA number of you have e-mailed your questions to Arvind. What I'd like to suggest is that any of you who have questions, directly e-mail them now to Arvind, and Arvind will read them. And we'll try to answer them here in the room. And let me just assure all of you that we will rearrange our schedule and be available to answer questions if we don't get to it on this conference call, be available to Arvind and his team to answer questions you may have after we wrap up.\nSo with that, let me turn to Arvind, and we'll tackle the questions that you've already submitted.",

Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, all of you, for joining our call. In the face of both macroeconomic and industry-specific challenges, Amgen remains laser-focused on delivering for patients and shareholders. Benefit of that focus was evident in the third quarter with volumes up a healthy 8% and 16% outside the United States. These results reflect the strong underlying demand for our medicines and the value they bring to patients even in challenging economic times like those prevailing at the moment.\nRevenues for the quarter were down 1%, reflecting a 5% net price decline consistent with what we communicated earlier in the year and a 2% impact from foreign exchange. All told, 11 of our products generated record sales in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 15% with free cash flows reaching $2.8 billion for the quarter. Looking forward, we remain focused on several growth drivers.\nWith the recent closing of the ChemoCentryx acquisition, we're excited to have TAVNEOS in our portfolio. TAVNEOS is the first new treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis in more than 10 years, and we're confident that we can leverage our decades of experience in inflammation and nephrology to bring this innovative medicine to many more patients moving forward.\nTwo recently launched products, TEZSPIRE and LUMAKRAS, are off to solid starts. TEZSPIRE is performing well in asthma, and we have studies underway for several other indications for that product as well. LUMAKRAS is performing well globally with patients, payers and prescribers recognizing the importance of this innovation. With combination studies underway, we're exploring the many different ways this product may benefit patients through time.\nWe have a number of key products led by Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY that we know can benefit millions more patients globally than they do today. And let's not lose sight of the fact that these 4 products collectively generated $2 billion in third quarter sales with volume growth of 17%.\nWe've built an industry-leading biosimilars business, having now launched 5 products in markets around the world, and we're months away from being the first company to launch a biosimilar to HUMIRA in the U.S. AMGEVITA is already the most prescribed HUMIRA biosimilar in Europe, giving us confidence as we prepare to enter the U.S. market.\nLooking forward, our next wave of biosimilars to STELARA, SOLIRIS and EYLEA are well positioned with our having now successfully completed Phase III trials for all 3 of these molecules. We have many potential new medicines advancing through our innovative pipeline, including Olpasiran, tarlatamab, rocatinlimab, bemarituzumab and AMG 133. These 5 molecules and several others that you'll hear about shortly from Dave Reese are vintage Amgen, which is first-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases for which there remains a real need for new and better treatments.\nFinally, we have a highly engaged and committed workforce, and I want to thank them, as always, for their great work. With that, let me turn over to our CFO, Peter Griffith.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Amgen Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution this quarter, and we are on track to deliver against our long-term objectives, most importantly serving patients. Our recently closed acquisition of ChemoCentryx adds a newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, a first-in-class and best-in-class approved treatment for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.\nLet's walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. In Q3, we recognized total revenue of $6.7 billion. This represents a modest decline of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, total revenue and product sales grew 2% and 1%, respectively.\nEarnings per share of $4.70 grew 15% versus our recast Q3 2021. Recall those results included $400 million recorded in R&D expense related to our upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451, rocatinlimab, from Kyowa Kirin Corporation, KKC. Non-GAAP EPS grew 1%, excluding the $400 million expense for the KKC license.\nMurdo will review product sales with you, but I would highlight that our established product portfolio generated almost $900 million in product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund both internal and external innovation. Other revenues of $415 million increased 8% year-over-year.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses decreased 8% year-over-year primarily driven by the $400 million payment to KKC in Q3 2021. Excluding the impact of the $400 million upfront payment, third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting investments to advance our research capabilities and pipeline while also supporting product launches. And we delivered a 52.5% operating margin as a percentage of product sales.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.1% primarily due to changes in product mix, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and lower costs associated with fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments. Excluding the $400 million upfront payment, non-GAAP R&D spend in the third quarter increased 10% year-over-year primarily due to higher late-stage program support and research and early pipeline spend, partially offset by lower marketed product support.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity, automation and digitalization. Non-GAAP OI&E was about $370 million in expense in the third quarter. This was driven by increased net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results because of our use of the equity method of accounting. Our OI&E was lower than anticipated due to gains from liability management that we do not expect to the same extent in future quarters.\nWe have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities and execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. In the third quarter, we executed on the following: first, our recent acquisition at ChemoCentryx is a clear example of investing in the best innovation, in this case, external for patients; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including advancing construction on our new environmentally friendly facilities in Ohio and North Carolina; third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q3 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases. The final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase, ASR program, occurred in the third quarter, and we have repurchased about $6.3 billion of shares year-to-date.\nTurning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our execution through the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect to absorb about $560 million in FX headwinds against product sales based on recent FX rates, of which we absorbed nearly $400 million through the third quarter and this is net of our hedging activities.\nReflecting our strong execution through the third quarter and despite challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we're updating our 2022 revenue guidance range to $26.0 billion to $26.3 billion. We are updating our non-GAAP EPS range to $17.25 to $17.85. This range encompasses both FX headwinds of approximately 3% or $0.45 for the full year based on recent FX rates and costs associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx incurred between closing and year-end.\nI'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q4. We expect FX headwinds to reduce product sales in Q4 by about $165 million. The U.S. government has agreed to purchase $290 million of Nplate. We will recognize about $200 million of those sales in Q4 with the remainder in 2023.\nWe have completed the previously discussed divestiture of Gensenta, our generics business, in Turkey and will no longer recognize product sales and operating expenses from that business effective November 2, 2022. Sales of that business annualized at approximately $90 million. We now expect full year other revenue for 2022 between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus our prior guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.\nWhen comparing against our recast 2021 results, we continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% as a percentage of product sales.\nWe now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 to decrease 5% to 8% year-over-year compared to our recast 2021 non-GAAP R&D expenses, which include the $400 million upfront payment we discussed above. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be roughly flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales.\nWe expect OI&E to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion with fourth quarter results closer to the first and second quarter results. For the full year, we now anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, down from our prior guidance of 14.0% to 15.0%.\nAs you consider your modeling for 2023, recall that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June of 2022 that replaced the Puerto Rico excise tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax will increase our 2023 income tax expense while reducing by roughly an equivalent amount of cost of goods sold. Note, however, there will be a onetime residual negative impact in 2023 related to the amount of the PRET currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold without a corresponding tax benefit. This charge is slightly larger than the benefit previously recognized with the implementation of the PRET in 2011, which was discussed in our [2021] (corrected by company after the call) Form 10-K.\nSumming up, since the business review in February, much has changed at the macro level with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, persistently high inflation, higher interest rates and the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. Despite these headwinds, we have executed well in 2022. As we plan for 2023, we anticipate that these headwinds will continue. We're adapting our operating plans and expect to successfully execute against them.\nLike previous years, we expect to provide 2023 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong. I thank our millions of patients for their courage and my 25,000 colleagues for their mission-driven work on behalf of those patients every day.\nThis concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. We saw strong volume growth in the third quarter with an 8% increase year-on-year. We delivered record quarterly sales for 11 products, including EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, AMGEVITA, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, third quarter global product sales grew 1% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price, consistent with our prior estimates. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales declined 1% year-over-year.\nI'll start now with our general medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 14% year-over-year driven by 20% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 7% year-over-year driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $201 million for the quarter driven by 45% volume growth in the U.S. and 30% volume growth outside of the U.S.\nRepatha sales increased 14% year-over-year driven by 52% volume growth, which was partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated 32% volume growth aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We also saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., sales of Repatha grew 26% driven by 73% volume growth. Net price declines outside the U.S. were primarily a result of Repatha's inclusion on China's National Reimbursement Drug List as of January 1, 2022. Overall, we remain focused on addressing leading cause of morbidity and mortality by bringing Repatha to patients in need all around the world.\nMoving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales increased 3% year-over-year for the quarter. Otezla saw 9% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory and unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In the U.S., Otezla remains the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share, and we see broader adoption of Otezla among patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Looking forward, we expect continued strong volume growth given Otezla's established safety profile, strong payer coverage and unique position as the only systemic oral that can treat a broad spectrum of patients with psoriasis regardless of the severity of their disease.\nENBREL sales decreased 14% year-over-year for the third quarter driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and a 3% decline in volume. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety.\nI'm very pleased with our strong U.S. launch of TEZSPIRE, which generated $55 million of sales in the third quarter. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled without requiring any phenotypic and biomarker testing.\nWe recently completed our acquisition of ChemoCentryx, which adds TAVNEOS to our portfolio. TAVNEOS recently launched as a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis, or AAV. This is a serious systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This inflammatory disease can lead to permanent organ damage and, in some severe cases, can be life-threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in treatment for the 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV.\nAAV is often managed by rheumatologists and nephrologists, where Amgen has a strong market presence and successful track record. We look forward to applying our deep expertise and inflammation experience to help many more patients manage AAV with TAVNEOS.\nMoving to our hematology and oncology business. Our 6 innovative products grew 8% year-over-year with 10% volume growth. For Vectibix and Nplate, strong volume growth in the quarter benefited from timing of shipments to our partners in Japan.\nOur launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $75 million in the third quarter. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 3% driven by lower net selling price due to a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from our reimbursement approval in Germany. This was partially offset by 15% volume growth.\nIn the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,700 patients by over 2,200 clinicians in both academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining markets.\nAs we've noted before, near term, the market for LUMAKRAS is focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from earlier-line therapy and the potential of LUMAKRAS to treat other tumor types.\nSales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price for MVASI in the U.S. declined 37% year-over-year and for KANJINTI, declined 38% year-over-year. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches.\nWe're preparing ourselves for the upcoming launch of AMJEVITA, our HUMIRA biosimilar, in the U.S. in early 2023, followed by the next wave of biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution in the quarter. Our international presence and diverse portfolio of products position us well to deliver on the execution of our long-term growth strategy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Reese\n\nEVP of Research & Development, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by welcoming our new colleagues from ChemoCentryx. We're excited that you're now part of Amgen. For research and development, the third quarter was one of continued execution where we presented new data on several programs and continued to progress our innovative clinical pipeline.\nBeginning with general medicine. This coming weekend at the American Heart Association meeting, we plan to present data from a Phase II study of Olpasiran, a lipoprotein (a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule in subjects with elevated Lp(a). We also plan to present additional data from the Repatha FOURIER and Repatha open-label extension studies highlighting the association between the significant and sustained achievement of low and very low LDL cholesterol levels and lower rates of major cardiovascular events.\nData from the single- and multiple-dose cohorts of the Phase I study of AMG 133, a multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, or GIPR, and activates the GLP-1 receptor, will be presented at the 20th World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease Hybrid Conference in December. As a reminder, the unique aspect of AMG 133 is the inhibition of GIPR, an innovative approach that we chose to take based on human genetic data that suggest decreased expression of GIPR leads to lower body mass index and lower weight. We look forward to discussing the Repatha and Olpasiran data along with an update on AMG 133 at our investor call scheduled for Monday, November 7.\nTurning to inflammation. In September, we presented data from the Phase III SPROUT trial, where Otezla treatment resulted in significant improvement in measures of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at week 16 compared to placebo in children ages 6 to 17. We also presented data from the Otezla Phase III DISCRETE trial, where 16-week data demonstrated statistically significant improvements in genital psoriasis, including skin, itch and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Based on these results, discussion with the FDA is ongoing for DISCRETE to add clinical data to the U.S. prescribing information, and discussions with regulatory authorities globally for SPROUT are forthcoming.\nIn September, TEZSPIRE was approved in the European Union and in Japan, and regulatory reviews continue in other jurisdictions. In oncology, we presented data from tarlatamab, a DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule being studying in patients with small cell lung cancer. These data demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with notable response durability and survival. In this setting, tarlatamab delivered a confirmed overall response rate of 23%, a median duration of response of 13 months and a median overall survival of 13.2 months. We continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase II study in this setting.\nWe're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with second-line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.\nIn August, we presented data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor and SHIP2 combination studies. Based on these data, we continue to explore LUMAKRAS in both settings. In September, we presented data on LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix, where this combination demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Phase III trial continues to enroll using this combination.\nWe also presented data from the global Phase III CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory trial, where LUMAKRAS treatment led to increased progression-free survival and a significantly higher objective response rate in patients with KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer compared with docetaxel. Patient-reported outcomes were also improved with LUMAKRAS versus docetaxel.\nWe've just received initial top line data from a post-marketing requirement study comparing the 960-milligram daily dose of LUMAKRAS with a lower dose of 240 milligrams daily in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Following discussions with regulators, we are planning to submit data from this study along with CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory Phase III data.\nAs a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential to pass the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS, potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels, where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly 1/3s across PD-L1 high expressers, intermediate or low expressers, and PD-L1-negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1-negative population and are planning to initiate a Phase III study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\nFinally, I'm pleased to announce that the primary analysis of a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 938, an investigational biosimilar to EYLEA compared with EYLEA, met its primary end point in subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. With these data and previously announced Phase III data from our biosimilar candidates to SOLIRIS and STELARA, we have completed our goal of delivering positive Phase III data from 3 biosimilars in 2022.\nIn conclusion, with an innovative portfolio where approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term.\nI'll now turn it back to Bob.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, David. And Jason, why don't we now open the line up for questions. If you would remind our callers of the procedure, we can get started.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\n\nArvind Sood\n\nVP of IR, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay, Jason, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our Q2 call. Lots to cover today, so we'll go ahead and jump right in.\nSome of the key themes you'll hear about today include continued volume-driven growth, our strategy of seeking both internal and external innovation, the latter exemplified by our announcement this morning of acquiring ChemoCentryx. And lastly, navigating through a difficult macro environment. We have posted the slides for your background, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation today and some of the statements will be forward-looking. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.\nSo with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we'll be discussing our second quarter performance as well as our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx, which all of us here are very excited about.\nStarting with our operating results. We delivered strong volume-driven growth in the second quarter with unit volumes increasing 10%. Our innovative products performed well globally. Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY all delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter, while KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO in our innovative hematology/oncology portfolio, all generated record quarterly sales.\nOur 2 newest products, LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE are both off to strong starts. LUMAKRAS is now being prescribed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in 25 countries around the world. TEZSPIRE has made a big impact in a short period of time for a broad population of patients with severe asthma in the U.S. With our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we'll be adding another newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, which is for ANCA-associated vasculitis, which is a serious and sometimes life-threatening autoimmune disease. TAVNEOS is a terrific medicine, the first innovation in this space in more than 10 years and very much needed given the harsh side effects of the older treatments and the seriousness of the disease. This product also fits right in Amgen's strategic sweet spot. Our decades of leadership in immunology and nephrology will enable us to add value to the TAVNEOS launch, reaching many more patients and much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible.\nYou'll hear from Murdo in a moment, but let me just say that opportunities like this don't come along often. We're really looking forward to working with the highly skilled and committed team from ChemoCentryx to realize the full potential of this very innovative product. We think we can make a difference for patients and earn an attractive return for our shareholders from this investment.\nDave will talk about the pipeline shortly. Our innovative and biosimilar molecules are proceeding well through the pipeline. Highlights, of course, include the really encouraging data for our cardiovascular molecule, olpasiran, which we expect to move into Phase III testing. On the oncology side, data from our BiTE or bispecifics in several solid tumors are giving us growing confidence in the role these molecules can play in diseases where there are still really big unmet medical needs like small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. Across the board, our biosimilars are advancing to plan, setting us up for the growth of that business from future launches.\nLet me now turn to the current drug pricing debate in Washington. By now, it won't surprise you to hear that we're disappointed by the proposed legislation. For some time, we've been advocating for reforms that respect innovation and provide improved access to it. The proposed bill does neither. The bill will impose price controls, and price controls will stymie innovation. At a time when our nation needs more innovation, the result of this bill will be less of it. Adding to the problem, the bill does precious little to improve the affordability of medicines for patients. So when it comes to innovation and affordability, this bill is lose-lose for patients.\nRecent developments are no surprise, however. We've been positioning our business for some time for a world of compressed life cycles and prices. And if adopted, this legislation would accelerate those trends, and we'll adapt accordingly. We continue to believe that the world needs more innovation, not less, and our focus will remain on advancing more of it. Across inflammation, oncology and general medicine, we have a broad portfolio of innovative and biosimilar products meeting the needs of patients globally, and we remain encouraged by the prospects for our long-term growth. Through the first half of the year, our team performed well meeting the needs of the patients we serve. I'm grateful to them for their dedication to our mission.\nAnd let me turn now over to Peter.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Amgen Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. The CFO organization welcomes ChemoCentryx to Amgen, and we're excited to help enable the teams to serve patients. We are pleased with our performance this quarter, and we're on track to deliver against our long-term objectives. We continue to see the company successfully navigate through foreign exchange headwinds, increasing interest rates, inflation, supply chain pressures and the war in Europe, all while working through COVID variant surges. We're grateful for the hard work of our 24,000 mission-driven colleagues at Amgen and serving our millions of patients around the globe.\nI will present our second quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. We effectively executed in the second quarter with year-over-year volume-driven revenue growth of 1% and product sales growth of 3%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue growth and product sales growth were 3% and 5%, respectively. Our EPS growth of 163% versus our recast Q2 2021 is favorably impacted by the $1.5 billion Five Prime in-process R&D expense in 2021. Excluding the $1.5 billion charge for Five Prime, non-GAAP EPS grew 6%.\nTurning to product sales. Strong volume growth of 10% was driven by Repatha, Prolia, LUMAKRAS and EVENITY as well as a number of other products in the portfolio. Year-over-year volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price of 6% and foreign exchange headwinds of 2%. Our established product portfolio generated almost $1 billion of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund internal and external innovation, just like the ChemoCentryx deal today.\nTransitioning to our biosimilars. AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe, and we are preparing and excited for the U.S. launch of this product in January 2023. Other revenues of about $300 million decreased 24% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 antibody collaboration revenues versus Q2 2021. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased year-over-year, driven primarily by the $1.5 billion Five Prime related expense in 2021 that I previously mentioned. Recall from our Q1 discussion that we've updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC this year.\nFor comparison purposes, our 2021 non-GAAP operating expenses will now include 2 items that were previously excluded. First, the $1.5 billion recorded in acquired in-process R&D associated with Five Prime in Q2 2021. And next, secondly, $400 million recorded in R&D related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa Kirin Corporation in Q3 2021. Excluding the impact of the Five Prime in-process R&D $1.5 billion charge in Q2 '21, second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses declined 5% year-over-year, reflecting continuous improvement driven by digitalization, process simplification and automation, which more than offset investments to advance our pipeline and support product launches.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 2.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 14.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19 antibody shipments and direct manufacturing costs, partially offset by evolving product mix. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the second quarter decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower marketed product support, partially offset by higher spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter declined 2% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity.\nNon-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $410 million expense in Q2. This was driven by net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generate significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, today's announcement of the acquisition of ChemoCentryx is a great example of investing in the best innovation, whether internal or external. Second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina. Third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from the prior -- from last year's quarter. And fourth, opportunistic share repurchases. And while we had no share buybacks in the second quarter, Q1 2022 at $6.3 billion.\nLet's turn to the outlook for the business for 2022. We are pleased with our progress through the first half of 2022, and we continue to be confident in the trajectories of our growth brands. For the full year, we now expect to absorb $500 million in foreign exchange headwinds against product sales based on recent foreign exchange rates, of which we absorbed $200 million in the first half of the year. Reflecting our effective execution to date, while considering the challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we're narrowing our 2022 revenue guidance range to $25.5 billion to $26.4 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18 remains unchanged. This range encompasses foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 3% or $0.45 for the full year, based on recent foreign exchange rates. Of that $0.45, we experienced approximately $0.20 in the first half of the year, so we anticipate an additional $0.25 in foreign exchange headwinds against EPS in the second half of the year. Our non-GAAP EPS range also encompasses costs associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx. Both foreign exchange and ChemoCentryx will influence our performance within the range.\nI'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q3 and Q4. First, we expect foreign exchange headwinds against product sales in Q3 and Q4 of approximately $150 million in each quarter, for a total of $300 million for the second half of the year. These headwinds are most pronounced in brands with significant ex U.S. scale, such as Prolia, Aranesp, AMGEVITA, Vectibix and XGEVA. Second, anticipated negative pricing trends for MVASI and KANJINTI are expected to continue in the second half of the year. And we expect quarter-over-quarter product sales declines in those products for the remainder of the year. We expect KANJINTI sales for the year of roughly $300 million and MVASI sales for the year of roughly $850 million. As we've noted, growth in biosimilars will be driven by the addition of new products and geographies, and we look forward to being the first biosimilar to HUMIRA, the launch in the United States, with AMGEVITA in January 2023. Third, we expect Q3 ENBREL product sales to approximate Q2 ENBREL product sales. Four, for the full year, we now expect Neulasta product sales to be between $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. This is a change from our previous range of $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. We expect the negative pricing trends for Neulasta will continue in the second half of the year. Fifth, although we expect the net impact of these factors will result in Q3 revenues and EPS lower than Q2, I would reiterate that our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged at $17 to $18. We now expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion versus our prior range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. We continue to expect that operating expenses will increase in the second half of the year versus the first half of this year, including important investments in our pipeline as well as both current and upcoming launches, again, including AMGEVITA in January '23 and increasing R&D spend in the third and the fourth quarter. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Our expectations for non-GAAP R&D in 2022 remain unchanged, based on our recast 2021 results, which now include $400 million of expense in Q3 related to the license with KKC for AMG 451, our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be flat to slightly down year-over-year as a percent of product sales. We continue to expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, with an increase in Q3 over the run rate of the first 2 quarters due to both increasing interest rates and our share of BeiGene's results.\nAnd finally, for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 14.0% to 15.0%, up from our prior guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. We will effectively execute throughout the remainder of 2022, despite the continuing headwinds. We will continue investing in the best innovation. We look forward to the launch of AMGEVITA in January '23, driving the launches of TEZSPIRE and LUMAKRAS, progressing our pipeline, successfully integrating ChemoCentryx and delivering on our 2030 objectives.\nThis concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo?\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Second quarter product sales increased 3% year-over-year, driven by a 10% volume increase. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, global product sales grew 5%. We delivered record quarterly sales for Prolia, EVENITY, AMGEVITA, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO, and delivered double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Our ex U.S. business grew 5% with volume growth of 20% year-over-year. In addition to the strong second quarter, I'm also personally excited about our announcement to acquire ChemoCentryx and the opportunity to help patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease. I'll say more about TAVNEOS as I comment on the performance of our inflammation portfolio.\nI'll start with our general medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 17% year-over-year, driven by 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 13% year-over-year. Volumes grew 12%, driven by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY had record sales of $191 million for the quarter, driven by 60% volume growth in the U.S. and 37% volume growth outside of the U.S. ENBREL sales decreased 8% year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by declines in net selling price and volume. ENBREL remains a frequently prescribed therapy due to its long track record of efficacy and safety.\nOur launch of TEZSPIRE is off to a very strong start with $29 million in sales in the second quarter. I'm encouraged to see that both allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. On the access front, TEZSPIRE is a medical benefit product for which we received permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic-eligible without any phenotypic and biomarker limitation.\nNow our agreement to acquire ChemoCentryx brings a compelling opportunity into our leading inflammation and nephrology portfolio with TAVNEOS, a recently launched first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis, or AAV. Let me take a minute to talk about how important I think TAVNEOS will be for patients. AAV is a serious systemic autoimmune disease. It leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. And this inflammatory process can lead to permanent organ damage and, in some severe cases, can be life-threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in the treatment options for the 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV. We're looking forward to meeting and working with the talented team at ChemoCentryx and I'm confident that by applying Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence, we can help many more patients with AAV with TAVNEOS.\nMoving to our hematology and oncology business. Our 6 innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. This was driven by strong volume growth for KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO, which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA volume declined 2% in Q1 and was flat year-over-year in Q2. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $77 million in the second quarter, representing 24% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,000 patients by over 1,900 physicians, and we've seen broad adoption in the community setting where the majority of non-small cell lung cancer patients are treated. Unfortunately, while 85% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, only 50% of the time do oncologists have these test results available to support second-line treatment decisions. And our teams are removing barriers to ensure that the oncologist is able to review KRAS G12C status when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy. And we've seen that when the KRAS G12C status is known in the second-line setting, 85% of patients receive LUMAKRAS. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 40 countries, and we're actively launching in 25 markets and rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries.\nSales of our oncology biosimilars declined 24% year-over-year, while our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares. We expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines, driven by increased competition. In total, our biosimilars portfolio has become an industry-leading franchise, which has contributed $5.5 billion of product sales cumulatively. Looking forward, we're excited about the upcoming launch of AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023, followed by the next wave of biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our execution and volume growth in the quarter, our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, including the exciting addition of TAVNEOS position us well to deliver on our long-term growth strategy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Reese\n\nEVP of Research & Development, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by sharing my excitement for the transaction we announced today. As you've heard, ANCA-associated vasculitis is a serious and sometimes life-threatening disorder. Having treated these patients personally, I fully appreciate the challenges they face and the benefits of TAVNEOS in addressing this significant unmet need. I look forward to working with the team at ChemoCentryx.\nFor research and development, the second quarter was one of continued execution where we announced new data on several programs and continued to progress our robust innovative clinical pipeline.\nBeginning with inflammation. In July, TEZSPIRE was recommended for approval in the European Union by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for severe asthma and also approved in Canada. We initiated the SUNRISE Phase III study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of TEZSPIRE in reducing oral corticosteroid use in adults with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. The ROCKET Phase III program evaluating rocatinlimab, an innovative anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis was initiated in June. Following additional discussions with regulators and our partner, we are amending the studies to further improve patient convenience and investigate a range of doses. No safety or efficacy issues have arisen. We continue to remain very excited about the broad potential of this program in atopic dermatitis.\nIn oncology, we will present data from two of our thoracic programs at the upcoming World Conference on Lung Cancer. The first is tarlatamab, a DLL3-targeting HLE BiTE molecule, being studied in heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer, a population with few treatment options. In this setting, tarlatamab demonstrated promising antitumor activity with notable response durability. We look forward to presenting an updated data set at World Conference and continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase II trial in this study -- in this setting.\nWe're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with second line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.\nI'll also present data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor and SHIP2 combination studies. Data from the former are embargoed until August 7, so we can't discuss the results today. What we can say is that PD-1s have been challenging to combine with other targeted agents due to tolerability issues. We will present a comprehensive data set from this study. As a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential paths to first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels, where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly 1/3's across PD-L1 high expressers, low expressers and PD-L1 negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1 negative population. And based on discussions with regulators, we are planning to initiate a Phase III study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\nWhile a smaller data set, we are very encouraged by both the efficacy and safety of the LUMAKRAS combination with Revolution Medicines' SHIP2 inhibitor RMC-4630. In patients without prior KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment, 3 of 4 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received the highest 2 doses of RMC-4630 in combination with LUMAKRAS had a confirmed partial response and all 4 had disease control.\nIn gastrointestinal cancer, we are also pleased to announce the data from the full dose expansion Phase Ib study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in refractory KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer were accepted for presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress taking place in September. The final analysis of the FIGHT study, Phase II randomized, double-blind, controlled trial evaluating bemarituzumab, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b, FGFR2b, targeting monoclonal antibody, and modified FOLFOX6 in patients with previously untreated advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer was completed. These results continue to demonstrate the bemarituzumab plus modified FOLFOX6 improves the clinical outcome of patients with FGFR2b-expressing tumors with no new safety concerns. A greater survival benefit was observed with increasing levels of FGFR2b expression.\nIn general medicine, we announced top line data from a Phase II study of Olpasiran, our small interfering RNA targeting Lp(a). These data demonstrated a significant reduction from baseline in Lp(a) of up to or greater than 90% at week 36, the primary endpoint, and week 48, the end of treatment period, for the majority of doses, which range from once every 12 weeks to once every 24 weeks in dosing frequency. No new safety concerns were identified during this treatment period. Presentation of these results is expected at a medical congress in the second half of this year. We're very excited about this innovative molecule and are moving to rapidly initiate a Phase III outcome study.\nAMG 133, our multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, GIPR, and activates the glucagon-like peptide 1, GLP-1 receptor, has completed enrollment. We are planning to submit data from the initial cohorts of this Phase I study for medical congress occurring late this year and are actively planning the Phase II program for this molecule.\nIn conclusion, with an innovative portfolio where approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Bob for questions and answers.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Dave. Jason, could you remind our callers of the process for asking a question?",

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\n\nArvind Sood\n\nVP of IR, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay, RJ. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our Q1 call. I think our performance in Q1 exemplifies our continued focus on execution while staying on track to deliver against our long-term objectives. So let's get started.\nSlides have been posted. Quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation, and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to vary or differ materially.\nSo with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. When we last spoke in February, we told you that we'd be focused on execution and that we have a number of opportunities in place that should enable us to deliver long-term attractive growth.\nIn the first quarter of the year, we executed well on these many opportunities, delivering 6% revenue growth and 15% earnings per share growth. We achieved this performance despite the effects of COVID during the first 2 months of the year, currency headwinds, and of course, net selling price declines.\nThe innovative brands that we highlighted in February continued to generate strong volume growth in the first quarter, including Repatha, which was up 49%; Prolia, up 10%; EVENITY, up 59%; and Otezla, up 7% as well as several of our oncology products, which also generated attractive volume growth in the quarter.\nOur 2 newest innovative medicines, LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE, are off to a strong start offering compelling new treatment options for patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer and severe asthma, respectively. And we're also pursuing significant new indications for both of these products.\nLet me just say, with respect to the 5 high-quality biosimilars we have on the market, that they're performing well and in line with our expectations. As we've noted previously, growth for the portfolio of biosimilar products over time will come through the steady introduction of new products, including the U.S. launch of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA in January of next year. AMGEVITA is the first of 6 new biosimilars that we expect to launch by the end of the decade.\nInternational growth is an important component of our long-term strategy, and we saw a strong volume growth outside the U.S. of 15% in the first quarter and nearly 30% volume growth in the Asia Pacific region.\nTurning to our pipeline. We're advancing, as you're aware, a number of mid- to late-stage potentially first-in-class opportunities in inflammation, oncology and general medicine while continuing to invest in our innovative marketed brands and biosimilars. Since our business review, we've had important data readouts for LUMAKRAS, Repatha and ABP 654, which is our Phase III biosimilar candidate to STELARA. We have several more data milestones that come through the remainder of the year.\nLooking to the longer term. We continue to thoughtfully invest in an integrated set of discovery research capabilities, including human data and generative biology, as we look to significantly expand the number of targets we can pursue, reduce cycle times and increase the probability of our success.\nAs to our commitment to innovation, we're committed to pursuing the best innovation available, whether it comes through our own efforts or is sourced externally, and our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to continue to invest in innovation both organically and through business development.\nOur work to serve patients comes at a time when society is confronting many challenges, and we're doing our part to address these, as we have throughout our history, with a focus in 4 areas: removing barriers that limit equitable access to health care, working toward a more just society, minimizing our environmental impact and ensuring that our actions and culture reflect Amgen values. If you're interested in learning more, our latest environmental, social and governance report was published earlier today and is available on our website.\nBefore I turn to Peter, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to serving patients and outstanding execution. Now Peter, over to you.\n\nPeter H. Griffith\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Amgen Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution and growth this quarter as we drive towards our long-term goal. I will walk through our first quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 5 of the slide deck.\nThe first quarter marked another period of solid execution, with year-over-year revenue growth of 6% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15%. For product sales, strong volume growth of 9% was driven by Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY. Volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price and foreign exchange headwinds.\nOur established portfolio comprised of EPOGEN, Aranesp, Neulasta, NEUPOGEN, Sensipar and Parsabiv, generated almost $1 billion of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows.\nTransitioning to our biosimilars, AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe. And looking forward, we will leverage this successful experience as we prepare to launch and grow this product in the United States in January of 2023. For MVASI and KANJINTI, as anticipated, we experienced year-over-year declines driven by net selling price reductions, and we expect this trend to continue for these products. Murdo will discuss product sales in more detail in his remarks.\nOther revenues of $500 million increased 64% year-over-year, primarily driven by our COVID-19 antibody collaboration. First quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year as we invest in our pipeline, execute product launches and drive digitalization across the company. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.1 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.6%, primarily due to higher direct manufacturing costs, COVID-19 antibody manufacturing costs and increased royalties and profit shares. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter decreased 1% year-over-year.\nRecall that Q1 2021 included $53 million related to our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics. Excluding the $53 million for Rodeo in 2021, non-GAAP R&D increased 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the first quarter declined 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities and driving productivity.\nNon-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $413 million expense in Q1. This line item is driven by interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generate significant cash flow and retain excellent financial flexibility to evaluate strategic business development opportunities.\nWe continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, investing in the best innovation, internal and external; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina; and third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q4 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases, including 24.6 million shares of common stock in the first quarter, which included 23.3 million initial shares received and retired under the accelerated stock buyback agreement.\nTurning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our growth to date in 2022, and we're tracking to our 2022 plan. Accordingly, we're reaffirming our 2022 guidance with a revenue range of $25.4 billion to $26.5 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18. This non-GAAP EPS guidance does not include upfront expenses that may occur from certain types of transactions in the future. Similar to our peers, we have updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance recently issued by the SEC.\nFor reference, the only impact as we recast 2021 to incorporate this change is that our non-GAAP operating expenses will now include 2 items that were previously excluded in 2021. First, $1.5 billion recorded and acquired in-process R&D associated with the Five Prime acquisition in Q2 2021. And second, $400 million recorded in research and development related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa Kirin Co. in Q3 2021.\nImportant additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022. Foreign exchange had an adverse impact on our Q1 2022 sales, and based on current rates, it is expected to create headwinds to our reported product sales of approximately $400 million year-over-year and has been included in our guidance. We note that while the results of our hedging program are reported in product sales, our hedging program is designed to partially mitigate the foreign exchange impact on our net income over the full year. In total, our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% or approximately $0.35.\nWe continue to expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. Q1 included a majority of our full year's projected revenue from our COVID collaboration and recall that these revenues in 2021 were recognized across Q2 to Q4. Our COVID collaboration revenue outlook depends on the state of the pandemic and continued government support. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. However, when comparing against our recast 2021 results, total non-GAAP operating expenses will now reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%.\nOur expectations for non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 remain unchanged. Based on our recast 2021 results, in response to the SEC guidance mentioned above, which increased non-GAAP R&D expense in 2021 by $400 million, our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We continue to expect SG&A spend to be flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. And we now expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, reflecting increasing interest rates and our share of BeiGene's results. This is a change from our previous range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.\nAnd for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, up from our prior guidance of 13% to 14%.\nYou've had an opportunity to read the update to our litigation and dispute with the IRS over the proposed adjustments for the period from 2010 to 2015, included in the press release. We firmly believe that the adjustments proposed by the IRS for that time period and the penalties proposed by the IRS for the 2013 to 2015 period are without merit.\nFurther, the amount of the adjustments proposed by the IRS for 2010 to 2015 period overstates by billions of dollars the magnitude of the dispute. We filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court in July 2021 to contest the adjustments previously proposed for the 2010 to 2012 period. And we plan to file another petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest the adjustments proposed in the notice for the 2013 to 2015 period. The dispute is expected to take several years to resolve.\nAmgen believes the IRS assertion of approximately $2 billion in penalties for the 2013 to 2015 period is wholly unwarranted. We've applied a consistent transfer pricing methodology since 2002. We've documented that transfer pricing methodology is required under relevant tax regulations and have extensively discussed that methodology with the IRS across multiple tax audits over multiple tax years. The IRS has never previously proposed transfer pricing penalties.\nAmgen also believes, based upon the positions advanced by the IRS, that the IRS adjustments for the 2010 to 2015 period are overstated by approximately $2 billion due to the IRS failure to account for certain income and expenses. Amgen has reported its income and expenses in a consistent manner for many years, and the IRS has appropriately accounted for the company's income and expenses in all prior audits.\nAny additional tax that could be imposed for the 2010 to 2015 period would be reduced by up to approximately $3.1 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued with respect to the company's Puerto Rico earnings. Amgen previously made advanced tax deposits to the IRS totaling $1.1 billion for the 2010 to 2015 period. These deposits would further reduce any additional cash tax that could be imposed.\nThe IRS is currently auditing the 2016 to 2018 period. We expect the audit to continue for several years, and it is possible that the 2010 to 2015 dispute will be resolved before the conclusion of the 2016 to 2018 audit and administrative appeals process. Any transfer pricing adjustments the IRS may propose for this period will be lessened by the change in tax rates resulting from the 2017 tax reform law, which reduced the difference between the tax rates applicable in the U.S. and Puerto Rico by approximately 2/3 beginning in 2018.\nWe are highly confident in our positions in the litigation and dispute. We are grateful to all of our highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and their important and ongoing contributions to Amgen's mission of serving patients. And now back to the mission of serving every patient every time. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong given the strength of the business and our outstanding and dedicated team of 24,000 colleagues that deliver every day for patients.\nThis concludes the financial update. I'll now turn it over to Murdo.\n\nMurdo Gordon\n\nExecutive VP of Global Commercial Operations, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. First quarter product sales increased 2% year-over-year. We continue to progress our volume-driven growth strategy, which led to a 9% volume increase globally in Q1. We delivered record quarterly sales for Repatha, EVENITY and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Prolia, KYPROLIS and AMGEVITA.\nIn the first 2 months of the year, COVID-19 affected our business in the U.S. and around the world as the Omicron variant led to diminished capacity in the health care sector and reduced working days for our own sales forces. In March and continuing into April, the impact of Omicron in the U.S. receded, which allowed us to engage in increased face-to-face customer interactions. Provider and patient activity have also increased, leading to improvements in demand for our products.\nNow let me review some product details, beginning with our general medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 19% year-over-year with 23% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year. Volumes grew 10%, fueled by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $170 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across our markets.\nMoving to Repatha, the global leader in the PCSK9 class. Repatha sales increased 15% year-over-year, driven by 49% volume growth. And in the U.S., we saw 41% volume growth. Net selling prices declined as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Outside the U.S., sales grew 12% with strong volume growth coming from the inclusion of Repatha on China's National Reimbursement Drug List beginning January 1. We remain focused on increasing Repatha market penetration globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients.\nMoving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla delivered 7% year-over-year volume growth in the first quarter. In the U.S., we saw a strengthening of the market with Otezla remaining the market leader, achieving a 30% share of patients who are new to systemic agents for psoriasis. Otezla's recently expanded label has been well received by payers, providers and patients. We're seeing early signs of physicians using more systemic treatments for mild psoriasis patients, and the majority of dermatologists anticipate increasing the use of Otezla for mild psoriasis.\nGlobally, Otezla sales decreased 5% year-over-year due to net price declines and lower inventory levels in the U.S. across wholesale and specialty pharmaceutical channels. Otezla net price declines in the U.S. were driven primarily by enhancements to our co-pay and bridge programs to support new patients starting treatment. Looking forward, we expect lower year-on-year price erosion for the remaining quarters of 2022. We also expect continued volume growth driven by broader adoption of Otezla, given our unique broad indication regardless of the severity of psoriasis.\nENBREL sales decreased 7% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by declines in net selling price and inventory levels. Year-over-year, volume remained flat in the first quarter, supported by ENBREL's long track record of efficacy and safety.\nOur launch of TEZSPIRE is off to a strong start, with $7 million in sales in the first quarter. Initial feedback from payers, providers and patients is very positive. Physician's unaided awareness increased to greater than 65% since launch, supported by our disease state education programs. On the access front, TEZSPIRE is a medical benefit product for which we expect permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1 of this year. Both allergists and pulmonologists acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated properties and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations.\nMoving to the hematology and oncology business. Our 6 innovative products grew 17% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. We saw strong volume growth from KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO, which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA sales grew 7% year-over-year, while volumes declined 2%.\nOur launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $62 million in the first quarter, representing 38% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to approximately 2,500 patients by over 1,500 physicians in both academic and community settings since launch. While approximately 80% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, the test result is not always available and/or reviewed when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy.\nThe opportunity to improve care is to ensure the KRAS G12C status is available in the patient chart, or electronic medical record and reviewed by the oncologist to ensure that LUMAKRAS is discussed as an option for the patient. LUMAKRAS has strong payer coverage in the U.S., with 93% of patients having formulary access. Outside the U.S., sotorasib has now been approved in nearly 40 countries around the world with recent reimbursement approvals in the United Kingdom and Japan.\nSales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year. While our biosimilars, MVASI and KANJINTI, both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines, driven by increased competition and ASP erosion. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches beginning with AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023.\nOverall, we're executing well against our growth strategy with strong volume trends across our portfolio. With that, I'll turn it to Dave.\n\nDavid M. Reese\n\nEVP of Research & Development, Amgen Inc.\n\nThanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter was one of continued execution in R&D, where we focused on progressing our robust innovative clinical pipeline comprised of many potential first-in-class opportunities. Beginning with inflammation, we initiated 2 additional studies with TEZSPIRE in severe asthma: the WAYFINDER Phase IIIb study, designed to demonstrate a reduction in oral corticosteroid use in adult participants on long-term oral corticosteroid therapy; and the PASSAGE Phase IV real-world effectiveness study, designed to evaluate TEZSPIRE in adult and adolescent participants, including underrepresented populations such as Black Americans, smokers and patients with asthma-COPD overlap.\nPhase III planning continues for rocatinlimab, formerly AMG 451, an anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with heterogeneous moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Rocatinlimab binds activated pathogenic T cells expressing OX40. Through its unique mechanism of action, rocatinlimab inhibits and prevents the expansion of activated pathogenic T cells and reduces their number. Thus, rocatinlimab has the potential to lead to profound disease control. In addition, this provides a rationale for longer dosing intervals, with the prospect of achieving disease modification. ROCKET, the comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase III program, remains on track to initiate in mid-2022.\nIn our biosimilar portfolio, last week, we announced preliminary results from a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 654 compared to STELARA, ustekinumab, in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 654 and STELARA.\nNow turning to oncology. Earlier this month, we presented data at AACR on outcomes from a 2-year analysis of the LUMAKRAS CodeBreaK 100 trial, which demonstrated the long-term clinical benefit, including overall survival of patients with KRAS G12C mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with LUMAKRAS. These data showed that roughly 1/3 of patients were still alive at 2 years and that the prolonged tumor response was observed with a 41% objective response rate by central review.\nWhile this was a single-arm trial without a control arm, the efficacy data compare favorably with anticipated outcomes in this patient population based on historical data. There were no new safety signals reported over the course of this 2-year follow-up analysis. We have submitted data from the LUMAKRAS PD-1 combination and SHIP2 combination cohorts to a medical congress taking place in the late summer, while top line results from the LUMAKRAS confirmatory Phase III study versus docetaxel and the dose comparison study are on track for Q3 and Q4, respectively.\nAlso in the lung cancer setting, we have submitted updated Phase I data of tarlatamab, our DLL3-targeting half-life extended BiTE molecule being used in patients with relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer to a medical congress taking place in the late summer. And we plan to initiate DeLLphi-303, a Phase Ib study testing tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer this quarter.\nFinally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we are enrolling patients in a Phase Ib study of bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against FGFR2b.\nTurning to gastrointestinal cancers. We presented data at the ASCO plenary series in February, where LUMAKRAS demonstrated a centrally confirmed objective response rate of 21% and disease control rate of 84% across 38 heavily pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer patients. We continue to explore the benefit of LUMAKRAS as a monotherapy and when combined with other agents in this setting.\nIn third-line colorectal cancer, Phase III study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix is enrolling patients. In gastric cancer, a Phase Ib study of bemarituzumab plus oral chemotherapy regimens in tumors with FGFR2b over expression has been initiated.\nIn general medicine, we were pleased to announce the results from 2 Repatha open-label extension trials, the FOURIER-OLE study, designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in more than 6,600 high-risk adults with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease on stable effective statin therapy.\nIn the OLE studies, patients receive Repatha for approximately 5 years, with some patients receiving Repatha for up to 8.5 years in aggregate across the FOURIER and OLE studies. The combined results from these studies reinforce the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in lowering LDL cholesterol. We are extremely encouraged by the sustained benefit of this medicine in patients with cardiovascular disease who still struggle to get their LDL-cholesterol level below the recommended targets.\nThese extended results for patients on Repatha are consistent with what the health care community has learned over the past 7 decades about the benefits of lowering cholesterol. That is robust and sustained LDL cholesterol reduction affects the spectrum of important cardiovascular outcomes. We look forward to sharing these data at a medical congress later this year.\nIn conclusion, we continue to execute crisply across our innovative and biosimilar portfolios and look forward to sharing new data from a number of our programs throughout the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A.\n\nRobert A. Bradway\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Amgen Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Dave. RJ, could you remind our callers of the process for submitting a question? We're happy to answer questions now.",

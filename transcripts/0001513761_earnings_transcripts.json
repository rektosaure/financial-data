Welcome to Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sherry, and I will be your operator.\n[Operator Instructions]\nThis conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inmon. Ms. Inmon, please proceed.\n\nSarah Inmon\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Sherri, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2025 earnings call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website. We will be referring to a slide presentation during the call, which can also be found on our website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with third quarter 2025 results was issued this morning and is also available on our IR website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our call results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all references to 2025 net yields and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2024. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Harry Sommer. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. I'll begin my remarks today with a discussion of the third quarter results and recent booking pace, and we'll then get into some recent highlights on our 3 brands and strategy. I'll then provide some brief comments on how 2026 is shaping up before handing the call over to Mark, who will provide a deeper dive into our financial performance and outlook. So side right in, I am pleased to report another record quarter with the results that met or exceeded guidance across all metrics. As a result, we are reiterating our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising our guidance for adjusted EPS.\nOur performance this quarter was driven by solid customer demand which drove load factors higher, reflecting the continued strength of our brands and the execution of our charting the course strategy. As previously stated, we remain committed to balancing return on investment with return on experience delivering exceptional vacations, driving sustainable financial performance and strengthening our balance sheet. Now delving a bit more into the details of our third quarter results shown on Slide 4, we achieved another quarter of strong performance and solid execution across the business. We met or exceeded guidance we provided in July and delivered the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history. Load factor finished ahead of expectations at 106.4% driven by stronger-than-anticipated demand for families, particularly at the NCL brand, resulting in net yield growth of 1.5% and costs were essentially flat year-over-year, which resulted in adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, a milestone achieved for the first time in company history.\nAs a result, our trailing 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin reached 36.7%, an improvement of 220 basis points from last year and another meaningful step towards achieving our charting the course margin target. Finally, adjusted EPS came in at $1.20, exceeded guidance by $0.06. In -- turning now to recent demand. Bookings in the third quarter marked the strongest third quarter bookings in company history with bookings up over 20% from last year. With this trend continuing into October, all collectively driven by strong demand, not only for short Caribbean sailings this winter, but also for our luxury brands. These results not only underscore the strength of today's demand but also provides a solid foundation for growth in the quarters ahead. Of course, there are other highlights in the subvenful quarter that I would like to share. First, on the financial side, which Mark will cover in more detail, we completed a multifaceted capital market transaction that, among other benefits, reduced our share outstanding on a fully diluted basis by more than $38 million or over 7%, materially improving our adjusted EPS.\nOn the guest experience side, we introduced several enhancements, including our new Tri-branded loyalty and recognition program, which I'll discuss later, and the launch of an enhanced website for the NCL brand. The new site is already delivering results with faster performance, better guest experience and higher conversion rates, resulting in increased bookings. We have also made it easier for guests to personalize their vacation with more targeted pre-cruise offerings. For example, we are now promoting high-value onboard products such as Vibe Beach Club passes, drinks and dining packages, streaming WiFi, spa treatments and shore excursions through personalized e-mails and push notifications. Pre-cruise sales at our all-time high levels, which drives higher onboard revenue and higher guest satisfaction and repeat rates. On the sustainability front, we recently announced a landmark agreement with Spain's Repsol for supplying renewable marine fuels at the Port of Barcelona.\nThis 8-year agreement starts this upcoming European season and is a first-of-a-kind partnership in the industry, underscoring our sale and sustained commitment. This agreement is a great example of cross-industry collaboration that could unlock meaningful progress and secure long-term access to renewable marine fuel in Europe. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the high-level strategies we're executing across our 3 brands, which are summarized on Slide 5. These strategies are designed to ensure we continue delivering exceptional experiences for our guests while advancing our charting the course targets and creating long-term value for our shareholders. At Norwegian Cruise Line, our focus is enhancing the family appeal and experience. At Oceania Cruises, we're working to firmly position the brand within the luxury sector. And at Regent Seven Seas Cruises, we're focused on maintaining its well-earned reputation as the pinnacle of ultra-luxury cruising.\nMoving to Slide 6. I'll dive into the strategic evolution underway at Norwegian Cruise Line. This is a transformation that has been underway for several months and is now accelerating with sharpened focus under the brand's new leadership, including a new Chief Commercial Officer and a new Chief Marketing Officer with a robust search for a world-class leader to head the NCL brand well underway. As part of this evolution, the brand is executing a focused 3-part commercial strategy to drive yields and profitability higher over the next year and into the future. First, we're focusing more on families as a core demographic. We're building brand familiarity through our short Caribbean sailings, which give more guests, particularly families, a chance to experience our amazing product. That exposure helps build loyalty and creates a pipeline of repeat guests for the future.\nOver time, this will increasingly support one of our key priorities, boosting load factors. We are working diligently to attract more families to the brand to experience everything Norwegian has to offer, both on board and at our destinations, particularly our upgraded private island Great Stirrup Cay and through enhanced onboard offering geared towards families. Second, we're strengthening our brand positioning and marketing. To reach the broader family market, NCL is developing a refreshed brand campaign designed to elevate awareness and strengthen emotional connection, which we should launch in early 2026. Alongside that, we're optimizing our marketing mix and spend to ensure we're getting the best possible return on every marketing dollar, creating efficiencies throughout 2026.\nLastly, we're elevating the guest experience. We are pleased to reiterate that our previously announced enhancements at Great Stirrup Cay are all on track to open around the holidays, including the new multishipier, welcome center, trans system, an expansive 28,000 square foot gated pool, the size of an entire cruise ship with a swim of bar, kids flash zones, 5 shore club, new dining and beverage outlet and dozens of new cabanas. The upcoming summer '26 launch of the Great Tides Water Park will mark another milestone moment for the brand spanning nearly 6 acres, the water park will feature 19 thrilling water slides, a dynamic River, a huge kids splash zone, a 10 and 15 footwall cliff jump and an innovative jet cards attraction. It will be the perfect family-friendly addition to our already exceptional island amenities, which include Silver Cove and exclusive retreat offering magnificent villas at a beach Cloud. And that's just the additions at Great Stirrup Cay. We're also looking ahead to enhancements across other destinations in our portfolio.\nIn addition, we are expanding our kids and family programming with improved activities in entertainment, ensuring engaging experiences for guests of all ages. At the core of this approach is our ambition to be the brand of choice in the contemporary space for both seasoned travelers and premium families while maximizing profitability. Future travel intent, current bookings, guest satisfaction scores and future onboard cruise sales are all at or near record levels, clear signs that our strategy is working. We continue to actively balance between load factor and price with the goal of optimizing net yield margins and most importantly, profitability. Now turning to Slide 7. This strategy is already leading to tangible results. Our increased Caribbean presence, additional short sailings, which capitalize on demand for closer-to-home family vacations and continued investment in our private island destinations are already driving higher load factors.\nThe fourth quarter marked the first period where we're truly seeing the shift in strategy come to fruition. In Q4 of this year, we will have the highest mix of short selling since 2019, reflecting our deliberate move to rebalance Norwegian's deployment towards closer to home itineraries. This approach expands our reach, appealing to a broader mix of guests, particularly premium families and [indiscernible] travelers, while allowing us to better leverage our private island investments. In Q4, short selling capacity is increasing over 80% versus prior year, and our Caribbean deployment is moving to over 50% of our total capacity. As a result, we now expect load factors to improve over 100 basis points year-over-year to nearly 102%. Now I know many of you will probably ask why our fourth quarter yield guidance has changed from our prior implied guide to growth of 3.5% to 4%. So let me get ahead of that question.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are very focused on load factor and increasing brand visibility through our Caribbean product. It has been quite some time since we've had this level of short sailings in our deployment and demand has exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, our Caribbean short sailings are performing quite well, particularly among our targeted family demographic, driving load factors higher than we had forecasted. On our Premian sailings, we are seeing more families, which means for children at each cabin. We expect core pricing for the first and seconds to be well up. The addition of child as third and force in the cabin, however, will naturally dilute blended pricing. The end result remains strong yield growth and strong margin expansion. This is an intentional planned trade-off to drive margins and profitability higher in both the short and long term. These early results from our increased short sailings creating deployment are encouraging and reinforce our confidence in this strategy. Now looking ahead, we expect this dynamic to accelerate in the first quarter of 2026, with load factor projected to be 200 to 300 basis points higher year-over-year, driven by a meaningful 40% increase in short sailings.\nAdditionally, this will coincide with the soft opening of Great Stirrup Cay new amenities around the holidays, while the more meaningful enhancements will be coming when great tied to water park opens later in summer 2026. While we returned next winter, we'll have the full benefit of the new amenities at Great Stirrup Cay and the word of mouth from thousands and thousands of satisfied guests, which will further strengthen performance. Moving on to Slide 8. We're confident this positive momentum will continue throughout 2026 and with load factors building on 2025 levels and returning to, if not exceeding 2024 levels, reaching at least 105%. This is sustained progress driven by this new deployment strategy. Now talking a bit about the Norwegian brand. And now I want to turn to our luxury portfolio, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Cruises on Slide 9. The opportunity we're seeing in luxury cruising has never been stronger. Global luxury spending continues to expand with experiences ranking as the fastest-growing segment in 2024. Both Oceania and Regent are perfectly positioned to capture this demand.\nOceania delivers luxury by choice, offering guests elevated personalized experiences with exceptional culinary offerings, while Regent is the pinnacle of the ultra-luxury all-inclusive luxury segment. To fully capitalize on this opportunity, we brought back Jason Montague earlier this year to lead both brands and drive the next phase of growth. Turning to Slide 10. You can see the tangible progress already underway. The first thing Jason did was optimize the organization, ensuring we had the right leadership structure and the right people in the right roles to support long-term growth. He's been deeply engaged in our fleet management program, including our pipeline of 6 luxury ships, overseeing the design and launch of Oceania Allura and Regent Seven Seas Prestige, both of which will set new standards for design, experience and efficiency. He has also been very focused on elevating our existing fleet and Seven Seas Mariner is the latest example of that commitment. The ship entered drydock just yesterday where we're undertaking the full transformation, refreshing suites, reimagining public spaces and introducing an enhanced pool grill featuring the new wood-fired pizzeria concept for relaxed or Al Fresco dining. Seven Seas Borger will be undergoing the similar revitalization when she enters dry dock next year coupled with our 3 new vessels and the upcoming prestige delivery in 2026, we truly will have the world's most luxurious fleet.\nFinally, Jason has been laser-focused on enhancing brand positioning and marketing across both brands ensuring that Oceania is fully recognized in the luxury space, while Regent maintains its place as the pinnacle of ultra-luxury cruising. We know we had 2 extraordinary luxury products. Now it's about telling these brand stories more powerfully and consistently in the market. I want to take a moment to recognize Jason and the entire luxury team. They're doing an outstanding job executing on the strategy, elevating both the Regent and Oceania and positioning our luxury portfolio as a key growth driver for 2026 and beyond. Finally, moving to our loyalty program on Slide 11. I'm thrilled to share how we're taking guest recognition to the next level. We recently launched our new loyalty status honoring program, allowing members of Latitude Rewards, Oceania Club and the Seven Seas Society to have their tier status honored across all 3 of our award-winning brands. Our guests will now be able to enjoy the loyalty PERCs they've earned no matter which of our brands they use to sell. It's a major step forward that makes it easier than ever to explore the world within our NCLH family.\nThis change will also encourage our top guests to try our other brands. It's really about deepening our connection with our most loyal guests, rewarding their commitment and giving them even more ways to vacation better and experience more. And while it's early, the preliminary results of this program have well exceeded our expectations, proving again the power of our brands. And with that, I'd be happy to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our third quarter results highlighted on Slide 12. We delivered another strong quarter, exceeding or meeting guidance across all metrics. Occupancy came in at 106.4%, nearly 100 basis points above guidance, driven by strong family demand across all itineraries. Net yields grew 1.5%, in line with guidance, fueled by strong pricing growth of over 3%. On the cost side, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel was down 0.1 point coming in slightly better than expected as our cost control efforts continue to bear fruit. As a result of better-than-expected fuel consumption, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.019 billion, above our guidance of $1.015 billion. Adjusted net income came in at $596 million. Adjusted EPS came in $0.06 ahead of guidance at $1.20. Overall, this was a solid quarter, consistent with our expectations.\nMoving on to fourth quarter and full year guidance on Slide 13. We expect occupancy to be approximately 101.9% in the quarter, roughly 100 basis points above the prior year and our previous implied guidance. As Harry mentioned, we are very focused on load factor and brand visibility at the Norwegian brand, and we are encouraged by the progress we have made this quarter as family demand surpassed our initial expectations driving occupancy higher. I want to reiterate that we continue to balance load factor and price recognizing the natural give and take between the two. As we attract more families, we are seeing more third and fourth guests in a cabin. And naturally, those guests come in at a lower price point which has a modest impact on overall pricing. As a result of this dynamic in the fourth quarter, we expect net yield to grow approximately 3.5% to 4% reflecting our deliberate decision to welcome more families while taking a slight trade-off on price, which remains healthy at nearly 3% growth.\nAs a result, full year net yield growth expectations have been adjusted slightly to 2.4% to 2.5% for the year. Turning to cost in the fourth quarter. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel is expected to be essentially flat, up only 50 basis points year-over-year. This is slightly higher than our prior implied guidance for the quarter, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses. As a result, for the full year, we now expect cost to increase 75 basis points, well below inflation. The second year in a row, we have been able to achieve this strong cost control, all while achieving record guest satisfaction scores and repeat rates. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $555 million and adjusted EPS to be $0.27. As a result, we are reiterating our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance at $2.72 billion and increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $2.10, which represents almost a 19% increase year-over-year.\nMoving on to Slide 14. A I want to take a moment to highlight the strong progress we've made on our cost savings program. Back at our Investor Day in May 2024, we set a bold goal to achieve more than $300 million in savings and we remain fully on track to deliver on that commitment. In 2024, we realized over $100 million in savings, and we're on pace for another $100 million plus in 2025 which has allowed us to limit net cruise cost growth to only about 3/4 of 1%. We are carrying this culture of cost discipline into 2026. we have full line of sight to achieving at least another $100 million in savings next year, keeping our unit cost growth well below the rate of inflation while continuing to deliver an exceptional guest experience. These cost savings have been a major driver of our continued margin expansion, as you can see on Slide 15. Our adjusted operational EBITDA margin has increased by roughly 600 basis points since year-end 2023, and we remain on track to reach approximately 37% by the end of this year.\nLooking ahead to 2026, we expect this positive momentum to continue supported by our proven algorithm of low to mid-single-digit yield growth and sub-inflationary cost growth. The strategic initiatives Harry outlined earlier are central to this plan, from bringing more families to the Norwegian brand and increasing load factor, to refreshing our brand and marketing and the launching of new amenities at Great Stirrup Cay this year around the holidays and the new water park next year. At the same time, our luxury brands continue to benefit from strong demand trends and their truly best-in-class offerings. Oceania is building momentum as we position it squarely in the luxury space, and Regent remains the clear leader in ultra-luxury cruising, delivering an unmatched product and service experience. I'm confident that all of these efforts driving both the top and bottom line will enable us to further expand margins and achieve our approximately 39% target next year.\nTurning to Slide 16. You can see our debt maturity profile, which has been extended and strengthened following our recent capital markets activity. In September, we successfully completed a series of strategic transactions that significantly enhanced our financial flexibility. We refinanced the majority of our 2027 exchangeable notes extending our maturity profile, and reduced our shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis by approximately 38 million shares, all while remaining essentially net leverage neutral. In addition, we refinanced approximately $2 billion of debt, including the replacement of about $1.8 billion of secured debt to unsecured. As a result, we have now fully eliminated all secured notes from our capital structure. These actions underscore our continued focus on optimizing our balance sheet, improving collateral utilization and positioning the company for sustainable long-term growth.\nTurning to net leverage on Slide 17. I want to emphasize that reducing leverage remains our top financial priority. In the third quarter, net leverage increased slightly from the second quarter to 5.4x from 5.3x. This modest uptick reflects the delivery of Oceania Allura where we took on the associated debt but have not yet annualized the EBITDA contribution from the ship. We now expect to end the year at approximately 5.3x. And excluding the impact of noncash foreign exchange revaluation on our euro-denominated debt related to Norwegian Aqua and Oceania Allura, our leverage would end the year at approximately 5.2x. In a year when we've taken delivery of 2 new vessels, keeping leverage flat as a notable accomplishment and positions us well to achieve our 2026 target of reaching the mid-4x range.\nWrapping up our solid performance so far this year and the ongoing benefits from our cost initiatives reflect meaningful progress on our top financial priorities, deleveraging, expanding margins and fortifying the balance sheet. I'll hand the call back over to Harry to close out the call.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Mark. Now looking at Slide 18, I'd like to once again highlight the significant progress we're making towards our key charting the course financial targets. By year-end 2025, we expect adjusted operational EBITDA margin to expand by more than 600 basis points versus 2023, adjusted EPS to grow nearly threefold net leverage to decline by 2 full turns and adjusted ROIC to continue its upward trajectory. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished so far in 2025.\nLooking ahead, 2026 is shaping up to be another outstanding year with capacity set to grow approximately 7% and as the Regional Luna and Seven Seas precede join the fleet, we expect to see continued strength across all 3 brands. At Norwegian, we anticipate even more families selling with us further lifting load factor and driving margin expansion. Our strong capacity growth, combined with low to mid-single-digit yield gains and sub-inflationary cost growth is expected to drive meaningful margin expansion and continued deleveraging in 2026. I'm confident in our trajectory and excited about with the last months of 2025 and the year ahead will bring as we continue charting our course to our sustainable, long-term value creation. With that, I'll hand the call back to Sherry to begin the question-and-answer session."

My name is Maria, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Inmon, please proceed.\n\nSarah Inmon\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2025 earnings call.

As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during the call, which can also be found on our website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2021 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures.

Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings call. I am pleased to report another record quarter where we met or exceeded guidance across all metrics, allowing us to reiterate our full year guidance on the back of solid customer demand that resulted in record bookings over the last 3 months. These results reflect the continued strength of our brands and the disciplined execution of our strategy. While we are encouraged by our performance during the first half of 2025 our focus remains firmly on delivering long-term value through our charting de course strategy. This includes our commitment to balancing return on investment with return on experience ensuring that we deliver exceptional locations while driving strong financial results and strengthening our balance sheet.\nThese have been an exceptionally active and exciting last few months that included several high-impact announcements and significant milestones that will shape the future of our company for years to come. I'll walk through each of these in more detail shortly. But highlights include the successful delivery of Oceana Cruises Zalora, the brand's Ace vessel, the confirmation of 2 additional next-generation sonata class ships for Oceania Cruises bringing their future order book to 4 ships -- and earlier this week, the announcement of the new -- great Tight water park at -- great Sure, marking our latest initiative to unlock the full value of the greatest island in the Caribbean.\nI'll wrap up my remarks by focusing on top line drivers and an update on our return algorithm. I'll then hand the call over to Mark, who will provide a deeper dive into our financial performance and outlook. Let me begin with our second quarter performance reflected on Slide 4, which includes record results and continued momentum across all metrics. We met or exceeded all guidance we provided at the end of April in our last earnings call, and achieved record Q2 revenue. Most notably, net yield outperformed our expectations, growing 3.1% as a result of strong close-in demand and onboard spend. This, combined with the benefit from the timing of certain costs, drove adjusted EBITDA of $694 million, $24 million above guidance, -- as a result, our trailing 12-month margin now stands at 36.3%, representing a year-over-year improvement of more than 300 basis points, bringing us meaningfully closer to our charting the course margin target.\nLastly, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $0.51, in line with guidance despite an $0.08 headwind from the impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily related to our advanced ticket sales balance.\nMoving to Slide 5. Let's take a look at 1 of the most exciting recent announcements for Norwegian Cruise Line brand, the long-awaited full next phase of development at -- great Serve K. Earlier this week, we unveiled plans for great ties a massive 6-acre water park opening in the summer of 2026 with 170-foot tower and 19 water slides, an 800-foot dynamic River, Cripps, and a dedicated 9,000 square feet kids slatstone. Great Tight water park will redefine the experience in our private island and make great Serve K the greatest private island in the Caribbean. This marks a major milestone in the evolution of Great Serve K, which along with our previously announced amenities, reflects our strategy to deliver experiences that resonate with families and multiple generation of travelers from kids and teens to parents and grandparents, we are indeed enhancing the destinations with more of something for everyone.\nTo build excitement around the -- Great Tides water park we launched Escape to -- the -- great Life, a consumer campaign featuring immersive pop-ups in New York City and Miami. If you're in New York, stop by 104 Grand Street today for a preview of what's coming. The campaign kicks off a refreshed look and feel for Great Serve K that coincides with the island's many enhancements. The Gray ties water park is just 1 part of a broader transformation -- by year-end, the Norwegian brand will have debuted a new peer, a new welcome center, a new 28,000 square foot pool area with multiple swim of bars, cabanas and a kids splash zone following in the spring of 2026 is the opening of Horizon Park, Hank Bay and the adults only beach area, the Vive Shore Club alongside additional amenities in our award-winning Silver Cove. These new additions will drive incremental onboard revenue while enhancing the guest experience, the classic balance of return on investment with return on experience, which we discussed so often, which will lead to higher guest satisfaction rates and stronger returns at what is already 1 of our highest-rated destinations. In 2026, we expect to welcome approximately 1 million guests to the island, nearly 1/3 of our total guests -- and in 2027, we expect that number to increase 20% to approximately 1.2 million guests cumulatively coming from 9 different home ports across 21 of our vessels. Ultimately, what we're doing at -- Great Serve K is a clear example of our strategy in action, helping our guest fiction better and experience more -- as the original private island experience, we're now reimagining it for the next generation of cruisers and I can't wait for everyone to discover and experience the greatest destination in the Caribbean.\nMoving to Slide 6. I I'm also incredibly proud to share that earlier this month, we were in Italy to celebrate the delivery of Oceana Allura, the eighth ship in Oceana's award-winning fleet and the second in the Allura class. Built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Jena, Oceana Allura is a starting embodiment of our vision for the future of luxury cruising where immersive destinations, elevated design outstanding service and culinary excellence converge. The shift is not only Oceania's most luxurious to date. It's also a clear signal of our continued investment in the luxury segment. With Oceana Allura, we've made thoughtful ROI-centric improvements to the Vista Blueprint, including enhancements to the state remix. We replaced SovoCabins with Pentol Suites and concierge Heranstate rooms both of which deliver yield premiums and align with guest demand.\nWe've also brought back the guest favorite French restaurant chalk created Inspired by the World Famous Jack Behan, and expanded Red Ginger with new Nike inspired menu, further elevating the culinary experience. Allura sets a new benchmark for design, service and guest satisfaction and the initial guest feedback has been outstanding, but we're not stopping here. At the delivery ceremony, we confirmed an order for 2 additional Sonata class ships for a total of 4 next-generation ships for the brand, further reinforcing our confidence in the long-term demand for luxury cruising, which is clearly reflected on Slide 7.\nAdditionally, this quarter, -- under Jason Montage's renewed leadership, we launched sales for 7 Seas Prestige, our newest ultra luxury vessel. The Shindeut marked a record-breaking booking day for a newbuild launch, underscoring the strength of the luxury sector. Notably, the SkyView region Suite priced at $25,000 per night sold out on nearly all of our first ceiling season of sailings on opening day representing the strongest opening day performance for a top-tier product in the brand's history. Following the successful delivery of Oceana Allura and the confirmation of 2 new Sonata class chips, -- we now have 13 ships on order across the 3 brands through 2036, implying a 4% capacity CAGR. Each of these 3 brands is on a well-defined growth trajectory, Norwegian has 7 ships on order, Oceana foreship on order and Region institutions on water.\nThis measured expansion strategy ensures we're investing in the unique strength and market position of each brand. Historically, this kind of measured capacity growth has led to outsized returns, and we are confident it will continue to do so.\nMoving to Slide 8. I want you to revisit a framework many of you saw at our Investor Day, 1 that outlines the multiple drivers of pricing and net yields. We've been making steady progress across each of these areas. While some of the benefits will take time to materialize, we wanted to provide a clear update on how these initiatives are advancing to date.\nSlide 9 demonstrates how momentum is building. Let's start with new builds and our fleet. As we bring new ships online, we're also improving the cabin nice across the existing fleet. That includes modifications like the 1 I mentioned earlier on Allura, replacing solo cabins with higher-yielding pentestand concierge suites, as well as increasing the number of valcony cabins on the legacy fleet. Deployment optimization is another key focus. We've been analyzing our itinerary mix and cruise duration at more granular levels to strike the right balance between guest demand and profitability. This includes increased fund and fund deployment, shorter cruise length and, of course, the benefits of the enhancements of Great Serve K. With new deployments, ships and experiences coming online, we are investing in the systems that will also help drive our top line. We have been developing a new revenue management system, the first phase of which, which is on track to be completed by the end of 2025 and and we expect some benefits from the system as early as late 26 with an even bigger benefit in 2027.\nMarketing and brand positioning are equally important Oceania Cruises is focused on positioning to sell firmly within the luxury space with new branding coming in the near future that better communicates the brand's extraordinary value proposition. And as I mentioned earlier, this week, Norwegian introduced a refreshed look and feel for Great Serve K to align with the transformational enhancements underway. To support these efforts, I'm thrilled to welcome Kieran Smith as the new Chief Marketing Officer at Norwegian Cruise Line. Her expertise and deep experience in vaunted consumer brands will bring fresh perspective and will elevate our marketing efforts, amplify brand reach and fuel top-of-funnel demand.\nFinally, onboard spend remains a critical driver of revenue, and we're focused on improving the guest journey to support it. We've made significant strides in this area already. And I'm excited to share that Daniel Henry has joined NCLH last week as our new Chief Digital and Technology Officer. His experience in travel and hospitality at American Airlines and McDonald's, will help us advance everything from websites and apps to back-end systems, enhancing the guest experience and driving onboard revenue.\nNow I know many of you are looking ahead to what this means for 2026 and are charting the course targets, which I'm pleased to report, we are very much on track to achieve. Consistent with our algorithm that we shared at Investor Day, we continue to expect net yield growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. As I mentioned earlier, the opening of the Gray Tight water park next summer is expected to be a positive demand driver and with the summer launch, we expect to see a full benefit starting in Q4 of 2026 and throughout 2021. Our outlook includes a 25 basis point benefit in 2026 and a cumulative 1% uplift in 2027.\nOf course, top line growth is only 1 part of the equation. As you can see on Slide 10, we've also made significant progress on the cost side of the business. In 2024, our costs were essentially flat and we're guiding to flat again this year for the full year 2025 and flat in both Q3 and Q4. By year-end, we expect to deliver over $200 million in savings, and we have high confidence in delivering our $300 million plus savings target through 2026. But I want to be clear. The cost savings come off initiatives focused on better purchasing, economies of scale and more efficiencies all with an eye to always be improving the guest experience. As an example, our efforts have proven so successful that we've been able to invest a portion of our savings generated to upgrade significant portions of our culinary offering across the fleet to further elevate our already outstanding product.\nWe now are offering higher quality food throughout all 34 vessels in our fleet. Of course, our performance over the past 2 years gives us confidence to continue in '26 and beyond. We remain fully committed to sub-inflationary unit growth in 2026, while continuing to further improve the guest experience. We are committed to continued record guest satisfaction scores, record repeat rates and record future onboard cruise sales. Driving top line growth and maintaining sub-inflationary cost growth are what support our 2026 financial targets, which you'll see on Slide 11.\nAnd with strong performance in the first half of 2025 and reaffirmed guidance for the full year, I remain confident in achieving the goals we laid out just over a year ago. We launched our 2026 target 1.5 years ago, and our execution on our strategy is driving meaningful financial improvement, which you can see on Slide 12. We expect to expand margins by 630 basis points by the end of this year compared to 2023. During that same period, capacity is growing over 8% or about 4% a year and adjusted EPS is projected to almost triple. All of this is contributing to our top financial priority deleveraging. We expect to end the year with net leverage around 5.2x, down a full 2.1 turns from 2023. That's a significant step forward and a clear signal that our strategy is producing results.\nNow before I turn it over to Mark, I want to take a moment to highlight the release of our 2024 sale and sustained report on Slide 13. I encourage you to take a look as it showcases the meaningful progress we've made on our sustainability priorities. One thing that really stands out is our fuel efficiency with new and enhanced technology and equipment going fleet-wide on a constant basis. At the same time, almost 60% of our fleet is equipped with shore power and all half fleet has been tested with biodiesel blends. This is a clear reflection of our commitment to operating more sustainability while driving long-term value for our business and stakeholders. None of our sustainability, financial or operational achievements would be possible without the dedication of our incredible team across the globe. I'm proud to share that Forbes has recognized Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings as 1 of America's best large employers for 2025. This honor is a testament to the hard work and passion of our shoreside and shipboard team members who make everything so possible and I'm so proud of.\nWith that, I turn the call to Mark to give more thoughts on our financial performance. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our second quarter results on Slide 14. We delivered record results coming in at or ahead of guidance across all metrics. Occupancy was slightly above guidance at 103.9%. Net yields grew 3.1%, 60 basis points better than our guidance on strong pricing growth of 5.1%. The beat on net yield was largely driven by strong close-in bookings and pricing across all deployments as well as strong onboard spend.\nOn the cost side, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel was flat at 163, coming in better than expected. The beat was primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that are now expected to be incurred later in the year. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $694 million, higher than our guidance of $670 million. Adjusted net income came in at $257 million net of $37 million of foreign currency losses related to the revaluation of our advanced ticket sales. Adjusted EPS was in line with guidance at $0.51 net of an $0.08 impact from foreign exchange losses. Excluding this, our earnings per share would have been meaningfully higher than guidance this quarter.\nMoving on to third quarter and full year guidance on Slide 15. We expect occupancy to be approximately 105.5, which is about 2.5 points below the prior year. As we noted last quarter, this is primarily driven by some softness in bookings that we experienced in early April related to our long-haul European sailings. That said, we saw demand improve as the quarter progressed, and our disciplined approach to pricing allowed us to maintain solid pricing growth in the period. As Harry mentioned, we saw record bookings over the past few months, and our ATS balance reached an all-time high of $4 billion. As a result, net yield is expected to grow approximately 1.5% in the quarter, driven by very healthy pricing growth of 4%. Keep in mind, this is coming off prior year net yield growth of 8.7% in the third quarter of 2024.\nTurning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel is expected to be essentially flat in the quarter. I am extremely proud of our team members across the entire organization who have been the driving force in executing against our cost savings program for over a year now. And it is encouraging and a true testament to our overall execution as we continue to harvest savings and efficiencies and to see those results reflected in our guidance while still delivering an exceptional guest experience. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA to be just over $1 billion and adjusted EPS to be $1.14 an approximate 11% increase year-over-year.\nMoving to our full year outlook. We expect occupancy to average 103% as a result of our deployment mix in the year. As for net yield, we are reiterating full year guidance and expect net yields to grow 2.5%. This implies strong pricing performance with growth of approximately 4.4% with both metrics coming off record performance in 2024. On the cost side, we are also reiterating the midpoint of our prior guidance and expect our full year adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel to be essentially flat at 60 basis points of growth. As a result, we are maintaining our full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance at $2.72 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at $2.05 net of FX headwinds of $0.08. This represents an approximate 16% growth in earnings per share year-over-year.\nI want to take a moment to highlight the significant progress we have made on margin expansion since 2023, as shown on Slide 16. Nearly 2 years ago, we established a transformation office with the mandate to take a disciplined, methodical approach to identifying waste and inefficiencies across the business, and that work is clearly paying off. We remain very focused on both return on investment and return on experience. With record overall guest satisfaction scores, including in the key areas such as food and beverage, entertainment and service and combined with record repeat rates and onboard future sales across all 3 brands, we have clear evidence that our cost improvement actions are not coming at the expense of the guest experience.\nAs of June, our trailing 12-month margins reached 36.3% a more than 560 basis point improvement from the end of 2023. This is being driven by a combination of strong top line performance growth and a more efficient and lean cost structure. Looking ahead, we expect our 2025 margin to reach approximately 37%, and I am confident that with continued top line growth and sub-inflationary unit cost growth we are on track to achieve our 39% margin target by the end of 2026.\nTurning to Slide 17. I'll walk through our balance sheet and debt maturity profile. At quarter end, we expanded our revolving credit facility by almost 50% from $1.7 billion to nearly $2.5 billion, further strengthening our liquidity profile and enhancing our financial flexibility. This is another testament to the strength and confidence our lenders and stakeholders see not only in our current performance, but more importantly, in our future growth trajectory. Looking ahead to 2026, we have approximately $1 billion in scheduled maturities, reflecting a balanced and manageable maturity profile.\nOn a housekeeping note, 1 important change in our debt profile that should be noted for your models is that with the delivery of Norwegian Aqua, our total euro-denominated debt on the balance sheet is approximately EUR 1.3 billion. In addition, our euro debt increased in July with the delivery of Oceana Allura by approximately EUR 570 million. As a reminder, our euro debt is subject to mark-to-market remeasurement which may result in noncash gains or losses below the line due to FX movements. For purposes of adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, we are excluding the impact of this remeasurement.\nTurning to net leverage on Slide 18. I want to reaffirm that reducing leverage remains our top financial priority. In the second quarter, we reduced net leverage to 5.3x, down from 5.7x in the first quarter. We expect a slight uptick in the third quarter, reflecting the debt associated with the delivery of Oceana Allura in July. At year-end, we expect our net leverage to be approximately 5.2x, which is over 2 turns lower than 2023. This modest revision from our prior guidance is solely due to the fluctuation in our euro debt and does not reflect any change in our underlying fundamentals or earnings expectations. In fact, One important but often overlooked element of our current earnings profile is that when adjusting for the annualization of expected EBITDA contributions from our 2025 newbuild deliveries, year-end net leverage would be at approximately 4.9x.\nThis represents a meaningful step forward as we continue to improve our balance sheet and financial profile. With the solid progress we have made, we remain firmly on track to reach our 2026 goal of net leverage in the mid-4x range.\nWrapping up, our strong execution in the first half of the year, combined with the momentum of our cost reduction program has enabled us to make meaningful progress on our top financial priorities. Deleveraging the business, expanding our margin profile and the resulting strengthening of our balance sheet.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over back to Harry.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you again, Mark. Looking at Slide 19, I want to take a moment to once again highlight the significant progress we're making against our key charting the course financial targets. By year-end 2025, we expect adjusted operational EBITDA margin to expand by more than 600 basis points versus 2023, adjusted EPS to grow approximately 3x net leverage declined by 2.1 turns and adjusted ROIC to continue its upward trajectory. While these results and the momentum we're carrying into 2026, we remain firmly on track to achieve our long-term targets.\nMore than ever, I'm confident that our strategy is working and our execution is delivering. There's real excitement across the organization from the new ships that entered service in the first half of the year to the meaningful progress we're making towards creating the greatest private island experience in the Caribbean. I'm looking forward to what the second half of 2025 and the years ahead will bring as we continue charting our course to sustainable long-term value creation.\nAnd with that, we will now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call, and I will hand the line back to our operator. Thank you all."

My name is Donna, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inmon. Ms. Inmon, please proceed.\n\nSarah Inmon\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2025 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during the call, which can also be found on our website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following the call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release for the first quarter 2025 results was issued this morning and is available on our website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all references to 2025 net yields and adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2024. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Harry Sommer. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. Today, I'll begin my comments with highlights from our strong first quarter results, where we essentially met or exceeded guidance across all key metrics. And while we are quite pleased with our near-term results, we continue to get our focus firmly on our longer-term Charting the Course targets. So I'll discuss a number of initiatives we are undertaking to deliver long-term value to our shareholders through our proven strategy of balancing return on investment or ROI with return on experience or RoX. Some of the more important initiatives include the delivery of our groundbreaking new ship, Norwegian Aqua, the recently announced enhancements for Great Stirrup Cay and multiple projects underpinning our strategic fleet optimization efforts.\nI'll wrap up with an update on booking trends and how we are navigating the current environment before turning the call back over to Mark, who will provide more detailed commentary on our results and discuss our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2025. Starting on Slide 4, I'd like to highlight the strong start to the year. Our first quarter met or exceeded all key expectations we outlined in February. Most importantly, net yield increased 1.2% above our expectations and coupled with better-than-expected unit costs drove adjusted EBITDA to $453 million, also above guidance. This brings our trailing 12-month margin to 35.5%, a 280 basis point improvement over last year and well on our way to our long-term targets. Lastly, adjusted EPS ended the quarter at $0.07, slightly below guidance driven by a $0.05 FX headwind.\nMoving to Slide 5. Let's take a look at 1 of our key initiatives for the quarter, the delivery of Norwegian Aqua, the first shift in Norwegian Cruise Line's new Prima Plus class. We took delivery of Aqua in March on time and on budget, continuing our track record with Fincantieri, that's now 6 ships in a row, all delivered as planned, thanks to their team and our incredible new build organization. After her delivery, we proudly showcased during Europe before arriving in Miami just a few weeks ago for her pristine by her godfather, and the award-winning actor, Eric Stone Street. Aqua is the first shift shaped by our current management team and reflects our focus on balancing ROI and ROX. From design to amenities, each decision was made to improve the guest experience while also considering the impact on margin and return.\nNorwegian Aqua is 10% larger than her sister Prima class ships and perfectly combines NCL's one-of-a-kind service and offerings with guest first experiences that will make new waves at see. On Aqua, we took the strong foundation of Prima and Viva and elevated it. We redesigned or reimagined nearly 30 spaces, everything for the layout and flow to enhancements in our dining venues and entirely new offerings. One standout example is replacing the Go Card base track with the Aqua Sly coaster. This innovative offering not only adds a thrilling new signature experience, it also takes up less space than the racetrack, freeing up room to increase state room capacity and add additional activities and amenities. And the Aqua Sly coaster has been a huge hit, already garnering more than 270 million views across our traditional and social media platforms, a powerful early signal that Aqua is generating excitement and buzz.\nNorwegian Aqua is an example of what this team can accomplish when we stay true to our vision of having our guests vacation better and experience more and keep our ROI and ROX philosophy at the center of our decision-making. Guests are happy and the company is optimizing its financial performance. Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight the exciting new development of Great Stirrup Cay, our private island in the Bahamas, which we announced just a few weeks ago during Norwegian Aqua's christening. As many of you know, Great Stirrup Cay is already 1 of our highest-rated ports of coal, and we're about to take the experience to the next level.\nLater this year, we'll complete construction on a new peer that will allow us to dock 2 ships simultaneously and eliminate the need for tendering, which can be particularly challenging during the winter months. With this new infrastructure in place, and increased Carribean capacity in the years ahead, we expect to welcome more than 1 million guests annually to the island starting in 2026. To support that growth and elevate the overall experience, we've announced a series of new enhancements, which will open concurrently with the new peer. These include a large resort-style pool with Smear and Cabanas, a welcome center and a new tram system for easier access across the island. We are also bringing the popular and exclusive adult-only by Beach Club from several of NCLs vessels to the island, while also adding Horizon LaBagod, a dedicated family zone featuring a Flash pad and interactive play area.\nThese additions are thoughtfully designed to drive higher guest satisfaction, providing facilities for new experience and opportunities for stronger overall customer spend. We're confident these upgrades will further differentiate our Caribbean product and enhance our ability to drive incremental yield on itineraries that call on Great Stirrup Cay. But this is just the beginning. As we bring more capacity into the region, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to continue improving the island experience. I'm excited to see these plans come to life and look forward to welcoming even more guests to the island in the years ahead.\nIn addition to enhancing the real-life experiences on our vessels and island, I want to highlight a major success story that demonstrates our ability to enhance our guest experience digitally with our revamped NCI. We completed the full rollout across the Norwegian fleet in January, retiring all legacy platforms, and the response has been tremendous. over 800,000 guests logged in during the quarter. The app does more than provide practical tools like ship maps and folio news, which reduced onboard service lines. It also is proving to be a powerful pre-cruise revenue driver, a growing majority of our guests are logging before the crews using the app to book things like shore excursion and specialty dining in advance.\nThis provides us with consumer insights, which we can use to further personalize marketing and also lifts pre-booked onboard spend, which then creates a stickier guest in our customer ecosystem. We're incredibly excited about the progress we're making on the digital front and confident this platform will continue to enhance both upsell opportunities and the guest experience going forward. Turning to Slide 7. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our broader fleet management strategy which centers on 3 key pillars: breaking new ships online, investing in modernizing our existing fleet, and thoughtfully repurposing older tonnage.\nWhile we already covered Aqua's delivery, I want to highlight the progress we have made modernizing our existing fleet. This quarter, we completed dry docks for Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Breakaway each introducing new guest-focused enhancements. On Breakaway, we debuted the silver screen Bistro, the first immersive cinema and dining experience at sea. We also expanded dayroom capacity, including in the Haven expanded our most popular specialty restaurants and expanded both premium and free guest experiences on both ships. These investments reflect our commitment to enhancing what matters most to our guests, while continuing to focus on financial returns.\nFinally, on the final peer of our fleet management strategy, which is thoughtful repurposing of older tonnage, we had several important milestones during the quarter. signing agreements for 2 Norwegian Cruise Line vessels, Region Sky and Norwegian Sun to be chartered to Cordelia cruises, a premium operator in India beginning in 2026 and 2027, respectively. We also reached agreement for Regions 17 Navigator and Oceania's Insignia to be chartered to Crescent Seas, a residential cruise line also beginning in 2026 and 2027. These agreements are a clear reflection of our disciplined long-term approach to fleet optimization. By transitioning these ships into markets outside our core business with established operators in their respective areas, we're able to unlock value from these assets while remaining focused on delivering a consistent, high-quality experience across the remainder of each fleet in our 3 brands.\nImportantly, these transactions allow us to simplify our operations, reduce the average age of our fleet and drive further efficiencies, all while continuing to receive cash flow from these assets under charter. Our projected capacity CAGR from 2023 to 2028 now moves from 6% to 4% after factoring in ships exiting the fleet. This is a smart strategic evolution of our fleet that supports our long-term financial and operational goals and 1 that positions us well for the years ahead.\nMoving on to booking trends on Slide 8. Advanced ticket sales were up 3% as shown on Slide 9, while other key indicators such as cancellation rate and cruise next sales and onboard revenue remained steady during the quarter and in the first weeks of April. Looking at the remainder of the year, cruises for Q2 are nearly all sold and well within our final payment and cancellation window. So onboard revenue is the remaining variable, which, as I mentioned, continues strong. As macroeconomic uncertainty has increased, we have seen some choppiness in bookings on the remaining Q3 inventory, resulting in a headwind to occupancy where we are prioritizing price over load factor but leaves us the potential for upside if conditions improve. By protecting price, this allows us to garner higher yields on the remaining inventory if conditions improve while also allowing us to protect price in the future.\nAs we look into Q4, recall our Caribbean capacity is up 10% year-over-year and represents 40% of our quarterly deployment. This results in a shorter booking curve, so our book position for the next 12 months has shifted slightly, but continues to be within our optimal range above historical averages. Looking forward, we expect our strategic expansion of more close on itineraries especially coupled with our recent Great Stirrup Cay enhancements to fundamentally improve our demand profile in the mid- to long term.\nAs a result, we see potential for pressure on our top line and are modifying our full year net yield growth outlook to be a range of 2% to 3%. This guidance recognizes the reality of the situation as it exists today and also reflects our assumption that the consumer environment stabilizes as the year progresses. While we recognize potential pressures on the top line, we are maintaining our full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance. We believe continued execution of our cost savings initiatives should essentially offset any top line headwinds. As part of our Charting the Course strategy, we have identified initiatives supporting 300 million of cost efficiencies across the organization, and we are using this as an opportunity to accelerate certain initiatives to capture benefits even sooner.\nThis is a company-wide effort fully supported by the entire leadership team. We will continue to monitor the consumer closely, but make no mistake, we are guided by a clear strategy. We remain focused on disciplined pricing and cost control and delivering an exceptional guest experience, all while managing the business for the long term. We are committed to optimizing every dollar of revenue, controlling every dollar of cost and delivering exceptional financial and guest performance. And with that, I turn the call over to Mark to give more thoughts on our financial performance.\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our first quarter 2025 financial results, our full year outlook and our financial position. Let me start with our first quarter results on Slide 10. We delivered solid results in the quarter, coming in at or ahead of guidance across all key metrics. As expected, occupancy was 101.5% down year-over-year due to increased dry dock days and related repositioning sailings. Despite this, net yield came in ahead of guidance at 1.2% and driven by healthy net per DM growth of 4.3%. These results are indeed impressive as we are copying exceptional 13% growth in net per diem and 16% growth in net yield in the prior year.\nThe 70 basis point outperformance in net yield was largely driven by strong results and close-in bookings in our fund and sun itineraries including the Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda and Hawaii and strong presold and onboard spend. Turning to costs. Growth in adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel, came in lower than expected, increasing 3% to $169. The beat was primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that are now expected to occur in the second quarter. Excluding the $8 impact from dry docks, unit cost growth would have been 1.2%, well below inflation and in line with our commitment to sub-inflationary cost growth.\nAs a result, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $453 million, above guidance of $435 million. Adjusted net income came in at $31 million, impacted by $23 million of foreign currency losses compared to $13 million of FX gains that benefited the prior year. As a result, adjusted EPS was $0.07 which had a $0.05 impact from foreign exchange losses. Moving on to second quarter and full year guidance on Slide 11. I'll start by noting that today is April 30. So we have strong visibility into the second quarter, particularly as all sailings are now within the cancellation window and there are just 60 days remaining in the period. I'll start by focusing on the second quarter where we expect occupancy to come in at approximately 103.2%, which is about 2.7% below the prior year.\nAs we discussed last quarter, this is driven in part by a 6% increase in sailings in Asia, Africa and the Pacific versus the same period in 2024. These longer itineraries typically command higher pricing but have fewer third and fourth guests per cabin, which results in slightly lower occupancy. Additionally, given the challenges in the current environment we have discussed, we are prioritizing price overload factor, in line with our commitment to disciplined revenue management as we believe this will produce the best long-term results.\nAs a result, net yields for the second quarter is expected to grow approximately 2.5% driven by healthy net per diem growth of 5.2%. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel, is expected to increase 1% in the second quarter. This is primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that shifted from Q1 into Q2 along with additional costs related to the delivery and debut of Norwegian Aqua. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter to be approximately $670 million and adjusted EPS to be $0.51.\nMoving to our full year outlook. We expect occupancy to average 102.5%. This reflects a 3% increase in deployment in Asia, Africa and Pacific sailings compared to last year during the third quarter as well as our continued focus on maintaining price over load factor. By prioritizing price, we believe we are setting a stronger foundation and when demand normalizes, we should be restarting from a place of strength. Moving to net yield. As Harry mentioned, based on what we know today and assuming a stabilization in the current environment as the year progresses, we expect full year net yield growth in the range of 2% to 3%. This assumes that our pricing remains very strong, growing in the range of 4.3% to 5.4%, with both metrics coming off record performance in 2024.\nShould we see pressure on the top line, we believe we can effectively offset this with continued execution and acceleration of our cost savings initiatives, and we are prepared to proactively accelerate additional efficiency measures. As a result, we are improving our full year adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel guidance to a range of 0% to 1.25% growth. We do not expect our cost to be meaningfully impacted by recently proposed or implemented tariffs. Our global sourcing strategies and diversified procurement practices help insulate us from potential volatility in this regard.\nOur disciplined approach to cost control anchored in a more efficient operating model and empowered by our transformation office, reinforces our ability to protect margins and profitability even in a dynamic environment. We believe this flexibility sets us apart from others. Of course, should the macroeconomic or geopolitical environment shift materially we will reassess and adjust our guidance as appropriate. That said, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, execution and growth trajectory.\nMoving on, as a result of balancing challenges in the current environment, combined with our robust cost efficiency program, we are maintaining our full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance at $2.72 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at $2.05 as the reduced share count from our convertible note transaction in early April is offset by FX headwinds of $0.04.\nMoving to margins on Slide 12. The combination of top line growth and a more efficient cost structure continues to drive meaningful improvement. Trailing 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin expanded by nearly 280 basis points to 35.5% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter in 2024. For full year 2025, we continue to expect further expansion, reaching approximately 37%. As I've mentioned before, we believe we have a structural advantage. We've been building our cost efficiency capability for over 18 months now through our transformation office, and that work is already paying off.\nThe fact that we continue to progress towards our Charting the Course margin target of 39% even in the current consumer environment underscores the strength of our execution and culture the resilience of our business model and our ongoing commitment to improving the balance sheet. Turning to Slide 13, I'll walk you through our pro forma balance sheet and debt maturity profiles. As many of you know, we've been active on the capital markets front since quarter end. Most recently, we refinanced the majority of our 2025 exchangeable notes with new 2030 exchangeable notes in a shareholder accretive transaction that reduced our diluted share count by approximately 15.5 million shares, all without increasing our net leverage.\nLooking at the rest of our 2025 maturities of approximately $640 million, which consists of ECA backed loans, capital leases and other items that we can comfortably cover with our current operating cash flows. Looking ahead to 2026, we have just $1 billion in scheduled maturities which we also expect to be able to service through organic cash generation. And as a reminder, 93% of our debt is fixed rate. So movement in market interest rates will have minimal impact on our overall interest expense.\nTurning to leverage on Slide 14. I want to reaffirm that reducing leverage remains our top financial priority as is maintaining a strong liquidity position. Net leverage temporarily increased to 5.7x in the first quarter reflecting the delivery of Norwegian Aqua at the end of March. Keep in mind that when we take delivery of a new ship, we also take on the related debt onto our balance sheet. However, because our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is calculated on a trailing 12-month basis, that shift has not yet contributed any EBITDA. So our leverage calculation temporarily increases. That said, we continue to expect leverage to decline steadily over the course of the year, improving to approximately 5.4x in the second quarter and ending the year at approximately 5x.\nThis puts us firmly on track to achieve our 2026 target of reaching the mid-4s. With that, I'll hand the call back over to Harry.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thanks, Mark. I'll close today with a few reminders about the long-term fundamentals of both our industry and NCLH. Cruise remains a highly compelling sector with significantly runway for growth. It still accounts for just 2% of the global vacation market yet offers a differentiated value proposition, multiple destinations, world-class service and onboard entertainment, all at a better value than comparable land-based vacations. Adding long booking windows, rise in consumer awareness and limited supply growth, and it's clear this industry is set up to outperform. As for NCLH, I'm equally optimistic. We have clearly defined brands, a premium guest demographic and the leading growth profile in the space.\nOur performance is underpinned by a proven algorithm supported by a transformational cost savings program. This makes our business model sustainable in the long term. We're also backed by an experienced management team, a disciplined capital allocation strategy and a firm commitment to strengthening the balance sheet and reducing net leverage. We believe those fundamentals will continue to drive strong shareholder returns. Despite the uncertainty in the macro environment and based on what we know today, we are reiterating our full year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance underscoring our ability to perform and execute.\nWe remain committed and on track to deliver all of our 2026 Charting the Course targets. This includes meaningful margin expansion, continued deleveraging and record ROIC driven by our clear strategy, focus and strength of execution. While the current macro environment presents its share of challenges, we remain confident and optimistic about the long term. We are managing the business with discipline, staying focused on what we can control and maintaining a clear commitment to balancing cost efficiencies with guest experience. I could not be more proud of the dedication of our 41,000 team members, both shoreside and ship work around the world who bring our vision to life every day, with their unwavering focus on performance and delivering results in all environments, I am confident we are charting the right course. With that, I hand the call back to our operator."

My name is Maria, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inmon. Ms.Inmon please proceed.\n\nSarah Inmon\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which can be found on our website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2024 results was issued this morning and is available on our website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here today to share our exceptional fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. .\nThroughout 2024, we remain laser-focused on our vision of having our guests vacation better and experience more. I am thrilled with the enhancement to our product offering and guest experiences, and I'm particularly excited about the groundbreaking innovations to our ships debuting in 2025, Norwegian Aqua and Oceania's Allura. Our strong execution throughout the year has led to outstanding financial performance with record results on the top line for revenue and net yield, which once again beating meeting guidance, when combined with our disciplined cost control initiatives, drove our margins up almost 500 basis points and resulted in record adjusted EBITDA.\nThese results demonstrate that the initiatives supporting our Charting The Course strategy are paying off and position us firmly on track to achieve the 2026 financial and sustainability targets that we introduced this past May. Our Charting the Course strategy with its vision to have our guest vacation better and experience more guided our transformational achievements in 2024.\nUnder the strategic framework built on our 4 pillars of people, product, growth platform and performance, we delivered on significant initiatives across our 3 brands, set ambitious long-term financial targets and announced a historic fleet expansion program. I'll begin my remarks today by walking through key highlights and progress across each of our 4 pillars and our sustainability strategy, which underpins Charting the Course.\nLastly, I will comment on the demand environment and our offerings continue to drive record guest satisfaction scores, all while maintaining disciplined cost management, the balancing of return of investment and return on experience or ROI and [ ROX ] as we like to call it, I'll then turn the call over to Mark, who will provide more detailed commentary on our results and discuss our outlook for 2025.\nStarting on Slide 4, I want to emphasize how our cultural transformation has been a driving force behind our success in 2024. The introduction of our value anchors sets the foundation for the behaviors we prioritize as an organization. This shift in mindset has enabled us to achieve remarkable results across all aspects of our business, both shoreside and shipboard. Our team members have embraced these changes with enthusiasm. And the successful [indiscernible] of our Charting the Course strategy demonstrates that when we align our culture with our business objectives, we can create meaningful change.\nAs I look ahead to 2025, I am confident that the cultural foundation we have built will continue to accelerate our transformational journey.\nMoving to Slide 5. I'm particularly proud of the significant brand enhancements we achieved in 2024. For example, we successfully rolled out a repositioning campaign for our largest brand, Norwegian Cruise Lines Experience more at Sea. This new brand position underscores NCL's commitment to providing guests with more, more variety, more elevated offerings, more of what they love and more value while vacationing with Norwegian Cruise Line.\nWe also made important investments in our guest experience. A prime example is the now completed fleet-wide rollout of Starlink WiFi, significantly improving the bandwidth speed and reliability of onboard Internet. We've also expanded our itineraries with additional ports of call across the fleet as well as enhanced dining and entertainment options as well as new and exciting onboard activities and shore excursion offerings.\nDuring the year, we formed strategic partnerships that enhance our brands, including Norwegian's partnership with the National Hockey League and Regent's partnership with Aston Martin, Aramco Formula One team. These initiatives, among the myriad of other enhancements during 2024, underscore our commitment to aligning product offerings with what our guests value.\nFlipping to Slide 7, I want to highlight our significant achievements in our long-term growth platform pillar during 2024. Historically, measured capacity growth has driven outsized revenue and earnings growth. And with our most comprehensive newbuild order in our history announced last April, on top of the existing orders in place, we are set up to continue creating real long-term value for both our customers and our other stakeholders.\nWith a total of 13 ships on order, we are set to significantly enhance our offerings and guest experiences further across all 3 brands allowing us to significantly leverage our scale and strengthen our commitment to innovation and outstanding guest experiences while continuing to maintain measured and disciplined capacity growth, allowing us to continue to drive outsized revenue and earnings growth.\nLooking to 2025, we are excited to introduce 2 state-of-the-art vessels to our world-class fleet, Norwegian Aqua debuting in April 2025 represents an evolution as the inaugural vessel of our next-generation [ Prima plus Class ] Class, and will be 10% larger than the first Prima class chip and have improved fuel efficiency. I can't wait to sail on Aqua in April and experience the groundbreaking attractions, especially the innovative Aqua Slidecoaster, the first-ever hybrid attraction that combines the thrills of a roller coaster with the rush of a water slide along with other amenities such as a larger full deck, reimagined dining experiences, new entertainment, including our immersive [ Prince tribute ] show, Revolution, a Celebration of Prince, enhanced spa services, a 3-bedroom duplex suites and brand-new activities in our innovative game zone and a [indiscernible], which will set new standards for guest entertainment at sea.\nShe's truly breathtaking. Additionally, we are eagerly anticipating the debut of OceanIa Cruises Allura in July, this magnificent vessel exemplifies our commitment to upscale cruising, featuring meticulously crafted designer suites, sophisticated lounges and of course, world-class signing venues that Oceania is known for, including the introduction -- the reintroduction of our signature French restaurant Jacques, which is a crowd favorite with our guests.\nFinally, let me highlight some significant investments in our private island strategy, particularly at Great Stirrup Cay. We are making critical investment in a new [ 2-ship year ] scheduled to open in late 2025. This strategic enhancement at one of our highest rated ports will be a game changer for our guest experience. With the infrastructure upgrade, we anticipate welcoming over 1 million guests to the island in 2026, a significant increase from the approximately 400,000 guests that visited in 2024 and supported by a shift to a more [ Caribbean ] deployment beginning in late '25.\nLooking ahead, this positions us well to make targeted investments to further enhance both the guest experience and financial returns from this premier destination. We are committed to establishing the island as a cornerstone of our Caribbean offering, ensuring an exceptional and unforgettable experience for our guests.\nLet me now turn to our fourth pillar, exceptional performance. As shown on Slide 7, our record city results in 2024 stemmed from 4 key factors: delivering outstanding vacation experiences, execution from shoreside and shipboard teams, strategic initiative advancements and disciplined cost management. This execution, combined with strong market demand throughout the year sets us up well to achieve our Charting the Course target. I am proud to report that we generated record revenue, record net yield growth and record adjusted EBITDA in 2024, significantly surpassing even our own initial and repeatedly upwardly revised projections throughout the year.\nWhile Mark will provide more detailed commentary shortly, I would like to highlight some of our financial achievements for the year. Net yield increased a record 10% in 2024, surpassing our initial February guidance by 450 basis points. This outstanding overperformance reflects strength across all brands and itineraries complemented by strong onboard [ spend ]. These results not only validate our strong execution and positioning but also underscore the strong consumer demand for cruise. While 2024s exceptional performance set historic benchmark, we accept further growth to align with our growth algorithm of low to mid-digit yield growth.\nLast February, we announced our cost-saving targets, aiming to maintain flat unit cost through 2024. Today, I'm proud to report that we were able to accomplish this ambitious goal through rigorous cost management and a fundamental shift in our organizational culture while maintaining our excellent guest experience. Our performance is particularly noteworthy as we achieved an approximately 900 basis point spread between our unit cost, excluding the dry dock impact and our net yield in 2024.\nAnd these results are just the beginning. The momentum from our cost containment initiatives from increased efficiencies, elimination of waste and more strategic purchasing has created palpable excitement throughout the organization, and we remain committed to building on this foundation as we move through 2025 and beyond. But more importantly, we have been able to do this and enhance the guest experiences with all 3 brands reporting record guest satisfaction for us in 2024. 2024's impressive results demonstrate that our strategic initiatives and algorithm are delivering as planned.\nOur adjusted operational EBITDA margin expanded by nearly 500 basis points to 35.5%, while our adjusted ROIC improved 320 basis points to just under 11%. Notably, our net leverage ratio decreased 2 [ full turns ] to 5.3x, making significant progress on strengthening our balance sheet. These metrics clearly show that we are on track to achieve our 2026 Charting The Course targets and validates both our strategic direction and execution capabilities.\nMoving to Slide 8. Sustainability underpins our entire corporate strategy and our Sail & Sustain program continues to drive positive environmental and social impact through its 5 key pillars: reducing environmental impact, sailing safely, strengthening communities, empowering people and operating with integrity. In 2024, we received notable recognition for our efforts, including the ESG leader Gold Award and an A rating from MSCI.\nOperationally, we've made significant progress with nearly half of our fleet now tested with biodiesel blends targeting 60% by the end of this year. We're also continuing to invest in shore power capabilities with almost 60% of our fleet equipped to connect when appropriate shore site infrastructure is available. We were the first to connect in the Port of Seattle at Tier 66 during the 2024 cruise season and partnered with Fort Miami to launch the first major shore power installation on the U.S. East Coast.\nSwitching to Slide 9. I'm pleased to report continued exceptional customer demand across our portfolio through the fourth quarter, which drove net yield up 9%. Throughout the year, our strategic execution in this robust demand environment delivered outstanding results. Looking ahead, the momentum continues into 2025 as we remain at the optimal book position for the next 12 months with particularly impressive demand for summer sailings in Europe and Alaska.\nBased on these strong fundamentals and despite headwinds caused by the strong U.S. dollar and timing of drybacks in Q1, we are projecting a 4.5% pricing increase for full year '25 which will drive net yield growth of 3%.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Mark to go over financial results in more detail. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2024 financial results, 2025 guidance and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, 2024 and 2025 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day metrics are in a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2024.\nLet me begin with our fourth quarter results on Slide 10. Once again, our fourth quarter results came in ahead of guidance with net yield growing 9%. The 210 basis point outperformance was driven by strength across brands and geographies as well as strong onboard spend. Adjusted net cruise cost, ex fuel, was slightly above guidance, ending the quarter at $157, mainly driven by increased variable compensation due to our strong performance.\nExcluding this and the $6 dry dock impact, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel would have decreased year-over-year demonstrating the benefits of our transformation initiatives. The combination of healthy top line and strong cost control drove adjusted EBITDA of $468 million, exceeding our guidance.\nFinally, adjusted net income for the quarter was $125 million or adjusted EPS of $0.26, which included an approximately $70 million or $0.15 benefit due to foreign exchange rates. A reminder that as foreign exchange rates move, we revalue both our debt and advanced ticket sales that are denominated in foreign currencies. While this appears as a benefit in the fourth quarter net income, the impact is a headwind in future periods when these advanced ticket sales are realized ultimately through the P&L. Now moving to our record full year 2024 results on Slide 11. Let me start with our top line performance. We delivered exceptional results this year with net yield increasing 10% compared to prior year.\nThis represents the highest net yield growth in our company's history. At the same time, our disciplined cost management delivered strong results, further solidifying the commitments that we made at the beginning of last year. Our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day only increased $1 to $160 in 2024 when excluding the dry dock impact during the year.\nThis result was achieved despite higher variable compensation due to our strong performance. Excluding this, our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel would have decreased year-over-year. I am extremely proud of the significant progress we have made to streamline our cost base during the year demonstrating our focus and commitment to our margin enhancement initiatives while still delivering an exceptional guest experience, and we expect this to continue in 2025 and beyond.\nAs a result of the strong net yield growth and cost savings initiatives during the year, our adjusted EBITDA came in at just over $2.45 billion, while adjusted EPS came in at $1.82, which includes an approximate $0.10 benefit from FX, and our operating cash flow came in at just over $2 billion, driving our leverage down 2 full turns to 5.3x.\nOur exceptional 2024 performance demonstrates our successful operational execution while capitalizing on strong demand in the market, which positions us well along our path to achieve our Charting the Course 2026 financial targets. As we look ahead to 2025, we are committed to maintaining this momentum with continued focus and drive.\nMoving to Slide 12. Let me walk you through our 2025 outlook, starting with the first quarter. In the quarter, we are projecting pricing growth of 3.6% and net yield growth of 0.5%. The underlying drivers of this growth rate are occupancy is expected to be down 3% year-over-year, coming in at just over 101%. As we discussed in our prior earnings call, we have 2 large ships, Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Bliss that are repositioning from the Caribbean to Europe for dry docks during the quarter.\nAs a result, we have a 71% increase in repositioning capacity days during the quarter. These sailings naturally have a lower load factor than sailings in those vessels typical deployment in the Caribbean. To address these challenges in the future, we have established agreements with shipyards in the Caribbean that will allow us to perform dry docks closer to our core operating regions reducing the need for lengthy repositioning sailings going forward.\nTurning to pricing. We faced a challenging year-over-year comparison. In the first quarter of '24, we delivered exceptional net per Diem growth of 13%, driving a 16% net yield growth. Despite this challenging comparison, we expect pricing to increase 3.6% in the first quarter of 2025. This growth is particularly notable given that along with lower load factors, repositioning sailings typically generate lower prices as compared to typical itineraries.\nAnd finally, looking to the last 3 quarters of 2025, where deployments are more normalized, we expect our net yield to grow at a healthy 3.5%, driven by strong 4.6% pricing growth on the back of 7% capacity growth. Turning to adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel. We expect Q1 growth of 3.9%, which includes an $8 impact of increased dry dock capacity days and related costs in the quarter.\nExcluding this, adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel is expected to be up 2.1%, which is below inflation and higher than our cost growth for the remainder of the year due to costs associated with the delivery of Norwegian Aqua. Our unit cost growth will normalize going forward as we anticipate no meaningful dry dock impacts on our full year adjusted net cruise cost comparisons.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to come in at $435 million and adjusted EPS at $0.08. Looking now at the full year, net yield growth is expected to be approximately 3%. This growth is mainly driven by strong performance from our largest brand with more modest growth rates at our other brands that are absorbing outsized capacity growth. The recent appointment of our Chief Luxury officer positions us well to enhance yields and margins across these brands going forward.\nDriving more into the cadence of net yield throughout the year, we expect a temporary moderation in growth in the first quarter due to factors that I previously mentioned. The subsequent 3 quarters, which better reflect our core business operations are projected to grow at approximately 3.5%, primarily driven by strong net per diem growth of approximately 4.6%, which is in line with our long-term algorithm.\nTurning to unit costs. Building on our strong cost control performance in 2024, we intend to continue this momentum into 2025 and are targeting our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel to grow by 1.25%, well below anticipated inflation rates. This low unit cost growth comes after a year of only 1% cost growth and is a testament to our culture change and disciplined execution. This success is driven by the transformation office's ongoing strategic initiatives, which continue to identify and implement sustainable efficiencies across our organization but that do not impact the guest experience.\nThese efforts are not just short-term fixes, they represent structural changes that will generate value for years to come. Now I want to give you some detail on the timing of costs throughout the year. As I previously mentioned, the first quarter is the only period where we face year-over-year comparison impacts from dry docks and a related decline in capacity days as well as the delivery of Aqua.\nFor the remainder of 2025 we expect to have essentially flat unit costs, reflecting our continued focus on efficiency and strong cost discipline. The spread between our net yield and unit cost for the last 3 quarters of the year will reach approximately 300 basis points. These quarters better represent our core business, and this performance significantly exceeds our long-term algorithm while demonstrating our commitment to our Charting the Course targets.\nAs a result of the cost savings initiatives and strong net yield growth, we are expecting full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.72 billion, which is net of an approximately $70 million headwind from both FX and fuel. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be $2.05 and setting us up well to achieve our 2026 Charting the Course targets. Similar to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS also includes an approximately $70 million or $0.15 headwind from both FX and fuel.\nMoving on to our margins on Slide 13. The combination of a more efficient cost structure and strong top line growth drove significant margin enhancements in 2024, with adjusted operational EBITDA margins improving almost 500 basis points to 35.5%. For 2025, we expect our margins will continue to strengthen, reaching approximately 37%. These improvements position us well to achieve our 2026 Charting the Course margin target of approximately 39%.\nOn Slide 14, I discuss our balance sheet and debt maturity profile. In 2024, we made important strides in liability management and strengthening the balance sheet. We began in March refinancing our backstop commitment from secured to unsecured and repaid $250 million of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2028, our highest rate debt at the time. We continued in September with the refinancing of $315 million of notes due December 2024, with 6.25% unsecured notes due 2030, with the remaining balance of the $250 million paid at maturity.\nMore recently, in January of this year, we successfully issued $1.8 billion of 6.75% unsecured notes due 2032, which were used to replace $600 million of secured debt with unsecured debt and $1.2 billion to refinance a portion of our [ 5 7/8 ] notes due 2026. We also upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.7 billion, and extended its tenure with improved terms. Through these strategic transactions, we have optimized our collateral utilization, further strengthening our capital structure while supporting our growth trajectory.\nThe rating agencies are also taking notice of our progress with both S&P and Moody's recently upgrading our credit ratings with a positive outlook. Moving to leverage on Slide 15. the company has been delivering on its track record of net leverage reduction. During 2024, we reduced our net leverage 2 full turns ending the year at 5.3x. We are confident we can continue making meaningful progress on this front going forward, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled amortization payments.\nLooking to 2025, we expect to bring down net leverage to approximately 5x or better. This comes after net leverage temporarily increases to 5.7x in the first quarter due to the delivery of Aqua in March, ending the year at approximately 5x or better demonstrates the company remains on track to achieve our 2026 target of the mid-4s. And I am confident that our continued focus on deleveraging will further strengthen our balance sheet and create value for our shareholders in the many years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark. Looking at Slide 16, I want to take a moment to once again recognize the significant progress that we made during 2024 on our key Charting the Course financial targets. Adjusted operational EBITDA margin improved approximately 500 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew by 161% to $1.82, net leverage declined 2 full turns and our adjusted ROIC ended up 320 basis points at just about 11%.\nThese exceptional results were made possible through the dedication of over 40,000 employees who work tirelessly to provide our guests with memorable vacations at great value. It is truly an honor to work side-by-side with this outstanding team at witness what we can accomplish together. At our Investor Day back in May, we set our 2026 targets based on a straightforward executable plan backed by an experienced management team, outstanding staff, a clear strategy and a performance-driven culture designed to drive meaningful results and shareholder value and an extraordinary guest experience.\nGiven our strong progress towards these targets in 2024 and are expected to continue momentum in 2025, I am more confident than ever that our strategy is working and our execution is delivering results. I look forward to what 2025 will bring as we continue Charting our course towards our bright future. With that, we will now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call, and I will hand the line back to our operator."

My name is Donna, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inmon. Ms. Inmon please proceed.\n\nSarah Inmon\n\nHead of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. Throughout the call, we will refer to a slide presentation that can be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2024 results was issued this morning and is available on the Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.\nOur comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. This is an exciting time for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The second quarter has surpassed our expectations with results exceeding guidance on all key metrics, allowing us to increase our full year guidance for the third time this year.\nAt our Investor Day, we emphasized our unwavering commitment to balancing return on experience, what we call ROX, and return on investment or ROI. This strategy is clearly yielding results. We are witnessing robust demand with strong pricing and booking volumes, leading to record-breaking advanced ticket sales. This demand, coupled with our onboard offering and high-quality service has led to strong guest satisfaction for us while we continue to effectively control costs. These indicators affirm that our strategic approach is positioning us for sustained long-term success on our well-defined path forward for continued growth to achieve our Charting the Course strategy, which includes ambitious 2026 financial and sustainability targets.\nToday, I'm excited to discuss some of our key milestones for the second quarter and the factors that drove our enhanced guidance for the remainder of 2024. We -- we're thrilled to see how the pillars and initiatives under our Charting the Course strategy are moving the needle for our business. As these are strongly underpinned by our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, we're also excited to share the progress outlined in our recent sustainability report. Later in the call, I will hand it over to Mark who will provide more color on our second quarter performance and updated outlook for 2024.\nWe kicked off the second quarter with impressive momentum, continuing the positive trends from the beginning of 2024 and proudly executing on our exceptional performance pillar. As you can see on Slide 4, our second quarter results beat guidance across the board. Adjusted EBITDA grew 14% and adjusted EPS was up 33%. Notably, we hit our year-end target of decreasing net leverage by 1.5x turns a full 6 months early.\nAs we move forward, we remain committed to further deleveraging with a clear focus on attaining a 2026 target of mid 4x. These strong results also allowed us to raise our full year revenue and earnings guidance. We now expect to end the year with adjusted operational EBITDA margin of 34.5% and -- a full 400 basis point improvement over 2023, which puts us well on the way to our 2026 target of approaching historical margin levels of 39%.\nWe -- we also increased our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to $1.53, an approximate 120% increase over 2023 and -- and an impressive step forward towards our 2026 target of $2.45. And lastly, we are on track to achieve double-digit adjusted ROIC by year-end. This acceleration in our financial results speak volumes about our team's dedication and hard work.\nTurning to Slide 5. I want to emphasize how our long-term growth platform pillar is set to deliver measured capacity growth and optimize our fleet to drive strong financial returns. Historically, capacity growth has driven outsized revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, and we expect this trend to continue with the incorporation of larger and more efficient state-of-the-art vessels to our fleet, which I'll now give some updates on.\nTurning to Slide 6. We are currently focused on our next 2 new ships being delivered in 2025, and -- both currently scheduled for an on-time delivery. Our first milestone in the quarter was the float out of Norwegian Aqua, which we celebrated with our partner Fincantieri. Norwegian Aqua, the first ship in the next-generation Prima Plus Class is an evolution of the previous Prima Class ship and will be 10% larger. This space allows for more innovative offerings, including the world's first-ever hybrid roller coaster and water slide, the Aqua Slidecoaster.\nWe are also building a digital sports complex with an interactive LED floor and our most extensive 360-degree outdoor promenade, the Ocean Boulevard. We cannot wait for Aqua to make her debut in April 2025.\nWe -- most recently, we also celebrated the float out of\nOceania Allura at the Fincantieri shipyard in Genoa. This marked the transition of the vessel from dry-dock to fitting out birth, initiating the final stages of construction. Allura will redefine luxury with its designer-inspired interiors, including opulent suites, sophisticated lounges and exceptional new dining venues. Scheduled to enter service in the Mediterranean in July 2025, and -- she will follow her normal summer season with winter voyages in the Caribbean.\nOceania was also busy this quarter with the return to service of Marina after an extensive refurbishment. This all incumbency rejuvenation includes the addition of 3 new dining options and reimagined penthouse suites. And just as we add more capacity and new features on existing ships, we are also excited for enhancements to our destination and home ports. We're increasing our selling to exciting destinations such as Bermuda and Great Stirrup Cay, where we plan to complete construction of our 2 ship pier towards the end of next year.\nWe'll also be adding a new home port to our roster in 2025, JAXPORT in Jacksonville, Florida. And in April 2026, NCL will make its return to Philadelphia after a 17-year hiatus. With the addition of Philadelphia, NCL will now service 7 of the top 10 largest metropolitan regions in the United States. We are excited about our deployment and our guests are as well. as shown by our booking trends, which you can see on Slide 7.\nThe company continues to experience strong consumer demand. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong bookings with our 12-month forward book position at the upper end of our optimal range on strong pricing. During the second quarter, we observed continued strength in onboard revenue as well, which was driven by our guests' continued enjoyment of our short excursion and onboard amenities including specialty restaurants and communication services, which have been bolstered by the continued implementation of Starlink across the fleet.\nAdditionally, pre-booked onboard revenue per Capacity Day showed solid growth, increasing by 15% as more guests opted for pre-cruise purchases. And as we've seen from prior experience, higher pre crew spend typically results in higher overall spend throughout the guest cruise journey. As a result, our net yield grew 6.3% during the second quarter, surpassing our guidance by a full 200 basis points.\nDuring the second quarter, about 3% of our capacity was originally scheduled to be in the Middle East region with high teen percentages on our Oceania and Regent brands scheduled to be in that region. The cancellation of these itineraries resulted in a very short resell cycle. Despite the setback, results for this quarter were strong enough to offset this, underscoring the robust demand environment for cruises and the agility and effectiveness of our team to overcome difficult challenges.\nWithout a doubt, our financial performance exceeded our expectations, and we're therefore raising our yearly net yield growth guidance increasing 100 basis points from 7.2% to 8.2%. And -- it is worth noting that our occupancy guidance remains essentially unchanged as we're already guiding to full ships. So the entire increase in our guidance is on the back of stronger pricing. As such, we are anticipating strong pricing growth across all 4 quarters in 2024.\nTurning to Slide 8. To continue cementing our leading position beyond 2024, I'm excited to announce that our second quarter advanced ticket sales surpassed the first quarter, increasing 11% year-over-year and reaching a new all-time high of $3.9 billion. This success was driven by robust pricing, a dynamic deployment mix coupled with increased presale packages and capacity growth.\nNow moving on to what is at the core of our Charting the Course strategy, our sustainability program Sail & Sustain. In June, we were pleased to result our annual sustainability report. On Slide 9, we summarized some of our main 2023 highlights, which underscore our commitment to integrating sustainability into our overall business approach.\nSo noticeable accomplishments include achieving our 2024 target to equip 50% of our fleet with short power technology, a full year early. We remain on track to equip 70% of our fleet was this technology by 2025. In fact, we recently celebrated the launch of Shore Power at Port Miami, making it the first major cruise port on the U.S. East Coast to offer short power at 5 of its terminals, including our own Terminal B, the Pearl of Miami.\nWe also reached our goal of testing 20% of our fleet with biodiesel blend by expanding tests to form more ships throughout 2023. Our new target is 40% of our fleet to test biodiesel by 2024.\nWe -- Finally, doubling down on our people excellence pillar, we continue diversifying our sourcing, having spent over $635 million with small businesses and businesses with minority, women, veteran or economically disadvantaged qualifications in 2023. And most recently, Forbes named us as the best American employer for women, a milestone we are particularly pleased with.\nOur journey does not stop here. We remain dedicated to advancing towards our Sail & Sustain targets going forward, maintaining high standards of operational excellence and creating lasting value for our business in various stakeholders -- stakeholders through sustainable practices. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team for all of these impressive accomplishments.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our very strong second quarter 2024 financial results, our improved full year 2024 guidance and our increasingly solid financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2024 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2023.\nLet's begin with our second quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 10. In short, we exceeded guidance across the board, outpacing our targets for the quarter. Starting with the top line, results were impressive with net yield increasing 6.3%, exceeding our guidance of 4.3% and -- by 200 basis points.\nSeveral factors contributed to the exceptionally strong top line growth in the quarter, which included robust demand for European, Caribbean and Alaskan sailings, where the majority of our capacity is deployed this quarter; stronger-than-anticipated onboard revenue and close-in sailing demand; and finally, the redeployment of canceled Red Sea sailings were better than our initial expectations.\nLooking at costs. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD came in below guidance at $163, primarily due to the timing of certain expenses that will now fall into the third quarter. As expected, our unit cost this quarter included approximately $9 from higher dry-dock days and related costs as compared to '23.\nExcluding the impact of the dry-docks, our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD would have been flat year-over-year once again demonstrating our ability to fully offset the impacts of inflation with our disciplined cost savings initiatives across the entire organization. These initiatives, combined with robust top line growth has yielded strong results.\nAdjusted EBITDA came in at approximately $588 million, surpassing our guidance of $555 million, resulting in a year-over-year increase of 14%. Adjusted EPS was $0.40, exceeding our guidance of $0.32 and increased 33% on -- compared to the same quarter last year.\nOverall, we are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance. Strong top line growth, combined with our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, enabled us to surpass our guidance metrics for the quarter. This strong momentum positions us well as we look ahead. And as a result, we are raising our earnings guidance as highlighted on Slide 11.\nWe -- we are thrilled to announce that for the third time this year, we have raised our full year guidance, reflecting the strong performance and strength of our business. Since our initial guidance in February, net yield growth is expected to increase 280 basis points to 8.2%. And we have maintained our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD guidance which, excluding the impact of dry-docks, is expected to be flat for the year. I will go into more detail on this a bit later in my remarks.\nAs a result of the strong top line and sub-inflationary unit cost growth, we have increased our guidance for adjusted EBITDA by $150 million from $2.2 billion to $2.35 billion, all of this is flowing to the bottom line, resulting in an increase in our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately 25%, underscoring our impressive operational execution and strong market demand. These results mark significant progress towards achieving our Charting the Course 2026 targets as we outlined in May.\nMoving on to a more detailed look at our guidance on Slide 12. We outlined our expectations for the third quarter and full year as well as the implied metrics for the fourth quarter. Starting with net yield, we anticipate net yield growth of almost 6.5% in the third quarter. This growth is driven by several factors. Over 70% of our sailings in the third quarter are in Europe and Alaska, regions where we are experiencing strong demand from North American customers.\nContinued strong onboard revenue trends, combined with healthy prebooking for onboard amenities. Unlike Q2 and Q4, a -- this quarter is unaffected by disruptions from the Middle East cancellations and rerouting. These favorable trends and our ongoing momentum have allowed us to increase our full year net guidance to 8.2%. We -- I want to emphasize that our latest guidance implies a healthy net yield growth of 5% for the fourth quarter. This builds off of an impressive 8% growth in 2023 and that was underpinned by 14% pricing.\nOur Q4 2024 growth also comes in the face of headwinds from rerouted Middle East sailings which comprised 10% of our deployment in the fourth quarter and was disproportionately weighted to our luxury brands.\nNow turning to our attention to adjusted net cruise cost where our guidance remains unchanged, a true testament to the diligent efforts of the entire organization. For the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD to increase by 3.3% to $156 from $151 in the same period last year. I would like to highlight a few points about the quarterly numbers as there are many moving parts and I will get into that -- those yearly changes later in my remarks.\nFirst, in Q3 of last year, we recognized approximately $2 of nonrecurring benefits. Second, keep in mind the timing of expenses. As I mentioned previously, our Q2 unit costs were better than expected primarily due to timing differences of certain expenses between Q2 and Q3. We -- Consequently, on a year-over-year basis, Q3 unit costs are up. However, this is merely a timing issue. And for the full year, excluding the impact of dry-docks, we still expect our unit cost to remain essentially flat and in line with our prior guidance.\nAnd third, I will mention variable compensation. We are recognizing higher variable compensation due to our business outperforming initial forecasts. And this has a disproportionate weighting in the third quarter, consistent with the seasonality of our earnings.\nAs a result of strong net yield growth and cost savings initiatives, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $870 million, which is driving adjusted EPS of $0.92, and -- a 21% increase over the same period in 2023.\nMoving to Slide 13. I'd like to revisit our net yield guidance since our Q1 results in May and highlight the confidence and strength we are seeing for the latter half of 2024. At our Investor Day, we increased our full year guidance, indicating that the majority of the uplift was expected in the second half of the year. Giving more detail on this now, we had expected that about $35 million of the $50 million adjusted gross margin improvement or an increase of 120 basis points of net yield to materialize in the second half.\nToday, we are raising our full year guidance once again with an additional $35 million improvement in adjusted gross margin or 120 basis points in the second half. This positions us to achieve solid net yield growth of 5.9% in the back half of 2024.\nMoving to Slide 14. We -- I want to dive a bit deeper into our margin enhancement initiatives. As we stated at our Investor Day, a key pillar of our algorithm is boosting margins and reducing cost across the entire organization. And we continue to see these fruits -- the fruits of these efforts during 2024.\nDuring the first and second quarters, we have been able to keep our unit costs flat, excluding dry-dock. And as I mentioned earlier, due to the timing, this metric will increase in the third quarter, but should decline in the fourth quarter. And as a result, our adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel PCD will be essentially flat year-over-year, fully offsetting inflation as well as the increased variable compensation due to the company's strong performance. This speed is not easy and is the result of the tireless work of our entire organization and transformation team. I am confident that we will be able to continue this momentum in the years that come.\nTurning to Slide 15. We can clearly see the impact of our disciplined approach to earnings and returns as outlined during our recent Investor Day. The key elements of our algorithm are straightforward, improved net yields and rigorous cost management drive margin expansion. That margin expansion in conjunction with controlled capacity growth results in substantial adjusted EPS growth.\nMoreover, this adjusted EPS growth when paired with our disciplined capital allocation strategy allows us to prioritize debt repayment in the short to midterm. This approach not only reduces our net leverage, but also strengthens our balance sheet and enhances our adjusted ROIC, which, by the way, is on target to hit double digits this year another important milestone toward our 2026 target of 12%.\nDuring the second quarter, we improved our trailing 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin to 33%. The -- as we close out the year, we anticipate ending with a margin of 34.5%, marking a substantial improvement of 400 basis points from 2023. This progress is a significant milestone as we strive toward our target of approaching historical margins of approximately 39%.\nI -- now let's shift to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 16, which has not changed significantly since Q1. During the quarter and as expected, our 6% 2024 exchangeable notes converted to shares. And our net maturity is our $565 million notes due 2024 and which we are expecting to refinance and/or partially repay by its maturity in December.\nTurning over to leverage on Slide 17. As we are proud that we achieved our net leverage goal 6 months ahead of schedule, reducing our leverage by approximately 1.5x turns and ending the quarter at 5.9x. We -- Achieving leverage in the 5x is no small feat since we ended 2023 at 7.3x. As you know, we are on a multiyear deleveraging journey to derisk the balance sheet, targeting the mid-4s and this quarter's results are another significant milestone in that journey.\nIn closing, I want to emphasize that this has been an exceptional quarter where we surpassed guidance across all key metrics. This momentum has enabled us to raise our full year guidance for the third time. This is all a testament to the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day and that I discussed earlier. We are excited about the second half of the year and remain confident in our strategy going forward.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Mark. I want to close by reminding everyone of the ambitious targets and strategies that we laid out in Investor Day just 2 months ago, which are listed on Slide 17. Our board vision is to provide guests with exceptional vacation experiences, allowing them to vacation better and experience more. This vision is the foundation of our Charting the Course strategy, supported by our 4 pillars: People Excellence, guest-centric product offering, long-term growth platform and exceptional performance.\nThese pillars are all underpinned by our commitment to sustainability through our Sail & Sustain program. This new strategy and vision lead to a simple yet powerful earnings and return algorithm that Mark discussed earlier that will help us deliver on our 2026 financial targets.\nOur entire management team is driven and focus on this new strategy, and I'm positive that this quarter's results gives you even greater confidence that we are on track to achieve our long-term goals. We are optimistic about our future and look forward to sharing this journey of growth and success with you.\nWith that, I'll hand the call back over to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

My name is Joe, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a remainder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inman. Mr. Inman, please proceed.\n\nSarah Inman\n\nThank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. Throughout the call, we will refer to a slide presentation that can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nBoth the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2024 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. It's such an exciting time for our company with wonderful new product available across all 3 of our award-winning brands, strong demand and some recent noteworthy announcements that have solidified our trajectory for years to come. .\nThe demand for cruise vacations continues to be at all-time high, as evidenced by record booking, record book position and record advanced ticket sales as the continued innovation and service delivery on board our ships lead to exceptional guest satisfaction scores. The combined effect is strong financial performance in the quarter and an even brighter outlook for the year ahead. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our Q1 milestones, including the recent newbuild ship announcement and pier developments, our strong performance in the quarter and the exciting booking trends that are driving our improved guidance for the remainder of 2024.\nI'll also be diving into the significant progress we've made on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our first quarter performance and updated guidance for 2024. We kicked off the year with impressive momentum carrying forward several positive trends from the end of 2023.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, we sustained strong demand throughout the quarter, achieving record bookings in this period, which led to our most successful wave season ever. As a result, our 12-month forward book position remains at all-time high. In terms of financial results, adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled during the first quarter compared to last year on the back of stronger pricing and higher occupancy levels.\nOur margins also noticeably improved during the period, with our core costs essentially flat year-over-year, leading to a robust growth in adjusted operational EBITDA margin, which is adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted gross margin now approaching 33% for the trailing 12 months. As a result, we reduced our leverage by a full turn during the quarter when compared to the end of 2023, ending the first quarter at 6.3x net leverage, marking an important milestone in our journey to strengthen our balance sheet and well on our path for the 1.5 turn improvement in net leverage we guided for the year.\nThese strides were recognized by S&P, which upgraded both our issuer credit rating and issue-level ratings during the quarter. While we'll give more details later in the call, I can't help but share that we have exceeded essentially all of our guidance metrics for the first quarter of 2024 and consequently raised guidance on our key metrics for the full year, including net yield, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Another key milestone during the first quarter was our historic newbuild order, which we shared on our last conference call during Seatrade Cruise Global, encompassing 8 new ships across all 3 of our award-winning brands. This is the most transformative newbuild program in our company's history.\nWe also announced the construction of the [ 2-ship pier ] at Great Stirrup Cay, which will enhance our existing infrastructure on the private island making it an even more attractive destination for our guests. I am thrilled about our future as I know we're paving the way for our continued growth in the next decade and beyond. Our first quarter successes are due to our continued focus on our near-term priorities, which are detailed on Slide 5.\nWe successfully grew capacity 8% compared to 2023, while achieving a record 12-month forward book position, all while increasing price and reducing our net leverage by a [ full turn ], and we're seeing strong results across the board. Turning to Slide 6. we have shown you frequently in the past. I want to once again emphasize our long-term strategy of delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial returns. Our newbuild pipeline increased from 5 to 13 ships in the quarter, representing a capacity CAGR of 6% from 2023 to 2028 and 4% from 2023 to 2036.\nHistorically, capacity growth has driven outsized revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, and we expect this trend to continue with the incorporation of larger and more efficient state-of-the-art vessels to our fleet. Turning our attention to the current booking environment shown on Slide 7, and we are witnessing robust and resilient consumer demand across all 3 of our brands in all of our markets. As a result, during the first quarter of this year, we noted record bookings culminating a record wave season, leading to a continued record book position for the next 12 months, extending into 2025.\nWe continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands and products, including Europe and Alaska, which continue to perform very well and make up the majority of our deployment over the summer. All of this strength is despite the cancellation and rerouting of our itineraries that we announced in the Middle East and Red Sea earlier this year. We also recently announced the cancellation of all Red Sea sailings across all 3 of our brands for the spring of 2025 and replacement sailings are already on sale. By adjusting these sailings well in advance, we can ensure a full sales cycle for the replacement itineraries and no impact to our 2025 yield.\nOverall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for the next 12 months, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, yield growth is strong. During the first quarter, yield growth exceeded guidance coming in at 16.2% on a constant currency basis, up 70 basis points from the guidance we provided just 2 months ago in late February. 2024 is shaping up to be a strong year. And as a result, we are raising our full year yield guidance 100 basis points from 5.4% to approximately 6.4% on a constant currency basis on the back of the strong first quarter and strong demand for the remainder of 2024.\nPlease note that our occupancy guidance remains unchanged as we are essentially already guiding to full ships. So the entire increase in our guidance is on the back of stronger pricing. Onboard revenue also remains a highlight with strength seen across the board. This is a positive sign that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We continue to absorb strong demand from precruise purchases, which were up 16% compared to 2023. Preselling of packages of [ forward cruise ] typically leads to a higher overall spending during a guest's cruise journey.\nTurning to Slide 8. To continue cementing our leading industry position beyond 2024, I'm excited to announce that this first quarter reached an all-time high in advanced ticket sales. This success was driven by robust pricing, a dynamic deployment mix, coupled with increased presale packages and capacity growth. Our advanced ticket sales balance rose 13% year-on-year, reaching a record $3.8 billion.\nOver the past quarter, we have taken considerable strides in our sustainability efforts through our Sail & Sustain program, which you can see on Slide 9. We kicked off the year seeking out government grants to support our green initiatives by applying to the EU innovation fund with the goal of accelerating the transition of our six Prima class vessels for being methanol ready to be fully methanol capable. We continue to be committed to our short- and long-term decarbonization goals.\nWe're also proud to announce that 50% of our company-wide fleet is now equipped with [indiscernible] technology achieving our year-end 2024 target well ahead of schedule. This is key to our journey to minimizing emissions during port stays and contributing to cleaner air in the port communities we visit. Our proactive approach to environmental impacts didn't go unnoticed. CDP Climate gave us a notable B rating in recognition of the steps we've taken to measure and manage our risks and opportunities related to climate change. This acknowledgment endorses our efforts and pushes us to continue enhancing our sustainability initiatives.\nOur commitment to operating ethically and with integrity also gained us recognition in the equity markets, JUST Capital in their restaurant and leisure category of America's most JUST Companies Index named us as a top 5 company. This recognition is a testament to our dedication to fair and equitable operations and the prioritization of our stakeholders well being. Also, we completed the purchase of 3 million carbon offsets invested in renewable energy products. These offsets not only support our decarbonization journey, but invest in cleaner energy sources and local job creation in the communities where these projects are located.\nFinally, we were recently honored with being one of Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity in 2024. This award is a testament to our dedicated efforts in fostering an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds are represented, engaged and empowered to generate and execute on innovative ideas. I want to express my gratitude to our entire team for their efforts in making our company a welcoming place for all of our talented team members. This recognition motivates us to continue creating a workplace where every individual feels valued and empowered. This progress underscores our unwavering commitment to environmental sustainability, ethical business practices and the well-being of all of our stakeholders.\nThese accomplishments serve as building blocks in our ongoing journey towards a more sustainable and responsible future. I couldn't be more proud of our entire team for all of these impressive accomplishments.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mr. Kempa?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. I'm a little under the weather today, so if my voice cracks I apologize in advance. My commentary today will focus on our strong first quarter 2024 financial results, our improved full year 2024 guidance and our increasingly solid financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2024 net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Let's begin with our first quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 10. We had an exceptional start to the year, and we exceeded guidance across the board, beating our already ambitious targets for the first quarter, which we only announced 2 months ago.\nStarting with the top line. Results were impressive with net yield increasing 16.2%, materially exceeding our guidance of 15.5%. As discussed last quarter, several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong top line growth we saw this quarter, including the lapping of lower load factors and a less-than-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. But more importantly, we experienced unprecedented demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represented approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter.\nLooking at costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, came in slightly below guidance at $164. As expected, this number includes approximately $5 from the increased dry dock days and related costs in the quarter compared to 2023. Excluding the impact of dry docks, our adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel, would have been essentially flat year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to offset the impacts of inflation with our disciplined cost savings initiatives across the organization.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $464 million, exceeding guidance of $450 million and almost doubling the prior year's results. We returned to first quarter profitability with adjusted EPS of $0.16, exceeding guidance of $0.12 in the quarter and well above the loss of $0.30 in the prior year. Overall, we are incredibly pleased with the results we generated in the first quarter. Strong top line growth, combined with continued progress in reducing costs, allowed us to essentially beat all of our guidance metrics in the quarter.\nWe are building on this momentum and with our revised expectations for 2024 are raising our full year guidance on several metrics, which can be seen on Slide 11. We raised our full year net yield growth a full percentage point from 5.4% to approximately 6.5%. This 100 basis point increase reflects the strength we experienced in the first quarter, but more importantly, our higher expectations through the rest of the year as a result of strong demand and record bookings that we have experienced for the remainder of 2024.\nLast quarter, we mentioned the impact on our business due to cancellations and redeployment of itineraries in the Middle East and Red Sea. The strength we have seen in the business through wave season, however, has allowed us to almost fully offset this impact. Our full year guidance implies net yield growth for the remainder of the year in the low to mid-single-digit range and is exceeding our prepandemic growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year increased $50 million to $2.5 billion building on the first quarter guidance [ beat ] of $14 million. Adjusted EPS guidance for the year increased on a net basis of $0.09 to $1.32, made up of our $0.04 beat in the first quarter, a $0.10 raise for the balance of the year due to higher demand and pricing, which was partially offset by higher fuel costs and interest expense of approximately $0.04.\nThese strong numbers and related guidance raise would not be possible without the continued focus and efforts from our entire team, both shoreside and shipboard. Now let's take a look at our guidance for the second quarter. We expect a strong second quarter with net yield growth expected to increase approximately 4.3%, which is slightly above our historical averages despite the impacts of the [ canceled ] itineraries and redeployment in the Middle East and Red Sea.\nAdjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 5.8% above the same quarter last year. As we mentioned last quarter, dry dock days in 2024 will make comparisons to prior year more challenging. Second quarter '24 has approximately 70 more dry dock days scheduled than last year. This increase for the quarter results in a $9 or 5550 basis point impact on adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel in the quarter.\nExcluding the dry dock impact, adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel is expected to be approximately $156, essentially flat year-over-year, demonstrating once more the continued success of our cost savings initiatives across the organization. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $555 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be about $160 million and adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.32.\nMoving to Slide 12. I want to dive a bit deeper into our margin enhancement initiatives. We remain fully committed to boosting margins and reducing costs across the organization. With a meticulous approach supported by our transformation office, we are continuously pinpointing opportunities irrespective of their scale across every facet of our business. The results of these efforts are clear in the first quarter of 2024 where adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day was [ $165 ] but was flat -- essentially flat compared to the first quarter in 2023, excluding the dry dock impact.\nOur guidance on adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel remains unchanged for the full year 2024 and is expected to be $159, net of the approximate $5 impact from dry docks in the full year, which are -- ex the drydock, which are essentially expected to be flat. For your models, I would remind you that we expect to see about 2/3 of the drydock impact during the first half of the year with the remainder in the fourth quarter.\nTurning over to Slide 13. I want to focus on an important metric that we track internally, which is our adjusted operational EBITDA margin which is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by adjusted gross margin. Looking at the last 12 months, you can see the significant improvements we have made as we have returned the business to full operations and focus on rightsizing our cost basis. In Q1, trailing 12-month adjusted operational EBITDA margin was 32.7%, improving 200 basis points compared to the full year 2023.\nWe expect to see this margin continue to improve throughout the year, ending 2024 at approximately 33.5% based on our updated guidance. As you know, we are striving to improve our margins, and this journey will be fueled by 2 main drivers: First, capitalizing on the strong demand in the market, and converting this into quality and sustainable net yield growth; and second, continued focus on net cruise costs and rightsizing our cost base.\nShifting to the balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. During the quarter, we completed the refinancing of our $650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. In connection with this refinancing, we repaid $250 million 9.25% secured notes due in 2028, which was our highest interest rate debt. This refinancing reduces our interest expense and improved leverage while also releasing all related collateral, another important step forward in strengthening our balance sheet.\nMoving to leverage on Slide 15. We have a track record of delivering on net leverage reduction, as we have discussed in many previous earnings calls, and we are currently on a path to do so again. In the first quarter alone, we reduced our net leverage by a full turn from year-end and turned the quarter at 6.3x. This is a significant reduction for 1 quarter, and we expect to continue to improve net leverage over time propelled by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments.\nBy the end of 2024, we anticipate reducing our net leverage by approximately 1.5 turns from year-end 2023, ending 2024 in the upper 5x range, with sequential improvements in each quarter. We are currently refining a multiyear plan to further continue the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet to drive shareholder value. I plan to share more on this plan at our Investor Day on May 20. Closing out my section, I want to reiterate, this has been a fantastic quarter, where we beat guidance on all key metrics. The strong momentum we have seen in the quarter is carrying over to the full year, and we've been able to raise our guidance for the full year on yield adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS.\nThis quarter is a testament to our ability to use strong top line results, coupled with efficiencies to enhance margins and drive strong EBITDA and related cash flows, resulting in lower leverage and derisking the balance sheet. We are excited to see how the rest of the year plays out after the strong start. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Mark, and I wish you a speed of recovery. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on our most important work, as shown on Slide 16. First, we will continue to focus on execution, capitalizing on the strong demand from our target upskill demographics to drive net yield while delivering experiences that guests value. Second, we will build upon the progress already made over the last quarters from our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in cost reduction and efficiencies throughout the organization. .\nAnd finally, we will continue to improve our financial stability by further strengthening our balance sheet and continuing to reduce net leverage over time. In a few weeks' time, we will be having the privilege of hosting an Investor Day. We hope you are able to attend either in person at the New York Stock Exchange or virtually through our webcast. It is an occasion that we are eagerly looking forward to as it provides us with a platform to articulate our long-term strategy and financial metrics for the business. This strategic road map will offer insight into our ambitions and aspirations for the future of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.\nWe will outline the key initiatives and measures that will underpin our drive towards providing our guests the experiences they value while delivering long-term profitable growth and shareholder value. The future is certainly bright, and we are excited to share this journey with you. And with that, I'll hand the call back to the operator to begin our Q&A session."

My name is Donna, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Inman. Ms. Inman please proceed.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2020 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.\nOur comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to call -- turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I want to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. .\nIt's such a great time to be in the cruise industry with wonderful new products available across all 3 of our award-winning brands. The demand for cruise vacations is certainly as robust as we have ever seen it. And the continued innovation on board is leading to outstanding financial performance and exceptional guest satisfaction scores and guest repeat rates.\nToday, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our key milestones in 2023, our progress on our near-term priorities, recent booking trends and our outlook for 2024. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our 2023 performance and guidance for 2024.\nNow 2023 can best be described as a landmark year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We started the year on the heels of the last of the impact from COVID and the last of the cruise port reopening in the Asia Pacific region throughout Q1. But as you can see on Slide 5, consumer demand was quick to rebound in full and we were pleased to return to full ships and full year profitability. It is so incredibly rewarding for our staff and crew to be able to operate full ships and deliver vacation experiences of a lifetime to our happy guests.\nWhile that in and of itself would have made for a spectacular 2023, we were further going by the introduction of 3 new world-class ships into our fleet, one for each of our 3 award-winning brands. This was an unprecedented achievement and a first in the 57-year history of our company. We welcomed Oceania Cruises’ Vista in May, Norwegian Viva in August, and most recently, the highly anticipated Region Seven Seas Grandeur in November.\nThe successful launch of 3 vessels in 1 year would not have been possible without the hard work and unwavering commitment of crew and team members across the globe. Thanks to their dedication and passion for providing an unmatched guest experience, the reception for these new ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board.\nThis reception, combined with the strong demand environment, we continue to experience across all 3 of our brands, has enabled us to successfully absorb an 18% increase in capacity in 2023 versus 2019 levels at record pricing levels. As a result, we have driven revenue per passenger cruise day up 17%, allowing us to finish the year with year-end advanced ticket sales of $3.2 billion up an incredible 56% compared to 2019.\nAt the same time, we continue to maximize onboard revenue generation, as shown by growth onboard revenue per passenger cruise Day, which is up 27% over 2019. A main driver of this large improvement is through enhanced presold onboard revenue, so our guests come on board with a fresh wallet.\nBut none of this is new news. As we have been and continue to be the industry leader in net yields. We are proud of the work our teams do day in and day out to drive the highest yields in the industry. But today, I also want to emphasize that we are equally passionate about the cost side of the business.\nOur relentless focus on cost optimization has produced 4 sequential quarters of year-over-year adjusted new -- of year-over-year adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day reduction with full year 2023 coming in 21% lower than the prior year. We achieved this by focusing our efforts on optimizing spend and investments across all areas of the business, from fuel to food and consumables and marketing. We are committed to continuing to optimize our margins by balancing products, revenue and cost considerations through better leveraging data and analytics to drive decision-making and accountability.\nThe net result of these healthy revenue and cost metrics allowed us to get back to driving results. As we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, allowing us to generate the adjusted free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet with the repayment of nearly $2 billion in debt.\nOn the product front, we are strategically enhancing the guest experience by identifying smart ROI-driven investments and decisions to profitably maximize guest satisfaction. Our recent success has been the rollout of StarLink high-speed Internet. We moved quickly and have been able to roll out this cutting-edge technology across half of our fleet since the spring of 2023 and expect to finish the full fleet by year-end this year.\nIn addition, to significantly elevating the guest experience aboard our ships, we've been focusing on improving the pre-cruise guest experience and better leveraging digital tools across all 3 of our brands. For example, we've been making improvements to our pre-cruise planning functionality at Norwegian to allow guests to book even more before they need their homes, and we rolled out a flexible air program at Oceania, sharing an innovation which began at Norwegian earlier in the year. This innovation gives guests the few day window to deviate their air at the beginning and end of their crews so they can have more time to explore and enjoy destinations before and after they sail with us, while at the same time, allowing us to spread air demand over multiple days and save costs. A true win-win for us and our guests.\nOn the digital side, we recently launched the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur, and we continue to see strong adoption of the NCL mobile app, which reached record high guest usage in January. These improvements are not only resonating with our guests, giving them a better and more frictionless experience before, during and after their cruise, but are also generating positive returns.\nFinally, we announced important interim sustainability commitments, announcing our target to reduce greenhouse gas intensity on a capacity a day basis by 10% by 2026 and by 25% by 2030 versus 2019 levels. The company is truly firing on all cylinders. These solid operational and financial results have laid the foundation for a strong 2024 and position us to deliver sustained profitable growth in the future and incredible vacation experiences to the millions of guests who sail with us every year.\nIn addition to these priorities, a key cornerstone of our long-term strategy is delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial results. Our new build pipeline of 5 ships, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a capacity growth of 28% from 2023 to 2028 with a 5% CAGR over the period. Historically, capacity growth has led to outsized revenue and EBITDA growth and we expect this capacity growth to be no different and deliver meaningful top and bottom line growth.\nWe believe that these measured capacity additions will enable us to further enhance our long-term profitability and continue to significantly strengthen our balance sheet while providing guests new and innovative experiences.\nShifting our discussion to the current booking environment shown on Slide 8. we continue to experience strong and resilient customer demand across all 3 of our brands. The strong momentum we saw in 2023 has continued into 2024 with an all-time high book position and pricing [ bowed ] by strong wave season demand. This has led to some of the best booking weeks in the company history, which began with successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions.\nIn general, we continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands and products. Let me walk you through some recent trends. First, close-in demand for Caribbean sailing is particularly strong prompting the redeployment of Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway from offering shoulder season full 2024 voyages in the Med to offering Caribbean sailings from Port Canaveral and New Orleans, respectively, beginning in October.\nAs a result, our [indiscernible] capacity for the NCL brand is expected to increase by approximately 300 basis points in 2024 versus the prior year.\nOur industry's advantage lies in our ability to redeploy our ships and adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. These changes demonstrate our team's responsiveness to our guests' preferences.\nWe have also seen demand return for sailings in Hawaii. While only accounting for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, these sailings are performing exceptionally well in 2024.\nNext, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand continues to see exceptionally strong demand and our book position and pricing are higher than last year for all 4 quarters of 2024.\nOceania region also continued to see strong demand across all geographies with the exception of redeployed voyages due to cancellations in the Middle East and Red Sea.\nTurning to the Middle East. Last quarter, we made the preemptive decision to cancel all [indiscernible] Israel in 2024. And recently, we have announced the rerouting of our cruises sailing through the Red Sea for the rest of the year. As a reminder, just 1% and 4% of our capacity in Q1 and full year '24, respectively, was expected to dip in the broader Middle East region.\nHowever, the Middle East represents a larger percentage of our capacity for our Oceania and Regent brands making up 12% and 8%, respectively.\nWe now have no polls in the region in 2024 and all replacement cruises have been or are in the process of being put on sale.\nOverall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year. We expect healthy full year net yield growth of approximately 5.4% this year on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by improved occupancy and pricing strength. Onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with strength seen across the board, encouraging indicator that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We are continuing to see strong demand for pre-cruise purchases which typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest cruise journey.\nAnd while we have talked about our strong cost focus during 2023, we want to emphasize that this was not just a 1-year exercise for our team. Rather, it is a cultural shift in the way our entire company looks at cost to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible while delivering experiences our guests truly value. This company-wide focus should allow us to not only continue to reduce costs but even more importantly, create operating leverage to enhance profitability, which will be foundational for our long-term success.\nOur recently established transformation office is allowing us to monitor and track these changes holding each area accountable for their initiatives. We believe this is apparent in our guidance where we expect our core cost to be flat in 2024 versus 2023.\nIn conclusion, our strong top line growth, combined with our continued focus on cost and margin enhancements are expected to drive 2024 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to grow by 18% and 76%, respectively, over last year.\nWe are very excited about the future, and we plan to discuss our multiyear targets with the investment community in Mid [ net ]. We look forward to meeting with you all then.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2023 financial results 2024 guidance and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2023 and 2024 net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019 and 2023, respectively.\nLet's begin with our fourth quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 11. Starting with the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing approximately 14.5% and net yield increasing approximately 8.6%. As discussed last quarter, Several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong growth we saw, including the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019 as well as a very strong close-in demand for Caribbean sailings.\nLooking at costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $151 in the quarter marking our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement on this important metric. As expected, this included approximately $1 of certain nonrecurring net benefits realized in the quarter.\nWe have made significant progress streamlining our cost base during 2023, demonstrating our focus and commitment to our margin enhancement initiatives, and expect to continue this focus in 2024 and beyond.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $360 million, in line with guidance, while adjusted EPS was a loss of negative $0.18 and slightly below guidance due to a $0.06 impact from FX below the line.\nOverall, we were very pleased with the results we generated in the fourth quarter and full year. Strong top line growth combined with continued progress on reducing costs, enabled us to generate full year adjusted EBITDA just short of $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70. All of which drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion.\nI am confident that our improved financial performance in 2023 has set the foundation for a solid 2024 and beyond. Moving on to expectations for '24. Our outlook for the first quarter and full year can be found on Slide 12.\nStarting with the full year, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, an 18% improvement versus 2023 with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to improve by almost 250 basis points.\nAdjusted net income is expected to be approximately $635 million with adjusted EPS expected at approximately $1.23, a 76% increase versus 2023.\nBefore I get into our top line expectations, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind for your models. First, given our strong expected net income growth for the year, shares related to our exchangeable notes are expected to be dilutive and are included in our share count for 2024. As a reminder, we must settle the exchangeable notes due in 2024 and 2025 in shares, while both of our exchangeable notes due 2027 can be settled in cash or shares at our sole election.\nHowever, the accounting treatment requires we consider all notes as if they were settled in shares. As a result, we assume our full year 2024 average share count to be approximately 516 million.\nSecondly, we successfully migrated our tax residency from the U.K. to Bermuda as of December 31, 2023, and we do not expect recently enacted Bermuda corporate income tax legislation to have a significant impact on our overall tax rate as this was already assumed in our planning.\nTaking a closer look at the components of the outlook, occupancy is expected to be approximately 105%. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% inclusive of the headwinds from the outsized impact of the Middle East and Red Sea on our Oceania and Regent brands primarily in the second and fourth quarter.\nFor modeling purposes, our yield growth will be highest in the first quarter as we are lapping lower load factors and a non-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we are seeing strong demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represents approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter.\nFor the remainder of the year, yield growth is expected to return to more normalized levels despite the pressure from the aforementioned Middle East and Red Sea headwinds.\nMoving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year. This represents a 3.4% increase versus full year 2023, but -- which includes the incremental impact of more dry dock days in 2024. Excluding that impact, our core costs are essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. To put this in perspective, this effectively represents approximately $100 million of cost savings given our expected core inflation rate of around 3% for next year.\nFor modeling purposes, keep in mind that 2023 had less dry dock than normal as we took the opportunity to dry dock ships while they were out of service. This year, we are returning to a more normalized dry dock schedule and expect roughly 175 dry dock days in the year. Five dry dock days in the year. This will impact adjusted cruise cost ex fuel by approximately 325 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $5 on a unit cost basis. This includes both the impact of dry dock costs and the related reduction of capacity days.\nExcluding the impact of that, we expect full year adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel would be approximately $154 essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. Note that the timing of this impact is expected to be weighted more to the first half of the year, with approximately 2/3 of our dry dock days occurring in that period. This year, we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to enhance margins and reduce costs. We are leaving no stone unturned and are continually identifying opportunities big and small across the business.\nOur transformation office is running full speed ahead in identifying operating inefficiencies and operating platform in order to enhance the acceleration of our margin recovery and related cash generation.\nOne key focus area for us has been optimizing both our fuel consumption and bunkering strategy. Fuel costs are one of our largest expense line items, and our teams have been hard at work at fostering partnerships with the likes of DNB on decarbonization and long-term agreements with industry leader ABB to drive new opportunities to lower our fuel consumption capacity day.\nIn addition to the consumption side of the equation, we have made a big leap in the optimization of our fuel bunkering strategy that allows us to maximize price leverage across the various ports and suppliers we use during a season. And in many cases, even during a single voyage. We believe this will drive double-digit millions in savings in the first year alone.\nThis is just one of the many examples that support our relentless drive to improve our unit costs and leverage our scale. All without impacting the guest experience. I look forward to sharing many more tangible examples at our upcoming Investor Day in May.\nThe combination of our more efficient cost structure and strong expected top line growth for the year is expected to drive the expansion of our full year adjusted EBITDA margins up by approximately 250 basis points.\nNow let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. As I said earlier, net yield is strong in the first quarter and is expected to increase approximately 15.5%. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to be $165 or approximately 3% versus the same quarter last year.\nAs mentioned, we expect an increase in dry dock days in the quarter, which will have a $6 or a 350 basis point impact on adjusted net cruise cost in Q1. Excluding that impact, adjusted net cruise costs would be $159, essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the impact of inflation with our cost savings.\nAs a result, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $450 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.12. Given the quarter is essentially complete, we do not expect significant outperformance in the top line versus expectations as the vast majority of our inventory is already sold. Any limited upside would result from our onboard revenue generating performance during the month of March.\nMoving on to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. In 2023, we generated almost $2 billion of net cash from operating activities, which included $500 million return of cash collateral. And we repaid $1.9 billion of debt, including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving loan facility. Most recently, we successfully negotiated a refinancing of our $650 million back stock commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. And in connection with this financing, the $250 million 9.75 secured notes due in 2028, our highest interest rate debt is expected to be repaid. This refinancing, which is expected to close in early March will reduce interest expense, improve leverage while also releasing all of the related collateral. Another important step forward in improving our balance sheet.\nMoving to leverage on Slide 15. The company has a solid track record of delevering the balance sheet. From 2014 to 2019, we successfully delevered by over 3 turns. We will continue to be opportunistic and look for further ways to strengthen our balance sheet. We are confident we can make meaningful progress on this front going forward.\nAt year-end '23, with reported net leverage of approximately 7.3x or approximately 6.75x when excluding the impact of ships delivered in the second half of the year. We continue to expect significant improvement in this metric over time, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments.\nOver the course of 2024, we expect to reduce our reported leverage by almost 1.5 turns with sequential improvements in each quarter. This improvement does not assume any prepayment of debt, apart from the aforementioned takeout of our $250 million notes expected in early March.\nGoing forward, we are refining a multiyear plan to further accelerate the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet in order to drive shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Mark. Truly encouraging results. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on the most important work. First, we will continue to execute on our near-term priorities and capitalize on the strong demand from cruising from our target upscale demographic. Second, we will build upon the progress we've already made with our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in costs. And finally, we will continue to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage over time.\nIn closing, I couldn't be more excited about the year ahead. I am confident that we have the right resources in place to capitalize on the strong demand environment and deliver exceptional vacation experiences for our guests across all 3 of our brands, execute on our operational and financial goals for 2024 and ultimately deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder value.\nI look forward to sharing the results of our strategic assessment of our business and defining our vision for the future of the company, including long-term financial targets at our Investor Day this coming May.\nWith that, I'm happy to turn it over to the operator for questions."

My name is John, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John. Mrs. John. Thank you. Please proceed.\n\nJessica John\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications & ESG\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website. at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may be found on our IR website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I would like to cover a few items.\nOur press release with third quarter 2023 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we get into prepared remarks, if you haven't already heard the good news, I'd like to congratulate Jessica on her recent appointment to Chief Strategy Officer for Regent Seven Sea Cruises. I'd also like to welcome Sarah Inman, who recently joined the company last week as our new Head of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. We are very pleased to have Sarah on the team, and I'm sure many of you will have the chance to meet her in the weeks and months ahead. As she ramps up on the company, Jessica will continue to be available in the interim to ensure a smooth transition. Congratulations to Jessica and congratulations to Sarah.\nNow in turning to results, I'm pleased to share with you this morning that we achieved strong third quarter results generating record revenue and a meeting or exceeding guidance on all key metrics. I have to attribute the success to the hard work and dedication of our incredible team members, both on our ships and at our offices worldwide. We also continue to make good progress on both defining our longer-term strategic vision and executing on the near-term priorities I shared last quarter, which are shown on Slide 5.\nFirst, our team is focused on capitalizing on the strong demand environment for cruise to ensure we stay on our optimal booking curve while maximizing pricing and onboard revenue generation. On a 12-month forward basis, our book position continues to be at record levels within our optimal ranges and at higher prices. While we are very pleased with our progress so far in building our book for 2024 and beyond, we are also keeping a close eye on the evolving macroeconomics and geopolitical landscape and already enable to adapt if needed.\nThe next priority is rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives. Since we kicked off this initiative last year, we have seen sustained momentum with 3 consecutive quarters of improvement in our operating cost metrics. And what's even more encouraging is that we have done this without impacting the guest experience as evidenced by our continued strong guest satisfaction level, continued strong onboard future cruise sales and guest repeat rates and continued high onboard spend. These results have been driven by a palpable change in culture with team members across the globe, shipboard and shoreside embracing the challenge to find new and innovative ways to accelerate our margin recovery while still preserving our long-term brand equity.\nTo give you just 1 example. Last month, we took the time to tour Norwegian Jewel ahead of the scheduled 2025 dry dock. We walked through each planned project while on board stopping to get real-time guest feedback to help identify the highest value opportunities. The result of this more methodical approach resulted in not just lower cost, but also shortened the expected length of the dry docking self by 9 days which will allow us to return the shift to revenue generating service that much faster. All in all, the changes we made to the dry dock plan are expected to result in over 20% CapEx savings and a few million dollars of incremental revenue versus our original plan. It was a day well spent. While we have less of the lowest hanging fruit still available at this point, several opportunities like this remain untapped.\nI want to reassure you that we are committed to keeping the same relentless focus vigilant and balanced approach to identifying, evaluating and executing on opportunities in a methodical manner. This is not a one-off exercise to us, but rather something we are embedding in the DNA of our entire organization. This leads us to our next priority, which is to make strategic and intentional enhancements to our offerings and guest experience. With the continued keen focus on costs, we are still making smart, high-return generating modification and investments in our product and service offerings.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter, we are launching Air Choice for Norwegian Cruise Line. This will allow guests to upgrade from our current bundled air offering in which guests are signed flight at the lines discretion and allow them to choose their specific preferred flights for a fee. This is expected to have a dual benefit of improving both guest satisfaction and generating incremental revenue. We are also making disciplined investments in technology for better websites and mobile apps to Universal StarLink high-speed Internet across our entire fleet by the end of 2024. Our high-value targeted efforts to provide an excellent guest experience have not gone unnoticed.\nIn fact, Norwegian Cruise Line was just named the top net megaship cruise line by [ Conde Nast ] Traveler in their 2023 Reader's Choice Awards. Readers voted for their top choices based on several categories, including service, food, accommodations and sustainability and Norwegian Cruise Line 1. So it's clear that our product continues to resonate strongly with our guests. Turning to the fourth priority on the list. After welcoming Oceania [ Vista ] in May, in August, we took delivery of the incredible Norwegian Viva, the second ship in the game-changing prima class and we're not done yet. This year is the first year in our history in which we are introducing 1 ship for each brand, all of which were built with our incredible partners at [ Fincantieri ] in Italy.\nIn just a few weeks, I will be heading back to Italy to take delivery of Regent Seven Sea Grandeur, which you can see on Slide 6. Grandeur rounds out the highly successful Explorer class for Regent, taking luxury cruising to another level. The reception for these ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board, whether it's from our valued travel agents, our loyal pass guests or guests trying 1 of our award-winning brands for the very first time. The disciplined addition of new builds continues to be a key cornerstone of our strategy as they are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion.\nOur New built pipeline, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a 5% capacity growth CAGR from 2019 to 2028, and we are confident in our ability to absorb this growth profitably. We remain in talks with our shipbuilding partners to embark on a new vision for all 3 of our brands and plan to continue to add new ships across our brands at the right time and at the right interval. But for now, after the delivery of Grandeur this month, we have no additional ship delivery scheduled until spring of 2025 and in the interim, we expect to benefit from both organic growth as well as the annualization of the 2023 newbuilds next year.\nThe final prior embolus, shown on Slide 8, is charting a path to reduce leverage and derisk the balance sheet. While the return to investment grade like financial position will be a multiyear process, we continue to expect a significant organic improvement in our net leverage in the intermediate term, driven by our expected cash flow generation and normal course debt amortization payments. With new leadership and perspectives across our organization, we have embarked on a review of our entire business, taking a fresh look at all aspects of our strategy. We are embracing change while preserving what makes it special, and we are committed to take back a leadership position not just in cruise, but in the broader travel, leisure and hospitality sector.\nIn our view, no idea is too big or too small. We have a full vision for what the future holds for Norwegian, so we're taking the time to be thoughtful and thorough as we identify opportunities to ultimately drive more value for our shareholders. Our goal is to share this plan with all of you sometime in spring of next year, along with associated multiyear financial targets.\nNow turning to Slide 9. As we focus on closing out the year strong, successfully executing on our near-term priorities and defining our long-term strategic plan and vision for the future, our team is more united to energize now more than ever. In fact, earlier this month, we held our global conference in Miami, the first time in several years that we have brought together leaders across all 3 of our amazing brands in person. This year's the next gen was all about the future and how we can reach further individually and collectively to accelerate momentum as we move into 2024 and beyond. It was an opportunity to read the team together to spur innovation and collaboration and ensure that across the organization, we are overline and marching towards the same goals as we strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth.\nThis served to further cement my confidence that we are taking the right steps today to best position the company for the future. Now shifting our discussions to current bookings, demand and pricing trends shown on Slide 10. We achieved record revenue of $2.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2019. The strong consumer demand environment resulted in load factors of 106% in the third quarter while growing net per diems by nearly 8%, all while absorbing a 20% growth in capacity. Before we get into operational details, in recent months, we have seen the devastation caused by both the wildfires and Mali and the escalating conflict in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by these tragic events. Our priority remains the safety, security and well-being of our guests, team members and the communities we visit, and we have mobilized to modify impacted itineraries and help support relief efforts in both regions.\nStarting with Hawaii, we were uniquely impacted compared to our [ food ] peers given our unique year-round interisland Hawaii offering, the only 1 in the industry with our U.S. flagged vessel pride of America. When the wildfires began in August, we quickly modified certain itineraries to avoid straining local resources with the guidance and encouragement of a responsible return from both the Hawaiian governor Josh Ring and the Hawaii Tourism Authority, we resumed our scheduled calls to [ CalhoLawi ], Maui in early September. As it occurred in the past, with events of this nature, which received significant attention and media coverage, we did experience a temporary slowdown in close-in bookings for Hawaii sailings.\nThis impacted not only pride of America, but also certain sailings on Norwegian Spirit also based in the region for much of the fall, which in total represent approximately 6% of our capacity in the fourth quarter. Demand has steadily improved in recent weeks and while not quite fully recovered yet, it's on the right trajectory and now approaching normalized levels. While we expect some lingering impact in the first quarter, Hawaii only accounts for approximately 4% of capacity in this period as well as for the full year as Norwegian Spirit repositions outside of the region in December.\nTurning to Israel. Once the conflict began to escalate, we canceled all calls to Israel for the remainder of the year. We recently made the preemptive decision to cancel calls in Israel in 2024 as well, and our brands are currently working diligently to modify itinerary and communicate these changes to guests. One of the benefits of our industry is that cruise ships are easily movable assets so we can pivot as needed and still offer incredible itineraries for our guests to enjoy. However, we are seeing both elevated cancellation activity and lower new bookings for this region, primarily for close-in sailings as the conflict is ongoing and still front and center in the consumer psyche.\nPrior to the conflict approximately 7% of capacity in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4% of capacity for the full year 2024 had visits to the broader Middle East region. Breaking 2024 down a bit further, very little capacity is in this region early in the year, only about 1% of capacity in Q1. That said, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024 and beyond, which on a 12-month forward basis remains in a record position at our optimal levels and at robust pricing levels. Onboard revenue generation, which we view as our single best real-time indicator of consumer confidence also continues to knock it out of the park. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue for Passenger Cruise Day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period.\nThis is driven not only by strong demand but also through our multiyear effort to enhance our bundled offerings and pull forward and presell more revenue before a guest ever step foot on the ship, effectively expanding the sales cycle and getting more of the consumers bottle over time. For the third quarter, presold revenue on a per passenger day basis was up over 80% higher than in 2019 with nearly all of our guests purchasing something pre crews on their own or through our bundled offering. Not only does this lead to higher spend by guests over the course of their entire journey, but it also pulls forward cash inflows for the company. This is 1 of the reasons why, as you can see on Slide 11, our advanced ticket sales balance increased nearly 60% in the third quarter versus 2019, far outstripping capacity growth of 20%.\nBefore I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain in which Slide 12 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we partnered with the Global Maritime Forum to advance our shared mission of driving a positive change for the industry, environment and society. We also joined its flagship initiative, the Getting to Zero Coalition, a powerful alliance with more than 200 organizations within the maritime, energy, infrastructure and finance sectors committed to supporting the maritime industry in its journey towards full decarbonization by 2050. I'm also proud to share that we were recently recognized by Forbes in its World's Best Employers list for 2023. Our team members are, by far, our most important resource, and we are committed to their continued development and well-being.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial results and outlook. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our third quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019.\nSlide 13 highlights our third quarter results in which we are very pleased to report that we met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing nearly 8% and net yield increasing approximately 3%, both coming in at the high end of guidance. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $152 in the quarter, demonstrating our third consecutive quarter of improvement since we began our cost reduction efforts in earnest late last year. As expected, this also included approximately $2 of certain nonrecurring benefits realized in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $22 million higher than our guidance at approximately $752 million in the quarter.\nIn addition, adjusted EPS of $0.76 also meet our projection by $0.06. Overall, we were very pleased with the strong results we generated in the third quarter. Shifting our attention to guidance. Our outlook for the fourth quarter can be found on Slide 14. We are projecting very strong net per diem growth of approximately 15% to 16%. And net yield growth of approximately 7.75% to 8.75%. Keep in mind, as we laid out last quarter, there are several factors contributing to the exceptionally strong pricing growth we are expecting in the fourth quarter, as a result of more luxury and upper premium capacity operating with our new region in Oceania ships as well as the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019.\nWhile this is still a strong result on a core basis, we have tempered revenue expectations since we last spoke, primarily on the back of lower occupancy. As Harry touched on earlier, we are experiencing impacts during the quarter from exogenous events in Hawaii and Israel, the latter of which also had implication for parts of the broader Middle East in the form of elevated cancellations and lower booking volumes. In addition, as Norwegian Cruise Line continues to fine-tune its differentiated strategy of longer, more premium itineraries, certain voyages in the late season Eastern Mediterranean and parts of Asia performed slightly below expectations. While this resulted in a disconnect in the fourth quarter of 2023 our booking curves, guest sourcing and marketing plans have already been recalibrated for similar sailings next year, resulting in a book position that is significantly better for the same period in 2024 compared to the same time last year.\nShifting to operating costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $151 in the fourth quarter. This also includes certain nonrecurring benefits that partially shifted from Q3 and that we do not expect to occur in 2024 and are also partially offset by costs related to inaugural activities. On a normalized basis, unit costs would have been approximately $153 in the quarter. Taking all this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $360 million and adjusted EPS loss is expected to be approximately $0.15 on a projected diluted share count of approximately $425 million. Keep in mind that we have 4 outstanding exchangeable notes, which will cause variability in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate EPS following the if-converted method.\nSlide 22 in our earnings deck has more information to help you with modeling. Now shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year '23. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.86 billion within the previous range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion despite the headwinds expected in the fourth quarter. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.73 compared to prior guidance of $0.80. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, our healthy net per diem growth of approximately 9.25% to 9.75% is slightly narrowed versus previous guidance. Net yield growth is now expected to be 4.25% to 4.75% with capacity up 18%.\nMoving on to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $155 for the full year, better than our prior guidance of $156. This improvement is the result of the team's round-the-clock efforts to methodically rightsize our cost base. The savings we have identified have been broad-based and touching every aspect of the business, which you can see on Slide 16. I'm particularly proud of what we've been able to accomplish so far this year in the area of food costs. Since the fourth quarter of 2022 we have reduced these costs per passenger day by nearly 30%, significantly outpacing the easing and food inflation seen in the broader market. These are just a few of the many examples where we have been able to drive significant savings while still preserving the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels that our guests value.\nAs we look ahead to 2024, while we are not ready to give guidance yet, there are a few moving pieces to keep in mind. For example, the timing of expenses like dry docks, will cause variability in the NCC ex fuel metric when comparing periods. In 2023, we have limited dry docks as we took the opportunity during the pandemic to optimize the schedule while the ships were already out of service. In '24, we expect roughly 170 dry dock days, which will impact NCCs by approximately 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $4 on a unit cost basis. including both the impact of the dry dock expenses as well as the impact from reduced capacity days.\nTurning our attention to the balance sheet and our debt maturity profile on Slide 17, year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated over $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We've repaid $130 million debt in the quarter and approximately $1.5 billion of debt over the first 9 months of the year. For the remainder of the year, we have approximately $330 million of scheduled debt payments, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency back to ship financing. In October, we successfully completed the refinancing of our operating credit facility, extending our debt maturity profile and providing incremental liquidity. Our revolving credit facility was upsized to $1.2 billion from $875 million with a 3-year term maturing in October 2026.\nIn addition, the company issued $790 million of [ 818 ] senior secured notes through 2029. The net proceeds, together with the cash on hand were used to fully repay the approximately $800 million on our Term Loan A, which was to mature in January of '25. We were particularly pleased with the demand we saw for the new notes issuance. In addition to being significantly oversubscribed, we also saw substantial interest from new investors, reflecting increased confidence from the markets in our financial position and outlook.\nTurning to net leverage. We continue to expect significant improvement driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled payment of debt installments. Excluding debt associated with our ships on order for future delivery, trailing 12-month net leverage is expected to be meaningfully reduced versus current elevated levels. This does not adjust for ships that are delivered in 2023 which would have the full debt load in the numerator without a full year of contribution included in adjusted EBITDA. Our liquidity position outlined on Slide 18 remains strong and would have been approximately $2.5 billion at quarter end, if adjusted for the upsizing of our revolver in October. We continue to believe that our strong liquidity position, coupled with our ongoing cash generation and attractive growth profile provide a path to meet our near-term liquidity needs, including scheduled debt amortization payments, and capital expenditures.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Harry for his closing comments.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Mark. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways that you can find on Slide 19. First, we are focused on execution of the near-term priorities outlined today. Second, we are committed to defining our vision for the future with the comprehensive strategic review we are currently undertaking. Third, consumer demand for travel and experiences continues to be strong. Despite temporary regional disruptions, we continue to maintain a very strong record 12-month forward book position and at higher prices. Our advanced customer deposits also stand at $3.1 billion, 59% higher than Q3 2019. Fourth, we have seen a fundamental shift in culture at our company as a result of our margin enhancement initiatives.\nWe now have 3 straight quarters of sequential improvement in our key cost metrics and we will continue to identify and implement additional measures to accelerate our margin recovery while still delivering the exceptional products and service offerings that our guests desire. Lastly, our liquidity position is very strong, and we are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet and reducing leverage in the coming years. We've covered a lot today. So I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call to your questions."

My name is Maria, and I will be your operator. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, all participants of this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed.\n\nJessica John\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications & ESG\n\nThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2023 Earnings and Business Update Call. I'm joined today by Harry Sommer, President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2023 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us here today. So today marks exactly 1 month since I began my new role as President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. I'm humbled and honored to have been trusted to lead this incredible company, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities I see at. The responsibility they have to our best network of stakeholders, including our 40,000 team members worldwide, our guests our travel adviser partners, suppliers, lenders, shipyards, the over 700 communities we visit and all of you in the investment community is not something I take likely.\nRest assured, my leadership team, the Board of Directors and I are committed to best positioning Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings for success. My focus now is squarely on the future and how we can refine and enhance our strategy to optimize our existing fleet of high-quality assets, further differentiate our business model, build resiliency, advance our efforts to drive a positive impact on society in the environment and ultimately drive more value to our shareholders and broader stakeholders.\nWith new leadership not only in my seat, but in all 3 of our award-winning brands and most recently for our vessel operation function, there is a possible feeling of reinvigoration and excitement about the future across the entire company. We are approaching every decision with fresh perspective and new energy, challenging the status quo at every level and encouraging our entire team to think outside of the box and come to the table with new ideas, however big or small. Along with these changes, you can see for yourself on Slide 5 that while many of the senior leaders are new to their roles, there is still continuity and extensive experience among all of the leaders allowing for smooth transition without skipping a beat.\nOur executive team has an average of over 20 years in the cruise industry and nearly all has been with NCLH for a decade plus. I have the unlost confidence that this team is the right one to take the company to even greater heights. As we are fine-tuning our longer-term strategic vision and priorities, we are also focused on execution today, and Slide 6 outlines my near-term priorities.\nFirst, we are focused on capitalizing on the healthy demand environment for cruise, which I will talk about in more detail a little later in my commentary. At a high level, this means remaining within a booked position of approximately 60% to 65% on a 12-month forward basis while increasing pricing and maximizing onboard revenue generation. After years of experience, we believe this level will be the sweet spot based on our current deployment mix, and I am pleased to say we are comfortably in this range today. Our revenue management process is dynamic and we carefully monitor on a granular level how each ship itineranvoyage is tracking against its optimal booking curve and adjust marketing spend, promotional construct and pricing as needed depending on the market environment to maximize each voyage's contribution to the bottom line.\nThe next priority is rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives. Mark will dive into more detail on the great progress we've already made on this critical effort but I want to emphasize that we have many additional opportunities in the pipeline to do even more, and we are not shying away from this challenge. The reality is we are operating against the different backdrop today than we were in 2019 requiring an even keener focus on balancing the top line with the cost structure that supports our unique business model and allows us to accelerate our margin recovery and help build resilience to vary external and macroeconomic environments.\nWe are undertaking this effort with a strategic and data-driven approach that allows us to identify additional opportunities for efficiencies, sets, monitor and maintain accountability against concrete KPIs and increased agility to adapt quickly as market or consumer preferences evolve. I'm pleased to report that we're already seeing a change in the core culture of the company at every level of the organization to emphasize efficiency, cost mindfulness and results without impacting the guest experience. We built significant momentum in recent months with this initiative, and we look forward to demonstrating continued improvement in the coming quarters.\nThis does tells nicely into our next priority, which is to make strategic and intentional modifications to enhance our offerings and better align them to our guests' needs and wants. There is no question that investment in our product and service offerings are critical to keeping our brand value propositions intact. However, we are refocusing the business on making smart investments in areas that generate the highest return and maximize guest satisfaction over the course of their entire cruise journey starting from the time they book.\nFor example, we are deep in the development of a streamlined booking process at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand which uses generative AI technology to personalize the experience for guests, while also simplifying and reducing the number of considerations required to book by orders of magnitude. This, along with several other initiatives underway, should translate to more satisfied guests who spend more on board and return to sale with us more frequently, resulting in a win-win of higher yields and stronger loyalty.\nTurning to the fourth priority on the list. The entire team is hard at work preparing for the delivery of Norwegian Viva on Thursday as well as Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November, which you can see on Slide 7. I just came back from Italy where I visited the shipyards to check on their progress and I left even more excited than I was previously to welcome these new additions to our already guest and class slate. Both are sister ships to existing vessels that have been elevated even first so we have a high degree of confidence that there will be an overwhelmingly positive reception the ships from our guests and travel partners, which we are already seeing in their incredible advanced booked position. I'm also pleased that both are on schedule and on time for delivery despite supply chain and other challenges, a testament to our great working relationship we have developed with our partners at Fincantieri. In June, we announced that global Munich sensation in Aladdin music icon, Louis Fonsi, will serve as Godfather to Norwegian Viva. The announcement alone generated a reach of over 200 million globally, including new audiences in the targeted Spanish-language demographic.\nThe ship will be christened in Miami later this year and home port in San Juan, Puerto Rico starting in December for a season of Caribbean itineraries. We also recently announced Seven Seas Grandeur Godmother Sarah Faberge, the great grand order of Peter Carl Faberge, the legendary artist jeweler and created an entrepreneurial genius to find a world renowned company that bears his name. This is a natural choice and celebration of Regions partnership with Faberge.\nThe disciplined addition of new build is a key component to our strategy, and we have said consistently in the past, we welcome new hardware introductions as they not only generate excitement and bring more attention and awareness to our brand but they are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. As the smallest of the 3 large public cruise operators, we continue to believe that we have outsized opportunity to grow our footprint and meaningfully drive the bottom line. Our new build pipeline, which you can see on Slide 8, represents approximately 50% capacity growth by 2028 versus 2019, a CAGR of approximately 5%. After the delivery of 3 newbuilds in 2023, a record for the company, we have no additional ship delivery scheduled until spring of '25. In the interim, we expect to benefit from both organic growth as well as the annualization of the 2023 new build next year.\nAnd lastly, the final priority on the list, but arguably the most important is starting the path to reduce leverage and derisk the balance sheet. Given the necessary actions we took to navigate the past few challenging years, our leverage ratios are currently not at optimal levels. Our goal remains to evaluate all options available and then clearly define a multiyear pathway to return to an investment-grade like financial position. This only happened overnight, but as you can see on Slide 9, the company has successfully reduced leverage in the past, and I am confident we will do so again.\nIn the interim term, our expected cash flow generation boosted by our robust new build pipeline, along with normal course debt installment payments are expected to result in significant organic improvement in our net leverage. Over the next several months, we are focused on the successful execution of our near-term priorities while fine-tuning the future vision and strategy for the company with 3 strong brands, a world-class C and destiny industry, we are starting from a strong foundation and a position of strength. And I can say without a doubt that we have a bright future ahead with significant potential to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders.\nShifting our discussion now to our current bookings demand and pricing trends. We achieved rental revenue of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2019. We have been able to tap into strong consumer demand environment, achieving the right balance of underlying revenue growth with net per diems up 6%, while at the same time materially growing our fleet with capacity of 19% for the quarter. We also kept our ships full, reaching a load factor of 105% in the second quarter, in line with guidance and a long awaited milestone as we return to normalized levels, which you can see on Slide 10.\nAs previously mentioned and as illustrated on Slide 11, several years ago, we strategically shifted our deployment to longer, more immersive itineraries at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand and increased our concentration of premium destinations while reducing our Caribbean deployment. This was designed to attract a higher quality guest and maximize our competitive position. A natural bright product of this new deployment mix is left third and fourth passengers in the cabin, which is what historically pushed passenger occupancy above the 100% mark. As a result, we expect full year occupancy going forward to be roughly 200 basis points lower than 2019 levels. This shift also resulted in an elongation of our booking window which was 255 days in the second quarter, an increase of 51 days or 20% compared to the same quarter in 2019 and meaningfully enhancing our future visibility and reducing our exposure to volatile and less predictable cost in bookings.\nThinking together, we believe this strategy will drive higher yields, higher guest satisfaction and higher guest repeat rates with longer runway to optimize our pricing and marketing strategy as macro environment evolved over time.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our cumulative book position for the second half of 2023 remains ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices another indication of continued healthy demand environment and the resilience of our target consumer. This strength continues past this year to sailings in 2024 and beyond, which at this point in the booking curve is our primary focus. In fact, over the past 90 days, over 70% of our ticket sales were for 2024 and '25 sailings, considerably higher than in 2019. Onboard revenue generation, our best real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially today also continues to perform exceptionally well. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue for passive Cruise Day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. Our efforts to enhance our market-leading bundled offerings and increase quality touch points with our guests starting from the time of booking and continuing throughout their cruise journey are clearly bearing fruit.\nIn fact, presold revenue on a per passenger day basis for the second quarter of 2023 was over 75% higher than in 2019. An important contributor to our onboard revenue strength as these guests tend to spend more overall throughout their journey than guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, in which Slide 14 outlines key accomplishments and milestones.\nSince we last spoke, we published our annual Sail & Sustain report and [ SAD Valine ] disclosure on World Environmental Day in June. The report provides transparency in our progress and initiatives on top ESG priorities. Some of the highlights this year for more detail on our new climate action strategy and enhanced data and disclosures on community impact, human capital and greenhouse gas emission reported. In addition, we demonstrated progress against several of our environmental goals, including targets to equip our ships with short power capabilities and reduced bunkering of freshwater. I encourage all of you to take some time to explore the report and welcome -- I'm sorry, to explore the report and visit our website for more information.\nI'm also proud to share that just last week, we announced the winners of our annual Giving Joy recognition program that has been celebrating teachers across North America since 2019 for their hard work and relentless dedication. Each of the 20 winning educators want a free 7-day voyage for 2 and the top 3 grand prize winners were invited to attend the exclusive cresting voyage for Norwegian Depot. This year's content drew support from over 3,400 teachers across the U.S. and Canada and garnered hundreds of thousands of lots. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our second quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019.\nSlide 15 highlights our second quarter results in which we are very pleased to report that we've met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, results were strong with revenue per up 33% and net per diems increasing approximately 6.5%, surpassing the high end of guidance, while net yield was in line with guidance at 2.9%. Keep in mind that comparisons to 2019 includes certain premium-priced Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year, which did not operate in 2023.\nTurning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, came in below [ $156 ] in the quarter, demonstrating further improvement from the prior quarter and the high watermarks seen in the second half of 2022. The reduction in cost this quarter was primarily driven by lower food costs and crew optimization efforts as we continue to realize the benefits of cost savings initiatives identified and implemented during the first phase of this initiative. I will note that across all 3 brands, our guest satisfaction scores remain strong, reflecting our continued focus on cost rationalization without impacting the guest experience.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $30 million higher than our guidance at approximately $515 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS of $0.30 also beat our projection by $0.05, and was the first time we generated positive EPS since 2019 as well as the first time that our quarterly adjusted EBITDA exceeded the same quarter in 2019. Shifting our attention to guidance. Our out for the third quarter can be found on Slide 16. We are projecting net per diem growth of approximately 7% to 8% and net yield growth of approximately 2.25% to 3.25%.\nSimilar to the second quarter, the loss of certain premium priced Baltic itineraries will continue to impact the comparison versus 2019. In the fourth quarter, pricing and yield are both expected to exhibit mid-teens growth compared to 2019. There are several other factors contributing to the exceptionally strong growth we are expecting for the fourth quarter which include more luxury and upper premium capacity operating with the new region and Oceania ships as well as a favorable comp from the rapid exit from Cuba in 2019 and the close in resale of those sailings. Adjusting for these factors, net per diem growth is still expected to be up approximately 10%, which reflects our organic pricing power and strong consumer demand that Harry referred to as well as the benefit of our shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and Europe seasons this year.\nGiven that we have already -- we already have a substantial booked position and our pace of bookings is on track with our optimal booking curves. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this top line outlook for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $152 in the third quarter which includes approximately $3 of certain nonrecurring benefits realized in the quarter.\nLooking ahead, there are also onetime expenses associated with new capacity additions in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these items, this metric is expected to slightly decrease quarter-over-quarter, which is noted on Slide 17. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter is expected to be approximately $730 million, and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.70 on a projected diluted share count of approximately 510 million shares. Keep in mind that we have our 4 outstanding exchangeable notes, which will cause variability in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate EPS when we follow the if-converted method. It is also important to note that despite our ability to settle our 2 2027 exchangeable notes in cash rather than its shares, these notes would still be included in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for GAAP reporting purposes, if they are dilutive in the quarter. We've included an additional slide in our earnings deck, Page -- Slide 24, with more information to help with modeling.\nNow shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023, we are raising the floor of our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion despite approximately $30 million of headwinds for our interest and fuel expense in the back half of the year. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.80 or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the second quarter outperformance. As you can see on Slide 18, since we first guided for the year in February, we have increased our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 or 14% on strong results in the underlying business which overcame headwinds from higher fuel FX and interest rates. Excluding these headwinds, adjusted EPS growth versus initial guidance would have been approximately 20 percentage points higher.\nTaking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, our healthy net per diem growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019 and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance with capacity up 18%.\nTurning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel first capacity date is expected to average approximately $156 for the full year better than the prior guidance of $159, reflecting lower-than-expected costs in the second quarter. As we have previously mentioned, when comparing this metric to 2019, please note that we do not have the benefit from the disposal of older, less efficient tonnage that some of our peers have. And we have also added capacity at our high-end Oceania Regent brands, which while accretive to margins do have higher operating costs.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the timing of expenses such as dry docks can cause variability in these metrics when comparing different periods. For example, in 2023, we have limited dry docks as we took the opportunity during the pandemic to optimize the schedule while ships were already out of service. As Harry noted earlier, this improvement is the result of the deliberate actions we have taken to enhance margins and rightsize our cost base. To further supplement our internal efforts, which have been in full force since we kicked off this initiative last fall. We have also more recently engaged a third-party consultant to benchmark best practices across sectors and identify incremental areas of opportunity.\nOur entire team is working around the clock to find ways to accelerate our margin recovery, and we are leaving no stone unturned in the process. To date, the savings we have identified in the broad-based have been broad-based, touching every aspect of the business with the largest buckets consisting of fuel, food and consumables and marketing, as shown on Slide 19.\nTo give you an example of one of the initiatives we are undertaking, we are optimizing crew movements and reducing ship crew transfers, which we expect to result in multimillion dollars savings. To put this into context, each year, we have approximately 90,000 crew movements including 6,000 or so between ships. This is just one example, but it demonstrates how incremental changes can add up to a larger impact on the bottom line. We recognize that we still have more work to do, and we are committed to doing so in a way that preserves the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels that our target higher-end guests expect from our brands all while setting us up well for continued margin improvement in the next few years.\nTurning our attention to the balance sheet and our debt maturity profile on Slide 20. In the first half of the year, we generated over $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations, including over $1 billion in the second quarter. This allowed us to repay approximately $1.4 billion of debt including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving credit facility. In addition, we have approximately $475 million of scheduled debt payments for the back half of the year, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing.\nAs we have previously stated, we intend to refinance our operating credit facility in the normal course of business before year-end. As mentioned earlier, we expect our net leverage to improve significantly, driven by our organic cash flow generation and payment of scheduled debt installments. Excluding debt associated with ships on order for future delivery, trailing 12 months net leverage is expected to meaningfully reduce versus current elevated levels dropping below 6x over the course of the first half of 2024. This does not adjust for ships that were delivered in 2023 which would have the full debt load in the numerator without a full year of contribution included in adjusted EBITDA.\nTurning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong at approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end, as outlined on Slide 21. This consists of approximately $900 million of cash and cash equivalents, $875 million under our revolver and a $650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate $300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity, but is not currently available to draw. During the quarter, we received approximately $500 million of cash collateral back from a credit card processor. This collateral release not only provided a meaningful increase to liquidity but was also a very strong signal that our external partners have increased confidence in our financial position and future outlook.\nOverall, I feel the same optimism about the direction of our business. I want to echo Harry's comments that our entire management team is reinvigorated and focused on delivering on our business and strategic goals while also pursuing all opportunities to maximize value creation and create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing comments.\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nWell, thank you, Mark. So before turning it over to Q&A, I'd love to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can also see on Slide 22. First, we are focused on execution of the near-term priorities outlined today, including the delivery of 2 new builds in the coming months, while simultaneously fine-tuning our vision of the future. With new leadership in many functions, including my own, we are approaching this exercise of open minds and a fresh perspective as we work to best position the company for success.\nSecond, our target higher-end demographic continues to be healthy and resilient with strong demand for travel and experiences. This is demonstrated by our strong revenue performance, a record up 33% in the quarter with our strong book position, which when looking over the next 12 months is within our sweet spot range of approximately 60% to 65% booked and at higher prices and advanced customer deposits of $3.5 billion, 52% over Q2 2019. Third, we are demonstrating the results of our margin enhancement initiatives, including through our efforts to maximize revenue, improve efficiencies and right size costs. We now have 2 straight quarters of sequential improvement in our key cost metrics and we'll continue to identify and implement additional measures to accelerate our margin recovery while still delivering the exceptional product and service offerings that our guests desire.\nLastly, our liquidity position is solid and we are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet and reducing leverage in the coming years. We've covered a lot today. So I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions."

My name is Paul, and I will be your operator.\n[Operator Instructions] As a reminder to all participants, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed.\n\nJessica John\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications & ESG\n\nThank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2023 Earnings and Business Update Call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Friedland Holdings, Harry Summer, President and CEO elect of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2023 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today marks a significant milestone for me as it is my 34th and final earnings call as President and CEO of this incredible company before my upcoming requirement, which was announced just over a month ago. In 2015, I was given the opportunity to lead Norwegian Cruise on Holdings into its next chapter, 1 where we brought together 3 of the industry's leading brands Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises to form the best cruise operator in the industry. After 8 incredible years, it is now time for me to make wave for the next generation of leaders who are ready and energized to take this company on to greater heights. Before getting to the crux of the call, I want to take a moment to thank all of Norwegian's team members around the globe, shipboard and shoreside for the backbone of this company and who are the main driver of his success. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our loyal guest value travel partners lenders, shipyards, investors, analysts and all of our stakeholders for your continued support and partnership over the years.\nI'm incredibly proud of what we have been able to collectively achieve especially over the past few extremely challenging years, but I know that the best days for this company still lie ahead, and I look forward to seeing what you all accomplish together. With Harry Sommer at the helm, I leave this company the most capable of hands.\nAs Slide 5 shows, Harry has a broad range and depth of experience that makes him 1 of the premier executives in the industry. I have worked with Harry in various capacities over the course of 3 decades, and I can assure you that he is a strategic and innovative leader who has the right talent skill set and energy to lead the company at this pivotal time in its history. As a long-standing cruise industry and company veteran, he brings both continuity and a fresh perspective to this seat. We have been working together along with our Board of Directors and the rest of the senior management team for some time now to ensure a seamless transition, and I am confident that NCLH will not skip a beat as we continue to push forward and capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing today.\nNow there are times when state makes circumstances and this happens to be one of those times is my departure coincide, not only with the 20th anniversary of the founding of Oceania Cruises, but also the delivery of the 7 ship in the Oceania fleet the incomparable Vista which you can see details about on Slide 6. With great pride, we took delivery of this amazing shift just last week, bringing NCLH's total fleet to 30 vessels with over 60,000 births. We are heading over to Europe this week where Vista will be Christine and Maltbie Godmother, Emmy award-winning food personality Giada De Laurentis. As 1,200 guests Vista is the first of 2 Alora class ship for the line with the second ship named Alara expected in 2025. These ships will further elevate and cement Oceanics' leading position in the upper premium crew space. I have to thank our partners in Cantieri once again for bringing our vision to life and delivering a truly magnificent shift. What is even more exciting is that this is just the first of 3 new builds that we have in the pipeline this year with Norwegian Veeva and Region Seven Seas grander joining the fleet later this year.\nNew hardware introductions generate excitement from those new to cruise and new to brand as well as with our loyal past guests. So 3 ships in 1 year will mean that much more of a halo effect for our company to leverage given their very efficient financing structures made possible to the unique nature of the industry's interconnected financing ecosystem New ships are able to contribute immediately and are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. So now I'll turn the call over to Harry, who will be tasked with delivering on the significant potential upside we see ahead to provide an update on the current environment and the key catalysts we have in the Hazen. Harry?\n\nHarry J. Sommer\n\nPresident & CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Frank. And before I get started, I have to say that I am honored and grateful to begin the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Growing up to integrate working-class parents in the Bronx I could never have dreamed to be at the helm of such a storied brand. But Frank, you took me under your wings early in my career and it taught me so much over the last 3 decades. I know I speak on behalf of the entire NCLH team when I say thank you, Frank, for your countless contributions not only to our company but also to the broader cruise industry. I look forward to building on this remarkable legacy, and I am committed to doing everything I can to best position this company for continued success.\nOver the next few months, I will be speaking with travel partners, team members destination representatives, the investment community and a whole host of constituents while working closely with our executive team to fine tune our plan and vision for the future, and I look forward to sharing details with you. Shifting our attention to the to the backdrop that makes me so optimistic for what lies ahead slide 7 outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we see now and on the horizon. We cover our leadership transition already, which could not have gone smoother. So I will skip ahead to what continues to be a healthy demand environment. Our target consumer remains resilient with a persistent desire for travel and experiences. Our booking window, which is our best forward-looking indicator remains strong. In fact, we were encouraged to see that even with the banking sector driven financial market volatility in March, we did not experience any unusual booking or cancellation activity across any of our brands.\nOur onboard revenue generation, which is our best real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially is also performing exceptionally well and we are even more pleased with the depth and breadth of the strength across revenue streams, ships and regions. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was nearly 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. This is driven in part by our focus on attracting the best guests and enhancing our market-leading bundled offering. We are also increasing quality touch points with our guests, starting with the time of booking to capture even more revenue and prepayment prior to grades. Our presold revenue on a per passenger day basis for the first quarter of 2023 is approximately double the level in 2019, an important contributor to our onboard revenue strength as guests who make precruise purchases tend to spend significantly more than guests who do not pre-book onboard activities.\nTurning to our next catalyst. We continue to take strategic actions across our business to improve operating efficiencies and rightsize our cost base to rebuild and enhance margins. The results of this initiative are ready to getting to bear fruit as demonstrated by our first quarter adjusted net cruise cost, excluding steel per capacity day which was not only 14% below the run rate in the second half of 2022, but also outperformed our guidance by $4 as certain savings were realized earlier than anticipated.\nWe expect this metric to continue to show modest sequential improvement each quarter for the remainder of 2023 as seen on Slide 8. I want to stress that we recognize and acknowledge while this is a great start, we still have more work to do. This initiative is very much ongoing and will continue to be a top priority under my leadership. We are committed to identifying and evaluating incremental opportunities across every area of the business to help accelerate our margin recovery. This does not mean, however, that we will not continue to invest in our product or service offering to enhance our guest experience. But rather that we will be even more strategic and data-driven when making these decisions to ensure we are investing where we see the highest return and most impact.\nA good example of this is our recent announcement regarding the rollout of the StarLink low latency broadband Internet system in a phased manner across our fleet. This was a strategic and cost-effective initiative to help address the consistent pain point we hear from guests regarding the reliability and speed of Internet connectivity at sea. This is one example of our focus on finding the right balance, which is critical to keeping our brands value propositions intact, maintain our incredibly loyal pass gas base and continually attract new cruisers to sail on a world-class fleet for what we believe is the best vacation experience in the world.\nThe last catalyst to highlight is our industry-leading new build pipeline shown on Slide 9, which Frank already touched on briefly. Capacity growth in 2023 is expected to be just shy of 20% compared to 2019 as we add over 5,000 births to our world-class fleet. And as we look out over the next 5 years, this increases to approximately 50% growth versus 2019. All 3 of our brands are well poised to profitably absorb this elevated capacity growth given our relative size and under penetration in many markets around the world. We are focused on better leveraging our scale as we embark on this period of transformational growth and translating this capacity growth into outside benefits to both the top and bottom line. This makes for an attractive entry point for investors as the newbuild pipeline adds significant potential future earnings power compared to today's levels.\nWhen combined with our ongoing efforts to maximize profitability on our existing fleet, including by delivering consistent year-over-year moderate yield growth, we view this as a winning formula. Shipping our discussion now to our booking demand and pricing trends. You can see on Slide 10, we reached load factors of 101.5% in the first quarter, exceeding our guidance and breaking triple-digit levels for the first time in 3 years with some voyages exceeding occupancy of 115%. With this significant achievement, we have also nearly closed the occupancy gap versus 2019 levels. In the second quarter, we expect to average 105% occupancy, a return to normalized levels with cabins fully sold. This average is slightly below 2019 levels as a result of our strategic shift to longer, more immersive itineraries at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand naturally resulting in less thirds and fourths which is what historically pushes passenger occupancy above the 100% mark, all while enhancing margin over time.\nTurning to Slide 11. After a very strong wave season, our cumulative book position for the balance of 2023 remains ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices. Demand and pricing continues to be strong, not only for 2023, but also as we look further out to sailings in 2024 and beyond. To give you an example, bookings for Regions 2026 World Cruise were nearly 70% higher than its 2022 World Cruise, which was the last World Cruise launch Creedenemic at an average price point of over $230,000 per suite.\nAnother strong indicator that our product continues to resonate with our guests is the performance of NCL's Cruise next program, an onboard program in which we sell nonrefundable future crew certificates. In the first quarter, CruiseNext achieved its highest quarterly results in the program's history surpassing the previous record. As we look to the remainder of the year, our substantial book position, coupled with the continued healthy demand metrics we are experiencing gives us confidence in achieving our 2023 net for DM and net yield guidance, which Mark will touch on in more detail momentarily. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to provide an update on our decarbonization efforts as part of our global sustainability program, sale and sustain, something that I'm very passionate about and committed to advancing.\nAs shown on Slide 12, coinciding with Earth Day last week, we announced new short- and near-term greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction targets to help guide us on our pursuit of NetZero by 2050. We are targeting a 10% reduction in GHD intensity by 2026 and 25% by 2030. The scope of these targets cover our direct submissions as well as the full well to wake impact of our fuel consumption. As we execute on this plan, we expect to see a dual benefit of not only initial reductions, but also cost savings from reduced fuel consumption. We also revamped our climate action strategy, which is now centered on 3 key pillars: efficiency, innovation and collaboration.\nWe are implementing solutions for efficiency today, innovating for future solutions, including with our investments to modify 2 of our future new builds to create methanol ready configurations and are committed to collaborating with our stakeholders and partners along the way. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President\n\nThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financial results and outlook, I want to also thank Frank for all that he has done to propel this company forward as well as his outstanding leadership. I look forward to continuing to partner with Harry in his new role as we work to capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing in order to maximize value for all of our stakeholders.\nMy commentary today will focus on our first quarter 2023 financial results 2023 guidance and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics, is on a constant currency basis. Slide 13 highlights our first quarter results, in which we are pleased to report that we met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter was up approximately 18% versus 2019. Net per diems increased approximately 7.7%, achieving the high end of guidance while net yield of 3.6% was a healthy beat versus our expectations as load factor of 101.5% came in well ahead of projections.\nWith significantly higher participation as a result of enhancements to our bundled offerings today when compared to '19, the accounting allocation between ticket and onboard revenue has also changed, which can skew the comparison. Therefore, we focus on total net per diem and net yield as a better holistic representation of our pricing power. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity date averaged $161 in the quarter, better than expected and approximately 14% lower than the run rate in the second half of 2022.\nThis reflects the rapid execution of cost savings initiatives identified and implemented last year, some of which were realized earlier than anticipated. This includes improvements in areas such as supply chain initiatives back-office optimization as well as crew costs and travel expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $40 million higher than our guidance at approximately $234 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS loss of $0.30 also beat our guidance.\nShifting our attention to guidance. Our outlook for the second quarter can be found on Slide 14. As we have stated previously, the second quarter will complete our occupancy ramp up. In addition, comparisons to 2019 include certain premium priced Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year which we did not operate in 2023. As a result, growth is in line with our expectations with net per DM increasing approximately 5.5% to 6.25% net yield expected to increase approximately 2.5% to 3.25%. Pricing and yields are both expected to increase in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter exhibiting the strongest growth versus 2019. This is driven by our organic pricing power and in part by a favorable comp as the second half of 2019 included various headwinds like the rapid exit from Cuba, and the close in resale of those sailings.\nFourth quarter is also expected to benefit from our strategic shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and European seasons this year as well as a mix shift with more capacity operating for our region and Oceania brands. Given our robust book position for the second half of 2023, which is ahead of 2019, we have good visibility into the balance of the year, which gives us confidence that we can achieve the sequential improvement in year-over-year growth. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $159 in the second quarter. A further improvement versus the prior quarter as additional savings initiatives are realized. We continue to expect modest sequential improvement each quarter in 2023 as occupancy increases and as a result of initiatives which have already been identified and implemented. This should result in a lower run rate cost level exiting 2023 than our full year reported results.\nTaking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $485 million, which is roughly the same level as EBITDA in the same quarter of 2019. Another stepping stone to closing the gap versus prepandemic levels. I am also pleased to report that we expect to achieve another significant milestone in the quarter with adjusted EPS turning positive for the first time since the pandemic at approximately $0.25 per share.\nNow shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion, with the high end of our targeted range, representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.75 or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the first quarter outperformance partially offset by higher anticipated fuel costs and FX for the remainder of the year. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, net per DM growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019 and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance.\nMoving on to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year, slightly better than our prior guidance and reflecting lower-than-expected costs in the first quarter. This represents a 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. As Harry noted, we continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies and are taking deliberate actions to improve our margins, while maintaining the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels our brands are known for. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate this improvement over the coming quarters.\nTurning our attention to the balance sheet. Slide 15 provides our debt maturity profile, which includes approximately $800 million of scheduled debt service for the remainder of the year, the vast majority of which is related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. We've talked previously about the actions taken earlier this year to address a large portion of our 2024 maturities so I won't go into further details today, but a summary is provided on Slide 16 for your reference. Since we last spoke, we also signed agreements to increase our ECA-backed commitments by approximately EUR 1.7 billion. This was primarily to finance improvements and modifications to newbuilds currently on order across our 3 brands. This includes the previously communicated changes to the last 4 PRIMA class ships to make them up to 20% larger than the first generation ships as well as the addition of the methanol ready configuration to the last 2 ships to increase optionality and help future-proof these long-life assets and reach our decarbonization goals.\nThe financing also covers odor supplies associated with preparing certain new build center service as well as related financing premiums. While we originally plan to fund this with our organic cash flow generation when the ships were originally ordered, given the very efficient and supportive financing we received from export credit agencies and the continued uncertainty in the macro and financial markets, we felt financing this was a prudent action to minimize cash outflows for the next few years.\nTurning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.9 billion, as outlined on Slide 17. This consists of approximately $700 million of cash and cash equivalents, nearly $600 million of availability under our revolver and our $650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate $300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity, but is not currently available to drop. I want to reiterate our commitment and relentless focus on delivering value from all of our key stakeholders.\nWe will continually evaluate options to accelerate our recovery, while maintaining adequate financial flexibility to adapt to different macroeconomic backdrops. Overall, we feel optimistic about the direction of our business, and we believe we are taking the right steps today to create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments.\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n\nThank you Mark. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 18. First, we continue to see healthy and resilient demand from our target markets who remain willing and eager to spend on cruise vacation travel. Our brands continue to resonate with consumers as demonstrated by our book position and pricing for the remainder of '23. Our record book position also gives us high visibility into the back half of the year and beyond.\nSecond, we are already starting to see the benefits of our margin enhancement efforts and we'll continue to take strategic measures to best position the company for its next chapter while ensuring that we keep the secret sauce that makes our brand so special fully intact. Third, we are excited to deliver on our industry-leading growth profile, which we are confident we can profitably absorb providing a meaningful boost to our future earnings power. And lastly, we feel comfortable with our liquidity position and are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet in the coming years. We've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions."

My name is John, and I will be your operator. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Thank you, Ms. John. Please proceed.\n\nJessica John\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Communications & ESG, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Harry Sommer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which, Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions.\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with fourth quarter and full year 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.\nOur comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2022 was a year like no other in our company's 56-year history. As we successfully concluded our Great Cruise Comeback with the last vessel in our fleet reentering service midway through the year. Our team continually push forward to this challenging transition year, achieving several significant milestones on our road to recovery and preparing for the next chapter of our storied brands.\nWith our full fleet back to the high seas, we significantly ramped up occupancy levels carrying nearly 1.7 million guests welcomed our newest ship, Norwegian Prima to our world-class fleet, reached several critical financial inflection points, maintained our industry-leading pricing and perhaps more telling, ended the year in a record booked position for 2023 and at record prices. These accomplishments are even more impressive when considering they were achieved against the backdrop of lingering COVID-19 impacts as well as ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.\nI want to take the opportunity to once again thank our entire team, both shoreside and shipboard for their hard work, dedication and tenacity, which has propelled us forward as we strive to be the vacation of choice for everyone around the world. I'm incredibly proud, honored and inspired to work alongside each and every one of you. And I also want to express our sincere thanks to our loyal guests, value travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors and all of our stakeholders for their continued support and partnership.\nShifting our attention to what is certainly a bright future for our company, let's turn to Slide 6, which outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we have on the horizon. First, we are encouraged to see that our target consumer, which tends to skew more upmarket in the broader cruise industry, continues to be financially healthy and resilient and is prioritizing consumption of experiences over the purchase of physical goods. We've talked previously about the 2 high-level indicators we carefully monitor to evaluate the willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel.\nThe first being the length of the booking curve, which is a forward-looking indicator and the second one being onboard revenue, a real-time indicator of a consumer's actual spending, both of which continue to hold strong with no signs of fading. In fact, the booking window in the fourth quarter was well elongated compared to the same quarter in 2019. Onboard revenue also continues to be a bright spot with gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, approximately 25% higher than the comparable 2019 period.\nThe bottom line is our target consumer continues to be willing to spend on travel and experiences now and in the future. This gives us confidence that not only is the incredible value proposition for cruising resonating with consumers, but the unique and compelling offerings of our 3 brands are also appealing to their respective markets.\nSecond, we are taking actions across our business to align with our strategic priorities and strengthen the foundation for sustained profitable growth. This includes a broad and ongoing initiative we began in the fourth quarter to improve operating efficiencies and to rightsize our cost base so that we can rebuild and enhance our margins.\nYou may ask why start this initiative now? While the past few years have been unlike anything we could have imagined. First, we were focused on taking the necessary measures to withstand a prolonged and unprecedented period of disruption by minimizing cash burn, raising capital, enhancing our health and safety programs to adapt to a rapidly evolving public health environment and advocating for the industry to restart cruise operations. We then shifted our focus to relaunching our operations while providing our discerning guests the same unparalleled vacation experience they expect from our leading brands. We also took this unique opportunity to raise the bar on pricing for the long term.\nNow that our phased occupancy ramp is nearly complete, and our loyal guests know that cruising in our brands is back and even better than before, we are squarely focused on how to maximize profitability as we embark on a period of transformational growth. Every aspect of our business is being evaluated through the lens of how we can realize our full value potential for all stakeholders. We are exploring further opportunities, first and foremost, to reduce our cost profile and to maximize revenue generation.\nYou've likely seen some of the actions we've already taken to improve our cost structure, including normalization of marketing spend, corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives and thoughtful rationalization of product delivery. We will continue to leave no stone on turn as we identify and evaluate incremental opportunities. And of course, we will not lose sight of our guests, the very heart of our business, and we will continue to prioritize delivering an exceptional guest experience and superior service levels.\nThe last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading new build pipeline. This year, for the first time in our history, we are gearing up to deliver 1 new build for each of our brands, as shown on Slide 7, adding over 5,000 additional births to our fleet including an over 20% increase in our upscale births. On a capacity day basis, this will result in approximately 19% growth in 2023 compared to 2019.\nAs you can see on Slide 8, we have made some modifications to our newbuild pipeline primarily related to the last 2 shifts in the Prima Class. These ships have been lengthened in part to accommodate the future use of alternative fuels. We now expect gross tonnage for the third and fourth Prima Class to be approximately 10% larger and the fifth and sixth Prima Class ships to be approximately 20% larger than Norwegian Prima and Viva. As a result, delivery days have shifted a bit, and we now expect 1 larger Prima Class ship to be delivered each year from 2025 to 2028. We remain confident in our ability to profitably absorb this capacity with continued consumer demand for travel, our expansion into the many unserved and underserved markets around the world that our brands have not yet tapped into, and on the broader industry's vast underpenetration particularly when compared to land-based vacation alternatives.\nShifting our discussion now to our booking demand and pricing trends. As you can see on Slide 9, in the fourth quarter, our load factor reached 87%, in line with guidance. This is approximately 20% below the comparable 2019 quarter, yet demonstrates another sequential improvement in closing the occupancy gap versus 2019. This ramp is continuing through the first quarter of 2023 as we have already achieved 100% occupancy in the quarter, leading to a return to historical levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023 and beyond.\nIn terms of pricing, Slide 10, illustrates another strong result in the pricing front with our net per diem growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, up approximately 14% on an as reported basis and up 15% in constant currency over 2019.\nTurning to Slide 11. At year-end, our cumulative book position for 2023 was within our optimal range of approximately 60% to 65%. We continue to believe this is our sweet spot as it strikes the delicate balance of encouraging guests to book early while also optimizing pricing. Full year '23 book position is now ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices.\nSince we last spoke in November, we have been pleased to see positive booking momentum continue, including a very strong wave season that likely started 2 months earlier than usual. In fact, November was a record-breaking month for Norwegian Cruise Line as they celebrate a record day, record week and record month of sales boosted by Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday push.\nSubsequently, in January, a strong start to traditional wave led the line of setting another record booking month. Our region brand also experienced a similar positive reception to it 2023 Wave offer launch, which resulted in a record launch day with net booking volume nearly 4x last year's Wave launch and 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our current cumulative book position and the strong demand dynamics that we continue to experience across our brands gives us further confidence that we can achieve our 2023 guidance, which Mark will discuss shortly in more detail.\nI'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2022 financial results, 2023 guidance and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics is on a constant currency basis.\nSlide 12 outlines key metrics highlighting our fourth quarter results, nearly all of which met or exceeded guidance. Focusing on the top line, strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, up approximately 24% versus 2019, with net per diems increasing approximately 15%, continuing the strong pricing performance we have achieved since our relaunch.\nTurning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity today was in line with expectations with the second half 2022 decreasing approximately 10% versus the first half as our operations continue to ramp up. As our 2023 guidance indicates, second half 2022 is not representative of a go-forward run rate. For the second half of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was nearly breakeven.\nWe did, however, achieve another significant milestone in the fourth quarter, generating positive adjusted free cash flow for the first time in 3 years. This represents another stepping stone as we return to a normalized operating environment.\nLooking at expectations for the full year 2023 on Slide 14. We are pleased to return to our normal cadence of providing annual and quarterly guidance. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion with the high end of our targeted range, representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.70 at the midpoint of our guidance.\nTaking a closer look at the components of this outlook, net per diem growth is expected in the range of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019. This translates to net yield for the year expected to increase in the range of 5% to 6.5%. This stellar top line performance is reflective of our go-to-market strategy and emphasis on price discipline.\nMoving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $160 for the full year. This represents a nearly 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. The key drivers of this expected decrease includes the scaling back and normalization of marketing investments, ,which were elevated in the second half of 2022 as we focused on resetting expectations and raising the bar on pricing during our relaunch, moderation in hyperinflationary pressures in certain areas, including food and logistics, normalization of capacity days as a result of the elimination of previously acquired protocols, timing and optimization of scheduled drydocks. And finally, the results of our operating efficiency and cost minimization efforts as part of our broad and ongoing margin enhancement initiative that Frank touched on.\nKeep in mind that costs are expected to sequentially trend lower over the course of the year as occupancy increases and reduction initiatives are realized, which is expected to lead to a lower cost run rate as we exit 2023 as compared to our full year guidance. As we have consistently communicated, our costs will be elevated when compared to 2019 baseline, both due to normal and hyperinflation over the past 3 to 4 years as well as a mixed headwind as we add higher operating cost capacity, which we do expect will gain a premium on the top line.\nI want to reiterate that we are committed to rightsizing our cost base and are taking deliberate actions across our business to best position us for the future as a stronger and leaner organization. There is no silver bullet, but we will continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies while continuing to deliver an exceptional guest experience. Our goal is not only to rebuild our margins, but over time, continue to enhance them, and we look forward to demonstrating this improvement over the coming quarters.\nNow let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. Compared to 2019 levels, net per diem is expected to increase approximately 6.75% to 7.75%, while net yield is expected to increase approximately 1.25% to 2.25%, primarily as a result of our continued occupancy ramp and with pricing expected to be higher for the remaining quarters of 2023. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $165 or approximately 12% below the second half of 2022.\nFirst quarter is expected to be the highest cost quarter due to lower occupancy and as actions taken in recent months to reduce costs will not yet be fully realized. When looking at our implied guidance for the remaining quarters of 2023, the expected decrease in cost is approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2022. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $195 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be a loss of approximately $0.45.\nMoving to our balance sheet. Slide 15 demonstrates the results of our deliberate and opportunistic measures to optimize our debt maturity profile. In 2023, we have approximately $1 billion of scheduled debt service, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing.\nIn recent months, we also addressed a large portion of our 2024 maturities. First, we completed an amendment of our operating credit facility and extended approximately $1.4 billion of this facility by 1 year to January 2025. Earlier this month, we took advantage of significant improvements in the bond markets to complete a refinancing transaction of the remaining nonextended term loans under the operating credit facility. We issued $600 million of new 8.375% senior secured notes due 2028 and use the proceeds to repay these term loans, allowing us to derisk and replace near-term debt maturities with longer-dated debt at only a marginally higher cost.\nAs you can see, with these actions, we have a manageable maturity profile over the course of the next few years. When you look at the totality of our debt, approximately 40% is ECA back debt. This is a unique differentiator of the cruise industry, which is part of a broader connected ecosystem, which includes, among others, the operators, the shipyards and the governments and export credit agencies, all of which rely on shipyards and suppliers for significant economic and employment related benefits. As all of our interests closely align, these partners are incredibly supportive as demonstrated by the very efficient financing we are able to secure for our new builds as well as the support they provided during the pandemic. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments, we also provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website.\nTurning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong. And just last night, we announced 2 transactions, which further enhance our liquidity and outlined on page -- on Slide 16. First, we revised and extend our existing $1 billion undrawn backstop commitment. As part of the agreement to secure a second year extension option on the commitment, the company issued $250 million of 9.75% notes due 2028. At the same time, we revised the undrawn commitment to reduce the amount to $650 million, with the agreement now extending through February 2024 with the option at our sole election to extend through 2025. We do not currently intend to draw on this commitment. And in total, the combination of these 2 actions provides the company approximately $900 million of liquidity to the bottom line.\nSecond, we also entered into a new $300 million unsecured and undrawn backstop commitment. This facility will be available to draw beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. Securing this facility provides a backstop for the remaining portion of the non-extending operating credit facility, which matures in January 2024. Pro forma for these recent transactions, our liquidity position at year-end is approximately $1.8 billion, which includes approximately $650 million under the available commitment. For housekeeping, this does not include the enhancement to future liquidity, we obtained with the $300 million undrawn commitment as it is currently not available to draw.\nBefore handling the call back -- handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate our relentless focus on executing on our medium- and long-term financial strategy as laid out on Slide 18. We will continue to be opportunistic and are committed to delivering value for all stakeholders. But most of all, we are excited to be back in full operation and once again delivering incredible vacation experiences on our 3 brands to all corners of the globe.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments.\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which Slide 19 outlines a few key highlights. Since we last spoke, we have made meaningful progress to advance our commitment to pursue net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. We successfully completed the testing of biodiesel fuel blends on 3 additional ships in our fleet, a promising potential lever to help reduce emissions on our existing fleet.\nIn addition, we recently modified our contracts to the final 2 Prima Class ships for Norwegian Cruise Line scheduled for delivery in 2027 and '28 to reconfigure these ships to accommodate green methanol and as an alternative fuel source in the future. While additional modifications will be needed in the future to fully enable the use of dual fuel, both methanol and diesel, this action reinforces our commitment to decarbonization and represents an important and exciting step forward in our pursuit of net zero.\nBefore turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 20. First, we believe we are well positioned in the current economic environment and our target upmarket consumer remains resilient. This is especially true for the all-import North American consumer from we enjoy an outsized benefit, given our strategic sourcing mix and focus on global versus national brands.\nSecond, booking momentum is positive, buoyed by a strong start to the year with wave season, and we are pleased with our book position and pricing for 2023. Third, we are focused on strengthening the foundation for sustained profitable growth, and we will continue to take strategic measures to best position the company for its next era. And lastly, our cash generation engine continues to rev up which, along with our transformational new build pipeline provides a path to meet our liquidity needs and to restore our balance sheet in the coming years.\nWe've covered quite a bit today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions.

My name is Maria, and I'll be your operator today. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President Investor Relations of ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed.\n\nJessica John\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Communications & ESG, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks.

We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release, the third quarter 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our IR website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we reached another significant achievement on our road to recovery this quarter, with a generation of positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time since the pandemic began. We have been clear about our intentional and methodical return to service strategy, consistently meeting or even exceeding the operational and financial milestones we have guided to.\nI am encouraged by our progress as each quarter has seen substantial sequential improvement in load factor with the shortfall gap continuing to narrow versus pre-pandemic levels, while our industry-leading pricing continues to hold strong. And while we are always looking for ways to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our recovery, I want to reiterate that our primary focus continues to be maximizing profitability for 2023 and beyond in a sustainable banner by prioritizing our long-term brand equity and protecting our industry-leading pricing.\nWhile the macroeconomic environment heading into 2023 remains more uncertain than usual, we see several tailwinds and catalysts to sustain our current positive trajectory as outlined on Slide 5.\nFirst, the public health regulatory COVID-related protocols continue to improve. In the past 30 to 45 days alone, key countries like Canada, Bermuda, Greece and all of South America have removed COVID testing requirements for entry and many countries in Asia have begun reopening the cruise. These developments have paved the way for us to relax our own COVID-19 protocols, allowing us to reach a wider cruising population as well as adding greater variety to high-yielding itineraries as more ports around the world become accessible to cruising.\nWith the public health environment improving, in September, our 3 brands removed mandatory vaccination requirements. And just last month, Norwegian Cruise Line took another significant step forward with the elimination of all COVID-19-related guest protocols. That means no more vaccination, testing or masking requirements on any of the Line's 18 ships, except in the very few areas around the world would still have specific COVID rules. This is a long-awaited alignment of protocols to the rest of the travel lesion hospitality industries, which reduces friction, eliminates the #1 reason for not booking a cruise and meaningfully enhances the cruise experience for our guests. Our [sales safe] program was always designed to evolve and the improvement in the public health environment along with the near elimination of intrusive protocols to remain in place allow us to uphold our #1 priority of protecting the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and the communities we visit.\nSecond, while there are heightened concerns surrounding an economic slowdown in the broader marketplace, the primary target cohort of our 3 brands, which is more upmarket and affluent than that of the cruise industry as a whole continues to demonstrate its willingness to spend on travel and experiences. In fact, you may have heard commentary from credit card issuers this earnings season about continued strong spend on travel and experiences, especially by those in higher-income categories, reinforcing the continued strength and resilience of demand for cruising, particularly among Americans. Within the cruise industry, we believe our company is well positioned to outperform if indeed the macroeconomic environment weakens. First, and as Slide 6 illustrates our dominance in the upscale space, which we participate in and not only through our Oceania and Regent brands, but also with our exclusive high-end ship within a ship concept on Norwegian with The Haven is significant. And while this cohort is not totally immune to economic downturns, it has been very resilient historically.\nIn addition, Slide 6 also demonstrates our favorable guest demographic mix which skews towards the higher end of the income spectrum as each of our brands operate at the top of their respective industry categories. The vast majority of our guests have a net worth of 250,000 plus. Again, a more resilient cohort in the event of an economic downturn particularly if the job market remains strong and the equity markets stabilize. With over 85% of our guest sourcing coming from North America, we will also benefit in the near term given our relatively low exposure to European sourcing, where the economic environment is already challenged. Long term, this bodes well for our business as North Americans have historically been the guests who booked the earliest, garnered the highest ticket price and spend the most on board. Taken together, these factors contribute to our strong book position despite current microeconomic worries and a turbulent geopolitical environment.\nLast quarter, we spoke about the 2 indicators in our business that we typically monitor to evaluate the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel. The first being the booking window, which provides a peek into the consumer's psyche about the future; and the second being our onboard revenue generation, which is our best real-time now indicator.\nBoth of these indicators continue to meet or exceed our expectations. In fact, our onboard revenue generation continues to break records as onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period.\nIn addition, our booking window in the third quarter was approximately 245 days, nearly 10% ahead of the same quarter in 2019. This is important because an elongated booking window is preferable as it provides better visibility, which allows us to increase prices sooner while moderating marketing expense.\nThe last catalyst I want to touch on is our industry-leading new build pipeline outlined on Slide 7, which we expect will enhance our brand profile and product offerings and most importantly, drive significant revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow growth.\nTurning to Slide 8. In August, we celebrated the christening of our newest ship, Norwegian Prima in Reykjavik, Iceland, the first major cruise ship christening in this historic seafaring locale. Prima has been incredibly well received with extremely positive feedback from the guests, travel partners, media and the investment community who have participated in the ship sailings so far.\nThe addition of Prima in her upcoming 5 sister ships, along with Oceania Cruises new generation Vista class ships and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur, well without a doubt, reinforced the positioning of our brands as the leaders in providing upscale experiences in each of the major cruise categories.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we have 3 new builds, one for each brand entering the fleet with over 5,000 additional berths. These new ships are expected to attract new-to-brand guests, create excitement for our loyal pass guests and contribute significantly to top and bottom line financial results.\nWith the relatively small size of our current 29-ship fleet, we are confident that we can absorb this capacity growth. Not only do we have many unserved and underserved markets around the world, but we also continue to believe that the cruise industry at large is vastly underpenetrated, especially when measured against other land-based vacation alternatives.\nTo put this point into perspective, as you can see on Slide 9, which we provided at our investor event last month, the total number of staterooms aboard our 29 ships across our 3 brands is less than 1/4 the total number of hotel rooms in Orlando, Florida alone, just one city and one single country. And even if you look at the entire cruise industry, there are fewer staterooms in the global cruise fleet of over 250 ships than there are hotel rooms in the top 3 U.S. cities for hotel capacity, which is Orlando, Las Vegas and Chicago.\nSo the opportunity to grow demand is significant. And when you couple that with the supply side of the equation where we have a high degree of visibility and a limited pipeline of new ships due to shipyard constraints, the industry and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in particular, have a strong foundation for continued growth.\nShifting our discussions now to our bookings, demand and pricing trends. As you can see on Slide 10, in the third quarter, our load factor was approximately 82%, in line with our guidance and demonstrating continued and substantial improvement over the prior quarter of 65%. We expect load factors to continue improving sequentially to the mid- to high 80% range in the fourth quarter, despite the fourth quarter historically being a seasonally lower occupancy quarter than the third quarter.\nAnd looking at our quarterly load factor in terms of the gap with 2019, third quarter occupancy was approximately 30% below the comparable 2019 period and we expect continued sequential improvement in closing this gap to about 20% during the fourth quarter. The steady occupancy ramp-up is expected to continue until we reach historical 100% plus levels beginning in the second quarter of 2023.\nIn terms of pricing, as you can see on Slide 11, our net per diem price growth in the third quarter of '22 when compared to the third quarter of 2019 was up approximately 5%. This is particularly impressive when considering the hit pricing took with the absence of premium-priced Baltic itineraries in the quarter due to the Russia Ukraine conflict. These strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy of holding firm on our core to go market strategy of market-to-fill versus discount to fill and maintaining price integrity by emphasizing high-value over low price, which you can see on Slide 12.\nI've said this before, and I will reiterate again today, given its high importance that we strongly believe that this strategy is the optimal path to continually deliver high-quality and sustainable profitability once we return to a fully normalized post-pandemic environment, which again, we expect will be in the early second quarter of 2023.\nTurning to Slide 13. As expected, our fourth quarter 2022 booked position remains below that of 2019. That said, pricing continues to be significantly higher when compared to 2019 and even when taking into consideration the dilutive effect of future cruise credit. Dilution from future cruise credits will not carry forward into 2023 as the bonus or value-add portion of certificates issued during the pandemic will expire at year-end.\nFocusing in on 2023, our full year book position is equal to 2019's record performance and our ongoing net booking pace is at the level needed to sail full beginning in the second quarter of 2023. We believe our cumulative book position is at the optimal level when balancing our desire to encourage guests to book early in order to be approximately 65% booked by year-end for the following year, while also maximizing our industry-leading pricing so as not to leave yield on the table. This volume versus price dynamic is a delicate balance that we have fine-tuned over the years using historical itinerary specific data and our sophisticated revenue management system and is key to our success.\nPricing is also significantly higher for 2023 versus the comparable 2019 period with strength seen across all 3 brands. As we have said previously, pricing naturally will level off as we fill out our book for 2023, but we continue to expect to achieve record pricing for full year 2023. As we look to the future, our entire team is mobilized, energized and ready to flawlessly execute, our eyes are wide open, and we are preparing for multiple scenarios given the current heightened uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and we are ready to adapt and pivot if needed. Our company and our industry has demonstrated its resilience time and again in the past. And I'm confident that if necessary, we will do so again.\nWe are also encouraged by the relaxation of protocols in the regulatory and public health environment, which paved the way for us to return to normal operations, and we are excited to welcome the 8 additional ships to our fleet we have on order through 2027. We will continue to be disciplined and strategic as we work to set our company up for long-term success and to maximize value for all stakeholders.\nI'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our third quarter financial results and outlook and the progress we continue to make on our path to full recovery. Slide 14 outlines key metrics highlighting our third quarter results, all of which were at or above our previous guidance.\nDuring the quarter, our load factor improved 17 points over the prior quarter to 82%, in line with the guidance previously provided. This is consistent with our phased and methodical approach to ramping up occupancies while maintaining pricing discipline as we remain on track to reach historical load factor levels for the second quarter of 2023.\nFourth quarter load factor is expected to be in the mid- to high 80% range, which, while on the surface appears only modestly higher than third quarter represents continued significant improvement when taking into account the seasonality of our operations. Strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter, up approximately 14% versus 2019 better than our expectation for a high single-digit increase. This is particularly impressive given the impact in 2022 of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced Baltic itineraries, which are heavily weighted to this quarter.\nIn addition, [fruit-related] capacity constraints on the high-yielding Pride of America were another headwind during the quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect this metric to increase by approximately 20% compared to 2019 levels.\nSlide 15 illustrates our advanced ticket sales build, which continues to indicate healthy consumer demands. Our total ATS balance stood at $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, flat versus the prior quarter's record high balance and versus the seasonal decline we typically see between the second and third quarter. On a gross basis, ATS build was $1.5 billion, consistent with the prior quarter, which was the highest level in 3 years.\nIn addition, approximately $1.6 billion of the total ATS balance at quarter end is associated with bookings that are already within the final payment window and therefore, subject to cancellation penalties, which, by definition, results in stickier bookings and lower risk of churn.\nTurning to costs. We continue to feel the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints, which is pressuring margins in the near term. As seen on Slide 16, we have opportunistically added to our fuel hedge position during the quarter and are now approximately 44% hedged for the remainder of '22 and approximately 38% hedged for 2023. We continue to expect adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day to decrease approximately 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half.\nGiven our ongoing ramp up, second half costs are not representative of a go-forward run rate, in part due to the additional demand-generating marketing investments as we lay the foundation for 2023 which we expect will normalize closer to historical levels on a capacity adjusted basis beginning next year.\nIn addition, we are starting to see some moderation of the hyperinflation we have seen in areas of late -- in areas such as food costs and related. Looking ahead to 2023, net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity, they will exceed 2019 levels as anticipated due to both normal and hyperinflation over the past 3 to 4 years. However, we are laser-focused on managing our cost base and our entire team is focused on mitigating this impact by increasing efficiencies and rightsizing the business all while still preserving the exceptional guest experience our brands are known for.\nTo help with modeling, we have also provided additional guidance on key metrics like capacity days, revenue expectations, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures, all of which can be found on Slide 17 and in our earnings release.\nShifting to our financial performance. Slide 18 demonstrates our continued momentum and consistency in achieving key milestones. Last quarter, we generated operating cash flow for the first full quarter since the beginning of the pandemic. And this quarter, we are pleased to report positive adjusted EBITDA of approximately $28 million. The next step forward is our expectation to achieve adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter. We have been clear throughout our return to service that this will not be an overnight lift the switch process, particularly given our intense focus on best positioning our company to maximize profitability once we return to a fully normalized operating environment. On our current trajectory, each of these building blocks are expected to lead to record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023.\nMoving to liquidity and our balance sheet on Slide 19. Our overall liquidity position remains strong totaling approximately $2.2 billion at quarter end, consisting of cash of approximately $1.2 billion and the undrawn $1 billion commitment. Keep in mind that during the third quarter, we took delivery of Norwegian Prima, which resulted in a cash outlay, partially offset by incremental ECA ship financing.\nBased on our current projections, and trajectory, we continue to believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs organically.\nSlide 20 demonstrates the result of our deliberate measures throughout the pandemic to optimize our debt maturity profile, which positions us well as we ramp up to a normal operating environment. For the remainder of 2022 and for the full year '23, we have approximately $300 million and $1 billion of debt payments coming due, respectively. The vast majority of which are related to our low-cost export credit agency-backed ship financing. We have previously disclosed that we are in the process of extending our operating credit facility, consisting of our revolver and term loan A which mature in early 2024, and we are on track to complete this by year-end.\nUpon completion, we expect to have a relatively smooth maturity profile over the course of the next few years. For additional detail on the breakdown of upcoming debt payments through 2027, we provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website. Our total debt portfolio is approximately 75% fixed rate today. And this is expected to increase to approximately 80% by year-end 2023, with the addition of 3 new builds next year, which positions us well in a rising rate environment.\nTurning to Slide 21. In addition to maximizing our current fleet, our expected future earnings growth from today's normalized levels will be fueled by the transformational growth profile we already have in the pipeline, representing a 50% growth in capacity versus 2019 levels.\nAs Frank touched on, we welcome this new capacity given our company and more broadly, the cruise industry's under penetration within the larger leisure landscape. Our new ships have a very favorable and efficient financing structure locked in at the time of contract which results in an expected immediate boost to profitability once they enter service.\nFor all new builds on order, our financing is committed at fixed rates averaging approximately 2.5% over the portfolio. Another important component of our newbuild pipeline is that well prior to a ship delivery, we are already receiving significant cash flows in the form of advanced ticket sales and presale of onboard revenue streams. This typically equates to roughly $100 million to $150 million of cash inflow from future bookings prior to a vessel's first revenue sailing essentially resulting in a cash infusion into the business that continues to build over time as final payments for future voyages also become due.\nBefore handing the call back to Frank, I want to reiterate that while we are proud of the tremendous progress we have made to date, we are not taking our foot off the gas and are relentlessly focused on executing our medium- and long-term financial strategy as laid out on Slide 22. We are keeping a close watch on the macroeconomic environment and are preparing to adapt to any potential scenario, but we are confident we are taking the right steps to set up our company for a successful future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Frank for closing comments.\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which Slide 23 outlines key accomplishments and milestones.\nSince we last spoke, we continue to advance our commitment to pursue net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We successfully completed the testing of a biodiesel fuel blend on Regent Seven Seas Splendor in October, and we announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with MAN Energy Solutions to conduct a feasibility study and retrofitting an existing engine to operate with dual-fuels, diesel and methanol. We will continue to evaluate a variety of alternative fuels and share learnings with other companies as we collectively try to find a viable long-term solution.\nIn September, after Hurricane Ian had a devastating impact to our neighbors in Southwest Florida, we responded as quickly and as generously as we could and donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross to assist in emergency relief efforts. We also committed to matching donations from team members, business partners, travel agents and concerned guests and others in our network up to an additional $100,000.\nAnd before turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 24. First, we believe we are very well positioned in the current economic environment given NCLH's unique drivers, which have allowed us to excel financially in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\nSecond, we are hitting our targets and reaching key milestones in our path back to normalcy. We are focused on laying the foundation for long-term sustainable profitability for 2023 and beyond.\nThird, our target upmarket consumer continues to hold strong, which is reflected in our excellent book position and significantly higher pricing for '23 as well as our impressive onboard revenue performance.\nAnd lastly, our cash generation engine has revved up, which, along with our new build pipeline provides a clear path for return to meaningful profitability and a deleveraging of our balance sheet in the coming years.\nWe've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude right now with our commentary and open the call for your questions.

My name is Darryl, and I will be your operator. (Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder to all participants, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications.\nMs. John, please proceed.\n\nJessica John\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Communications & ESG, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Darryl, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFrank will begin the call with opening commentary. After which, Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions.\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with second quarter 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website.\nThis call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nOver the past several quarters, we have reached many pivotal milestones as we continue the steady march of our post-pandemic recovery. On our last call, we had just welcomed the last ship in our fleet back to service, becoming the first major cruise operator to be fully operational. This quarter, we are pleased to report that we have reached another key milestone with operating cash flow turning positive for the second quarter. While our focus is on our profitable future, when I take a moment to reflect on the tremendous progress we have made since launching our Great Cruise Comeback just over a year ago, I can't help but be immensely proud of the entire team in Norwegian for rising to the occasion time and again and delivering impressive results.\nWorking well alongside us has been the travel agent community who more than anyone can appreciate the challenges that we as an industry have overcome, and more importantly, can also see the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We thank them for their unyielding support throughout this journey.\nWe have been disciplined and methodical in our ramp-up and have maintained a clear and consistent mindset focused on our core market strategy of market to fill and emphasizing value over price by continuing to expand and refine our bundling strategy. Our guiding principle has been a focus on the long-term profitability of the company, particularly for 2023 and beyond, by protecting our long-term brand equity and building on our industry-leading pricing. This means making intentional tactical sacrifices in the short term in favor of long-term sustainable results.\nWith this ethos at the forefront of our business plan, we also continue to be opportunistic, exploring all options to accelerate our recovery. As I serve in the current landscape, I see several tailwinds and catalysts for our company, which are outlined on Slide 4. First, since we last spoke, we have seen further improvement in the public health and regulatory environments, which has allowed us to relax COVID-related protocols and align us more to the rest of the hospitality industry. Last month, the CDC discontinued its voluntary COVID-19 program for cruise ships. This was a strong signal of confidence by the CDC that the industry's COVID-19 mitigation and management plans are robust and effective. This very positive development has paved the way for us to begin removing barriers for our guests. We're committed by local regulations, bringing us not quite an equal footing with land-based vacation and leisure alternatives, but significantly closer.\nJust yesterday, we announced a number of changes to our own health and safety protocols, which are effective September 3, and as always, are subject to local regulations. We will no longer have a mandatory vaccination requirement in any of our ships and have relaxed testing protocols regardless of sailing length. To put it simply, vaccinated individuals, including those embarking on NCLH ships from U.S. ports, will no longer have any pre-cruise-related protocols. And those who are unvaccinated or choose not to provide proof of vaccination will be required to test negative within 72 hours prior to embarkation.\nIn addition, all guests 11 years old and younger will be exempt from vaccination and testing requirements of any kind. There remain a few jurisdictions with strict requirements, including Canada, Greece and Bermuda where we will continue to comply with local mandates. These modifications or protocols are meaningful and give us additional flexibility to reach a wider cruising population, reduce friction and travel-related hassles for our guests and bring greater variety to our itineraries. In fact, yesterday's announcement was an instant catalyst, resulting in 1 of our top 3 best booking days of the year.\nOur top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and communities we visit. And this commitment to -- is unwavering even as we are evolving our SailSAFE protocols to adapt to the changing public health environment.\nAcross the globe, we continue to see the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of ports to cruise, bringing us closer to a normal operating environment. One significant example of this easing is the lifting in June of the onerous 1-day testing requirement to enter the U.S. While the decision was too late to have a meaningful impact on ship sailing in a second, and to a lesser degree, third quarters of this year. The change resulted in an immediate and sustained boost in booking volumes for future periods in the weeks following the announcement. Second, and despite recession and economic slowdown fears abounding in the broad marketplace, we continue to see a strong upmarket consumer, with booking trends continuing to show steady improvement week-over-week, which I will touch on in more detail later in the call.\nBut at a high level, to evaluate the extent and willingness of consumers to spend on cruise travel, we typically monitor 2 key indicators. First is the booking window, which provides a peek into the consumer psyche about the future, given that cruise is a long lead time and relatively high ticket purchase. To be clear, we have not seen any cracks emerge in the dynamics of the booking window. And it remains both within historical range and our own expectations. Second is our onboard revenue generation, which is a real-time now indicator of how our guests are feeling about their financial situation right now and while onboard our ships.\nOnboard revenue generation has continued to be impressive, even as we continue to ramp up occupancy carrying more guests across all ships and cabin classes. In the second quarter, onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was approximately 30% higher than during the comparable 2019 period. We continue to focus on enhancing our market-leading bundled offerings and increasing quality touch points with our guests starting from the time of booking to capture even more revenue pre-cruise, allowing guests to arrive on board with an ever fresher wallet, which ultimately results in higher overall spend. In fact, our pre-cruise revenue on a per passenger day basis for second quarter '22 is up over 50% versus 2019 levels. At a high level, guests who make pre-cruise purchases tend to spend approximately double that of guests who do not pre-book onboard activities.\nAnd while the broader economy has experienced a pullback in consumer spending for physical goods, we continue to see strong propensity for spending on travel and experiences, particularly from the affluent consumer. Hotel average daily rates and airline fares remain at or near record levels, with occupancies reaching pandemic peaks.\nConsumers want a vacation even during economic downturns. And we believe cruises are much better positioned than land-based alternatives to capture the strong demand given our unmatched value proposition.\nWhile consumer appetite for experiences bodes well to the entire cruise industry, we believe our company in particular is best positioned to outperform in this environment. Our 3 brands focus on providing upscale experiences relative to their respective industry categories, and therefore, skewed towards the higher-end consumer, which while not immune, have proven more resilient than other cohorts in previous downturns. And all indications are that the intent to travel for this demographic has not abated.\nThe last and arguably most exciting catalyst I want to touch on is our attractive pipeline of new builds, outlined on Slide 5, which will greatly enhance our already world-class fleet and drive significant contributions to the top and bottom line. I just came back from Italy last week where we took delivery of Norwegian Prima, the first of 6 next-generation Norwegian Cruise Line ships, bringing our total fleet to 29 vessels with approximately 62,000 berths. We are excited to celebrate her christening ceremony later this month in Reykjavik, Iceland. And I encourage all of you to experience her firsthand as she is truly incredible. In fact, our shipbuilding partners, Fincantieri, has said Prima is the clients' most demanding and most complex vessel they have ever built. The Prima Class marks an evolution for Norwegian Cruise Line as every aspect of the design and guests' experience has been elevated.\nLast week, we also celebrate the float-out Norwegian Viva, the second vessel in this groundbreaking new class, which is expected to debut in summer of 2023, as seen on Slide 6. The Prima Class will further differentiate Norwegian Cruise Lines compared to our cruise peers and reinforce the positioning of our brands as the leaders in providing upscale experiences in each of the major cruise categories.\nIn addition to the new Norwegian vessels, we are also gearing up for the delivery of Oceania Vista in spring of '23 and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur later that year. These new additions will further add to our dominance in the flourishing upper premium and luxury segments.\nI often get asked whether we are confident that we can profitably absorb the capacity growth we are expecting for the next few years. And the answer is a resounding yes. Given our relatively small base of only 29 ships, we still have many unserved and underserved markets around the world. We are continually innovating and enhancing our product offerings through our new builds and refurbishment upgrades to our existing fleet and making enhancements to our bundled offering to provide even more value and attract even more high-paying guests to our brands.\nI can't emphasize this enough. So I will show you once again on Slide 7, how we've proven our ability over the years to absorb capacity and deliver outsized revenue, adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow contributions relative to our capacity growth, and we fully expect to continue this trend.\nTurning now to our booking demand and pricing trends summarized on Slide 8. We continue to see sequential improvement as we remain disciplined and focused on laying the foundation for a record 2023 and beyond. In the second quarter, our load factor was approximately 65%, in line with our expectations and a significant improvement versus the prior quarter of 48%. We expect load factors to increase to the low 80% range in the third quarter, with July already coming in at 85%. This steady sequential ramp is expected to continue until we reach historical 100%-plus levels beginning for the second quarter of 2023.\nIn terms of pricing, as you can see on Slide 9, our Net Per Diem growth in the first half of 2022 over the first half of 2019 pricing was significant at 18%.\nThese results are consistent with our strategy of holding firm on our go-to-market strategy, outlined on Slide 10, of market to fill versus discount to fill and maintaining pricing integrity by emphasizing high value over low price. We absolutely believe this is the optimal path to continually deliver high-quality and sustainable profitability once we return to a fully normalized environment post-pandemic.\nAs expected, our second half 2022 book position remains below, an extraordinarily strong 2019, driven primarily by the lasting impacts of Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. That said, pricing for the second half of 2022 continues to be higher when compared to 2019, even when taking into consideration of the dilutive effect of future cruise credits and the impact of premium priced Baltic itineraries from the Ukraine conflict, which is primarily concentrated in the third quarter. As we move beyond this transition year and focus on 2023, our full year book position is in line with 2019's record performance. And our booking pace in recent weeks has reached the level needed to consistently sail full.\nPricing is also significantly higher for 2023. And while we typically would not provide this level of detail, our performance in this area is so extraordinary that I just had to share it with you this one time. Pricing for 2023 is currently running in excess of 20% above 2019's record pricing and is higher by double digits across all 3 brands. And while pricing will naturally tend to level off as we continue to build our book for 2023, it is nevertheless a testament that our steadfast strategy of focusing on long-term price increases over short-term load factors is indeed working as intended.\nAnother onetime proof point that I will provide is ticket sales already on the books for 2023 sailings. When compared to the same time in 2018 for 2019 sailings and taking into account capacity growth of approximately 20%, 2023 sales are a whopping 40% higher. In addition, the quality and stickiness of our ticket sales for '23 sailings is also expected to improve, as a significantly higher proportion of bookings, 4x the level seen in 2019, include air travel booked through our own air program, which in the past has proven to be indeed stickier.\nAnother positive indicator demonstrating strong consumer demand is our advanced ticket sales bill. As you can see on Slide 11, our advanced ticket sales balance stood at $2.5 billion as of the end of the second quarter, up over $300 million versus the prior quarter despite approximately $1 billion of revenue recognized. This represents an all-time record-high ATS balance for the company. On a gross basis, advanced ticket sales build increased by over 40% to $1.5 billion in the quarter, the highest level in 3 years. In addition, approximately $1.5 billion of the total ATS balance at quarter end is associated with bookings that are already within the final payment window, and therefore, subject to cancellation penalties.\nThe bottom line is that our entire team is more energized now than ever before. We are striving to reach our goal of record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA in 2023, welcoming 8 additional ships to our fleet through 2027 after Prima this year and leveraging all opportunities to maximize value for our stakeholders. This will not be an easy feat, especially as we continue to navigate an uncertain macroeconomic, but an increasingly encouraging public health and regulatory environment. We are prepared for all scenarios. And I'm confident that we are taking the right steps today to set us up for future success.\nI'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone.\nBefore I begin my commentary on our financial results and outlook, I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank our team of nearly 35,000 team members across the globe for their continued dedication, passion and commitment to excellence. Their collective efforts are propelling us forward as we continue to execute on our operational and financial recovery plan. We have made tremendous progress to date, which has led to the significant financial inflection point of generating positive operating cash flow in the quarter for the first time since the start of the pandemic.\nTurning to our second quarter results. During the quarter, we returned our full fleet back to service with the relaunch of Norwegian Spirit in early May. Our load factor for the quarter was 65%, in line with our prior guidance, which reflects our methodical approach to ramping up occupancy while maximizing pricing.\nNumerous sailings across key regions and markets achieved over 90% and 100% occupancy, with particular strength in recent months in the Caribbean and Bermuda markets. We continue to expect sequential quarterly increases in occupancies, with load factors returning to historical levels for the second quarter of 2023.\nStrong ticket pricing and onboard revenue generation drove total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter up approximately 20% versus 2019. As we look to the third quarter, we expect this metric to increase by high single digits compared to 2019 levels. This is impressive considering the impact in 2022 of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on premium-priced European, in particular, Baltic, itineraries, which are heavily weighted to the third quarter. As a reminder, 3 ships were redeployed entirely as a result of the conflict, including one for each brand, and a total of 60 sailings across our fleet were canceled or modified. In addition, crew-related capacity constraints on the high-yielding Pride of America are a further headwind to overcome.\nTurning to costs. Like every company across the globe, we continue to experience pressures from inflation and global supply chain constraints. Fuel prices remain a headwind, but our hedge program, as seen on Slide 12, provides partial protection. And more recently, we have also seen prices beginning to moderate. We have opportunistically added to our hedge position during the quarter and are now approximately 40% hedged for the remainder of '22 and approximately 30% for 2023.\nWe are also experiencing pressure on food costs, although we have recently seen green shoots, prices moderating for certain commodities, such as beef and pork. In addition, we are starting to see shipping and logistical costs moderating from their highs experienced in 2021 and early '22. Our supply chain and logistics teams continue to work around the clock to find measures to minimize this impact.\nLastly, in the first half of 2022, we continued to incur additional costs associated with our COVID-19 health and safety protocols, primarily related to testing. As the industry continues to align its protocols with the broader travel and leisure space, we expect these costs to ramp down in the future.\nTaken together, we expect adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, to decrease approximately 10% in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. Guided by our core market to fill strategy, we will continue to make disciplined demand-generating investments in marketing in the near term, with a focus on laying the foundation for a strong 2023.\nLooking ahead, while it is still too early to provide concrete guidance, we expect net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, in 2023 to exceed 2019 levels. Aside from the fact of 3 or 4 years of both normal and now hyperinflation, remember that we have the youngest fleet of the major operators. We have not disposed of any ships during the pandemic, and therefore, will not receive the unit cost benefit from the removal of less efficient capacity. To help with modeling, we have also provided additional guidance on key metrics, like capacity days, revenue expectations depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures. All of which can be found on Slide 13.\nShifting to our financial performance. Slide 14 lays out the key financial milestones already achieved as well as our expectations for the upcoming quarters. As previously stated, we generated approximately $260 million of operating cash flow for the second quarter after first turning positive for the month of March. Given that just over a year ago, we were just beginning the herculean task of returning our ships to service after 500 days on the sidelines, this is no small accomplishment. The next milestone we are aiming to achieve is slightly positive adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2022, leading to positive adjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter. All of these stepping stones are consistent with our return to service plan and position us extremely well for 2023, where a return to a more normal operating environment, along with our focus on pricing discipline, is expected to lead to record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for the full year.\nMoving to liquidity and our balance sheet. Our overall liquidity position remains strong, totaling approximately $2.9 billion at quarter end, which consisted of cash of approximately $1.9 billion and an undrawn $1 billion commitment. This existing $1 billion commitment, originally entered into in November 2021, was recently extended through March 2023. We have been clear that we view this facility as a backstop, and we currently do not intend to draw on it. However, given the volatility in the capital markets in recent months, we felt extending the facility was the prudent choice to enhance our financial flexibility. Based on our current projections and trajectory, we continue to believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs organically.\nSlide 15 demonstrates the result of the proactive and deliberate measures we undertook throughout the pandemic to optimize our debt maturity profile. We resumed debt amortization payments in April, which were previously deferred during the pandemic. For the remainder of 2022 and for full year 2023, we have approximately $500 million and $900 million of debt payments coming due, respectively. The vast majority of which is related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. While on the surface, 2024 maturities appear high, approximately $2.4 billion is related to our operating credit facility, consisting of our revolver and Term Loan A. Both of which we expect to refinance well prior to maturity. This positions us well as we continue to ramp up and return to a more normal operating environment. For additional detail on the breakdown of our upcoming debt payments through 2027, we also provide a detailed schedule on our Investor Relations website.\nAfter taking delivery of Prima less than 2 weeks ago, with fixed rate financing that was secured back in 2017, our debt portfolio is approximately 75% fixed rate today. This fixed rate -- fixed ratio is expected to increase to approximately 80% by year-end 2023, with the addition of 3 new builds next year, positioning us well in a rising rate environment. The weighted average cost of debt for the portfolio is approximately 5%. We took out, as a reminder, all of the high-cost double-digit debt we incurred during the pandemic at an opportune time prior to the current dislocation we are seeing in the markets by completing balance sheet optimization transactions in November '21 and February 2022.\nTurning to Slide 16. As I've said this before and will repeat it today, we believe the transformational growth we have in the pipeline over the next few years, representing 50% growth in capacity by 2027 as compared to 2019, is an underappreciated component of our company's investment thesis. Our new ships have very favorable and efficient financing structures, resulting in an expected and immediate boost to profitability. For all new builds on order, our financing is committed at fixed rates averaging approximately 2.5% over the portfolio.\nTo help you better understand the mechanics of the cash inflows and outflows associated with the new ship, Slide 17 lays out an illustrative scenario demonstrating the typical timeline. In general, approximately 20% of the ships cost is due in 4 installments tied to various milestones preconstruction beginning at contract signing. Typically, 80% of the cost is then due upon taking delivery of the ship. However, while this looks like a large capital expenditure outlay in the financial statements, we also received very efficient export credit agency-backed financing at the same time.\nThis ECA-backed financing covers approximately 80% of the ship cost, which, as I mentioned earlier, is committed prior to contract signing and at extremely attractive rates. In certain cases, we also structure predelivery financing in order to better map the timing of cash flows. Amortization payments on this deck began 6 months after delivery of each vessel and continue over 12 years.\nAn often overlooked but incredibly important facet in the cash flow mechanics of a new build time line is that well prior to a delivery of a vessel, we are already receiving significant cash inflows in the form of advanced ticket sales and onboard presales. Given that final payments from our guests are typically due 120 days prior to a sailing, this is when the cash engine begins to come to life.\nAs a rough estimate, we typically receive in the range of $100 million to $150 million of cash inflow from future bookings prior to a vessel's first revenue sailing, resulting in a cash infusion into the business that continues to build over time as final payments for future voyages also become due. So while we often hear concerns surrounding the industry's capacity growth, we welcome and are excited for new capacity we have coming online. We have a high degree of visibility into the supply chain, supply pipeline for the industry, with only 4 major shipyards globally who can build cruise ships of scale. This, coupled with the incredibly efficient cost and financing structure of the new builds are a unique differentiator for us and the industry at large.\nSo in summary, I am pleased with the progress we have made so far, but more importantly, how we have positioned our company for the future. While there continue to be challenges facing our business and we are keeping a close eye on how the macroeconomic environment evolves, we also have significant tailwinds, including a continued post-pandemic return to normalcy and the industry-leading capacity growth that I just discussed. All of which bode well for our future prospects.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Frank for closing comments.\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark.\nAnd before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which Slide 18 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. Since we last spoke, we published our second annual comprehensive ESG report and SASB align disclosure on World Oceans Day in June. The report highlights our progress and commitments on our top ESG priorities. As we strive to provide critical transparency to our stakeholders this year, we focused on expanding and improving the data disclosed in our report, including expanding Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions reporting, providing climate risk and resiliency data through our TCFD assessment, and strengthening human capital disclosure, including with data related to diversity as well as training and development. We also increased the scope of our third-party assurance to include many of these new data points.\nEarlier this year, we also announced that we are pursuing net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This ambition spans our entire operation and value chain as we aim to bring all of our key partners along with us on this important journey. As we have said previously, a key driver to achieve our net zero ambition is the development of alternative fuels along with the associated critical infrastructure at destinations globally to support the creation, distribution, storage and usage of these fuels. Methanol is one of the fuels we are actively exploring. And we recently joined the Methanol Institute to collaborate, share and adapt solutions alongside the institute's members of methanol producers, distributors and technology providers. We will continue to evaluate a variety of alternative fuels and share learnings with other companies as we collectively try to find a viable long-term solution.\nAnd before I turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways that you can find on Slide 19.\nFirst, we continue to execute on our return to service plan and are achieving key milestones as a return to normalcy. The improving public health and regulatory environment, including our recent relaxation of testing and vaccination protocols, are a tailwind. And our entire team is focused on setting the stage for long-term sustainable profitability in '23 and beyond.\nSecond, we are seeing a strong consumer with a healthy desire to spend on travel and experiences, particularly in the upscale demographics, our brands' target. This strength is demonstrated by our improving booking trends, robust pricing and strong onboard revenue generation.\nLastly, we are excited for the transformational and highly profitable growth we have in store over the next 5 years as we welcome 8 additional ships to our fleet after Norwegian Prima.\nWe've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions.

My name is Rob, and I'll be your operator. (Operator Instructions) Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for the session will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder to all participants, this call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed.\n\nJessica John\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Communications & ESG, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings and business update call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Frank will begin the call with opening commentary, after which, Mark will follow to discuss our financials before handing the call back to Frank for closing remarks. We will then open the call for your questions.\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2022 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.\nOur comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the last few days, our company marked a significant milestone, if not the most significant milestone thus far in our Great Cruise Comeback. This past Saturday, Norwegian Spirit welcomed guests for the first time since our fleetwide pause in operations back in March of 2020. And in doing so, she became the final ship in our 28-ship fleet to return to service, making Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings the first major cruise operators that have all its ships operating again.\nThe last 2 years and certainly the last few months have been challenging to say the least. But with each new challenge in a row to further complicate an already colossal undertaking, the team at Norwegian stepped up to the plate time and again to demonstrate our extraordinary resilience, dedication and passion. So I want to thank each and every team member across our organization, from shipboard to shore side, for all their efforts to reach this point and our Great Cruise Comeback and position our company to thrive in the years to come.\nEven more impressive was our team's ability to drive some of the highest guest satisfaction scores ever, ticket revenue and onboard spend in our history, and this trend has persisted even as we ramp up occupancy, carrying more guests across all brands, all itineraries and in all cabin classes. We have reached this milestone with a clear, consistent and focused strategy throughout our relaunch, ensuring that we do not prioritize short-term gains at the expense of jeopardizing our long-term brand equity and industry-leading pricing in the process.\nFirst, we have prioritized the health, safety and well-being of our guests, crew and the communities we visit above all else, doing everything possible to create a safe and healthy experience for all stakeholders. Since launching our Great Cruise Comeback, we have carried over 500,000 guests, and we continue to experience significantly lower COVID incidence rates aboard our ships as compared to the population at large, indicating that our health and safety protocols are indeed working as designed.\nSecond, and throughout the pandemic, we provided steadfast support, both to our guests and travel partners, focusing on doing the right thing and demonstrating our willingness to go to great lengths to support them. And I don't think this commitment has gone unnoticed. I firmly believe that as we exit the pandemic, our 3 brands will be in better standing than ever before with these key partners, the travel public at large and with our key past guests.\nAnd lastly, we have stood firm on our core go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill and maintaining price integrity by emphasizing value over price. You have heard me say time and time again that we will not sacrifice our industry-leading pricing to temporarily bolster our load factors, and I continue to stand behind that philosophy. Pricing will be the primary driver to net yield growth. As we exit the pandemic and return to a normalized booking performance, this outperformance will be key. And given that consistent net yield growth is the single most important factor in maximizing high-quality and sustainable profitability, this is an area where we will not compromise our efforts.\nSo while our first quarter load factors were somewhat tempered, our net per diem growth over first quarter of 2019 record pricing was, as shown on Slide 5, significant. A trade-off and an outcome that is much more meaningful for the company's long-term success. Now you don't have to take my word for it, our pre-pandemic track record of stellar net yield outperformance year after year speaks for itself.\nAs you can see on Slide 6, in 2019, our net yields were better than our peers by somewhere between 20% to 40%. This historical outperformance, coupled with the strong pricing we are experiencing for all future periods are evidence that our strategy is a superior one, and the best way to protect our brand's equity while driving long-term shareholder value. Taking a step back to serve the broader landscape, today, we find ourselves in a much more favorable public health regulatory and demand environment than when we last spoke a little over 2 months ago. We have witnessed a continued relaxation of COVID-related protocols across the globe from air travel to concerts and other indoor activities, and this time around, the cruise industry is an active participant.\nFirst, we are pleased that in late March, the CDC entirely removed its travel health notices for cruise, representing a significant step towards leveling the playing field between cruise and our land-based counterparts. In addition, the CDC continues to modify elements of its voluntary framework for cruise, relaxing certain requirements, the most recent of which includes reducing required vaccination thresholds from 95% to 90%, which further opens up the important family market to cruising.\nSecond, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen an acceleration in the reopening of society to pre-pandemic normalcy, which bodes well for the travel and leisure sector overall. More ports around the world have opened to cruise and we have seen travel restrictions relax in many areas. And while there are still regions where discussions to reopen to cruise are ongoing, particularly certain countries in Asia, the good news is that we do not have ships sailing in those regions until fourth quarter, giving us additional time to monitor the situation, plan for various outcomes and be ready to adapt as needed.\nAnd lastly, we are seeing an explosive showing by consumers, particularly American consumers. Consumer spend is strong, snapping back and even exceeding where we left off in 2019. Gone are the days where the family budget was going to antibacterial wipes, hand sanitizer, delivery apps, stationary bikes and streaming services. Consumers today are spending to catch up on over 2 years of missed experiences. One example of this that we see every day is hotel ADRs and airline fares, which are at or near record levels. And now with our full fleet back up and running in our industry's overwhelming advantage in its value proposition over land-based options, we, along with the entire cruise industry, are well positioned to capitalize on this pent-up demand.\nWhile the public health environment improved over the course of the quarter, the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict did cause additional disruptions across the world and to our business, as you can see on Slide 7. First and foremost, we continue to hope for a peaceful resolution, which minimizes further impact for those in the region. Our motto is family first and as such, we have focused on assisting our impacted shipboard and shoreside team members as best we can. We have activated our crew relief fund and are providing logistical, communication and mental health support to affected team members. In addition, we also provided a sizable donation to Save the Children of Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund and invited partners, including guests, travel partners and team members to contribute as well.\nPrior to the conflict, approximately 10% of our annual capacity across our 3 brands was scheduled to sail in the Baltic region, with approximately 5% calling on St. Petersburg, Russia. We subsequently canceled or modified approximately 60 sailings, which included all calls to ports in Russia for 2022. And in a move that demonstrates one of the unique strengths of our industry, we quickly redeployed 3 ships scheduled to operate in the region to sail alternate itineraries. Oceania's Marina, Regent's Seven Seas Mariner, will remain in Europe sailing British Isles and Northern European itineraries, respectively.\nMeanwhile, Norwegian Getaway was redeployed to Port Canaveral to take advantage of pent-up close-in domestic demand, which despite the condensed booking window, has already meaningfully exceeded our occupancy expectations. And in a preemptive measure, our 3 brands will pause all calls to Russia from their 2023 and 2024 itineraries. While this is not an ideal scenario, we are once again demonstrating our ability to pivot as needed and respond to exogenous events.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We shift today's discussions to our broader booking and demand trends. Overall, we continue to experience sequentially improving underlying demand and robust pricing for all future periods. The Omicron surge in December and January did indeed impact net booking momentum, with the vast majority of cancellations concentrated for close-in sailings. The tide began to turn in mid-January, when net booking volumes began to show week-over-week improvement. As bookings regained momentum, we experienced another temporary setback with the emergence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This impact was also short lived and was mainly concentrated on the Baltic region, with some leakage to surrounding Mediterranean sailings with cancellations returning to pre-conflict levels by the end of the first quarter.\nOverall net booking volumes have continued to improve sequentially, returning to and recently surpassing pre-micron levels and currently at levels approaching the pace needed to consistently sail at historical pre-pandemic load factors. As a result of the impact from Omicron and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, second half 2022 book position is not below an extraordinarily strong 2019. As we look further out in the year, the picture improved sequentially with book position in the fourth quarter remaining in line with 2019.\nMore importantly, cumulative full year 2023 book position is ahead of 2019 and ahead of pre-pandemic 2020 at a comparable point in the booking curve. On the all-important pricing front, as mentioned earlier, our go-to-market strategy of marketing to fill versus discounting to fill and emphasizing value over price is paying off in droves, with pricing meaningfully higher for all future periods when compared to the comparable pre-pandemic periods.\nThis holds true even when including the dilutive impact of future cruise credits in 2022, which, as a reminder, will no longer be a headwind in 2023 as FCCs must be applied to sailings through year-end 2022. As the booking environment improves, we will continue our strategic marketing efforts in order to further stoke demand to obtain quality, high-priced and high-value bookings.\nWith each month that goes by, our recovery trajectory becomes a little clearer. 2022 is no doubt a transition year. But as I look towards 2023, I'm excited by the full potential the future holds. We are still operating in an uncertain environment. And if we've learned anything, it's that a return to normalcy will certainly not happen overnight and possibly not without additional bumps in the road. But with each passing day, I'm increasingly confident that we are reaching the milestones needed to propel us forward in this recovery.\nWe are doing everything in our control to position us for sustained long-term success and we are laying the foundation needed to set the company up for an extremely strong year in 2023 and beyond. From where we sit today and without another black swan event derailing our plans, there is a reasonable and clear path to reach record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA levels in 2023, boosted by the introduction of 4 new ships across our 3 brands over the next 18 months, a goal our entire team is focused on achieving.\nAs just mentioned, a key component to this future success will be our industry-leading growth profile, with 9 new ships coming online across our 3 brands through 2027. The first of these ships, Norwegian Prima will join our fleet in just a few short months, as you can see on Slide 9. After her record sales debut in May of 2021, her booking volumes continue to be stellar and her pricing significantly outpacing our past new ship launches.\nIn March, we announced that pop icon Katy Perry will serves as godmother to Prima and will be the headline entertainer at her christening ceremony in Reykjavik, Iceland. This announcement garnered significant media coverage, further building on the excitement surrounding Prima and allowing us to reach a new-to-cruise audience.\nAs we look to next year, 2023 will be the first year that each of our brands will be welcoming new capacity, the addition of Norwegian Viva, Oceania Cruise's Vista and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur to our fleet. These new hardware introductions are a meaningful driver, not only in net yield growth and overall profitability, but also in attracting new guests to our brands and reigniting loyal past guests to enjoy new and elevated experiences. They also have historically had a significant halo effect in the rest of our fleet.\nNeedless to say, I'm ready and eager to begin welcoming these additional premium capacity to our fleet, which we expect will be meaningful contributors to our top and bottom line financial results. I'll be back with closing comments a little later. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark Kempa for his commentary on our financial position. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my commentary on our financial results and outlook, I would like to take a moment to express my sincere thanks to our truly top-notch team for the successful execution of our return to service plan. Their hard work, collaboration and innovative spirit are unmatched, and their efforts have been critical to getting us to the significant milestone, with all ships now officially back to revenue service.\nTurning to the first quarter results, strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue spend drove positive contribution from the fleet that operated in the quarter despite headwinds we faced from the Omicron variant. During the quarter, we canceled approximately 60 sailings due to Omicron-related operational disruptions from additional travel restrictions, increased health and safety protocols and port closures. This impact, coupled with our focus on maintaining price integrity for the long term, resulted in slightly lower than anticipated load factors in the quarter. However, pricing remained robust in the quarter, and onboard spend per person per day continues to be up meaningfully versus record 2019 levels.\nLooking ahead, load factors are also improving sequentially each month, and we expect second quarter load factors to come in at approximately 65%. This will continue to build throughout the year, and we expect to reach historical load factor levels in the first half of 2023, and at record pricing, staying consistent with our go-to-market strategy and protecting the long-term pricing strength of our brands. In addition, we are experiencing an uptick in bookings for close-in sailings, which not only help organically boost near-term load factors, but more importantly are a positive indicator that consumer confidence is building as these bookings are typically within the cancellation penalty period.\nTurning to our financial performance. Slide 10 lays out our expectations for upcoming key financial milestones. In March, we reached a significant inflection point in our financial recovery, with operating cash flow turning slightly positive for the month ahead of our previous projections, which we expect will continue throughout the second quarter. This momentum should continue to gain steam as we progress through the year with both positive operating cash flow and positive adjusted EBITDA expected for the second half of 2022. This sets us up nicely to achieve our goal of record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023.\nMoving to Slide 11. Our cash balance for the quarter increased by approximately $390 million on a net basis to $2.1 billion. This reflects $1.1 billion of cash burn associated with operations, including interest and capital expenditures, partially offset by nearly $600 million of advanced ticket sale collections and other working capital changes. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was also boosted by an incremental $925 million associated with the balance sheet optimization transactions we executed in February.\nOur overall liquidity remains strong, standing at $3.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, which positions us well to manage the resumption of debt amortization and newbuild-related payments, which were deferred during the pandemic, the former of which resumed beginning last month. With all ships now sailing and cash generation increasing month after month, our current trajectory would indicate that we are confident we can fund our operations organically.\nA key component of this cash generation is our advanced ticket sales build, which continues to accelerate. As you can see on Slide 13, Total ATS balance stood at $2.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter, up over $400 million versus the prior quarter. On a gross basis, ATS build increased by 60% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time since the start of the pandemic and approaching pre-pandemic levels. This is another positive indicator demonstrating strong consumer demands for our brands.\nTurning to cash burn. Our monthly burn in the quarter was approximately $375 million, better than our guidance of $390 million despite some cost pressures from inflation and global supply chain constraints. This cash burn figure does not include cash inflows associated with current or future bookings, nor contributions from ships that have already resumed service.\nMoving to the balance sheet. As part of our financial recovery plan shown on Slide 14, our team is focused day in and day out on finding and seizing opportunities to optimize our balance sheet and maximize value for our shareholders. During the quarter, we raised approximately $2.1 billion through a series of debt transactions. Proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem the remaining outstanding balances of the high-cost 12.25% senior notes due 2024 and the 10.25% senior secured notes due 2026, which we incurred out of necessity at the peak of the pandemic.\nThe remaining proceeds of approximately $925 million will be used to make principal and interest payments on scheduled debt amortization due in the short term. These transactions extended our debt maturity profile and released certain collateral and guarantees. The combined benefit of these transactions, coupled with those completed late last year as laid out on Slide 15, reduced our annual cash interest expense by approximately $75 million.\nAs I've touched on in the last few quarters, consistent with what all other industries are also experiencing, inflation in global supply chain constraints continue to put upward pressure on our costs. Fuel prices have risen significantly, accelerated by the ongoing geopolitical unrest. While we are not immune to this spike in pricing, our hedge program, as shown on Slide 24, provides partial protection.\nOn the labor front, we remain relatively better positioned than our land-based peers due to our long-term employment agreements, which provide for stable wage inflation and predictability in our operating cost structure. We've also provided incremental guidance on key certain metrics like depreciation and amortization, interest, fuel consumptions and capital expenditures, all of which can be found on Slide 25.\nLooking ahead, we are gearing up to deliver on our attractive newbuild program. This transformational growth is an underappreciated cornerstone of our company's investment thesis. Compared to 2019, the addition of -- to our fleet of 9 new ships through 2027 results in a 50% capacity growth versus 2019, as shown on Slide 16. This also reflects the additions of both Norwegian Encore in late 2019 and Regent Seven Seas Splendor in early 2020. These new ships are expected to be top line and margin accretive and with very efficient financing structures, resulting in an expected immediate boost to our profitability.\nAs we have showed you in the past, Slide 22 demonstrates how this management team has time and again generated outsized returns on incremental capacity, a trend we fully expect to continue in the future. Another area where we can drive additional value for our stakeholders is our multiyear strategy to capture additional share of the leisure wallet. Cruise vacations continue to offer a unique and incredible compelling value proposition for consumers versus land-based vacation alternatives. In the past, we have said that a cruise typically offers at least 20% to 30% better value than a similar land-based alternative.\nWith the current inflationary backdrop, that gap has widened, making our value proposition even more compelling today than ever before. Without the same labor pressures on many of our land-based peers are facing, we can also provide a consistent and exceptional level of service to our guests as evidenced by our high guest satisfaction scores. These factors combined present another opportunity for us to both drive additional demand and increased prices.\nStepping back and looking at the bigger long-term picture, I am optimistic not only because of the progress we have made so far in our recovery, but also by our future prospects. Each new milestone we reach is another stepping stone as we push forward in our recovery process. And as I touched on, we have several significant catalysts to generate value beyond simply targeting a return to our pre-pandemic performance.\nWe are focused on controlling what we can control and finding new and innovative ways, however big or small, to improve each day. I am confident that our strong culture of operational and financial excellence and discipline, which served us well in the past and through the challenges of the pandemic, will serve us even more in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Frank for closing comments.\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you very much, Mark. Before we wrap up our prepared remarks this morning, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, and which Slide 17 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. We have made several significant advances since our last earnings call. First, we announced last month that we are pursuing net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This ambition spans our entire operation and value chain, as we aim to bring all of our key partners along with us on this important journey.\nTo support our path to net zero, we have also committed to develop short- and near-term greenhouse gas reduction targets. These new commitments broaden and strengthen our existing and continually evolving climate action strategy, which is centered around 3 key focus areas: first, reducing our carbon intensity; second, investing in technology and exploring alternative fuels; and third, implementing a carbon offset program. We will continue to monitor and invest in opportunities to reduce emissions, including and beyond our fleet, working closely with our vendor partners to accelerate decarbonization efforts.\nA key driver to achieve our net zero ambition is the development of alternative fuels along with the associated critical infrastructure at destinations globally to support the usage of these fuels and to accelerate the use of shore power while in ports. We will continue to partner and research to identify appropriate alternative fuel sources that can also be sufficiently scaled. For example, we are currently actively engaging with partners, including shipyards, engine manufacturers and classification societies in exploring path for the development of additional technologies, including potential hybrid engine solutions and safe and effective methanol engine retrofits.\nSecond, last month, we published our first task force on climate-related financial disclosures or TCFD report. As part of this process, we engaged teams across the organization to conduct an extensive climate risk screening, identifying priority climate-related risks followed by a scenario analysis in our top risks under different hypothetical climate scenarios. We are focused on improving resiliency and the result of this assessment will assist us in further integrating climate-related risks into our long-term strategy and decision-making processes.\nLastly, I'm pleased to report that I signed the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity and Inclusion in March, further expanding our commitment to fostering an inclusive workforce, where diverse backgrounds that are represented engaged and empowered to generate and execute on innovative ideas.\nBefore turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 18. First, we are incredibly pleased to have our full fleet back in operation, so we can now singularly focus on wrapping up occupancies in a disciplined and brand accretive manner with the goal of reaching record net yields and record adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023. The public health and regulatory environment has improved, and I am encouraged by the current trajectory and the overall progress we have made as a society in learning how to adapt and live with the virus, allowing us to accelerate our return to normalcy.\nSecond, we are encouraged by the improving booking trends and robust pricing we are experiencing, which lay a strong foundation for the second half of '22 and 2023. We will lean on our fundamental go-to-market strategy of market-to-fill in order to set the stage now for high-quality, sustainable long-term profitability and free cash flow generation. And lastly, we will continue to execute on our medium and long-term recovery plan and to capitalize on our attractive growth profile over the coming years.\nAs you can see, we've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions. Rob, please open up the line."

We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and the presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call.\nBefore we begin, I would like to cover a few items. Our press release with the fourth quarter and full year 2021 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release.\nOur comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. And as always, I hope that all of you as well as your loved ones remain healthy and safe.\nBefore going into my main commentary, I'd like to address the recent geopolitical issue, which escalated last night. The tense situation in Ukraine is regrettable. And our hopes are that the conflict ends quickly with minimal impact to the safety and welfare of those in the region. We are following the situation carefully as it impacts our voyages in the area. We have no vessels in the region until late May. And we will be updating guests on our plans and about affected itineraries as needed.\nWe have quite a bit to share with you today, ranging from our resumption of operations to the impacts of the Omicron surge to recent developments with the CDC. We'll also cover the booking and pricing landscape in our plans for the return to service of the balance of our fleet. So let's get started.\nIt seems like just yesterday that we launched our Great Cruise Comeback in late July of '21 after 500 days of no cruise operations. In the 5 months that followed through the end of 2021, we safely carried over 230,000 happy guests around the globe, everywhere from Europe to Alaska and points in between, delivering the unique and upscale vacation experiences that only our three award-winning brands can provide. This is evidenced by our brands having achieved the highest customer satisfaction scores in our history and a reflection of the deep commitment from our crew members, who are as energized as ever to be back in the high seas serving our guests.\nIn addition, onboard spend by guests during the quarter continued to exceed all expectations and reached all-time highs. And we delivered these unparalleled vacation experiences in the safest manner possible with protocols that are unmatched by any other area of the hospitality sector. I'll repeat once again that our #1 priority is and always will be the health and safety of our guests, crew and the communities we serve. And that commitment has never been more evident than in a month since our return to service.\nWith over 230,000 guests sailing on our vessels in 2021, our COVID positivity rate was miniscule and certainly a fraction of what has been the case in the population at large. Our science-backed protocols, centered on vaccination and preboarding testing, provide a safe vacation experience that is not duplicated anywhere in the world. Today, and because of the rapid decrease in prevalence and in severity, the prospective view of the pandemic is rapidly changing across the globe. Municipalities, cities, states, countries, schools, institutions of all kinds and private businesses alike are all moderating protocols as the public health environment improves.\nIn the past, protocols were usually pared back slowly and only when cases had receded. But we have seen many instances, Denmark and Iceland being one of the best and most recent examples, where protocols and restrictions have been moderated despite high or even increasing caseloads. This latest normal now takes into account the diminished severity of the virus and balances the extent of necessary protocols with the need to resume daily life.\nThe confidence for society to take these actions is mainly due to the availability and widespread uptake of vaccines, new therapeutics and broad immunity. And an NCL cruise ship is one of the few places in the world where you can be assured that at least 95% of the people around you are fully vaccinated. And we're pleased to report that the rapidly improving public health environment has allowed us also to follow the easing of COVID-related protocols occurring in broader society.\nYou can see on the return-to-service plan on Slide 4, a new phase, returning to normal, that reflects those changes and advances. Our brands recently announced that effective March 1, masking for guests across our fleet will be optional while taking into account local guidelines, if any. Also, beginning March 1 and in conjunction with the new CDC guidelines, which I'll discuss in a moment, the Norwegian brand will begin allowing all guests under the age of 12 to sail on an ship fleet-wide.\nThese two steps greatly expand the addressable market for our largest and most family-oriented brand by allowing families to travel together regardless of age and without the mandate of wearing a mask. This announcement was scheduled to provide plenty of time and opportunity for families to plan their summer vacations with us. And all this comes at a time when last week, we had the lowest number of positive pre-embarkation cases per 1,000 guests by far since launching service last July during the Delta surge.\nRecently, we were happy to see significant regulatory progress being made as we received clarification from the CDC on updated protocols for sailing originating from the U.S. ports. Back in January, our three brands were the first in the industry to opt into the CDC's voluntary COVID-19 program for cruise ships operating in U.S. waters. When our brands first opted in, the program had not yet been finalized. However, last week, as protocols to the program were confirmed, our brands reaffirmed their commitment made in March and mid-January of opting into the program, demonstrating once again our industry-leading and unwavering dedication to health and safety with protocols that appropriately reflects the public health environment.\nThe program our brands have opted into calls for at least 95% of vaccine-eligible guests and crew be vaccinated. Given the differences in demographics of our brands, a vaccination requirement will differ somewhat with Norwegian requiring guests aged 12 and over to be fully vaccinated while Oceania and Regent will continue to require all passengers to be fully vaccinated. Regardless, we will continue to require that 100% of crew across our fleet be fully vaccinated and are working towards having all crew members boosted by April 1.\nThe new updated protocols also allow for mask wearing to be optional as is the case with more and more societal activities. All the industry has ever asked is to be treated the same as other areas of society. The CDC's new voluntary program is a positive step in that direction, which we expect will lead to further easing of protocols as the pandemic continues its retreat. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain best-in-class protocols centered on vaccinations and testing for the health and safety of all onboard and to offer guests the safest vacation experience possible.\nThe resumption of service across our fleet was not without its challenges. As difficult an endeavor as it was to pause and find safe haven for our entire fleet back in the spring of 2020, it is even a greater feat to smoothly bring back the fleet into operation and to deliver the world-class level of hospitality and service our brands are known for. I want to thank team members across our organization, from shipboard to shoreside, for the hard work, dedication and passion they displayed in returning our fleet to service.\nI also want to thank our loyal past and new-to-brand guests for entrusting us with what, for many, has been their first taste of travel since the pandemic began 2 years ago. And a special and heartfelt thanks to the travel agency community, who have weathered the pandemic like no other. We stuck together through the industry's toughest times and are now reengaged to bring us all back stronger than ever. And finally, a thanks to our shareholders, lenders, shipyard partners and the broader financial community for your support and confidence in our company, supporting our growth story and the opportunities that lie ahead.\nThe story of the past quarter was obviously all about the Omicron wave. Unfortunately, Omicron did not pick the best of times to make its appearance. Just as we were experiencing a solid rebound in bookings during October and November after the Delta wave began to wane and buoyed by a very successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions, the impact of Omicron began to appear in early December.\nFirst, a Norwegian vessel, whose itinerary featured multiple calls to South African port, had its operations paused as Omicron quickly spread there and additional travel restrictions were imposed. Canceling targeted sailings on certain vessels operating in the Caribbean and South America during the quarter also became necessary as an addition to travel restrictions, ports began implementing difficult, sometimes onerous requirements for docking. Concurrently, booking volumes slowed and cancellation of existing bookings increased.\nWhile Omicron did impact our business in the near term, primarily for close-in sailings in the first and second quarters, it did provide the opportunity to once again demonstrate our resilience as a company and as an industry. Our ethos throughout the pandemic has emphasized being nimble and ready to adapt. Our management team has maneuvered to what no other industry has ever had to do and has done a remarkable job doing so. The silver lining to this pandemic is that it has brought our team even closer together and fortified the strong collaborative culture we already enjoyed and that we truly believe is one of our competitive advantages. As we return to normalcy, that positive culture will only grow stronger.\nNow for some good news. The impact of Omicron are waning week-by-week. While the short term has been impacted, the following points illustrate the strong underlying consumer demand that gives us confidence about the trajectory of our business in the future. First, of the guest cancellations that occurred during December and the January period, the majority were for sailings in the first and second quarters of 2022, demonstrating sustained consumer confidence in sailings further out.\nSecond, beginning in mid-January, net booking volumes began improving and continue to do so and accelerate sequentially week-over-week. Third, booked position for each quarter in 2022 when compared to 2019 sequentially improved over the prior quarter. Fourth, despite the erosion in booked position due to the Delta and Omicron surges, as of today, second half 2022 booked position is in line with what was an extraordinarily strong 2019, while 2023, compared to pre-pandemic 2020, is in an even better position, in fact, a record booked position.\nFifth, again, as of today, pricing for 2022 and 2023 sailings remained higher for the full year versus 2019 and pre-pandemic 2020, respectively, even when including the diluted effect of future cruise credits. Our core go-to-market principle of marketing to fill versus discount to fill is performing like a champ as we have not and will not chase short-term occupancy by sacrificing price, which only results in long-term and perhaps even permanent damage to brand equity as we have seen over the years in other situations.\nSixth, despite sailing cancellations and slight changes in our return-to-service plans due to Omicron, all of our vessels are expected to sail by early May and in time for the peak summer season. And lastly, we are seeing our largest and most important distribution channels coming back to full strength. Every day, we are seeing more and more business being booked by our travel partners in a shift which bodes well for the industry as the vibrant travel agent community is vital and amplifies the reach of our message to consumers, which translates into more and better bookings.\nI want everyone to recall that in the past, our industry was accustomed to successfully managing through bumps in the road. Whenever there was a natural or geopolitical or some other black swan-type event that impacted bookings, you could almost count like clockwork that after 8 to 10 weeks of quiet, booking patterns would rebound. We've seen this pattern occur twice already during the pandemic, once last spring after the initial variant ceded and vaccinations became prevalent and most recently, last fall, right after the Delta surge began to wane.\nWith the public still a bit shellshocked by the sudden emergency -- emergence and equally dramatic decline of Omicron, what our business needs now is a few weeks of quiet with no new variants or surges for confidence to return and momentum to take hold. Our experts in the SailSAFE Global Health and Wellness Council, headed by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, believe we're at that point right now. So while Omicron did indeed have an immediate but short-term impact on our business, it was an impact that simply shifted expectations and the timing of our recovery by about 3 months.\nThat shift in timing is coinciding with the shift in societal attitudes that I mentioned earlier from avoiding the virus at all cost to living with it. It's something we really didn't see after the Delta wave but is gaining more and more momentum post Omicron. We are seeing more and more living of life. And we once again began hearing the term revenge travel being batted about. These shifts bode well for our company as vacationers look to once again explore the world but to do so in a safe manner.\nI'll be back shortly with closing comments. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his commentary and the progress of our financial action plan. Mark?\n\nMark A. Kempa\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Frank. As mentioned earlier, going from a complete standstill to having over 70% of our capacity sailing by year-end, through not one but two COVID variants, has been an impressive effort in coordination and logistics. I give my thanks and kudos to our operations and hotels teams, both shipside and shoreside, for executing on this truly herculean endeavor. We have been deliberate and disciplined in bringing our fleet back gradually and have kept self-imposed load factor limitations in place to ensure the safety of our guests and crew members.\nI am pleased to report that strong ticket pricing and onboard revenue spend drove positive contribution from the fleet that operated in the quarter, despite the headwinds we faced from the remnants of Delta as well as the onset of the Omicron variant. This result reinforces our belief in the fundamental strength of the business as we reach 85% of our capacity back in operation during the first quarter and the entirety of our fleet back in service in the second quarter to capture demand for the peak summer travel season.\nBased on our current trajectory, we expect to reach a key milestone in our recovery as the net cash provided by operating activities is expected to turn positive in the second quarter. In addition, we expect the second half of 2022 to be profitable for the company on an adjusted net income basis, marking an important transition for managing the daily business primarily around liquidity needs to shifting our focus back to maximizing profitability as we exit these unprecedented times. That said, we remain keenly focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position through this transition period.\nMoving to Slide 8. Our cash and short-term investments for the quarter decreased by approximately $200 million on a net basis to $1.75 billion. This includes $1 billion of cash burn associated with operations, including interest and capital expenditures, partially offset by nearly $600 million of advanced ticket sale collections and other working capital changes. Our quarter-ending cash and short-term investment balances were also boosted by an incremental $260 million associated with a series of balance sheet optimization transactions we executed in November.\nMore importantly, our liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.7 billion, including a $1 billion commitment through August 2022, which remains undrawn. In addition, our latest transaction earlier this month puts us in a strong position to manage the resumption of principal payments that had been deferred during the pandemic. Furthermore, as the environment improves, our own cash generation engine will be fully up and running, which will further strengthen our balance sheet.\nA key part of that cash generation engine is our advanced ticket sales build. In the fourth quarter, gross advanced ticket sales increased by 40% to $700 million versus a build of $500 million in the prior quarter. On a net basis, this was partially offset by revenue recognized for sailings in the quarter and refunds and cancellations associated with Omicron. We continue to be encouraged by the strong and accelerating advanced ticket sales build as it reflects robust demand for our product as we bring the fleet back to service.\nTurning to cash burn. Our monthly burn in the fourth quarter was $345 million, which was slightly better than our guidance of $350 million, despite some cost pressures from the global supply constraints. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we expect cash burn to increase to approximately $390 million as we ramp up to 85% of our capacity in operation by the end of the quarter. This cash burn includes costs incurred for ships coming online in the second quarter, such as crewing the fleet ahead of the restart, restocking of inventory and repositioning of certain ships to their initial home ports.\nAs a reminder, and consistent with our prior commentary, cash burn does not include cash inflows associated with current or future bookings nor contribution from ships that have already restarted service. However, it is important to note that we expect cash inflows to accelerate as our fleet continues to come online, resulting in our cash flow from operations expected to turn positive in the second quarter.\nMoving to the balance sheet. You may recall last quarter, we talked about pivoting to a more offensive approach as part of our financial recovery plan as shown on Slide 13. Since last quarter, our team has executed a series of transactions in November and February to begin the journey of optimizing our balance sheet. Let me share some key highlights with you, which are summarized on Slide 10.\nIn November 2021, we completed a series of balance sheet and cash flow optimization transactions, which reduced the company's annual interest expense, decreased leverage, extended the debt maturity profile and may lower diluted shares outstanding. Incrementally, in February, the company raised approximately $2.1 billion through a series of debt transactions. Proceeds from these transactions were used to redeem the remaining outstanding balances of the 12.25% senior secured notes due 2024 and the 10.25% senior secured notes due 2026 and will also be used to make principal and interest payments on scheduled amortization due in the near term.\nThis transaction extended our debt maturity profile and released certain collateral consisting of certain vessels, private islands and intellectual property. The combined benefit of these transactions reduces our annual cash interest expense by approximately $75 million. As is evident from the transactions I just covered, our treasury, accounting, finance and legal teams, amongst others, have been extremely busy. And I want to recognize and thank them for their tremendous amount of work and effort they put in for us to complete these transactions.\nTurning to inflation. Similar to all other industries, we are experiencing upward pressure on costs in certain areas such as food, perishables and other supplies that are impacted by the global supply chain constraints. Recent geopolitical developments have also pushed fuel curves higher. However, as you can see on Slide 20, approximately 40% of our total consumption for 2022 and approximately 25% of our consumption for 2023 is hedged and affords us partial protection from the recent spike in prices. In addition, some of our major costs such as labor, also have a long term -- have long-term agreements, which provide predictability in our operating cost structure.\nWhile inflationary pressures persist, the most recent consumer spending numbers remain robust. At a more micro level, we have seen clear evidence of this in the onboard spend from guests aboard our ships and pricing for future cruises that Frank touched on earlier. In fact, onboard spend per person per day continues to be up meaningfully versus record 2019 levels. We've also provided incremental guidance on certain key metrics like depreciation and amortization, interest expense, fuel consumption and capital expenditures, all of which can be referenced on Slide 21.\nAs I look ahead, I am encouraged by the continued positive news we are seeing, including the decline in COVID cases, the new guidance provided to the cruise industry by the CDC and the steady march back to normalcy in wider society. We are confident that the demand for our fantastic brands and unparalleled vacation experiences will continue strengthening back to pre-pandemic levels. This strength is clearly reflected in our forward booked position for the second half of 2022 and full year 2023.\nAnd our growth profile over the coming years is as robust as ever as we take delivery of 9 spectacular and margin-accretive ships across all 3 brands between now and 2027, increasing our capacity by 50% compared to 2019. More importantly, this management team has time and again generated outsized returns on incremental capacity. And we look to continue this trend as we focus on rebuilding and growing our business.\nLastly, Frank touched on this, and I couldn't agree more, that a business is only as strong as the people behind it. Our team has demonstrated incredible resilience working through these unprecedented times. We are undoubtedly stronger today than we were before entering the trenches of this pandemic. So as we look to the future, our team is focused on managing the controllable and staying nimble. As the landscape evolves, we will continue to adapt and create value for our shareholders, team members and communities we serve. Our management team is ready and eager to return our business back to pre-pandemic levels of significant cash flow generation and profitability combined with a strong balance sheet.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments.\n\nFrank J. Del Rio\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark. And before we wrap up our prepared remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail & Sustain, which Slide 14 outlines key accomplishments and milestones. We are committed to driving a positive impact on society and the environment through the advancement of this program. And we reached several important milestones this past year, including releasing our first ESG report announcing our long-term climate action strategy and goal to reach carbon neutrality. We also made several advances since just our last earnings call.\nWe took the opportunity during the voyage suspension period to accelerate installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems or scrubbers nearly 2 years ahead of schedule. We successfully completed our nearly $200 million multiyear investment that covered 13 ships, representing approximately 70% of our operational capacity with these state-of-the-art systems, which improved our environmental footprint by significantly reducing emissions, including sulfur oxides and improving air quality. In fact, ships equipped with this technology can reduce SOx emissions by up to 98%, allowing the ships to operate these systems within compliance in expanded areas throughout the world. Investments in technology such as scrubbers are an integral part of our climate action strategy.\nWe were also proud to be recognized as a leader in sustainable cruise terminal construction as we were the first in the world to receive the LEED Gold New Construction certification for our flagship terminal at PortMiami. The team designed our 188,000-square foot terminal, which welcomed guests for the first time last year, with innovation and sustainability at the forefront, creating a platform that optimizes the terminal's energy performance, indoor air quality, water efficiency, utilization of local materials and resources and much more. And we will continue to innovate towards our sustainability commitment, including further investment at our PortMiami terminal, where we are partnering with Miami-Dade County to add short power capabilities by fall of 2023.\nWe know that initiatives such as these are important in supporting our goals. And our Board of Directors recognizes that ESG is a critical driver in achieving our corporate goals and long-term success. And for this reason, our Compensation Committee included an ESG metric in our annual short-term incentive plan for the first time. This metric involves the company making sufficient progress in setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets during 2022 as determined by the Technology, Environmental, Safety and Security, or TESS, Committee of the Board of Directors. Our Board believes that this step towards shared accountability across the organization reinforces our commitment and ultimate goal of reaching carbon neutrality.\nBefore turning the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 15. First, we remain focused on our voyage resumption plan with 85% of our fleet operational at the end of the quarter and the full fleet ready for the important peak summer season in May. Despite the impacts of Delta and Omicron, we are pleased with our cumulative booked position for 2022 and 2023 and the strong corresponding pricing that comes with it. And lastly, our priority remains to execute on our medium- and long-term financial recovery plans and to capitalize on our attractive growth profile over the coming years.\nWe've covered quite a bit today in what has been an incredibly busy quarter and year. So I'll conclude our commentary now and open up the call for your questions. Operator?"

Today's conference is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.\nBeginning today's call is Megan Britt. Please go ahead.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nInvestor Relations Director, DuPont, Inc.\n\nHello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call for Air Products. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Eduardo Menezes, Chief Executive Officer; and Melissa Schaeffer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during the call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Air Products website.\nDuring this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nPlease note in today's presentation, we will refer to various financial measures including earnings per share, capital expenditures, operating income, operating income margin, the effective tax rate and ROC either on a total company or a segment basis.\nUnless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures refer to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our investor website in the relevant earnings release section.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Eduardo.\n\nEduardo F. Menezes\n\nThank you, Megan. Hello, and thank you for joining our call today. Please turn to Slide 3.\nEarlier today, we reported our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025 results. Our numbers show consistent progress related to commitments we shared earlier this year. We delivered earnings per share of $12.03, which is above the midpoint of our full year fiscal guidance range. Our operating income margin of 23.7% and return on capital of 10.1% were also in line with our commitments for these metrics. Also, this year marks the 43rd consecutive year of increasing our dividend. In total, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2025.\nI'm encouraged we are setting challenging but achievable targets and delivering on those commitments. We have taken several key actions starting in the second quarter to focus on the core industrial gas business and expect to unlock earnings growth through productivity pricing, operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. The last 3 quarters demonstrate that we are already making progress.\nMoving to Slide 4. We have three key priorities for 2026 that were part of the strategy we shared earlier this year. First, we expect to deliver high single-digit annual EPS growth. To be clear, our 2026 guidance anticipates additional helium headwinds in a sluggish macroeconomic environment.\nOn our second priority, we will continue to make strides to optimize our large projects portfolio. We are working diligently to finalize our NEOM project and expect to improve our underperforming project portfolio with a goal of generating positive cash returns.\nOn our third priority, we continue to take actions to balance our capital allocation and improve our balance sheet. We expect to reduce our capital expenditures to roughly $2.5 billion per year following the completion of several large projects. At this level of CapEx, we believe we can support our ongoing maintenance and invest in the traditional industrial gas projects while growing our dividend and longer term, returning additional cash to shareholders via share buybacks. In 2026, we expect our capital expenditures to be about $4 billion.\nIn summary, we expect fiscal 2026 to demonstrate our commitment to continuously drive improvement in our core industrial gas business and growing alongside our customers.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. We highlighted earlier this year that a portion of our productivity improvement will come from returning to an organizational headcount similar to what we had before we started several large clean energy projects. This slide offers a progress report on our actions in the savings that are being created. Since 2022, we have identified a total of 3,600 headcount reductions, which translates to [ 16% ] of our peak workforce. We expect these reductions to contribute approximately $250 million in annual cost savings or $0.90 per share in earnings once the reductions are complete.\nThese cuts are not something we do lightly, but they are critical to offset inflation and adapt the organization to a lower level of CapEx spend. Our objective remains to return to staffing levels 2018 adjusted for employee growth to support new assets, minus any other productivity we can find with new initiatives like AI.\nMoving to Slide 6. We have a summary of our expected CapEx expenditures after 2026. As we have previously said, we are also moving forward with several underperforming projects, giving our commercial obligations and project steps. We have roughly $2.5 billion remaining to be spent on these projects from 2026 to 2028. Though these products are not expected to contribute materially to operating income, we continue to work to improve their results through commercial negotiations, operational improvement and productivity.\nFor our NEOM project, this slide reflects the CapEx related to our equity contribution to the overall project, which will be completed in 2027. Any further investments for ammonia dissociation in Europe will need to be approved separately. After we bring these projects on stream, we expect capital expenditures of roughly $2.5 billion per year, which can sustain both our future growth and ongoing maintenance. For our blue hydrogen project in Louisiana, we have hard making new commitments until an uptake agreement is reached.\nIn this slide, our capital investment for this project in '26 reflects only prior commitments on the project and we have excluded any spending beyond 2026. Like in the case of NEOM downstream investments, they would need to be justified and approved based on firm offtake commitments. I'll talk more about the Louisiana and NEOM projects in our next slide.\nOn traditional core growth, we expect to invest approximately $1.5 billion per year going forward. These are as operation hydrogen projects that we normally execute in 18 to 30 months, so there are always new products being added and completed products being removed from the list. The CapEx figures for fiscal year 2027 and beyond represents our expected average spend. Our focus will be, as always, on opportunities that meet our return thresholds with quality customers and contractual uptake.\nMoving to Slide 7. I wanted to close with a brief update on NEOM and Louisiana. Start with NEOM, the project is progressing well and is about 90% complete. Solar and wind power generation will be completed by early 2026, and we will start commissioning the electrolyzers and ammonia production. We expect to have ammonia production on stream with full product availability in 2027.\nWe are, of course, following the regulatory developments in Europe. It is important to highlight that the scale of the energy transition is such that the volumes required to meet even the smaller mandates such as the Red III EU mandate to convert 1% of fuel sold to RFNBO fuels would create a green hydrogen demand equal to approximately 7x the total production of our NEOM project by 2030.\nObviously, a significant part of the volume is expected to be supplied by local electrolyzers using renewable power, but it's important to highlight that our solution to bring green ammonia from Saudi Arabia for dissociation in Europe is competitive in terms of pricing and requires 0 public subsidies. As mentioned before, the market for green ammonia is also being developed, and that will be our main target for -- from the time the NEOM project starts. Additional feedback on the market development will be provided during 2026.\nRegarding our blue hydrogen project in Louisiana, we are evaluating proposals to divest the carbon sequestration, and ammonia production assets. We will only go forward with this project if we can sign form offtake agreements for hydrogen and nitrogen from the facilities that will be owned and operated by Air Products. And of course, these agreements will need to comply with our return expectations with one or more high-quality counterparts. As previously committed, we expect to provide further updates related to this project prior to the end of 2025, so in less than 2 months from today.\nLet me finish by saying that I'm excited to launch my first full operating year with Air Products team. We have been working hard to right the ship and bring the company back to a position where we can deliver maximum value to our shareholders, customers and employees.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Melissa to discuss our financial results in greater depth and discuss our 2026 outlook. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eduardo, and welcome and hello to those joining us on the call today. Please move to Slide 8 for a high-level summary of our financial results.\nWe ended the fiscal year with earnings per share of $12.03, delivering our commitment to our shareholders and above market consensus. With respect to sales, favorable volume for on-site and non-helium merchant were more than offset by a 2% headwind from the prior year LNG divestiture as well as project backlog. Volume was also lower due to the reduced global helium demand. Partially was favorable for non-Helium merchant products across all regions. Operating income was down on volume and higher cost, partially offset by non helium price. The higher costs were driven by depreciation, largely offset by productivity improvements, net of fixed cost inflation. Operating income margin of approximately 24% and declined 70 basis points compared to the prior year, largely driven by higher energy cost pass-through. Return on capital of 10.1% was lower versus prior year as we continue to exit on our project backlog, as we continue to exit on our project backlog.\nMoving now to Slide 9. Our fiscal year earnings per share of $12.03 decreased $0.40 or 3% from prior year. driven by a 4% headwind from LNG divestiture and a 2% headwind from project exits. Without these discrete items, EPS would be up 3%. Additionally, we continue to see headwinds from helium, including unfavorable comparable volume and pricing across regions. Despite these headwinds, we continue to deliver on our base business with stronger non-helium pricing actions, ongoing productivity across our segments and favorable on-site and merchant contributions.\nMoving now to Slide 10. I will provide an overview of our results by segment for the full fiscal year. You can find additional details of the quarterly segment results in the appendix.\nFor the fiscal year, America's results were down 3%. As a reminder, we reported a onetime asset sale associated with an early contract termination at the request of a customer in the prior year fourth quarter, which alone resulted in a 3% headwind in the Americas. Additional drivers include headwinds from project exits and helium and higher maintenance-related costs. These were partially offset by strong non-helium pricing actions, productivity improvement and favorable on-site contributions from our HyCO business.\nAsia fiscal year results were relatively flat, as lower helium was offset by favorable on-site, non-helium price and productivity. During the quarter, we made the decision to sell 2 coal gasification projects within Asia, which are now within assets held for sale.\nEurope's FY '25 results improved 4% as non-helium merchant pricing, productivity and favorable on-site contribution was partially offset by lower helium and higher costs associated with 2 depreciation and fixed cost inflation.\nThe full year, Middle East and India equity affiliates income decreased 2% from prior year, primarily due to lower contributions from our Jazan joint venture.\nThe full year results for the Corporate and other segment were primarily impacted by the headwind from the prior year sale of LNG, partially offset by lower changes to the sale of equipment project estimates and lower costs with our continued focus on productivity improvements.\nMoving now to Slide 11. We continue to generate strong cash flows from our base business, supporting investments in both energy transition and traditional industrial gas projects. Additionally, we returned $1.6 billion in cash to our shareholders. We remain committed to disciplined cost control, a reduction in capital expenditures and strategic asset actions aimed at unlocking value and generating cash.\nMoving now to Slide 12. We will review our outlook for fiscal 2026. For the full year, we expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $12.85 to $13.15, an improvement of 7% to 9% from the prior year. Despite a helium headwind comparable to FY '25, this growth is expected to be achieved through new asset contribution and continued focus on pricing actions and productivity. We also expect a 1% benefit from the rationalization of projects in large part due to the two Asia gasification assets we wrote down in fiscal 2025. We are focused on delivering these results in line with the 5-year road map we introduced earlier this year.\nFor the first quarter of 2026, we expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $2.95 to $3.10, representing a 3% to 8% improvement from the prior year. Our outlook assumes growth from continued pricing actions and productivity as well as a benefit from the rationalization of projects and lower planned maintenance, partially offset by lower helium. As a reminder, we expect our first quarter to be lower sequentially due to normal seasonality.\nWith respect to capital, we expect to spend approximately $4 billion as we execute on our project backlog, including approximately $1 billion on traditional industrial gas projects and invest in ongoing maintenance. As we look to derisk our Louisiana projects and optimize our portfolio, we expect to be modestly cash flow positive in fiscal year 2026 and are committed to staying cash flow neutral through 2028 as we close out on several projects.\nNow we'll open the call up for questions.

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products.\nPlease note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Eric Guter. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Guter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Welcome, everyone, to Air Products Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Teleconference. This is Eric Guter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Eduardo Menezes, our Chief Executive Officer; and Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer.\nAfter our comments, we will be pleased to answer your questions. Our earnings release and slides for this call are available on our website at investors.airproducts.com.\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements provided in our earnings release and on Slide #2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, the effective tax rate and ROCE either on a total company or segment basis.\nUnless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures refer to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our investor website in the relevant earnings section -- Earnings Release section.\nNow I'm pleased to turn the call over to Eduardo.\n\nEduardo F. Menezes\n\nThank you, Eric. This is Eduardo Menezes. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 3. The Air Products team delivered solid fiscal third quarter results. Our adjusted earnings per share of $3.09 exceeded our guidance and were higher than last year on a comparable basis excluding the impact of the LNG business sale.\nWe saw positive base business results despite significant global heating headwinds and continue to see positive cost savings across the organization from our productivity actions. Air Products has a solid core industrial gas business with significant potential. The results this quarter shows the strength and resilience of our base business. I'm confident we can continue to improve margins and unlock value through systematic cost productivity, pricing and operational excellence.\nLet me share some examples of how we are executing our productivity commitments. We continue to review and optimize our portfolio. The previously announced global cost reduction plan remains on track and will generate significant savings. Once all actions under the plan are fully executed, we expect to realize annual savings of $185 million to $195 million.\nAir Products has the lowest SG&A as a percentage of sales in the industry, and we are continuing to improve on this metric. We are investing to bring additional AI and digital transformation tools to the majority of our employees for use into their day-to-day work. I expect the combination of the Air grass roots projects and large ongoing AI corporate initiatives in areas like energy management will significantly change the way we work and open many new productivity opportunities for Air Products.\nWe are committed to project execution and capital discipline. We expect to finalize the current energy transition projects in line with our previous guidance and to continue investing in growth to build density in our core industrial gas business. We intend to take full advantage of our leading on-site positions in hydrogen and electronics, always through disciplined capital allocation.\nNow please turn to Slide 4. We presented this slide for the first time last quarter, and I thought it would be helpful to talk about it 1 more time. This is Air Products 5-year road map to unlock our earnings potential. We have a strong team running the core business, and I'm confident all our leaders are personally committed to take our products to this journey.\nOur objective for the next 5 years is starting in fiscal year 2026 is to consistently achieve high single-digit or better adjusted EPS growth rate, while maintaining or reducing our financial leverage. By doing that and maintaining the capital discipline I mentioned a few times during this presentation, we should achieve operating margins of 30% and ROCE in the mid- to high-teens by 2030.\nNow I will turn it over to Melissa to discuss our quarter results. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eduardo, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 to review our results.\nOur third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.09 exceeded the upper end of our guidance of $2.90 to $3. Compared to last year, sales volume was down 4%, mainly due to the sale of the LNG business last year, lower helium demand and project exits, while partially offset by favorable on-site across the region.\nThe sale of the LNG business drove volume lower 2%. Total company price was up 1%, which equates to a 2% improvement for the Merchant business. Adjusted operating income was unchanged as strong base business performance, including continued pricing strength in non-helium products across all regions, was largely offset by the sale of the LNG business and exited projects.\nAdjusted operating margin was flat, but improved about 300 basis points sequentially due to favorable volume and productivity improvements.\nNow please to turn to Slide 7 for the details of our third quarter earnings per share. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.09 decreased $0.11 from prior year. This was negatively impacted by $0.14 from the sale of the LNG business and $0.12 impact from project exits. Without these headwinds, EPS would have improved $0.15 versus prior year.\nVolume added $0.06, benefitting from strong on-site volumes. This volume growth was partially offset by lower helium demand and project exits in the Americas. Price was positive $0.05, driven by strong non-helium pricing actions across all regions. Costs were $0.03 favorable due to productivity and lower maintenance, partially offset by higher depreciation and inflation.\nThe tax rate this quarter was $0.05 unfavorable compared to last year, which benefit from several onetime items. Interest expense was $0.02 higher, as project exits reduced the interest eligible for capitalization.\nNow please turn to Slide #8 for an update of our fiscal 2025 guidance. Our fiscal full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is now in the range of $11.90 to $12.10, keeping the midpoint unchanged at $12. We remain cautious in our outlook, recognizing the significant economic uncertainties around the world. Our guidance for capital expenditures stays at approximately $5 billion for the year. We've included additional details on the segment results in the appendix section.\nNow we will turn the call over for questions. Operator?"

Now I'll turn the call over to Eduardo.\n\nEduardo F. Menezes\n\nThank you, Eric. Good morning. This is Eduardo Menezes.. Thank you for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 3. Let me begin by sharing a few thoughts from my first 3 months as Air Products CEO. I talked with our employees visits several sites and met with many of our largest customers and partners. I can say our product has a solid core industrial gas business with significant upside if we stay within our traditional business model. Decades ago or pioneered the on-site business model. Today, approximately 50% of the company's sales are on site with long-term take-or-pay complex, the highest percentage in the industry. .\nThe process also build density in its merchant business, helping customers be more efficient and sustainable. We became the leading supplier of hydrogen operating hydrogen pipeline networks around the world including the world's largest at the U.S. Gulf Coast. We have also become a leading supplier of high-purity gases for the electronics industry. These are clearly strength to build upon. However, over the past few years, our products moved away from its core business in search of growth. The company give us investment in coal gasification and then in clean energy.\nWe deploy capital to complex higher risk projects with first of a kind technologies and more importantly, without committed offtake agreements in place. In doing so, our products moved away from its successful model, while significantly increasing its financial leverage and headcount to support these projects. The company grew by almost 7,000 employees since 2018 to execute the capital plan. This had a negative impact on both costs and execution policy, leading to significant project delays.\nAll of this leads to the importance of refocusing our products on its core business and core capabilities. Please turn to Slide 4, and let me talk about where the business stands today. You can think about Air Products business in 3 categories. First, we have the strong core industrial gas business. This includes on-site projects with take-or-pay agreement, our regional merchant business and a portfolio of high-quality minority-owned joint ventures.\nThe business has about $12 million in sales and operating margin of 24%. I'm confident we can improve margins and unlock significant value through disciplined cost productivity, price in operational excellence. This is the largest opportunity we have considering the $35 billion in capital we have invested in the base business. In summary, Air Products can go strongly and profitably in traditional industrial gases -- we can also participate in clean energy opportunities as long as they align with the traditional industrial gases model where customers take the volume list. Second, we have the 2 large projects in Saudi Arabia and Louisiana. We believe these projects are set up to be the lowest cost producer of green and blue ammonia for several decades. To be clear, Air Products is an industrial gas company and does not intend to be a retail marketer of ammonia.\nAs a progress report, I can say that the Saudi Green project is progressing well. Our 4 gigawatts solar and wind power generation will be concluded by mid-2026 and we will start commissioning the electrolyzers and ammonia production after that. As you are informed before, we successfully limited our spend on this project through partnership and project financing. We expect product availability in 2027. Regarding the Louisiana project, we actively worked to derisk it by focusing on the Industrial Gases portion of the project. We announced ongoing discussions to divest the carbon sequestration and the ammonia production elements of this project.\nThe earliest start-up of this facility is 2028 or 2029, spanning the derisking strategy. To make it clear, Air Products will only move forward with this project when we have form off-state agreements for hydrogen and nitrogen. Third, we also have the underperforming projects with CapEx totaling about $5 billion. These are first-of-a-kind energy transition budget with substantial cost overruns. In some instances, these underperforming projects were designed to produce additional volumes for noncontracted pipeline sales and for the hydrogen mobility market, which is being delayed or reduced.\nI will provide additional comments on these underperforming projects in a few minutes. Please turn to Slide 5. The products will get back to basics. First, we will return to excellence in execution in our core business. We can invest about $1.5 billion per year for industrial gas projects going forward. Our focus will be on opportunities that meet our high return thresholds with high-quality customers and contracted take-or-pay offtake. And we will work to expand our margins through operational excellence, productivity and by rightsizing the organization as we return to a normal level of CapEx spend. To focus on the second column of this slide, we remain cautiously optimistic about both the green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia and the Blue hydrogen facility in Louisiana.\nIn Saudi Arabia, in the near term, we will focus on completing construction and selling in ammonia, FOB Saudi Arabia until hydrogen regulations fully develop and we will delay investment in downstream facilities in Europe until specific regulatory frameworks are clear for each country, and we have firm customer commitments. As you all know, the previously announced agreement for green hydrogen supply in Europe is scheduled to start in 2030. We expect parity regarding the development of this project no later than 2027. Louisiana, we plan to concentrate on the hydrogen and nitrogen production and continued discussions to derisk the carbon sequestration ammonia production activities.\nThere will be no new spending commitments on this project while we pursue the derisking strategy. Lastly, we are moving forward with the underperforming projects, given our commercial obligations and project status, though they are not expected to materially contribute to operating income. We anticipate these projects will provide positive cash flow, which will allow us to recover on an undiscounted basis, our cash investment over the life of the projects. We have roughly $2 billion remaining to be spent on these projects from 2026 to 2028. Our goal will be to maximize profitability for commercial negotiations, operational improvement and productivity.\nTurn to Slide 6. We have begun the process of getting back to basics. We canceled 3 significant U.S. projects in February, and we are taking a more prudent approach to the Louisiana project. Additionally, we are also working to address the underperforming projects, which do not currently meet our expectations. For the previously announced net 0 hydrogen projects in Edmonton, total cost is now expected to be $3.3 billion with onstream between late 2027 and early 2028. On the next 2 slides, I will detail how we will bring down both our capital expenditure and head count in the coming years.\nOn Slide 7, you can see that once we complete the project in Saudi Arabia and Louisiana, as well as the underperforming projects, our capital expenditure level roughly $2.5 billion per year, which can sustain both our future growth and ongoing maintenance. Now please turn to Slide 8. Part of our productivity improvement will come from rightsizing our headcount to the levels we had before we started a large wave of projects discussed in this presentation. Air Products total head count increased from approximately 16,000 to 23,000 employees since 2018. 1,300 reductions have already been unified and are in process. This is in addition to the approximately 500 related to the LNG divestiture.\nWe intend to identify another 2,500 to 3,000 positions, which will be eliminated between 2026 and 2028 as we finalize the large projects with the objective of reaching an employment level similar to 2018 adjusted for employee growth to support new assets. Let's turn to Slide 9 and talk about our road map for improvement in the coming years. For 2025, we expect our base business to deliver around $12 per share of EPS, double-digit ROCE and over 20% adjusted operating margin. We strongly believe we can do better so we will look to maximize profitability from the base business to drive results in the coming years. We will manage our cash flow to allow dividend increases, new projects and in time, reduce our debt and buy back shares.\nAs we improve our operating margin through productivity and address challenges in 7 projects, we expect this key operating metrics to improve. Despite the burden of the underperforming projects, we anticipate that during the 2026 to 2029 period, we can achieve high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, adjusted operating margin in the high 20s and adjusted ROCE in the low to mid-teens. We also expect our aggregate net cash flow to be improved to neutral during this period. As you can see in the far right column, 1 to Saudi Arabia and Louisiana projects begin contributing we expect to unlock significant potential, achieving roughly 30% adjusted operating margin, mid- to high teens adjusted ROCE and double-digit adjusted EPS growth by 2030 and beyond. Our objective is that at full contribution, these projects will allow us to achieve greater than 10% compounded EPS flow versus 2025 by 2031 or 2032.\nThe Air Products team recognized the importance of transparent communications with our investors. Going forward, we will a, focus 100% on our core industrial gas business, b, be disciplined with capital and c, build a culture that prioritizes productivity and continuous improvement. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Air Products employees for the way they received me during the last 3 months and for their support to refocus the company in our traditional business model despite difficult changes we'll need to go through. Now I will turn it over to Melissa to go through our financial results. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eduardo. And good morning, everyone. As a reminder, on this call, we will be speaking about our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Before we do, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the $2.3 billion after-tax charge taken in the second quarter. This charge included the project cancellation we previously announced, cost reduction measures and executive separation costs. We will now turn to Slide #11 to review our financial results. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.69 were below our previous guidance of $2.75 to $2.85, primarily due to changes in cost estimates on a sale of equipment project in the U.S. and lower-than-forecasted helium contribution.\nCompared to last year, sales volume was down 3%, with 2% driven by the LNG business divestment, while weaker merchant primarily helium was largely offset by favorable onsite volumes across the region. Total company price was up 1%, which equates to a 3% improvement for the merchant business, driven by continued nonhelium pricing strength in the Americas and Europe. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% mainly due to the LNG divestiture and unfavorable helium impact. Additionally, we saw higher costs driven by Americas maintenance and fixed cost inflation, which was partially offset by strong productivity actions across the company.\nOperating margin was down 210 basis points with approximately 100 basis points, driven by higher energy pass-through. Now please turn to the Slide #12 for the details of the second quarter earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.69 decreased $0.16 from prior year. The divestment of the LNG business accounted for $0.12 of headwind and currency was unfavorable $0.04. Our base, which includes volume, price and cost was down $0.07 other than LNG, volume was relatively flat as the lower helium was largely offset by favorable on-site volume. Price was positive 0.4%, driven by improvements in the Americas and Europe.\nCosts were $0.11 unfavorable primarily due to fixed cost inflation and higher maintenance in Americas, partially offset by favorable cost productivity across the company. Affiliate income was better in Europe but partially offset by lower contribution in America. Now please turn to Slide #13. I would like to provide an update on our FY '25 full year guidance. Since our last earnings call, we have canceled several large projects and observed volatility in the macroeconomic conditions. As we look at the guidance year-on-year, the divestiture of LNG will continue to drive a 4% decrease relative to the prior year.\nThe large project cancellation will be a 3% headwind resulting from lower operating income and reduced capitalized interest. We anticipate base business growth of 2% to 5% for the year despite the 5% headwind in helium resulting in a fiscal 2025 full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $11.85 to $12.15. Please note the potential economic impact of global tariff is not in our guidance. While the industrial gas business is primarily a local business and very resilient. It is difficult to determine at this time if there will be broader macroeconomic impacts from tariffs or events that may impact our customers.\nWe expect our third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.90 to $3, and our full year capital expenditures to be approximately $5 million. We've included additional details on the segment results in the appendix section. Now we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?"

We have a great foundation to build upon.\nNow as you can appreciate, given the changes underway, the scope of today's call will be limited to discussion of the quarterly results of the company and our outlook. We appreciate you may have a variety of questions which extend beyond the results of the quarter, which will be addressed in due course. But for today, we kindly ask that questions be limited to and focused on the financial results that we disclosed this morning and our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nWith that, let me turn it back over to Eric.\n\nEric Guter\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Wayne.

Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide #3.\nAdditionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE either on a total company or segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures refer to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our investor website in the relevant earnings release section.\nNow I'm pleased to turn the call over to Melissa.\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good day to everyone. Please turn to Slide #4 of the materials we have posted on the website for this call. Safety is our #1 priority without exception. We are proud of the continuous improvement we were able to achieve in this area, but our goal and efforts are always towards 0 accidents and 0 incidents. Now please turn to Slide #5 for our first quarter results. As we announced in January, first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.86 exceeded the upper end of our guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85, up 1% over last year. driven by results in the Americas. Our earnings per share improved despite the divestment of the LNG process taking equipment business, which closed at the end of fiscal 2024.\nThe LNG business contributed roughly $0.08 to our first quarter earnings in 2024. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was up 140 basis points. Our adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points versus prior year. Please turn to Slide #6 for our fiscal 2025 2nd quarter and full year outlook. We are maintaining our fiscal 2025 full year guidance. We continue to monitor the strengthening U.S. dollar, tariffs in a global helium market for potential impact for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our focus on driving productivity, we continue to evaluate actions to reduce our costs and improve our services to our customers. We expect our second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.85, which is up 1 to 4 reflective of the LNG divestiture.\nWe are proud of the results this quarter. I am particularly grateful that our people stayed focused on the work at hand, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to our customers, shareholders and all of whom we serve. I would like to thank them for their support and continued efforts to position the company for long-term success.\nNow please turn to Slide #7 for a detailed review of our first quarter results. Compared to last year, overall volume was down 2%, primarily due to the LNG business divestment. Volume in Americas improved this quarter, but it was offset by the weakness in growth. Total company price was up 1%, which equates to a 2% improvement for the merchant business, driven by continued pricing strength in the Americas and Europe. Adjusted EBITDA improved 1% and primarily due to better price, partially offset by higher costs and lower equity affiliate income. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 140 basis points due to favorable business mix and price. Sequentially, volume was down following a strong finish to fiscal 2024 and the sale of the LNG business in September.\nNow please turn to Slide #8 for a discussion of our first quarter adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.86 increased $0.04 despite the $0.08 contribution from LNG in the prior year. which is reflected in our volume varies. Price, net of variable cost was favorable at $0.10, demonstrating continued strength in the Americas and Europe. The pricing improvement more than offset unfavorable other costs of $0.07, low prior year incentive compensation and inflation drove increased costs, which were partially offset by our productivity improvement.\nNow please turn to Slide #9 for a brief discussion of our business segment results. You can find individual slides covering each of the business segments in the appendix. Looking at each business segment. Americas, overall, pricing was 2% higher with improvement across most product lines. This translates to a 4% merchant pricing gain for the region. The 3% volume [indiscernible] was driven by a significant nonrecurring sale of helium to an existing merchant customer. These factors drove adjusted EBITDA 6% higher and improved adjusted EBITDA margin by 150 basis points. For our Asia segment, the 2% volume improvement was driven by contributions from new assets. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% and primarily due to favorable volume, cost and equity affiliate income. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 160 basis points.\nLooking at Europe results, broad-based pricing improved 1%. Volume was down 5%, driven by lower upside and continued weakness in merchant demand, primarily helium. Adjusted EBITDA was 3% lower as weaker volume was partially offset by higher price and favorable costs. Uzbekistan project is undergoing planned facility upgrades during the first half of fiscal 2025. We expect the facility to return to normal operation and contribute near its full run rate at the start of third quarter.\nMoving to our Middle East and India segment. Lower merchant volume was a headwind for sales and adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was also negatively impacted by unfavorable equity affiliate income and cost. Finally, for our corporate and other cement, sales and profits were lower this quarter, primarily due to the sale of the LNG business. Thank you. And now we will be delighted to answer your questions. And as a reminder, we request that questions be limited to our financial results and our outlook."

I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Melissa Schaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Eric Guter, our incoming Head of Investor Relations.

Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to join our call today. Before I discuss our results, I would like to introduce Eric Gutter, who is with us today. Eric has been with the company for nearly 30 years, most recently serving as our Vice President of hydrogen for mobility. He will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to Investor Relations. I'm happy that he has agreed to take on this new challenge. Eric, would you like to say a few words?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Seifi. I appreciate your kind words, and I'm humbled and honored to be part of this tremendous team and to be taking on this new role within Air Products. We're looking forward to meeting with our analysts and investors and continuing the great work Sid and the team have done as we continue to execute our growth strategy.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Eric. And as we have announced, Sid will be leaving the company to pursue other career opportunities. Sid has made great contribution to Air Products. I want to thank him for continuing to build strong relationship with investors and analysts and for his work over the past few years at the company. Sidd and Eric are already working closely together to ensure a smooth transition. Now please turn to Slide #3. As always, I would like to begin with our record on safety, which is our top priority at Air Products.\nWe have made significant progress on both our employee lost time injury rate and recordable injury rate since 2014. We are proud of this improvement, and we are very proud to have the best safety record in the industry. But we always strive to achieve 0 incidents and 0 accidents. That is our ultimate goal. Slide #4, summarizes our management philosophy. We have shared this with you many times before. We are, as we have been for the past 10 years, committed to these principles and practice them every single day.\nNow please turn to Slide #5. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.20 exceeded the upper end of our prior guidance range of $3 to $3.05 and improved 7% over last year. Our results reflect strong underlying performance in the Americas and Europe. Additionally, we saw improvements across our organization, driven by our price and productivity actions. We continue to execute our 2-pillar growth strategy, which includes driving operational excellence and growth in our industrial gas business while executing our energy transition projects focused on clean hydrogen.\nNow please turn to Slide #6. We are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $12.20 to $12.50 and we still expect our CapEx to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024. Now please turn to Slide #7. During our fiscal third quarter, in addition to achieving 7% earnings per share growth, we have also reached overall significant milestones. In June, we announced a very large scale, long-term green hydrogen supply agreement with Total Energies. Beginning in 2030, Air Products will supply Total Energies with 70,000 tons per year of green hydrogen for 15 years. This pioneering agreement, which has already generated significant interest from other customers, validates our long-term strategy and demonstrates a strong demand for green hydrogen.\nWe are seeing the development of significant demand for green hydrogen in Europe. And as a result, we are even more excited and committed to our strategy to be a pioneer in the production of clean hydrogen. In July, we announced the planned sale of our LNG process technology and equipment business to Honeywell for an all-cash price of roughly $1.8 billion. The divestment of this business will allow us to focus on our core business while bolstering our balance sheet and our liquidity position. Also in July, we were pleased to announce our collaboration with Mercedes Benz to help decarbonize the heavy transport sector.\nAir Products was among 5 other companies that took delivery of Mercedes-Benz hydrogen fuel cell trucks. This is a significant milestone toward the eventual mass production of hydrogen fuel cell heavy-duty trucks. In a related development, we have also announced plans to build a network of permanent commercial hydrogen fueling stations along the trans-European transport network. Now please turn to Slide #8, which illustrates or greater than 10% average growth rate for our adjusted earnings per share in the past 10 years. Our goal is to extend this trend for another 10 years, while remaining the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have done this before, and I'm confident we will do it again.\nNow please turn to Slide #9. We take a balanced approach to determining our dividends. We are confident that our cash flows from operations and our ability to raise capital through financing and other strategic initiatives will allow us to continue rewarding our shareholders through increased dividends while meeting the cash needs of our growth strategy. Now turning to Slide #10, which, as I always say, is my favorite [indiscernible] . It shows that our EBITDA margins have significantly grown and now it stands at 42%, leading the industry by far and demonstrating our persistent focus on effectively running our base business.\nWe are very much focused on profitability, and this slide is a living proof of that. I want to thank all of our employees for delivering these outstanding results in very challenging economic conditions. At this point, I would like to turn over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide a summary of the third quarter financial and business segment results. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 11. Compared to last year, underlying sales volume and price together were up 1% and positive across most reporting segments. The 2% reduction on the company's top line was primarily due to unfavorable currencies. On-site volume was again positive this quarter, driven by strong demand for hydrogen as well as contributions from new assets. However, overall volume was flat due to lower demand for merchant products.\nOverall price improved modestly at 1% with continued strong performance in the Americas coupled with lower power costs, which improved contribution margin. Declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in 1% lower energy cost pass-through, which has no impact on profit. EBITDA of $1.3 billion increased 5%, primarily driven by positive contribution margin and favorable business mix. Although cost was modestly unfavorable this with heavy planned maintenance this quarter, we are starting to see positive momentum on our productivity actions across the organization.\nROCE of 11% was down 70 basis points and relatively flat sequentially. Adjusted for cash, our ROCE is about 12%. Sequentially, volume improved across the reporting segments. Now please turn to Slide 12 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $3.20, up $0.22 or 7% compared to last year mainly due to better operating results. Overall, volume was up $0.05 on higher on-site, including new assets, partially offset by lower merchant demand. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.16 this quarter driven by both pricing gains and lower power costs.\nCosts were $0.04 unfavorable as productivity actions offset much of the cost related to planned maintenance and inflation. Again, we are making good progress implementing the productivity actions and exercising significant cost control throughout the organization. Currency was negative $0.04, mainly due to weaker currencies in Asia and South America. Additional debt contributed to higher interest expense of $0.03 onetime items helped lower the effective tax rate this quarter. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be about 18%.\nNow please turn to Slide 13. The for our discussion of our business segment results. Instead of viewing each business segment in detail, I would like to provide a focused discussion summarizing our segment results and highlighting key items for the quarter. You will find individual slides covering each of the business segments in the appendix. Looking at each business segment, Americas underlying sales were positive with price and volume together up 2%. Merchant pricing was 7% higher, which resulted in a 3% overall price gain for the region.\nVolume was relatively stable as weaker merchant demand was offset by strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA increased 6% and EBITDA margin increased about 400 basis points primarily driven by strong price despite increased costs due to higher planned maintenance. Looking at Asia results. The region's underlying sales were relatively stable. Volume was down 1% as lower demand for merchant products and planned maintenance outages were offset by new assets. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were unfavorable, primarily driven by the planned maintenance outages. Switching to our Europe segment, Merchant pricing was held firm and combined with our declining power cost in the region, drove improved contribution margin. Volume was up 1%, largely due to our new assets in Uzbekistan.\nEBITDA improved 12% EBITDA margin increased nearly 500 basis points, mainly due to improved volume and contribution margin. Moving to our Middle East and India segment. Sales and operating income declined due to unfavorable merchant price and volume. Equity affiliate income was 7% lower due to higher costs. For our Corporate and Other segment, sales and profit were up this quarter, primarily due to higher sale of equipment, including LNG. We're making good progress on our productivity actions across all segments of the company.\nBefore I turn the call back to Seifi, let me take a moment to thank our teams around the world for delivering these outstanding results. Now I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide closing remarks.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #14. Our industrial gases business is a great business, and we are committed to invest and grow it. Our recent announcements to expand our membrane production facility in St. Louis and to build 2 new air separation units in Georgia and North Carolina are just the latest examples. We are also leading the way to deliver low carbon hydrogen at scale, to help decarbonize the industrial and heavy-duty transportation sectors of the economy.\nOur 2-pillar growth strategy drives our company towards these 2 goals in parallel. The outstanding results and the significant project milestones that we were able to achieve this quarter demonstrates that we have the right strategy. And as I always say, we have the commitment and motivation of our employees to make it happen. Now before I open it up for questions, I want to make some comments about our management Board and succession planning. The formation of the Management Board was a strategic step to delegate more responsibility to our senior executives who are close to the business.\nYou have seen our public announcements and our 8-K filing on these organizational changes, and I don't really have any additional comments to make on them. On a personal basis, you all know that I am firmly committed to our 2 pillar growth strategy. And as I have articulated that many times, I fully intend to continue leading Air Products, ensuring that our growth strategy is fully implemented, our mega projects are built, and we are serving our customers with low carbon and 0 carbon hydrogen.\nHowever, with our continued commitment to good governance and succession planning, it is prudent and good practice to have a fully qualified individual who can be my successor if something unexpected were to happen to me. I currently share in 3 roles at Air Products. Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer and President. With good governance in mind, I have decided to bring into the company a fully qualified potential successor as President and a member of our Board of Directors. This person should be well known to investors with a clear record of success, preferably a current or former CEO of a public company with significant international experience and relationships.\nI have started this process, and we will take our time to find the right person for the job. At this point, I will be delighted -- we all will be delighted to answer your questions."

Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.\nBeginning today's call is Mr. Sid Manjeshwar, Please go ahead.\n\nSiddharth Manjeshwar\n\nVP, Corporate Treasurer & Lead Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Sid Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaefer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide #2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.\nNow with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Sid, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. As you know, I always start with safety, which is our top priority at Air Products. Slide #3 includes our employee lost time injury rate and recordable injury rates in the first half of fiscal year 2024. Both of these rates were at their lowest levels since 2014 and the best in the industry. This is great progress, but our ultimate goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents.\nSlide #4 outlines our management philosophy. We believe strongly in these principles and they will continue to guide us as we move Air Products forward, like we have done in the past 10 years.\nNow please turn to Slide #5. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.85 exceeded the upper end of our previous guidance range and improved 4% compared to last year on the strong results in Americas and Europe. We continue to effectively manage our current business while simultaneously executing our growth projects. We are focused on reducing costs and improving pricing in this inflationary environment. Our industrial gases business and world scale low-carbon hydrogen projects are driving sustainability, enabling customers to decarbonize and generating a cleaner future for our world.\nNow please turn to Slide #6 for a review of our third quarter and full year guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $3 to $3.05. Our earnings are generally higher in the second half of our fiscal year. We are maintaining our full year guidance of $12.20 to $12.50 per share as we continue to monitor economic uncertainties, including China's economy and activities in the electronic industry throughout Asia. We continue to expect our CapEx to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024.\nNow please turn to Slide #7. Our adjusted earnings per share has improved an average of more than 10% annually since 2014, a trend we are committed to continue.\nNow please turn to Slide #8. We take a balanced approach to determine our dividend, considering various factors including yield, payout and peer anchors while investing for growth and maintaining our aa2 credit rating. In January, we again increased our dividend to $1.77 per share per quarter, extending our record of 42 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2024.\nSlide #9 shows our EBITDA margin trend, always my favorite slide. Our margins have again climbed above 40%, leading the industry and reflecting our commitment to creating shareholder value. At this point, I would like to remind our shareholders that almost 10 years ago, on my first call as Chairman and CEO of Air Products, I promised you that we would make Air Products the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, and we have delivered on that. On the same call 10 years ago, I also promised we would increase our earnings per share on the average by 10% every year. And as you see on Slide 7, we have delivered on that too for the last 10 years.\nSo today, I want to set the goal for the next 10 years. Air Products will continue to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world and, as we have done before, deliver earnings per share growth of at least 10% per year on the average for the next 10 years. We have done it before and we will do it again. I have total confidence, and I want to stress this. I have total confidence in the ability of the talented, dedicated, motivated and committed people of Air Products to execute our bold and forward-looking strategy and deliver significant value to our shareholders.\nI want to thank every one of them for their hard work, commitment and dedication. I'm very proud to be part of this team. Now I would like to turn the call over to Melissa, our Chief Financial Officer, to make remarks about the second quarter. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our second quarter results. Compared to last year, on-site activities were robust driven by higher demand for hydrogen and contributions from new assets. The volume was down 2% primarily due to lower demand for merchant products. Price contributed 1%. The combined impact of pricing and lower power costs across most regions resulted in strong contribution margins. The declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in lower energy cost pass-through, which has no impact on profit but contributed to higher margins.\nEBITDA improved 4% as higher contribution margin and lower costs more than offset lower affiliate income. EBITDA margin exceeded 40%, with lower energy cost pass-through contributing about half of the nearly 500 basis point improvement. ROCE of 11% was relatively flat. Adjusted for cash, our ROCE would have been about 13%. Sequentially, results improved driven primarily by favorable pricing and lower costs despite the seasonal slowdown due to the Lunar New Year in Asia and planned maintenance outages.\nNow please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $2.57, which included a $0.20 charge for productivity actions. Our adjusted earnings per share was $2.85, up $0.11 or 4% compared to last year primarily due to favorable pricing and costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume and equity affiliate income. Overall, volume was down $0.07 on lower merchant demand and planned maintenance outages. Price net of variable cost contributed $0.16 this quarter driven by both pricing actions and lower power costs.\nOther costs were $0.12 favorable, demonstrating the team's commitment to managing costs, while we continue to support our growth strategy. Currency impact was negative $0.03, mainly due to a weaker Chinese RMB. Equity affiliate income was $0.08 unfavorable, driven by lower contributions from affiliates in Europe and the Middle East, partially offset by higher income in America. We successfully issued $2.5 billion of green bonds in February to help fund our growth projects. This additional debt contributed to higher interest expense of $0.07. The remaining items, including favorable noncontrolling interests, the tax rate and nonoperating expense together had a positive $0.08 impact.\nTo echo Seifi's statement, I would like to express my appreciation to the entire Air Products team for their commitment to our company. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan.\n\nSamir Jawdat Serhan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Melissa. Please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, underlying sales were positive with price and volume together up 4%. Merchant pricing was 6% higher, which corresponded to a 3% overall price improvement for the region. Volumes grew 1% as a strong demand for hydrogen more than offset weaker merchant volume. EBITDA was up 15% driven by higher price, volume and equity affiliates income. Of the 1,000 basis point improvement to the EBITDA margin, roughly half was attributable to lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, EBITDA was 5% higher, mainly due to higher price and equity affiliate income.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Asia segment results. Compared to last year, volumes were roughly flat as higher on-site volumes, including new assets were offset by lower demand for merchant products while price remained stable. As Seifi mentioned, we continue to see challenging economic conditions in China. However, we are beginning to see some potential improvement in the electronics market. Currencies were up -- were 5% unfavorable, primarily attributable to the weaker Chinese RMB. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were unfavorable, primarily driven by business mix. Sequentially, volume was 2% lower due to the Lunar New Year slowdown. However, EBITDA was flat as a result of lower cost and higher equity affiliate income.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 for a review of our Europe segment results. Sales declined 11% compared to last year with lower energy cost pass-through and volume shortfall each contributing about half of the total. Weaker merchant demand and planned maintenance outage drove lower volume, partially offset by contribution from our Uzbekistan project. Merchant pricing was stable, and combined with declining power cost, it drove improved contribution margin. EBITDA was up 5% as the improved contribution margin and lower cost more than compensated for lower equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin improved over 600 basis points. Approximately half of this was due to the impact of lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, results were stable as favorable contribution margin and cost offset the planned maintenance volume impacts and lower equity affiliate income.\nNow please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Despite lower sales volume, operating income improved compared to last year due to lower costs. Equity affiliate income from the Jazan joint venture was lower due to higher interest and other operating costs.\nPlease now turn to Slide 16 for our corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Sales were down primarily due to lower non-LNG sale of equipment activities. However, lower cost and contribution from LNG resulted in a stable EBITDA. Our activities related to the LNG equipment and technology business are robust, and we expect our LNG-related projects to improve the results of this segment moving forward.\nBefore I turn the call back to Seifi, I also would like to say thanks to our teams around the world. We're continuing to improve our results. Now I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #17air Products has a great business model and continues to operate from a position of financial strength. While we execute our bold growth strategy in this challenging and continuously changing macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, our organization must remain flexible and agile. On a daily basis, our employees are committed to taking action that improves our safety performance, simplifies work and reduces costs so that together we can deliver productivity to the bottom line and continue to earn the right to grow as we pursue our strategy.\nWe appreciate the dedicated service of all the people who are contributing to Air Products' success and the people in our leadership who continue motivating and developing our people. As I've always said, our real competitive advantage is the degree of motivation and commitment of the people in the company. I am honored every day to be holding alongside this team as we focus on delivering near-term results while executing our long-term growth strategy.\nAt this point, we obviously will be delighted to answer your questions. Operator, we are ready for questions."

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.\nBeginning today's call is Mr. Sid Manjeshwar. Please go ahead.\n\nSiddharth Manjeshwar\n\nVP, Corporate Treasurer & Lead Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Product's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Teleconference. This has said Sid Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.\nAfter our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide #2.\nAdditionally, throughout today's discussion we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.\nNow with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Sid, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today.\nAs always, I would like to begin with Slide #3, our safety performance, which is our #1 priority at Air Products. I'm very pleased to share that our employee recorded injury rate in first quarter was 78% than in 2014. And our employee lost time injury rate was at a record roll the best in the industry. Our ultimate goal will always be zero accidents and zero incidents.\nNow please turn to Slide #4, which summarizes our management philosophy. These principles remain fundamental to how we manage and grow our company.\nNow please turn to Slide #5. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the results for this quarter. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.82 was 7% higher than last year. Our business performed well and we are moving forward. There were several positive contributions to this result that included: strong conversion margins, robust on-site activities in Americas and Europe and higher quality affiliate income globally.\nDespite the year-to-year improvement that I just mentioned, our results diverged from the guidance we have given you due to several items that were not factored in our first quarter 2024 outlook. We have given you a forecast and we are delivering less than the forecast. But again, I'd like to express that we are 7% higher than last year. These factors that affected our guidance are, number one, larger-than-anticipated volume headwinds from weak economic growth in China. We were too optimistic about the performance in China. Second one is lower helium demand in electronics, especially across the world. But I would like to mention that our pricing in helium stays very stable and very robust. But we have -- the volume was lower than we expected. There is a high -- we had experienced higher costs for a sale of equipment project and the impact of Argentine's currency devaluation.\nWith this, let me talk about our revised full year guidance range. Please turn to Slide #6. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.50, which reflects the first quarter events I just discussed. It also reflects evolving geopolitical developments and uncertainties and continued weakness in Asia and helium volumes. This new range is supported by expected positive volume contributions from several new on-site plants and improvement in our LNG sale of equipment business as well as continuing cost productivity that we always pursue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.60 to $2.75. We continue to expect our CapEx to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024.\nNow please turn to Slide #7. We are proud of our adjusted earnings per share improvement since 2014, and we have delivered on a consecutive basis for the last 10 years more than 10% annual growth in our earnings. I would like to take the time to thank each and every one of our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication and commitment, which has made it possible for us to deliver these excellent results.\nNow please turn to Slide #8. In addition to investing in high-return projects, we believe creating shareholder value includes returning cash to our investors by paying a healthy dividend directly to them. In January, we again raised our quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share per quarter, extending our record of 42 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to our shareholders in 2024 while continuing to execute hard return industrial gas and clean hydrogen projects that support our customers in their sustainability journey and drive their energy transition. This balanced approach to allocation will allow us to meet our capital needs while maintaining our [ AA ] credit rating.\nNow please turn to Slide #9, which shows our EBITDA margin trend since 2014. Our margins have returned to roughly 40% since the second half of fiscal year 2023, going a 1,500 basis point improvement versus 2014. And our margins are leading industry margins and they reflect the continued strength of our business model.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you a summary of our first quarter 2024 results. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our first quarter results. As Seifi stated, our business fundamentals are strong. In comparison to last year, we continue to show underlying sales growth with both positive volume and price. Overall, price for the quarter was up despite lower energy costs across most regions. Volume improved 3% driven by strong on-site volume, including higher demand for hydrogen and contributions from new assets but partially offset by weaker demand for helium, particularly in Asia. Declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in 11% and lower energy cost pass-through for the company overall. This had no impact on profit but contributed to higher margins.\nEBITDA improved 8% as favorable volume price net of power costs and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs driven by higher planned maintenance activities and inflation. EBITDA margin of 39.2% and jumped more than 500 basis points with lower energy cost pass-through contributing to about 3/4 of this improvement. ROCE remained steady at about 12%. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been about 13%. Sequentially, results were unfavorable primarily due to seasonality in the Americas and sale of equipment headwinds in our corporate segment.\nNow please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our first quarter adjusted earnings was $2.82 per share, up $0.18 or 7% compared to last year due to favorable volume, pricing and higher equity affiliate income, partially offset by unfavorable costs. Volume was $0.11 due to improvements in Americas and Europe, which more than offset shortfalls in Asia and the corporate segment. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.15 this quarter driven by both pricing actions and lower power costs. Costs at an unfavorable impact of $0.21, driven by higher planned maintenance costs, inflation and our efforts to support our growth strategy.\nAccretive affiliate income was $0.18 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of Jazan project and positive results from our unconsolidated joint ventures across most regions. The remaining items, including lower tax rate, higher interest expense and other nonoperating expense together had a modest negative 5% impact.\nBefore I turn the call to Dr. Serhan, I would also like to thank the people of Air Products for their commitment to the company. I am proud to be working alongside them as we continue to execute our strategy. Now to begin to review our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan.\n\nSamir Jawdat Serhan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Melissa. Please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, price and volume together were up 5%. Adverse merchant price increase of 6%, this represents a 2% price improvement for the region overall. This drove contribution margin improvement. Volume grew 3% due to strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA was up 9%, driven by strong price as well as favorable volume and equity affiliate, while partially offset by higher planned maintenance costs.\nEBITDA margin was up by almost 800 basis points, driven mostly by lower energy cost cash flow. Sequentially, EBITDA decreased 7% mainly due to seasonality as demand moderated and maintenance activities backed up during the winter.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Asia segment results. The challenging economic conditions in China and the weak electronics market continued to put pressure on the region. Third to last year, our volumes were flat for the region as higher on-site activity offset lower helium demand. Price stayed up 1% as we continue to focus on price over volume. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were down primarily due to the unfavorable helium volumes and higher costs. Sequentially, results improved relative to the unfavorable business mix in the previous quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 for a review of our Europe segment results. Volumes were up 9%, benefiting from better on-site activities, including the new project in Uzbekistan. Compared to last year, merchant pricing remained stable relative to the decline in energy costs, contributing to margin improvement. EBITDA was up 28% driven by favorable volume, lower power costs and stronger currencies against the U.S. dollar, which more than compensated for increased costs due to inflation and planned maintenance activities. EBITDA margin was over 1,000 basis points higher, about half of which was due to the impact of lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, results improved driven by favorable price, volume and cost.\nNow please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Compared to last year, sales decreased due to lower volume, EBITDA improved due to the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in mid-January of last year.\nPlease now turn to Slide 16 for our corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Despite higher sales from LNG activity, EBITDA declined due to higher costs in our non-LNG sale of equipment business, as Seifi mentioned before. Our activities related to the LNG equipment and technology business are robust. We continue to have constructive conversations with customers who are interested in our offerings, and we expect our LNG-related projects to improve the corporate segment moving forward.\nAt this moment, I also would like to thank our teams around the world for their effort and demonstrating their determination to overcome the challenges we are facing. Now I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #17. As I always say, our real competitive advantage is the commitment, dedication and motivation of our people. I am proud to see that commitment and motivation in action every day in our company, and I'm very proud of our people. The fundamentals of our existing business are strong and we are moving forward. The short-term issues we have discussed do not change the compelling long-term prospects of Air Products.\nAir Products is pursuing a first-mover growth strategy with our core industrial gases business as the first pillar and our blue and green hydrogen projects as the second pillar. Executing our strategy in these 2 pillars with sustainability underpinning both of them enables us to fulfill our higher purpose as a company, which is to help solve significant energy and environmental challenges in our world. That is our highest purpose. First, our industrial gases business and technology solutions help customers across dozens of industries improve yield, increase production, reduce energy consumption and lower emissions, in other words, to make more with less, while reducing the impact on the environment.\nSecond, the world needs more energy and bonds that energy delivered with a lower carbon footprint. At Air Products, we are demonstrating our leadership position, leveraging our decade-long experience, core competencies, core technologies and ability to execute world-scale hydrogen projects. By producing and delivering low and zero carbon hydrogen at the scale for heavy UG transportation and industry, we can meaningfully contribute to the goal of decarbonizing the world. We believe that the first-mover advantage will be substantial and deliver enduring long-term shareholder value both in terms of return to Air Products and in generating a cleaner future for everybody.\nWith that, we are now more than happy to take your questions."

Welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Sid Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, [indiscernible], President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.\nAfter our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.

Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I would like to begin with the Slide #3, our safety performance which is our #1 priority at Air Products.\nI'm pleased to share that our safety record has improved compared to last year continuing the significant progress we have made since 2014. Our ultimate goal will always be 0 incidents and 0 accidents.\nNow please turn to Slide #4, which summarizes our management philosophy. We reiterate these principles every quarter because they are fundamental to how we manage the company and continue to profitably grow our earnings per share.\nNow please turn to Slide #5. Air Products has a very strong business model and the long-term strategy to deliver consistent earnings growth for the short and the long term, and I stress the long term. Projects in our on-site business where we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with our customers drove our volume growth this year despite economic weakness across the regions. Our on-site business generates stable cash flow and consistently contribute about half of our total sales.\nAlso note for the [indiscernible] is that strong pricing action in our merchant business as well as our ability to contractually pass through energy costs in our on-site business helped us mitigate inflation as well as higher power and energy costs, which we experienced last year. We also continue to successfully execute our long-term strategy to be the leader in blue and green hydrogen for the future with a significant number of green hydrogen, mega projects and their execution. Nobody in the world is matching what we are doing.\nFinally, our backlog of over $19 billion [indiscernible] up a multiyear framework for double-digit earnings per share growth which has been our goal since 2014 and remains our goal for the future.\nNow please turn to Slide #6. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $3.15 per share exceeded the top end of our guidance for the quarter and improved $0.30 or 11% versus last year. For the full year fiscal 2023, our adjusted earnings per share of [ 11.51 ] improved $1.26 or 12% over prior year, continuing our strong track record of consistently delivering double-digit average earnings growth per share since 2014. We are very proud of the accomplishment in 2013 despite the unfavorable economic conditions.\nIn addition to the strong results, we also made significant progress in our critical deployment -- in our capital deployment strategy this year. Jazan Phase 2 was completed, both Gulf Coast Ammonia and Jiutai are operational. Neon project financing was more than 2x oversubscribed and closed successfully. We also added our 4 significant LNG sale of equipment projects. And I'm very pleased to announce that the natural gas to [ syngas ] facility in Uzbekistan is operational and contributing to our earnings.\nBefore I go any further, I want to take time to thank all of our employees around the world, every one of the 23,000 of them, for their dedication and hard work which has made it possible for us to deliver these impressive results despite significant economic and geopolitical admin.\nNow please turn to Slide #7. We are continuing to deliver on what we promised to our shareholders in 2014. Executing to deliver an average of at least 10% growth in earnings per share each year as we move forward. We believe our 2-pillar strategy of focusing on our base business, while extending our leadership in the growing demand for clean hydrogen, which enable us to continue to deliver double-digit growth in our EPS as we go forward.\nNow please turn to Slide #8. We are proud again of our accomplishment of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increases. As you can see on this slide, since 2014, we have increased our dividend at an average of 10% every year.\nSlide #9 shows our EBITDA margin trend, continuing to be my favorite slide. Our margins have increased to nearly 40% in the second half of fiscal year 2023. Confirming the strength of our business model and the significant cash flow that we generate.\nNow please turn to Slide #10 for our fiscal year 2024 outlook and guidance. Although there will continue to be challenging economic conditions in the near term, I remain very optimistic about Air Products' future. Our capital deployment strategy and a strong business model will sustain our double-digit average earning growth rate. Therefore, for fiscal year 2024, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $12.80 to $13.10 per share, up 13% at the midpoint over last year. We expect new projects, many of which are already on stream to drive our earnings per share growth next year.\nAdditionally, we also expect improved LNG sale of equipment activities to add to our favorable results in 2024 and for the first quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.90 to $3.05, up 10% to 16% over last year. We also see our CapEx for next year, somewhere between $5 billion to $5.5 billion.\nNow please turn to Slide #11. I know that some of our investors refer to our major project commitments slide to track our projects. However, the size and scale of these projects, which all have multiyear execution time frames, certainly now warrant more than time and attention then we can give them in a single line on a singular slide. Therefore, we remain committed to providing investors visibility and meaningful update to scheduled capital [ and update the ] status as we continue to progress our major projects. So from time to time, we will give you a more depth look into our projects.\nToday, we have decided to give you an update on our blue hydrogen and blue ammonia clean energy complex in Louisiana which is one of the largest projects that we are executing.\nPlease turn to Slide #12. We announced our intent to build this broad scale facility in Louisiana in October of 2021. As we move forward with detailed planning to execute this project, a significant positive event happened in August of 2022. When the United States Congress passed the [ RRA ] registration, which created tax incentives for the production of blue and green hydrogen.\nIn addition, by 2022, it was becoming more and more evident that the future demand for blue hydrogen and blue ammonia is improving significantly supported by positive developments in other regions of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan. Not only is there growing need to decarbonize the heavy transportation and industrial sector, such as [indiscernible], but also other growing applications, including using low-carbon intensity blue ammonia to fuel ships, reduce emissions from power plants and more. These events, especially the passage of the [ IRA ] legislation, let us consider that now rather than later, is the best time to build the infrastructure for this project, to accommodate future expansion.\nIt is important that we are -- that we reinvest in the infrastructure needed for future expansion now so that when the demand increases rapidly, as we expect it to, we will be able to bring the next phase of this project on the stream as fast as possible. In addition to the increased cost to build the infrastructure, obviously, the project cost has gone up due to inflation that we are seeing in the past 3 years since we announced the project and anticipate in the future to build this facility.\nIn addition to all of this, we have included in the $7 billion funds to cover the interest on capital that we will be using as we build this plant. This facility is a huge facility, we are very excited about its future. We remain totally committed to this project and its profitability. It is a unique one of a kind project that [indiscernible] significantly ahead of anybody else in the world in the production of this product.\nWe see significant demand for the product that this plant will produce. As a result, I am very pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors has given us final investment approval to proceed with the project at the new capital estimate of $7 billion. We expect this project will deliver double-digit returns to our investors when it is fully on stream.\nAs you know, this project will produce hydrogen and ammonia at very low carbon intensity. As the first company to make this unique low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia products at a large scale, we expect to get a premium for the product, which will allow us to achieve double-digit returns on capital. Additionally, the scale of our activities will provide a cost advantage over other similar projects in development at this time. We are really excited about the future of low carbon hydrogen and ammonia. That is by -- this project in Louisiana is well underway, and we are laying the groundwork to meet the expected additional demand in the future.\nThe additional infrastructure we are building now will continue to be a competitive advantage for Air Products in the future. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you a summary of the fourth quarter 2023 results. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. And my thanks to the people of Air Products, who have again delivered double-digit average earnings growth in a difficult environment, an impressive trend that we have achieved in 9 of the past 10 quarters.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our fourth quarter results. In comparison to last year, we have again achieved underlying sales growth despite ongoing economic weakness. Merchant price was 4% higher compared to last year, with positive pricing in most regions. This corresponds to a 2% price improvement for the whole company. Higher on-site volumes including strong demand for hydrogen and higher LNG sales equipment activities were offset by onetime opportunities in the prior year, resulting in flat volumes for the company overall.\nDeclining natural gas costs in Europe and the Americas reduced energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers. This 14% decline in sales has no impact on profit but was a significant contributor to our higher margin. The overall impact of currency was minimal as the strengthening of the euro and British pound against the U.S. dollar was mostly offset by a weak Chinese RMB. EBITDA of $1.3 billion improved 10% as favorable price, variable cost and [indiscernible] affiliate income more than offset higher other costs. EBITDA was up in 4 of our 5 reporting segments.\nEBITDA margin jumped more than 700 basis points with lower energy cost pass-through contributed to about 2/3 of the improvement. ROCE progressed steadily to reach 12%, which is 90 basis points higher than last year. We expect to maintain the steady progression as we continue bringing new projects on stream and put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been relatively flat at 13.4%. Sequentially, results improved primarily due to increased LNG sales equipment activities as well as on-site.\nNow please turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $3.15 per share, up $0.30 or 11% compared to last year due to strong pricing and higher equity affiliate income, partially offset by unfavorable costs. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.44 this quarter benefiting from both price actions and lower power costs.\nCost has been unfavorable impact of $0.28, driven by higher inflation and higher maintenance as well as our ongoing efforts to support our growth strategy, including bringing new assets onstream. Equity affiliate income was $0.19 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of the Jazan project and positive results from other unconsolidated joint ventures across the region. The remaining items, including noncontrolling interest, interest expense and the tax rate together had a modest negative 0.3% impact.\nNow please turn to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining our current targeted AA2 rating. And with our strong cash flow and additional debt leverage, we estimate that we can put more than $30 billion to work over the next 10 years. Today, we have a backlog over $19 billion, with approximately $15 billion of projects focused on the energy transition. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create long-term shareholder value.\nNow to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan.\n\nSamir Jawdat Serhan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Melissa. Given our first -- fourth quarter, we again saw broad-based improvements across our businesses. Profits were favorable in 4 out of our 5 segments compared to the previous year.\nPlease turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, merchant price improved 10%, which corresponded to a 4% improvement for the overall region. Volumes grew 3% due to a strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA of just over $600 million improved 17% driven by strong price, volume and equity affiliate income, while partially offset by higher costs. EBITDA margin of 44.5% jumped more than 1,100 basis points. About 2/3 of the margin improvement was driven by lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 6%, mainly on [indiscernible] hydrogen volume.\nNow please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Asia segment results. Compared to last year, Asia volumes were negatively impacted by a slower economic recovery in China, a weak electronics market and onetime opportunities that benefit last year results. Despite these volume headwinds, our teams maintain focus on price. EBITDA margins were down primarily due to the unfavorable volumes. Sequentially, price and volume were flat. Our EBITDA declined primarily due to unfavorable business mix.\nPlease turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Europe segment results. Compared to last year, our costs subsided while merchant pricing remained stable. Growing volumes in our on-site business were offset by weaker demand for merchant products, resulting in flat volumes for the segment overall. EBITDA was up 15%, driven by the lower power costs and stronger currencies against the U.S. dollar, which more than compensated for the other cost increases. EBITDA margin was 1,000 basis points higher, approximately 2/3 of which was due to the impact of lower energy costs pass through.\nSequentially, the region's EBITDA was relatively flat as higher volume was offset by unfavorable price and costs. Like we mentioned before, we brought the new project in Uzbekistan on stream last month, earlier than previously anticipated. We expect this project to gradually ramp up and significantly contribute to growth in this segment going forward.\nNow please turn to Slide 19. Before we move on to the next [ roboting ] segment, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the recently announced largest blue hydrogen project in Europe. Blue hydrogen project is being developed in conjunction with [ Porthos ], [ CO2 ] transport and storage project in the Port of Rotterdam, where we have an extensive hydrogen pipeline network. [ Porthos ] will transport the CO2 emission from participating industrial companies and sequester them and depleted gas field in the North Sea.\nAir Products will [ then ] own and operate the carbon capture and CO2 treatment facility, which will allow us to capture the emissions from our existing hydrogen facility as well as the customer refinery. The resulting low carbon hydrogen produced will be supplied to [indiscernible] under a long-term offtake agreement. European regulations are supportive low-carbon projects. We have secured additional support from the Dutch government. We expect the project to be on stream in 2026.\nNow please turn to Slide 20 for a review of our Middle East and India segment. Compared to last year, sales were lower due to lower volume. The second phase of the Jazan project, which we closed in mid-January of this year added to equity affiliate income and it drove the region's overall results.\nNow please turn to Slide 21 for our corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. The sales and profit for this segment improved this quarter, primarily due to higher LNG sale of equipment activities. We continue to have robust discussions with customer interested in our LNG technology and equipment. We were pleased to announce a significant new project involving sale of equipment in Malaysia last week, adding to our already robust project pipeline. [indiscernible], the outstanding results this quarter again demonstrate the strength of our businesses. I also would like to thank our teams around the world for their hard work and commitment. I would like now to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you very much, Dr. Serhan. I appreciate that. Now please turn to Slide #22. We present this slide during every earnings call because it is our core belief that the commitment and motivation of our people are the key drivers of our success. After all, technologies, processes and physical assets, which are often cited as competitive advantages are all created by people in the organization.\nAt Air Products, we have built an outstanding organization. Our people working together are creating innovative technologies, processes and facilities that are making us a first mover in supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon energy and decarbonizing the transportation and industrial sectors. We are doing this alongside our excellent core industrial gases business, which has also underpinned -- which is also underpinned by sustainability and delivering significant productivity and environmental benefits to our customers around the world.\nAt Air Products, our higher purpose is to bring people together to collaborate and innovate solutions to significant energy and environmental challenges in our Board. I can say that our entire team is focused on sustainable growth opportunities in generating a cleaner future for humanity. With that, we are now ready to answer any of your questions, and we welcome them. Operator, we are ready for questions, please."

Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide #2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis.\nUnless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, sir, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. The committed and dedicated people at Air Products delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter, driven by strong organic sales growth, demonstrating the strength and the stability of our business. At Air Products, we have an excellent and resilient industrial gas business that is the foundation of who we are and what we do. We supply customers in dozens of industries, customers who depend on our people's expertise to make their products and processes more efficient and sustainable.\nWe have been doing this for the last 83 years, and we will continue to do all we can to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing outstanding service to our customers. But at the same time, we are using all of our experience, financial strength and core competencies as the world's leading supplier of hydrogen to implement our low and 0 carbon hydrogen mega projects around the world. When it comes to generating a cleaner future now, we want to lead the way, decarbonizing heavy duty transportation and heavy industry around the world with clean hydrogen at very large scale. This combination is our growth strategy, and it is a path forward for our continuous success and profitable growth in the quarters and years to come. I want to thank the hard-working and talented team at Air Products who make all of this possible.\nNow please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. We have worked hard to realize significant progress since 2014. But we always drive and strive to do even better. Our goal is to achieve 0 incidents and 0 accidents. Now please turn to Slide #4, which summarizes our management philosophy. We have shown you this slide every time that we have an earnings call, but I cannot emphasize enough our commitment to the basic principles delineated in these slides. These principles will guide our actions in the future. Now please turn to Slide #5. Our third quarter adjusted earnings of $2.98 per share improved $0.40 or 16% versus last year and exceeded the top end of our guidance for the quarter. Both price and volume were again positive.\nWe continue to demonstrate significant pricing strength while our volume improved for the 9th consecutive quarter, driven by strong on-site performance including improved hydrogen demand in Americas and over 13 new assets that we brought on stream. Additionally, we anticipate the recently announced $1 billion acquisition of the natural gas to syngas facility in Uzbekistan, and the new LNG sale of equipment projects will add significantly to our future earnings. As you can see on this slide, we have delivered an average of 11% cumulative average growth rate of earnings per share in the last 9 years. Now please turn to Slide #6. We are committed to rewarding our investors by providing a healthy dividend and return cash to them. We are proud of our record of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increases. We expect to return more than $1.5 billion of dividend to our shareholders in 2023. And also, this slide demonstrates that we have increased our dividend by an average of 10% in the last 9 years.\nNow please turn to Slide #7, which shows our EBITDA margin. This continues to be my favorite chart. This graph is self-explanatory and clearly demonstrates the significant improvement of our margins as compared to 9 years ago, when I had the honor and privilege of becoming the Chairman, President and CEO of Air Products. Now please turn to Slide #8. I would like to again highlight the 2 fundamental pillars of our growth strategy. Our resilient core industrial gas business and the low and 0 carbon hydrogen projects, the mega projects, each underpinned by sustainability. By running our existing business efficiency every quarter, we were able to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in 8 of the last quarters. And we continue to advance our blue and green hydrogen projects to help decarbonize the transportation, and the heavy industrial sector of our economy.\nWe expect these water scale clean hydrogen projects to significantly add to our already strong profit stream in the future. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. As Seifi has said, the consistency and resilience of our business was on full display this quarter. Price and volume gained 4% and 3%, respectively, at all profit metrics were up again double digits over last year in a difficult environment. Thanks to the people of Air Products for your continued commitment to serving our customers around the world. We are proud that our Neon Green hydrogen joint venture, the world's largest green hydrogen production facility, achieved financial close in May.\nThe joint venture successfully secured over $6 billion of nonrecourse financing from over 20 global project finance leaders. The project was 2x oversubscribed, a clear demonstration of confidence in this project. Now please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our third quarter results. In comparison to last year, volume increased 3% and driven primarily by our on-site business. Merchant price was 10% higher compared to last year, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This equates to a 4% price gain for the total company with positive pricing across all regions. Declining natural gas costs in Europe and the Americas reduced energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers. This 11% decline in sales had no impact on profit but had a positive impact on margins.\nThe overall impact of currency was modest. However, Asian currencies were particularly weaker and contributed to slightly unfavorable currency impact against the U.S. dollar. EBITDA improved 12% as strong price and equity affiliate income, including the contribution from the second phase of the Jiutai project that closed in January, more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin jumped almost 600 basis points. with lower energy cost pass-through accounting for 2/3 of the margin improvement. ROCE progressed steadily to reach 12%, which is 130 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on stream and continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash our ROCE would have been 13.6% this quarter.\nSequentially, favorable volume and price net of variable costs drove improvements to the EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Lower energy cost pass-through also benefited EBITDA margin by about 200 basis points. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our third quarter GAAP earnings of $2.67 per share included 2 non-GAAP items that together negatively impacted EPS by $0.30 per share. First, we recorded a $0.23 charge for business and asset actions. Second, the nonservice components of our defined benefit plan resulted in a $0.07 cost this year versus a $0.03 gain last year. Excluding these non-GAAP items, our third quarter adjusted earnings was $2.98 per share up $0.40 or 60% compared to last year, driven by strong pricing and higher equity affiliate income. Price and volume, and cost added $0.34 on to our third quarter adjusted earnings. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.52 this quarter, and volume improved -- improvements contributed an additional $0.09.\nCosts were unfavorable $0.27 driven by inflation as well as our ongoing efforts to support our growth strategy, including bringing new assets onstream. Equity affiliates income was $0.18 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of [ Jiutai ] project and good results from our other unconsolidated joint ventures in the Americas and Europe. The remaining items, including noncontrolling interest, interest expense and nonoperating income and expense together had a modest negative $0.06 impact. We expect our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%. Now please turn to Slide 11. Our ability to steadily grow distributable cash flow, especially in challenging conditions is a hallmark of the strength and stability of our businesses and underpins our dividend and capital deployment programs. Over the last 12 months, we have generated about $3.2 billion of distributable cash flow or over $14 per share, we prioritized over 45% of -- or about $1.5 billion as dividends to our shareholders while still having roughly $1.8 billion to invest for growth.\nNow please turn to Slide 12. We have made significant progress in developing or deploying our capital since 2018. Committing most of our estimated investment capacity available in 2018 to the 2027 time frame. Because our strategy related to the energy transition extends well beyond 2027, we have revised this slide to show a rolling 10-year time horizon. We have not changed any other assumptions or calculation. We remain committed to maintaining our current targeted AA2 rating. With our strong cash flow and additional debt leverage we estimate that we can put more than $30 billion to work over the next 10 years.\nToday, we have an $18 billion backlog and with $11 billion of projects focused on the energy transition. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create long-term shareholder value. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Serhan.\n\nSamir Jawdat Serhan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Melissa. During our fiscal third quarter, we again saw broad-based improvements across our businesses, extending the positive trend from previous quarters. Results improved in each of our regional segments versus last year. Driven by strong price, strong volume, productivity actions, despite the challenging operating conditions around the world.\nBefore I discuss the results of each region, I would like to provide a brief update on our major projects. First, turning to Slide 13. You will see that we have enhanced how we present our major projects clarifying the project investment amounts, specifying the long-term nature of the related offtake agreements, and highlighting energy transition projects. We believe this new format provides a clear overview of key projects in our backlog and provide near-term and long-term visibility. Now please turn to Slide 14. I I'm pleased to say that the [ Jiutai ] gasification project is in operation. Our team executed the project in the midst of Covid lockdown and supply chain disruption, including several months of severe lockdowns during the start-up period. We were able to complete this complex project with outstanding safety performance and come in under budget.\nThe team of over 3,300 workers during deep construction completed nearly 13 million hours without a lost time incident. I would like to thank the team for a job well done. Our team in the Americas has also overcome many challenges to execute the Gulf Coast ammonia project which had nearly 1,300 workers during construction and completed over 3 million hours without a lost time incident. The facility is currently in a start-up, and we expect to begin delivering hydrogen to our pipeline system this month. Finally, following many years of hard work, we announced the $1 billion acquisition of the natural gas to Syngas plant in Uzbekistan, as part of one of the most advanced energy plans in the world. This acquisition includes the 2 largest autothermal reformer in the world, in short ATR.\nThis is the same ATR technology we're deploying in our Net-zero energy complex in Edmonton, Canada. This will further enhance our industry-leading hydrogen production capabilities. driven by our own partial oxidation technology, in short POX, POX. This is the technology we have acquired from GE several years ago. The POX technology, which we are deploying in our clean energy complex in Louisiana has been a proven main stay for efficient syngas generation for many decades. We will elaborate multiple box units at the Louisiana facility, each of which will be the world's largest. POX and ATR are the 2 leading processes for the production of blue hydrogen, having the capability and the flexibility to use both leading technology to produce a blue hydrogen at word scale, will further extend our leadership in low carbon hydrogen production.\nNow please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, Americas EBITDA was up 18%. And driven by higher price and volume. Merchant price improved 11%, which corresponded to 4% improvement for the region overall. Volume grew 6% and driven by on-site, including strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA margin jumped more than 1,100 basis points, driven by strong price, lower energy pass-through, which drove about 3/4 of the margin improvement. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 10%, mainly on better hydrogen volume and lower variable costs. Lower energy cost pass-through also drove roughly around 2/3 of the margin improvement.\nNow please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our AGS segment results. Our results in Asia improved despite the currency headwinds to recovery in China and higher energy costs across the region. Compared to last year, EBITDA was up 10%, despite a 5% negative currency impact. Positive price and volume more than offset higher costs. Merchant price increased 9%, which more than offset higher variable costs. Volume improved 8% primarily to [indiscernible] on site, including the addition of over 30 new assets in the past year. Our activities in the electronics sector were [ Battelle ] robust accounting for many of the new projects. We also added projects in the chemicals, glass and other applications. Sequentially, volume was up 2% following the Lunar New Year holidays.\nPlease now turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Europe segment results. Our team in Europe has worked hard to maintain positive momentum. Compared to last year, EBITDA increased more than 20%, driven by the impact of our pricing actions. Merchant price improved 10%, which equates to a 6% gain for the overall region. This is the second 7th consecutive quarter of double-digit merchant price gains for the region. Volume was up modestly on [ but our ] on-site. This is particularly driven by improvement in hydrogen. This more than offset weaker demand for merchant products. EBITDA margin was about 800 basis points higher and included the impact of lower energy cost pass-through, which benefited margin by around 300 basis points. Sequentially, the region's EBITDA held steady as favorable energy costs offset the lower price. Lower energy cost pass-through also benefited EBITDA margin by about 150 basis points.\nNow please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. compared to last year for our merchant volume and the price push higher, but increased costs negatively impacted operating income. The second phase of the [ Jiutai ] project, which we closed in mid-January of this year added to our equity affiliate income, and it drove the region's overall results. The Jiutai project has contributed as we expected consistent with our commitment. Please now turn to Slide 19 for our Corporate and Other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses, as well as our centrally managed function and corporate costs. The sales and profit for this segment were lower this quarter due to lower sale of equipment activities, and higher costs resulting from ongoing support for our growth strategy. We do, however, continue to have robust discussions with customers interested in our LNG technology and equipment. We're pleased to announce 2 significant sale of equipment project wins with Qatargas and next decade. This is in addition to the 2 project wins announced in May.\nWe plan to expand our production facility in Florida again and expect increasing LNG project activities to improve the segment results. Pacing what Seifi and Melissa have mentioned earlier, the outstanding results this quarter again show the resilience of our people and our businesses. I also would like to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of our teams around the world. I would like now to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #20. Our third quarter results exceeded our previous guidance. However, the outlook for economic conditions around the world remain uncertain. We have again raised our fiscal year 2023 guidance by 5% at the midpoint of $11.40 to $11.50 earnings per share for the year versus the $11.30 to $11.50 we had provided last quarter.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share guidance is $3.04 to $3.14, up 7% to 10% over last year. We still see our CapEx for the year to be about $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Now please turn to Slide #21. The people of Air Products are passionate about helping to solve the Board's significant energy and environmental challenges. Their commitment and motivation continues to drive our performance. In our core industrial gases business, we are demonstrating continued strength and resiliency even against a soft economic backdrop. And we continue to bring plants online and entered a new phase where we will bring additional large-scale projects on the stream. As a result of that, we see a great future for Air Products and that is what makes all of us very excited about working here and being part of the global energy transition movement. At this time, we will be delighted to answer your questions."

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.\nBeginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar. Please go ahead.\n\nSiddharth Manjeshwar\n\nVP, Corporate Treasurer & Lead Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.\nAfter our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.\nToday's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings, capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide #2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.\nNow I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I am proud to say that our people delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter, continuing to grow our business in a challenging environment. Our team also continued to make great progress in executing our growth strategy, which is focused on the production of low-carbon and zero carbon hydrogen. I would like to thank each one of our talented, dedicated and motivated employees at Air Products for their commitment and hard work.\nNow please turn to Slide #3, our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. As you can see, we have made significant progress since 2014, but we are always working hard to do better. I want to make it clear that our goal is to achieve 0 incidents and 0 accidents.\nSlide #4, which we have shown you many, many times before, summarizes our management philosophy which is critical to Air Products' success and will continue to guide our actions as we move forward.\nNow please turn to Slide #5. Our second quarter adjusted earnings of $2.74 per share improved $0.40 or 17% versus last year despite the lingering economic headwinds in many parts of the world and exceeded the top line of our guidance for the quarter. We have consistently delivered earnings and top line growth driven by both price and volume, which were collectively up 14% for the quarter versus quarter of last year. We also brought new projects onstream that further enhance our earnings. Our roughly $16 billion of backlog with more than $11 billion focused on energy transition will continue to drive long-term earnings growth.\nNow please turn to Slide #6. As mentioned last quarter, we have again raised our quarterly dividend this year up 8% to $1.75 per share per quarter, extending our record of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to pay out more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in 2023, demonstrating our commitment to return cash to shareholders.\nNow please turn to Slide #7, which shows our EBITDA margin trend. This continues to be my favorite slide as it shows our business performance over time. We were happy to see our margins improve over the past 2 quarters after the decline which was caused largely due to the dilutive effect of higher energy cost pass-through that increases our sales but doesn't increase our bottom line. We expect our margin to move higher as energy costs decrease while we continue to improve productivity in our base business and add new projects.\nNow please turn to Slide #8, where I would like to share a few thoughts on our hydrogen strategy. We knew being a first mover in real mega projects has its challenges and that novel ideas and approaches are sometimes met with skepticism initially. When we launched the NEOM green hydrogen project 3 years ago, we were the first hydrogen producer to capitalize on the ideal renewable energy resources in the Middle East and the first to recognize ammonia's potential as an effective transport medium for hydrogen. When we announced the Louisiana blue hydrogen project in 2021, we were again first mover to act on carbon capture and sequestration on the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nNow the promise of clean energy is a reality. These projects have gained significant government support around the world, and many companies have since followed our lead and want to become a hydrogen company, announcing large clean hydrogen projects and exploring ammonia dissociation innovation. We believe these developments are actually good for the industry because a successful energy transition will require the work of many different companies, organizations and governments around the world. However, as a global leading hydrogen producer, we are confident that our experience, know-how and proprietary assets will continue to capture the first mover advantage and support Air Products' success in leading clean energy and clean hydrogen development for the decades to come.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, our business performed very well this quarter despite significant macroeconomic headwinds. Price and volume gained 14% and all profit metrics were up double digits versus last year. I, too, would like to thank the Air Products team for their continued outstanding efforts.\nIn March, we were proud to announce the successful issuance of our first-of-its-kind green bond with principal amount of USD 600 million and EUR 700 million after publishing our green finance framework. With these offerings, air Products became the first investment-grade U.S. issuer to execute multicurrency green bonds on the same day. Additionally, we are very proud to be the first U.S. chemical company to qualify green and blue hydrogen projects as an eligible expenditure category, which further demonstrates our position as a leader in advancing the world's energy transition.\nNow please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our second quarter results. In comparison to last year, volumes increased 6% driven primarily by better on-site activities. Volume has been positive for 8 consecutive quarters. Merchant price is 18% higher compared to last year, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This equates to an 8% price gain for the total company, for which we saw positive price gains across all regions. This partially was offset by a 1% lower energy cost pass-through and currency translation from the strong U.S. dollar, which reduced both sales and EBITDA by about 4%.\nDespite this headwind, EBITDA improved 13%, and EBITDA margin was 140 basis points higher as strong price, volume and the contribution from the second phase of the Jazan project more than offset higher costs. ROCE climbed steadily, reaching 11.7%, which is 140 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects onstream and continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.5% this quarter. Sequentially, volume was up 3% driven by improvement in merchant and our on-site business. EBITDA was up 6%, driven by better volume and equity affiliate results.\nNow please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our earnings per share results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings of $1.97 per share included 2 non-GAAP items, which had a combined impact of $0.77 per share. First, we recorded a $0.69 charge for business and asset actions primarily related to our previously announced decision to withdraw from Indonesia coal gasification and permanently suspend the construction of a plant in Ukraine due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding Russia's invasion of the country.\nSecondly, the nonservice components of our defined benefit plans resulted in an $0.08 cost this year versus a $0.04 gain last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items, our second quarter adjusted earnings was $2.74 per share, up $0.40 or 17% compared to last year, driven by strong pricing and higher equity affiliate income, Price, volume and cost together added $0.40. Our price actions more than offset variable cost increases. Price, net of variable costs, contributed over $0.70 this quarter, and volume improvements contributed an additional $0.12. Cost was a headwind of $0.44, but this increase does not represent our new run rate.\nIn addition to inflation and costs related to the execution of our growth strategy, this quarter we saw increased planned maintenance activities, the onstream project costs and other onetime items we do not expect to repeat. Meanwhile, the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project and good results from our other unconsolidated joint ventures in the Americas and Europe drove equity affiliate income $0.16 higher. Our consolidated joint ventures also performed well this quarter. And we shared the improved results with our partners as shown in the noncontrolling interest line.\nThe effective tax rate was 120 basis points unfavorable due to lower tax benefits this year. We still expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% for FY 2023.\nNow please turn to Slide 11. Our distributable cash flow continued to improve, driven by growing EBITDA and stable cash expenses, including interest, cash tax and maintenance CapEx. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $3.2 billion of distributable cash flow or over $14 per share. From our distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% and $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders while maintaining more than $1.7 billion to invest for growth. Our ability to grow cash flow, especially in challenging conditions, demonstrates the strength and stability of our business, which enables us to continue creating shareholder value by increasing dividends and deploying capital for our high-return projects.\nSlide 12 provides an update of our capital deployment. Our capital deployment potential through fiscal 2027 remained stable at roughly $35 billion, which includes over $7 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, about $15 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and $13 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity.\nAs always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. We have adjusted our backlog to reflect our recent developments, including the successful completion of our second phase of the Jazan project, the lower equity contribution for NEOM expected from the finalization of the project financing and our withdrawal from coal gasification in Indonesia. Our current backlog of about $16 billion will provide a substantial amount of growth in the future, and we are looking to add additional projects.\nWe have already spent 37% and committed 17% of the updated capacity we show on this slide. We have made great progress and still has substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. We continue to evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use the available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders.\nNow to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Serhan.\n\nSamir Jawdat Serhan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Melissa. During the second quarter, we saw broad-based improvements across our businesses. Results improved in each of our regional segments versus last year, driven by strong price and volume. Our commercial teams around the world worked hard to make sure that we realize the value of our offerings. And we successfully brought in new projects onstream to help drive our results. We saw elevated planned maintenance activity due to customer turnarounds in multiple regions, but our volumes again improved this quarter.\nIn addition to energy transition-related investment, we see significant investment opportunities of various project sizes in our base business. We continue to win our fair share of traditional projects across the region and in various industries. Our small to midsized project activities in Asia were particularly robust. We continue to see strength in our small to midsized on-site business globally.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, Americas EBITDA was up 14%, supported by higher price and volume. Merchant price improved 21%, the third quarter in a row that we exceeded a 20% increase. On-site volumes were up on a strong hydrogen demand. EBITDA margin of 37% was roughly flat as positive price offset higher costs largely driven by higher planned maintenance activity, inflation and other onetime items. Sequentially, EBITDA was flat as favorable price and equity affiliate income offset higher costs.\nAdditionally, we also enjoyed successes in larger traditional projects. Yesterday, we announced 2 new world-scale carbon monoxide projects in Texas with secured long-term off-take contracts from Eastman and LyondellBasell. This project will expand our world's largest carbon monoxide pipeline network in the U.S. Gulf Coast and enhance supplier reliability to our customers. We are committed to our base business while pursuing our growth strategy in low- and zero-carbon hydrogen.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 for a review of our Asia segment results. Our results in Asia improved despite the lingering effect of COVID-19 in certain parts of China and higher energy costs. Compared to last year, EBITDA was up almost 10% despite a 7% negative currency impact. Merchant price improved to 12%, which more than offset higher variable costs. Volume improved 7% driven by [ volume ] on site, including the addition of over 13 new assets in the past year, mostly in electronics, glass and chemical application. Sequentially, Volume was flat as the new assets offset the seasonal Lunar New Year slowdown.\nNow please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Europe segment results. For Europe, compared to last year, the story is price. And nearly 20% gain in merchant pricing drove the region's profits and margins significantly higher. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit merchant price gain for the region. Additionally, on-site activities backed up as we saw a recovery in our hydrogen volumes. EBITDA increased more than 30%, while EBITDA margin was more than 750 basis points higher as energy costs continue to come down. Sequentially, EBITDA was higher driven by favorable volume and equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin also improved, driven by the higher volumes and equity affiliate income as well as the lower energy cost pass-through.\nNow please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Stronger base volume increased sales but higher maintenance activity negatively impacted operating income. The second phase of Jazan project, which we closed in mid-January, added to our equity affiliate income and it drove EBITDA higher. Both the first and second phases of Jazan project have contributed as we expected, consistent with our commitment.\nPlease turn to Slide 17 for our Corporate and Other segment results. This segment includes our sale of [ equipment ] businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. The sales and profit for our Corporate and Other segment were lower this quarter, driven by a lower contribution from our sale of equipment business. and higher cost as we continue to add resources to support our growth strategy. Customers are very interested in our LNG technology and equipment, and we are pleased to see that our work resulted in 4 project wins recently. We announced 2 significant LNG sell of equipment projects and we look forward to making additional announcements in the future.\nAs Seifi and Melissa have already mentioned, the outstanding results of this quarter are a testament of the resilience to our business and the hard work and commitment of our people around the world. I would like now to turn the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #18. Our second quarter results exceeded our previous guidance. However, the outlook for the global economy as a whole remains uncertain. Therefore, we have modestly raised our fiscal year 2023 guidance to $11.30 to $11.50 per share versus $11.20 to $11.50 announced last quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share guidance is $2.85 to $2.95, up 10% to 14% over last year. We still see our CapEx at around $5 billion to $5.5 billion for this year, including the approximately $1 billion that we paid for the second phase of the Jazan project.\nNow please turn to Slide #19. Air Products was, 80 years ago, the pioneer of the on-site business model, and we were also the first to develop the on-site hydrogen business. Now we are again spearheading the development of large low-carbon intensity hydrogen projects to address the enormous opportunities provided by the energy transition. This drive to lead is part of our culture and shared by our people who have the courage to lead the charge. As I have mentioned many times, the long-term competitive advantage of an enterprise is rooted in the commitment and motivation of its people. This principle has been clearly demonstrated by our past and the leaders into the future. It is our people and their commitment and motivation.\nNow we are very pleased to answer your questions. Operator, we are ready for questions."

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Sid Manjeshwar. Please go ahead.\n\nSiddharth Manjeshwar\n\nVP, Corporate Treasurer & Lead IR, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kalie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Sid Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Simon Moore, our Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability who, as previously announced, will be retired at the end of March.\nAfter our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2.\nIn addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a total company and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed.\nReconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant Earnings Release section.\nNow I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sid, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I am proud to say that the people at Air Products delivered great results this quarter despite the significant macroeconomic headwinds. I would like to thank each of our talented, dedicated and motivated employees for their hard work.\nNow please turn to Slide #3, our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. As you can see, we have made significant progress since 2014, but we always work hard to do better. Our goal is to achieve 0 incidents and 0 accidents.\nNow please turn to Slide #4. For the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share was $2.64, an improvement of $0.16 per share or 6% versus last year. But our underlying performance versus last year was much better than that. The items that you need to consider to make a fair comparison versus last year are a $0.15 negative impact from currency and a one-time gain of $0.20 in the first quarter of last year from the finalization of the Jazan ASU joint venture. I would like to point out also that our guidance for the first quarter was to deliver earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.80. Our actual EPS is $2.64, which is within our guidance, but at the lower end. The principal reason is that the Chinese and European economies were weaker than our expectation in early November when we gave you the forecast.\nNow please turn to Slide #5. We are committed to reporting our shareholders while pursuing our long-term growth strategy. I am pleased to say that we have again raised our quarterly dividend this time by 8% to $1.75 per share per quarter or $7 a share on an annual basis, extending our record of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to pay out more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in 2023, reflecting our commitment at -- to return cash to our shareholders.\nNow please go to Slide #6. (inaudible) which shows our EBITDA margins. While energy costs remain high, our margin improved this quarter. Our team has worked hard on increasing prices to offset the higher energy costs in our merchant business, and we continue to work on productivity. I would also like to point out that 3 quarters of the margin decline since the peak margin of around 42% is due to higher energy cost pass-through in our on-site business, which increases our sales but does not impact our profit.\nNow please turn to Slide #7. In addition to delivering strong results, we also achieved several significant project milestones during the quarter. In December 2022, we were very excited to announce our $4 billion green hydrogen project in the United States. This project will be located in Northern Texas and is our latest megascale 0 carbon, which means green hydrogen project since the announcement of our revolutionary NEOM green hydrogen project in 2020, and it is the by far the largest green hydrogen project in the United States.\nThe information about this project and the recording of our December 8 webcast is on the -- for this project are available on our website.\nNow please turn to Slide #8. We were pleased to announce on January 19 the completion of the second phase of the $12 billion Jazan gasification and power project, which is 51% majority owned by Air Products, and it is 60% project finance.\nDuring the first quarter -- with the first phase of this project, which was completed in October of 2021, Air Products contributed (inaudible) for the purchase of $7.1 billion of assets from Saudi Aramco. In the second phase, which was just completed, Air Products contributed an additional $900 million for the purchase of $4.2 [billion] of additional assets. Our total cash contribution for this project is $2.5 billion. As expected, the first phase of the project at end was $0.80 to $0.85 per share on an annual basis, which significantly contributed to our results in fiscal year 2022.\nWith the completion of the second phase, we now expect about a total of (inaudible) per share of earning contribution on an annual basis. This is fully in line with what we announced to investors more than 3 years ago.\nNow please turn to Slide #9. Today, I wanted to provide you with an update on our great NEOM green hydrogen project, which is appropriate to give you an update since we are very close to completing a major milestone, which is signing the definitive project financing agreements for this project. And therefore, we wanted to give you an update before you read about that in the next few weeks. We have been making excellent progress on this world-scale project to bring energy to the world.\nThe engineering is now about 30% complete. All major subcontracts for the project have been awarded, including the electrolyzers and the power plant and all that. Land preparation is completed and construction has started, and the joint venture team is in place and executing the projects.\nNow please turn to Slide #10. As you know, Air Products has a [one-time] ownership position of the NEOM production joint ventures. But importantly -- and this is very important, we remain the sole off-taker of 100% of the green hydrogen produced in the form of green ammonia produced at this facility under an exclusive 30-year contract. We continue to see significant opportunities to use this green ammonia to bring green hydrogen to consumers around the world.\nAnd as I said, we are the sole off-taker and distributor of this product. Then I want to emphasize that the offtake price for this green ammonia remains the same as when we negotiated the original project in the summer of 2020 when we announced the project. This is a very key point that the fact that now you're project -- financing this project, and as a result, we are absorbing all of the financing charges and so on. That has not changed the offtake price.\nThen, now please turn to Slide 11. Initially the 3 partners plan -- which are Air Products, NEOM, which is owned by PIF and ACWA Power, we intended to use our own cash to fund the project -- the total project. Over the past 2 years, we have seen significant interest from the global financial institutions who see tremendous value proposition on this project. Therefore, we got tempted and reconsidered, and we decided that the best course of action to minimize our cash contribution and maximize the return on the cash is to do nonrecourse project financing on this project.\nThe partners will contribute 25% cash and the remaining 75% in the nonrecourse project financing. And obviously, if you are doing nonrecourse project financing, you want to maximize the amount of money that you can borrow. Therefore, you put a lot of your ongoing cost and you bring it forward to the real present value and borrow against that. I would explain this a little bit more when we get to the detailed chart.\nThis means that Air Products -- this project financing means that now our cash contribution to this project will be $800 million -- less than $800 million, which is significantly less than the $1.7 billion that we originally expected. That is what you would expect us to do -- that is the whole point of project financing.\nNow please turn to Slide #12. I am pleased to say that the non-recourse financing is well underway and we are more than 2x oversubscribed from what we want to borrow. We have received commitments from over 20 global financial institutions, demonstrating their confidence in this project.\nLater this month, we expect to complete what we call the dry close, which is the signing of the definitive financing agreements, and we expect the full financial close to be completed a few months later. We will obviously let you know as we make progress on the project financing.\nNow please turn to Slide #13 so that I can provide you with an overview of the total project capital needs. First, the original $5 billion that we have mentioned before, for the capital required to build the facility, we have increased that, it has increased by about $0.5 billion due to inflationary pressure that everybody expects. Then in addition, we have further increased the project investment by $1.2 billion to include items that we were going to provide service from other people.\nBut now we want to provide those services ourselves in order to make the project totally self-contained, and we wouldn't be dependent on others. These include power transmission (inaudible) and other infrastructure that was needed for the project. This increases the capital cost or it decreases the operating cost, and we decided that was a better trade-off. But the key point was to make sure that the project is not dependent on other people doing servicing and people will have control over the whole thing so that when we come on (inaudible) we have everything that we need for the project to be operated.\nNow the other item that I'm sure will be a subject of questions from people is the $1.8 billion for project financing costs. That is a big number. But it is well explained why that is. Again, as I said, if you have project financing, you want to put and borrow as much money as you can.\nFirst of all, about $1 billion of that $1.8 billion is the interest during construction. So we are spending money. We want to borrow that money. There is an interest to that borrowing. Therefore, that adds up for the net total length of the project to about $1 billion. We want to finance that and borrow against that. Then we are using the land instead of leasing the land for 50 years, we decided to pay for the land upfront that reduces our ongoing cost, and we can project finance that. That is a [few] hundred million dollars, spares for the project. Usually you buy the spares as you go forward, we decided to buy all the spares upfront and finance it.\nSo those are the kind of costs that comprise the $1.8 billion. It makes a lot of sense, and that is the beauty of project finance that you can -- you have the flexibility of bringing forward a lot of your costs that will save you operating costs in the future. So all together, the total funding needed for the product is $8.5 billion.\nNow please turn to Slide 14, which is the overview of the funding. As I described before, the $8.5 billion is made up $6.2 billion of nonrecourse debt, which we wanted to maximize and $2.3 billion of cash from the 3 partners. Therefore, obviously, the Air Products cash contributions is (inaudible) which is less than $800 million. And this is as compared to the $1.7 billion that we originally expected.\nSo overall, we are very pleased with where we are. We are very pleased with the fact that we are project financing this thing, minimizing our cash flow, and we are very pleased that the price that we are paying for the ammonia has stayed the same as it was in 2020. We are very optimistic about projects and the prospects for a good return for the total supply chain as we go forward.\nNow please turn to Slide #15. I would like to summarize the discussion by sharing thoughts about our strategy. As I have mentioned before, there are 2 pillars for growth strategy of Air Products and sustainability is the foundation for both of them. Through our core industrial gas business, we supply customers in dozens of industries with critical products and services that lower emissions and increase efficiency and productivity. Through our Blue and Green hydrogen megaproject of the future, we will commit more than $15 billion by 2027 to deliver clean hydrogen at a scale helping to drive the energy transition and moving humanity forward. These 2 pillars, which support each other for success put us in the heart of solving the Board's needs for -- the Board's needs for sustainable energy and environmental solutions. I'm proud to say that the people of Air Products have continued to drive results in the near term and make excellent progress in executing our growth project as we move forward.\nThe Slide #16 summarizes our management principles, which I reiterate every quarter. These principles are critical to Air Products' success and will continue to guide us in the future. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Melissa, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, we've delivered another set of impressive results this quarter even with significant macroeconomic headwinds. Our commercial teams across the region continue to execute price actions and their efforts paid off. Price drove the 25% operating income improvement despite a significant negative currency impact, and operating margin was also 300 basis points higher compared to last year.\nI also would like to thank the team at Air Product for their continued outstanding efforts.\nNow please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our first quarter results. In comparison to last year, sales, volume and price were up nearly 10%. The 7% gain in price for the total company equaled a nearly 20% improvement in merchant price compared to last year, the fifth quarter in a row of double-digit increase. Volumes were up 2% higher, driven by better on-site in merchants, but partially offset by lower sales of equipment activities. Volumes were strong in America and Asia, but weaker in Europe. Currency translation from the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced sales by about 6% and lower operating income by 8%. Despite this headwind, operating income is up 25% and operating margin was 300 basis points higher, primarily driven by strong pricing. Operating income was higher across the region and particularly strong in America and Europe.\nImprovements in EBITDA and EBITDA margins were not as significant as operating income and operating margins due to the prior year onetime items primarily related to the Jazan ASU joint venture finalization. ROCE has climbed steadily over the last 6 quarters, reaching 11.3%, which is 120 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on stream and continue to put our cash on the balance sheet to work.\nAdjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.3% this quarter. Sequentially, volume was weaker following a strong prior quarter, which also benefited from cost sales and a favorable contract [addendum]. Price continues to gain strength across the region. Merchant price improved 3% versus last quarter. EBITDA was down 5%, primarily due to weaker volumes, while EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points as positive price and energy cost pass-through more than offset the lower volume.\nNow please turn to Slide 18 for a discussion of our earnings per share results. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.64 per share this year, up $0.60 or 6% compared to last year. Strong price drove the improved results. Price, net of variable costs contributed over $0.70 this quarter as our price actions more than offset the higher variable cost increases. Cost was $0.11 unfavorable primarily due to inflation and higher maintenance. Price, volume and cost together added $0.63 or a 25% increase compared to last year.\nHowever, the negative $0.15 from currency and a roughly $0.20 of prior year onetime benefit associated with the finalization of the Jazan ASU joint venture moderates a strong underlying result. The Jazan item accounted for much of the $0.14 decline in equity affiliates' income and an unfavorable $0.10 in noncontrolling interest. The effective tax rate of 19.1% was 210 basis points unfavorable due to less tax benefit this year.\nWe expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2023. For the quarter, a non-service component of our defined benefit plans were favorable $0.04 last year and unfavorable $0.07 this year. As I shared with you last quarter, we now exclude the component from our adjusted results.\nNow please turn to Slide 19. Our distributable cash flow continued to climb, driven by improving EBITDA. While cash expenses included interest, cash tax and maintenance CapEx remains relatively stable over the last 3 years. Over the last 12 months, we generated close to $3.1 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $14 per share. From our distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders while still having almost $1.7 billion to invest for growth. Our ability to grow distributable cash flow, especially in challenging conditions demonstrates the strength and stability of our business. It enabled us to continue to create shareholder value by increasing dividend and deploying capital for high-return projects.\nSlide 20 provides an update of our capital deployment. As you can see, we have over $36 billion of capital deployment potential through fiscal 2027. The $36 billion includes over $8 billion of cash, additional debt capacity available today, about $17 billion, we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $12 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity.\nAs always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. So you can see our backlog of nearly $20 billion will provide a substantial amount of growth in the future. However, please note this figure still includes the second phase of Jazan project that was completed in January as well as the capital required for NEOM at its original higher value as we work through the finalization of project financing.\nMoreover, we will include the $4 billion Texas green hydrogen project when the project reaches final investment decision. We have already spent over 30% and committed 74% of the updated capacity we show on this slide. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. We continue to evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use available cash and trusted to us by our shareholders. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #21 for our Asia first quarter results. Our businesses were able to deliver positive volume and price despite the negative COVID impact in certain parts of China. Volume improved 7% supported by new assets. This quarter, we benefited from more than 25 new small to midsized traditional industrial gas plants which came on stream across the region over the last years. Price was up 1% in total, which is -- which translates to 3% in our merchant business. Although underlying sales grew 8% versus last year and energy pass-through was a positive 2%. Overall, sales (inaudible) offset by a 10% weaker currency, which is obviously translation.\nNegative currency also reduced operating income and EBITDA each by about 10%. Operating income and EBITDA both improved versus prior year as better volume and price more than offset the negative COVID impact. Higher price and volume also drove margin improvement. Although China's government has relaxed its rules related to COVID, their subsequent high infection rates have impacted business activity. We expect economic recovery in China to take time. We anticipate power cost across the region to continue to rise, and we are taking action, which I mean pricing action, to mitigate the impact. Sequentially results compared unfavorably to last quarter, which benefited from some specific spot sales.\nAt this point, I would like to turn the call over to Sid to discuss our European results. Sid?\n\nSiddharth Manjeshwar\n\nVP, Corporate Treasurer & Lead IR, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 22. As the chart shows, power costs for Europe moderated sequentially this quarter, but are still at a historically elevated level. Our commercial team has executed significant price actions to compensate to these costs in our merchant business and their hard work has paid off. Although we have fully recovered the higher power costs for the quarter, we are keeping a close eye on the dynamic power market in this region.\nAs a reminder, power costs in our merchant business is the primary focus when managing the escalating energy costs in Europe. Our on-site business has contractual pass-through, which enables us to pass energy cost to our customers and almost all our national gas usage is for on-site hydrogen production.\nNow please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our Europe results. Successful price actions, we have worked hard to implement the last few quarters, drove the significant improvement in Europe's results. Compared to prior year, price increased 14% for the regions corresponding to a 24% improvement in merchant pricing. Volume declined 6%, reflecting challenging conditions in the region. Demand for our hydrogen was weaker as customers continued to optimize their own hydrogen operations.\nOur merchant business was lower, partly due to the divestment of our business in Russia. Energy cost pass-through was up 9% due to higher natural gas costs although it had no impact in profit. Operating income jumped nearly 50%, while EBITDA was up almost 30%, primarily due to strong price. Although unfavorable currencies reduced operating income and EBITDA, each by more than 10%. Price primarily drove more than 400 basis point, EBITDA margin increase. This was net of the higher energy cost pass-through, which lowered the margin by about 200 basis points.\nCompared to the prior quarter, volume was unfavorable due to weaker merchant this quarter and a favorable contract amendment in the prior quarter.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a discussion of our other segments.\n\nSamir J. Serhan\n\nCOO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sid. Now please turn to Slide 24 for a review of our Americas results. Underlying sales increased 15% despite the adverse effect of severe weather in December. Price improved further by 9%. This is equivalent to a 26% increase in the merchant business. Our team in the Americas has successfully raised the prices to cover the higher energy cost. Volume grew 6% due to better merchant and on-site, volume also benefited from a new short-term agreement, which will benefit Americas results for the next few quarters.\nOperating income was up to almost 30% over last year. And operating margin improved 300 basis points, driven primarily by the strong price. Volume also contributed to profits, but costs were unfavorable. EBITDA improved less than operating income because of our lower equity affiliate income due to unfavorable onetime items and lower medical oxygen volume in Mexico as the COVID impact subsided.\nSequentially, the price continued to gain strength. Merchant price was up 7%, but volume was down 3%, following a strong previous quarter. EBITDA margin improved by around 400 basis points, primarily due to lower energy cost pass-through which accounted for three-quarters of that. We expect our planned maintenance activity to increase next quarter in parallel with our customers' plan turnaround.\nPlease now turn to Slide 26 for our corporate segment. This segment includes our -- I'm sorry.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nSamir, you need to describe (inaudible) Slide #25, please?\n\nSamir J. Serhan\n\nCOO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nI'm sorry, review the Middle East results and India before going to that. So please -- lets go to Slide 25 first for review of our Middle East and India segment. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly owned operations are smaller in size. However, the segment's EBITDA is significant, it includes the equity affiliate income related to the Jazan gasification and power joint venture, our India joint venture, (inaudible) Air Products and other joint ventures.\nFor the quarter, an acquisition benefited sales and operating income versus last year but was partially offset by land maintenance activities.\nAlthough our share of the ongoing Jazan gasification and power joint venture net profit added to the region's results, the equity affiliate income declined by $28 million primarily due to the onetime benefit associated with the Jazan ASU joint venture finalization in the first quarter of last year. As Seifi mentioned before, we have successfully completed the second phase of the Jazan gasification and power project, and we have begun to receive additional income in the second quarter.\nNow please turn to Slide 26 for our Corporate segment. This segment includes our sales of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. For our sale of equipment activities, our LNG business historically has been the anchor, but our non-LNG related project activities have also grown in recent years to become major contributors to this segment. The cadence of project activities and timing of sales and profit recognition can vary the segment results. Our ongoing effort to support our growth strategy has also increased the centrally managed functions and corporate costs.\nFor the quarter, the segment sales and profits were lower than last year, primarily due to lower sale of equipment project activities. We also continue to add resources to support our growth strategy. As mentioned before, inquiries for potential LNG projects have picked up recently. However, these projects take time to develop. We're excited, however, that we have signed 1 new agreement in the quarter and working hard to sign additional new projects.\nAt this point, I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing [comment.] Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #27. The outlook for the global economy remains uncertain. However, we remain confident in Air Products and the prospects that we have in the future and the stability of our business which is supported by our robust capital deployment strategy as you have seen. Therefore, for fiscal year 2023, we have left our guidance unchanged despite the significant uncertainties that exists in the world.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal year '23, which is usually our weakest quarter. Our earnings per share guidance is $2.50 to $2.70, up 7% to 15% over last year. We still see our CapEx at $5 billion to $5.5 billion for the year, including the approximately $1 billion for the completion of the Jazan project that we just talked about.\nNow please turn to Slide #28. We include this slide in all our earnings call presentations. It describes very clearly my view that an enterprise can only be successful for the long term when the people in the enterprise are motivated and committed to emission. And Air Products are higher pipes. Our mission as a company is to bring people together so that they can collaborate and innovate solutions to the world's most significant energy, environmental and sustainability challenges. We continue to build a diverse and inclusive culture. There are more than 21,000 people, feel they belong and matter and are motivated to achieve our goals. I believe Air Products is uniquely positioned to help the Board transition to a cleaner and better future, and we are putting our efforts toward that each and every day.\nNow we are very pleased to answer your questions. Operator, we are ready for questions."

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved.\nBeginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore.\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Sidd Manjeshwar, our Vice President and Corporate Treasurer. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most direct with comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.\nNow I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. I am extremely proud to say that Air Products, with grit and determination, has again made great progress this year despite macroeconomic headwinds. We exceeded our financial goals, had great results and, at the same time, reached many key milestones that significantly advanced our growth strategy. I would like to thank each one of our talented, dedicated and motivated employees at Air Products for their exceptional efforts. I'm proud to be working alongside them as they continue to deliver strong near-term results as well as executing our long-term strategy.\nBefore I discuss our results, I would like to share some good news. In his opening comments, Simon mentioned that Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar is joining us on our call today. In addition to Sidd's existing responsibilities as our Corporate Treasurer, he will also be taking on the additional responsibility for leading our Investor Relations team. As we shared last quarter, Simon is planning to retire at the end of March 2023. For the next few months, Simon and Sidd will be working closely together to ensure a smooth transition. Sidd brings a breadth of knowledge and expertise across finance disciplines. And since joining Air Products in April of 2021, he has played a key role in supporting our financial policies and strategies. I know he will be an exceptional and excellent resource for our investors and analysts as we continue to communicate and execute our growth strategy. Sidd, congratulations from all of us. And would you like to say something at this stage?\n\nSidd Manjeshwar\n\nThank you, Seifi. I appreciate your kind words, and I'm humbled and honored to be part of this tremendous team and to be taking on these additional responsibilities. I am very much looking forward to meeting with our analysts and investors and continue the great work Simon has done to engage them and share our exciting growth strategy. Thank you once again, and I look forward to connecting with everyone.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sidd. And now please turn to Slide #3. Before I will discuss our results, I would like to highlight our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. We continue to make progress, but we can always do more to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees. Our ultimate goal is a zero incidents and accidents.\nNow please turn to Slide #4. For fiscal year 2022, our business delivered strong earnings per share of $10.41, an increase of 15% compared to last year. Price and volume both improved across the regions, and the Jazan project contributed as expected. Our team delivered these impressive results despite a $0.24 per share headwind from currency and challenging macroeconomic environment. These results for sure confirm the resilience of our business portfolio and the absolute commitment of our people to deliver near-term results.\nNow please turn to Slide #5. These excellent results confirm once again that Air Products has the capacity to deliver near-term performance while executing our ambitious long-term growth strategy.\nOn Slide #6, you see that since 2014, our goal has been to deliver an average EPS growth of 10% per year. In the last 8 years, we have exceeded this goal and delivered 11% for this time period. As you can see on Slide #7, we have consistently delivered positive earnings growth since 2014 regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. Our onsite business with its take-or-pay contracts gives us downside protection, and our merchant business, having volume and price flexibility, and provide upside potential. In addition, our backlog of nearly $20 billion will add significant long-term growth in the future.\nNow I'm on Slide #8. For fiscal year 2023, our guidance is to continue this trend and deliver adjusted earnings per share of $11.20 to $11.50. I would discuss our guideline in more detail later in the call.\nNow please turn to Slide #9. The strength and the stability of our business provides a secure steady cash flow, and we are committed to reward our shareholders by paying a healthy dividend. The whole team is very proud that we have provided 40 consecutive years of dividend increase to our shareholders. This extraordinary achievement is a testament to our people and their strength and stability of our business.\nOn Slide #10, you can see that our dividend has grown 10% per year on the average in the past 8 years, mirroring our earnings growth. We expect to return more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders in calendar 2022. And still have significant cash flow to support our growth opportunities.\nI would like to point out that on Slide #11, which is still my favorite slide, about 3 quarters of the decline since the peak margin was due to higher energy cost pass-through which increases our sales but does not impact profit.\nOn Slide #12, you can see a summary of our management principles, which I have shown to you every quarter in the past 8 years. These principles have guided and will continue to guide our performance as we go forward, and we intend to follow these policies consistently as we go forward.\nNow please turn to Slide #13, for a brief overview of our latest green hydrogen project that we announced recently. We took another significant step forward toward a clean hydrogen future by announcing our investment of about $500 million in a new green hydrogen project in Massena, New York, located on the banks on the St. Lawrence River. The facility will produce about 35 metric tons of green liquid hydrogen using almost 100 megawatts of hydroelectric power provided by the New York Power Authority. We are excited about this project since it broadens our renewable energy sources to include hydro power in addition to solar and green energy. It also demonstrates the growing support for the energy transition in the United States, which has been further reinforced with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. We are actively pursuing other project opportunities for green hydrogen in the United States, driven by this world-leading legislation. I look forward to sharing more information about these projects as we go forward.\nNow please turn to Slide #14. As you know, we announced our sustainable aviation fuel project with World Energy in April. This project is another great example of the investment opportunities that further support -- that is further supported by the Investment Reduction Act (sic) [Inflation Reduction Act] at legislation. We are -- as a result of that legislation and the incentives put for sustainable fuel aviation, we are expanding our scope. And now with investment -- we'll increase our investment from $2 billion to $2.5 billion in this project. We still expect that this project will contribute more than the minimum returns that we have promised you before. Projects like these are aligned with our energy transition strategy and will continue to drive our earnings now and well into the future.\nNow with that, I would like to turn the call to Melissa Schaeffer, our CFO. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned, our business performance -- performed very well despite the macroeconomic challenges this fiscal year. Our onsite business, which generates about half of our total company sales, once again held firm, while our merchant team successfully managed through the significant energy cost increases. Our people worked hard to overcome supply chain challenges across the region, keeping our facilities running and our customers supplied. I would like to thank the entire Air Products team for their hard work and a job well done.\nNow please turn to Slide 12 for an overview of our full year results. Underlying sales were strong, up 14%, with significant contributions for both price and volume. Overall, price increased 6%, which corresponds to a 15% increase in our merchant business. Year-over-year price improved every quarter in our last -- in our 3 largest regional segments and across most of our major product lines.\nOur volume grew 8%, driven by improved hydrogen, new plants, merchant demand and increased sales of equipment activity. EBITDA was up 9% due to favorable price, volume and equity affiliate income, which are partially offset by a higher cost and unfavorable currency. EBITDA margin was down just over 400 basis points and was negatively impacted by over 400 basis points by energy cost pass-through, which drove approximately half the total sales increase but added no profit. The impact of the energy cost pass-through was particularly noticeable in the Americas and Europe, where we have a meaningful hydrogen business.\nROCE has climbed steadily in the last 5 quarters reaching 11.2%, which is 110 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on stream and continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.6% this quarter.\nNow please turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of our full year EPS. Our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $1.39 or 15%. Volume was favorable at $0.80 and was particularly strong in Asia and the Americas. The increased sales equipment in our corporate segment also helped drive higher volume. Price more than offset the significant energy cost increases adding $0.81, driven by our strong price action in our 3 largest segments.\nOur other costs were $0.84 unfavorable and were driven by external factors, such as inflation and inefficiencies caused by COVID restrictions in certain parts of China as well as a supply chain disruption across the region. We also incurred additional costs purposefully to support our future growth. These include resources required to develop projects and bring them onstream as well as investments and facilities such as our new helium storage cavern, which will generate significant value in the future. We continue to closely monitor our costs and are focused on productivity actions across our businesses.\nCurrency lowered our earnings by $0.24 or 3% as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most key currencies the latter half of the fiscal year. Since the revenue and cost are denominated in their respective local currencies, this is primarily a translation rather than a transaction impact. Equity affiliate income was up $0.74, primarily due to the first phase of our Jazan project, which contributed as we committed. Our effective tax rate of 18.2% was 70 basis points lower than last year, and we expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2023. Interest expense was lower, adding $0.05 to earnings, primarily due to a reduced debt balance.\nNow please turn to Slide 14 for a review of our fourth quarter results. In comparison to last year, we achieved double-digit growth for both sales and profits as our teams worked hard to overcome considerable macroeconomic headwinds. Each region found its own success and achieved better results through its respective key drivers, which will be detailed later in the regional review.\nUnderlying sales were up 17% and with about equal contributions from both volume and price. Volumes are up 9% better, primarily in Asia and Americas, driven by new plants, recovery in hydrogen and better merchant volumes. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we achieved double-digit increase in merchant pricing, which was up 20% compared to last year. As cost pressures persist, we continue to work hard on pricing each region.\nCurrency translated from the strengthening U.S. dollar negatively impacted our results this quarter, reducing sales by about 6% and EBITDA by 5%. Despite this headwind, EBITDA increased 10% as favorable price, volume and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. The 450-basis point decline in EBITDA margin was primarily attributed to energy cost pass-through, which impacted margins by about 450 basis points.\nSequentially, volumes improved across all segments and price increased primarily due to actions in our Europe segment. EBITDA was up 6% sequentially, absorbing 3% of currency headwinds, and favorable price and volume more than offset higher costs.\nNow please turn to Slide 15. Our fourth quarter GAAP EPS was $2.56 per share and included a negative impact of $0.32 for 2 non-GAAP items, both of which were noncash. First, we recognized a $0.27 per share loss on the divestiture of our business in Russia, which we exited as a result of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as we had previously announced. This charge is separately presented as business and asset actions on our P&L. We also recognized a loss of $0.05 per share for the impairment of 2 small equity affiliates in Asia, which is included in the equity affiliate line item. Excluding the non-GAAP items, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.89 per share, an increase of $0.38 or 15% from prior year. We achieved this excellent result despite a negative $0.15 or 6% currency impact.\nPrice, volume and cost together contributed $0.46. Volume contributed $0.33 and was particularly strong in Asia and America. Price, net of variable costs, was favorable $0.39 with Asia, Europe and the Americas each achieving significant price improvements. Price has improved throughout the year due to the outstanding efforts of our regional teams who helped us improve our pricing, net of variable costs, from a modest negative impact in the first quarter to a positive impact in each quarter's since then.\nOther costs were $0.26 unfavorable. Almost half of the cost increases this quarter were due to higher incentive compensation, which is performance-based and reflective of our strong results. The remaining increase was primarily due to inflation supply chain disruptions, higher planned maintenance and the addition of resources needed to support our growth.\nCurrency was negative $0.15, and which was about $0.05 worse than we had expected when we provided Q4 guidance in July. The Jazan joint venture drove the improvement of equity affiliate income. However, many of our other equity affiliates compared unfavorably due to the strong performance last year, in part due to the lower medical oxygen demand for COVID this year.\nNow please turn to Slide 16. The stability of our business allows us to generate strong cash flow despite the challenging environment. In fiscal year 2022, we generated more than $3 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $14 per share, which is up 15% compared to last year. From our distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or roughly $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders. This leaves more than $1.7 billion available for high-return projects, 20% more than last year. This droves cash flow, especially in uncertain times, enable us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment for high-return projects.\nSlide 17 provides an update of our capital deployment. As you see, our capital deployment potential has increased to about $37 billion through fiscal 2027. The $37 billion includes over $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, more than $17 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and $11 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity.\nAs always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. So you can see, our backlog has grown to nearly $20 billion, which will provide substantial amount of growth in the future. We have already spent 30% and have already committed 73% of the updated capacity we show here. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. We continually evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders.\nBefore I turn the call back to Seifi, I would like to mention that starting first quarter of fiscal 2023, we will exclude the nonservice pension impact from our adjusted results. These nonservice-related components and our defined benefit plans, including effects of the changing interest rates and movements of the capital markets, are unrelated to our operations. By excluding these items, we believe that we can better provide visibility to our underlying results. The recap of earnings per share by quarter for fiscal year 2021 and 2022 are included in our reconciliation tables available on our websites. The EPS guidance for the first quarter and the full year of fiscal 2023, which Seifi will discuss in more detail later, reflects this change.\nNow to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #18 for our Asia fourth quarter results. Sales and profit both improved double digits despite the continued currency headwinds. Volume and price together were up 19%, but they're partially offset by 7% weaker currencies. Volume by itself was up 15%, benefiting from new, small to midsized traditional industrial gas plants in our onsite business across this region as well as an increase in spot opportunities for sales. Merchant price was 9% stronger than last year, which increased the region's overall sales by 3%. Price was up across the key countries and most major product lines.\nContinued COVID restrictions in certain parts of China modestly reduced volumes and created supply chain inefficiencies that contributed to higher distribution costs. EBITDA was up 13% after -- even after absorbing 7% of negative currencies as favorable volume and price more than offset unfavorable costs and a lower contribution from our equity affiliates. Sequentially, the strong volume drove both sales and profit increase versus the previous quarter.\nNow I would like to turn the call to Simon to talk about our European fourth quarter results. Simon?\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 22. Power cost recovery via price for our merchant business is a primary focus to manage the ever-higher energy costs in Europe. Our onsite business has contractual pass-through, which enables us to pass the energy cost to our customers, and almost all of our natural gas usage is for on-site hydrogen production. As the chart shows, power costs for Europe this quarter soared to more than 5x the level of the beginning of 2021. Our commercial team has tirelessly implemented price increases to compensate for these costs in our merchant business, turning a headwind at the beginning of the year to a tailwind by year-end. Although we have fully recovered the higher power costs for the year, we are keeping a watchful eye on energy costs heading into the winter season, and we remain focused on power cost recovery in this region.\nNow please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our Europe results. In addition to significant energy cost increases, unfavorable currency movements also pressured our European businesses. All major local currencies were weaker versus the U.S. dollar by double digits. Compared to prior year, price increased 19% for the region resulting from a 30% increase in merchant pricing. Prices were higher in all key subregions and product lines.\nOur volume was flat this quarter as a favorable contract amendment with an on-site electronics customer offset modestly weaker demand across our businesses. Additionally, our results no longer reflect our immaterial Russia business, which was divested in August. Negative currency reduced sales by 15% and EBITDA by 12% compared to last year. Despite this currency headwind, EBITDA improved 8% as positive price and better mix more than offset higher costs. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 750 basis points. Excluding this impact, margin was slightly higher than last year.\nCompared to the prior quarter, price contributed 5% via our ongoing price actions Volume added another 5% driven by better hydrogen activities following a planned customer turnaround last quarter and the previously mentioned contract amendment. Despite a 5% currency headwind, EBITDA was up 5% as better price and volume more than covered the higher costs. EBITDA margin was relatively flat, excluding the negative impact of higher energy cost pass-through. Compared to Q1 of this year, Europe's operating income has improved about $50 million or about 50%, thanks primarily to our team's successful pricing efforts.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a discussion of our other segments.\n\nSamir J. Serhan\n\nCOO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 24 for a review of our Americas results. Strong underlying sales accounted for half of the nearly 40% sales increase compared to last year, while the other half was due to higher energy cost pass-through, which had no profit impact but diluted our margins. Price improved for the region by 8%. This is equivalent to a 21% increase in our merchant business. Prices improved in all key product lines over last year. Our team in the Americas did an excellent job raising prices to more than cover the higher energy cost.\nVolume grew 12%, primarily due to improvements in merchant and hydrogen. We saw an increase in helium volume this quarter, and the demand for hydrogen has been climbing steadily in the past several quarters. We expect hydrogen to follow this recovery path as we move into 2023. Planned maintenance activities have declined compared to last quarter as expected, but they were higher compared to last year. Maintenance activities were significantly below average in the fourth quarter last year.\nEBITDA grew 8% over last year, driven by positive price and volume, partially offset by higher costs and lower equity affiliate income. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 650 basis points. Sequentially, volume was up 4% and improved across all product lines. Price was also favorable, 1%, more than covering the higher variable cost. EBITDA increased 7%, mainly due to better price, volume and lower planned maintenance, which more than offset higher of our costs.\nNow please turn to Slide 25 for a review of our Middle East and India segments. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly owned operations are smaller in size. The segment EBITDA is, however, significant since it includes the affiliate income related to the Jazan joint venture and our India joint venture in Air Products. For the quarter, sales were higher versus last year due to acquisitions.\nOperating income converted unfavorably to last year due to mainly unfavorable contract settlement in last year. We also expect planned maintenance activity to increase next quarter. The over $40 million increase in equity income included our share of the Jazan joint venture net profit, which is delivering as we expected. We have been receiving cash distributions from the joint venture.\nPlease turn to Slide 26 for our Corporate segment. This segment includes our share of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. For our sale of equipment activities, our LNG business historically has been (inaudible), but our non-LNG related project activities have grown in recent years to become major contributors for this segment. The cadence of the project activities and the timing of sales and profit recognition can vary the segment's results. Our ongoing effort to support our growth strategy has also increased the centrally managed functions and corporate costs.\nFor the fiscal year, the segment capital improved over $20 million, but the fourth quarter sales and profit were lower than last year primarily due to our sale of equipment project activities. We also added resources to support our product strategy. As mentioned before, increase for potential LNG projects have jumped recently, but they will not drive our near-term results as these projects take time to develop. We're working hard to signing new projects to maintain the good momentum in this segment.\nAt this point, I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing comments. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. We believe that investing in high-return projects is a better choice for our shareholders and share buyback in the long term. We are also confident that we can deliver on near-term results while achieving our long-term goals. Although the projects that we seek to execute are large and take time, we have the competencies and the people to execute these projects and have been diligently working on them for many years to get to where we are.\nNow Air Products has entered a new phase of our company's evolution, in which we expect a steady stream of meaningful contribution from these new projects going forward and for years to come. By choosing capital deployment over share buyback, we believe that we have traded quick gains in the near term for greater reward in the future.\nNow please turn to Slide #27. Economies around the world continue to face considerable obstacles. The conflict in Ukraine persists, COVID restrictions in China may continue, we see that inflation, currency and supply chain issues will remain as headwinds. As always, we will push price -- we will push for price increases to compensate for additional costs, pursue additional volume opportunities and obviously pay close attention to our costs.\nWith that background, for fiscal year 2023, we expect our earnings per share to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.50, representing an 11% increase at midpoint over last year. This includes an expected roughly $0.50 of negative currency impact. I would also like to add that our projections for next year are based on the fundamental assumption that the economies around the world performed as we see them today. That means we don't have a crystal ball, so we have not projected any economic growth around the world, neither have we projected a significant recession. Our guidance is based on what we see today in the economies in Americas, Europe and China.\nFor quarter 1 of fiscal '23 -- for first quarter of fiscal '23, our earnings per share guidance is $2.60 to $2.80, up 5% to 13% over last year. Please also note that our prior results for the first quarter benefited from a gain of roughly $0.20 related to the finalization of the Jazan suppression unit joint venture. In terms of CapEx, we see our CapEx expenditure for next year to be approximately $5 billion to $5.5 billion, including the approximately $1 billion for the Phase 2 of the Jazan project.\nNow please turn to Slide #28. As you may recall from our last earnings call, I have been hosting in-person discussions with our employees across the regions to share our strategy and answer their questions. My goal is to talk with our more than 21,000 employees around the world over the course of the next year in small groups. I am happy to say that our employees around the world share our core values and focus on our common goals. Their commitment and motivation are truly a long-term competitive advantage. As I stated at the beginning of this call, I am proud to be working alongside them to make Air Products the leader of the clean energy future for the world.\nNow we are more than pleased to answer your questions."

Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures.\nUnless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a total company and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed.\nReconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.\nNow, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today.\nOur fiscal year 2022 third quarter results are the latest demonstration of the strength and resilience of our business portfolio, despite all the well-known and visible headwinds on the global stage, such as rampant inflation, supply chain constraints, currency headwinds, COVID-related shutdowns in China, the war in Ukraine and the significant rise in energy prices in Europe.\nThe people of Air Products delivered excellent results, with earnings per share up 13% versus last year. In addition, as you can see, we delivered very strong cash flow that will support our energy transition growth projects. I do want to thank all of the people at Air Products for the total commitment to excellence and service to our customers.\nNow please turn to Slide #3, our safety performance. Our highest priority at Air Products is the safety and well-being of our employees. We have made significant progress to improve our safety performance in the last few years. But we are working even harder to achieve our ultimate goal of zero incidents and accidents.\nNow please turn to Slide #4. This is our historical performance over the last 8 years and the best indication of our commitment and the resilience of our business portfolio.\nWe have increased our earnings per share by an average of 11% per year over the last 8 years, despite all of the ups and downs in the world economy, geopolitical tensions and COVID. This performance is better than what we promised investors 8 years ago.\nNow please to Slide #5, which clearly indicates that we have shared the success with our investors by increasing our dividend per share by an average of 10% per year also.\nNow please go to Slide #6. My favorite slide that shows our EBITDA margins. You'll note the significant improvement over the years, and please also note that about 3/4 of the recent decline is due to higher pass-through energy costs that increase our sales but not our profits.\nI have, as usual, included Slides #7, 8, 9 and 10 to emphasize our continued commitment to the basic management principles that have guided our performance up to now and will continue to be the key principles that we will follow in the future.\nSlide #11, 12 and 13 represent our new sustainability commitments that we shared on Monday, July 25 at a conference call. The transcript of that call explains all of these slides in detail. So I do not plan to go through that again today.\nBut I do want to reiterate that sustainability is our growth strategy at Air Products, and we are committed to improving our performance and enabling our customers to do the same. We are proud to have set additional ESG goals and increased our total capital expenditure for projects driving the energy transition to $15 billion or more.\nNow, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details of the fiscal year third quarter results. Melissa.\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. As mentioned earlier, the resilience of our business is once again demonstrated on results this quarter. Our on-site business, which generates approximately half of our total company sales, is stable and has contractual protection to pass through higher energy costs. Our merchant business also performed very well.\nPrice stayed ahead of variable cost increases for the second consecutive quarter and how -- has now more than offset the higher variable costs for the year-to-date.\nI'm also pleased to announce that we received a cash distribution of approximately $100 million from the Jazan joint venture in June. Another example of this project meeting our commitments.\nI also would like to echo Seifi's comments and thank all of our people at Air Products for their outstanding effort to overcome the significant energy cost challenges and achieve key project milestones.\nNow please turn to Slide 14 for our third quarter results. Underlying sales were strong. Price and volume, combined, were up 12%. So energy costs have fallen slightly in recent weeks, they remain significantly higher than in prior quarters, and our team stepped up our pricing efforts across the region in response to the escalating energy costs.\nOur third quarter merchant price was 17% higher than last year, which resulted in a 7% gain for the total [company]. Merchant price has improved double digits for 3 consecutive quarters and increased sequentially each quarter.\nVolumes were up 5% overall and better in most segments. New assets, recovery in hydrogen in the Americas, better merchant demand and increased sale of equipment activities more than offset the negative COVID impacts in Asia and lower hydrogen volumes in Europe.\nCurrency translation from a strengthening U.S. dollar was a significant headwind this quarter, reducing sales and EBITDA by 5%. Despite this headwind, EBITDA increased 11% as favorable volume, prices and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs.\nEBITDA margin of 33.9% decreased 360 basis points compared to the prior year as positive contributions from price, equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher energy pass-through, which lowered EBITDA margin by 500 basis points.\nSequentially, volumes were up 4%, supported by Lunar New Year recovery in Asia and higher hydrogen volumes in the Americas, were partially offset by lower merchant demand due to the COVID restrictions in China.\n[EBITDA] was up 6% sequentially, absorbing 2% of currency headwinds as favorable price and volume more than offset higher costs.\nROCE has climbed steadily the last 4 quarters to reach 10.8%. We anticipate ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects onstream and continue to put the abundant cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for this cash, our ROCE would have been 13.5% this quarter.\nNow please turn to Slide 15. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $2.62 increased $0.31 or 13% from the prior year, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year earnings growth.\nPrice, volume and costs together contributed $0.27. Volume was favorable at $0.11 and price net of variable cost was favorable at $0.32. Asia, Europe and Americas all showed positive price results. Our costs were higher primarily due to inflation, supply chain-related issues and higher planned maintenance.\nWe also remain steadfast in our support for the long-term growth of our company, hiring the necessary people to bring projects onstream and investing in facilities, including our new helium storage cavern, which will generate significant value in the future.\nWe keep a close eye on all of our costs and continue to focus on productivity actions across all of our businesses. Weaker foreign currency versus U.S. dollar lowered our EPS $0.08. The euro, British pound, Korean won and RMB were the biggest contributors. This was about $0.05 worse than we expected for the quarter.\nThe Jazan joint venture continues to deliver as expected and drove the improved equity affiliate income versus prior year. Noncontrolling interest was unfavorable as higher earnings from consolidated joint ventures is attributed to our partners. Nonoperating income was $0.04 lower, driven by higher pension expense.\nOur third quarter effective tax rate of 18.6% was slightly higher than last year as the favorable impact of Jazan in the current year was offset by prior-year impact of favorable one-time items. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 19% next quarter.\nNow please turn to Slide 16. The stability of our business allows us to generate strong cash flow despite the challenging geopolitical energy environment.\nOver the last 12 months, we generated more than $2.9 billion of distributable cash flow over $13 per share. From our EBITDA of over $4 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital.\nFrom the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or roughly $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have over $1.5 billion available for high-return projects.\nThis strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enable us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment for our high-return projects.\nSlide 17 provides an update to our capital deployment. As you can see, our capital deployment potential is $35 billion through fiscal 2027. The $35 billion includes about $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, almost $17 billion, we expect to be available by 2027 and more than $10 billion already spent.\nWe still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity.\nAs always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current and targeted A/A2 rating. So you can see, we have already spent 30% and have already committed 73% of the updated capacity we show here. We've made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects.\nAs Seifi mentioned, we have committed an additional $4 billion to the future energy transition projects or about half of the remaining $9.5 billion to be committed. We are developing a significant number of exciting projects. As a result, I think we have a good chance to exceed this target.\nWe continually evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use the available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run.\nNow to begin the review of our segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #18 for our Asia results. As I mentioned earlier, currency was a major hurdle for Asia this quarter. Sales were flat as positive volume and price that offset by weaker currency.\nVolume was up 2% as we continue to successfully bring on -- being onstream a small- to medium-sized traditional industrial gas plants in our on-site business across the region, which more than offset the reduced merchant volumes caused by COVID restrictions in certain parts of China in the last quarter.\nOur merchant price was up 5% compared to last year, which resulted in the 2% overall price improvement for the region.\nCosts were unfavorable, primarily due to higher planned maintenance, inflation and supply chain inefficiencies caused by COVID restrictions. EBITDA was 5% lower, mostly due to currency, and EBITDA margin decreased 230 basis points as better price and volume only partially offset the higher costs.\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Simon to talk about our Europe results. Simon?\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 19. Energy costs in Europe remained very high but had no profit impact on our on-site business since we are contractually able to pass the cost on to our customers. Since almost all of our natural gas usage is for on-site hydrogen production, we have very little cost exposure to natural gas and no cost exposure to the power used for our on-site ASUs.\nIn our merchant business, our team continues to implement price increases to compensate for higher power costs, highlighting the strength of our business model. You can see the power costs for Europe this quarter were still 3x the level at the beginning of 2021.\nAlthough we have now fully recovered the higher power costs for the year-to-date, we remain mindful of the dynamic nature of the situation, and we are continuing to work hard on pricing.\nNow please turn to Slide 20 for a review of our Europe results. Negative currency had a significant impact on Europe. All major local currencies were weaker versus the dollar by double digits. Compared to prior year, underlying sales were stable, supported by a sizable step-up in merchant pricing.\nPrice increased 17% over last year for the region, which translates to a 25% gain for the merchant business. Prices were higher across all major product lines and subregions, and this is the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential price increases. Volume was 3% weaker.\nMerchant volume was up, but hydrogen volume was negatively impacted by a planned customer turnaround and another customer reducing volume from us due to high natural gas costs.\nEBITDA improved 4% due to strong price net of variable costs and better equity affiliate income, which were partially offset by unfavorable currency and weaker volume.\nEBITDA margin decreased 500 basis points compared to prior year as better pricing net of variable costs only partially offset higher energy cost pass-through, which lowered margin more than 700 basis points.\nCompared to the prior quarter, merchant volume improved and price continued to gain strength across all key product lines and subregions.\nEBITDA was up 9% as better price net of variable costs more than offset weaker currency. EBITDA margin improved 230 basis points primarily due to the strong price.\nCompared to Q1 of this year, Europe's operating income has improved $40 million or 40% and EBITDA margin has increased by over 600 basis points, owing much to our team's successful pricing effort.\nNow, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a discussion of our other segments.\n\nSamir J. Serhan\n\nCOO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 21 for a review of our Americas results. Energy cost pass-through was a significant factor this quarter, accounting for 2/3 of the 33% sales increase over last year but contributing no profit. However, it does negatively impact our margins.\nUnderlying sales were strong. Volume and price together were up 12%, similar to the last 2 quarters. Volume grew 4%, primarily due to recovery in hydrogen despite the planned outages in this quarter as well as a new on-sites coming online. We expect hydrogen to continue its path to recovery as we move into 2023.\nOur third quarter volume growth was partially offset by continued weakness in our South America merchant business due to lower demand for medical oxygen as well as the favorable impact from our one-time items in the previous year.\nAs mentioned, the positive price momentum continued. Our team in the Americas did an excellent job again, by raising the prices to more than cover the higher energy costs. Prices improved in all key product lines over last year and were also up sequentially. The 8% gain for the region compared to last year is equivalent to an 18% increase in our merchant business.\nAs we indicated previously, a planned maintenance was still elevated in the third quarter, but it's expected to decrease in this fourth quarter. Costs were also unfavorable primarily due to inflation and supply chain-related challenges, including driver shortages that continued to impact the industry.\nEBITDA grew 3%, driven by higher price and volume, partially offset by higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 980 basis points from the previous year due to higher energy cost pass-through, which accounted for around 800 basis points, with most of the rest driven by one-time gains in the previous year.\nSequentially, our hydrogen volume and continued price gains helped to drive EBITDA higher, despite higher supply chain-related costs. EBITDA margin was lower, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through.\nNow please turn to Slide 22 for a review of our Middle East and India segment. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest, since our Middle East and India wholly-owned operations are smaller in size.\nHowever, the segment's EBITDA is significant since it includes the equity affiliate income related to the Jazan joint venture and our India joint venture, INOX AP.\nFor the quarter, sales were higher versus the previous year and previous quarter due to acquisitions. The $50 million increase in equity affiliate income included our share of the Jazan joint venture net profit.\nAs Melissa indicated earlier, we received a distribution of about $100 million from the joint venture during the third quarter. And I'm also happy to report that the planned commissioning activities continue to make good progress.\nPlease turn to Slide 23 for our Corporate segment. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Over the past few years, our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses have grown considerably and have become major contributors for this segment.\nFor this quarter, sales and profit increased, driven by strong activities in non-LNG projects and also supported by favorable profit recognition upon the recent completion of an LNG sale of equipment project.\nAs expected, inquiries for potential LNG projects have increased significantly, but these projects take time to develop, we're working hard to sign in new projects in order to maintain our momentum.\nAt this point, I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing comments.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. As I have mentioned previously, our strategy for the company is fundamentally based on doing two things at the same time, 2 pillars.\nNumber one, is to operate our base industrial gas business in the most efficient way and continue to invest and grow that business, something that we have been doing, and we will continue to do.\nThe second pillar of our strategy is to focus on zero and low-carbon hydrogen projects that produce the hydrogen energy of the future. Air Products today is the leader in the production of gray hydrogen worldwide.\nOur strategy is to have a natural extension of that leadership position and to be the leader in the production of green hydrogen, based on renewable resources, and blue hydrogen, which is the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons combined with CO2 capture.\nThat is our growth strategy for the future. We are very much committed to this strategy. These 2 pillars are part of the same thing. They fit together. They align with our core competencies as a company and they give us the potential to grow significantly.\nAs the world's largest hydrogen supplier, with over 60 years of experience with hydrogen, we are uniquely positioned to be successful in implementing this strategy.\nWe have the know-how to carry out our mega projects and implement them successfully, as demonstrated by the successful completion of several major projects recently, including a more than $2 billion air separation project, the largest in the world, which was completed on time and in their budgets, recently.\nWe can also leverage our existing assets as many of our energy transition projects are connected to our own pipelines, which can readily supply the low-carbon hydrogen to our existing customers.\nNow please turn to Slide #24. Like everyone else, we see significant economic challenges as we go forward. COVID restrictions in China remain uncertain, and we expect inflation, currency and supply chain constraints to continue to be headwinds.\nAlthough we have only a very small business in Germany, the fear of energy supply disruptions is weighing on all of Europe. Despite all of these headwinds, I remain confident in the strength and stability of Air Products business.\nWe will push for price increases to compensate for additional costs, pursue additional volume opportunity and pay very close attention to our costs.\nAs a result, for the fiscal year '22, we have kept our guidance unchanged despite not only all of these headwinds, but also the more than $0.10 of negative currency impact that we see, which is different -- which is higher than when we gave you the guidance last quarter.\nOur range of $10.20 to $10.40 represents a 14% increase at midpoint over last year. We expect to see our CapEx in 2022 to be slightly above $4.5 billion, including the approximately $1.5 billion previously invested for Phase 1 of the Jazan project.\nNow please turn to Slide #25. To make this energy transition a reality, we need people who share the same vision for this important undertaking.\nRecently, I've been hosting strategy discussions with our employees around the world. These are extensive thoughtful dialogues with small groups of people at a time that allow me to share our strategy with our people and as always, to answer their questions and get input from them.\nI have already met with approximately 2,000 of our employees in the last 2 months, and our plan is to talk to all of our 20,000 employees in small groups in the next year or so. I'm happy to say that our employees are excited, motivated and confident to take on the bold challenges ahead of us.\nTheir commitment and motivation is our long-term competitive advantage, which is going to make us successful in implementing our strategy. I am, have been and continue to be very excited about the future of Air Products.\nNow before we answer your questions, I do have an announcement to make. As all of you on this call know -- all of you on this call know my friend and colleague, Mr. Simon Moore very well. He has been responsible for Investor Relations for the last 12 years. He has been a significant contributor to the success of Air Products over the last 33 years.\nRecently, Simon informed me that he plans to spend more time with his family and therefore, he wishes to retire from Air Products at the end of March 2023. We have decided to announce this decision early so that we can go about finding a successor in an open and public manner and also to give his successor plenty of time for the transition.\nI do want to publicly acknowledge and thank Simon for the outstanding and valuable contribution he has made to Air Products and also acknowledge the key role he has played in developing our sustainability program.\nAll of us at Air Products wish Simon the best in his retirement and look forward to working with him over the next 8 months to identify and transition to a strong successor. Simon, thank you again for all we have done for Air Products, and I invite you to make any comments you would like to make at this time.\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. I have been honored to enjoy the challenges, the opportunities, the people and the teamwork at Air Products over the last 30-plus years. As they say, no one joins the company planning to stay for 30 years, but I have been lucky to be challenged with a wide variety of opportunities that always made Air Products a great place to be.\nSeifi, as we discussed when I first shared my decision with you, I remain fully supportive of Air Products' growth strategy, continuing to focus on our very strong base business, while we further advanced our unique first-mover advantages, driving the sustainability-focused energy transition for the world, will no doubt create significant value for our investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders.\nAnd Seifi, I want to specifically thank you for leading the team to transform Air Products into this great company with an incredible future. I'm looking forward to continuing to drive our critical work, support the search for an outstanding successor and ensure a smooth transition. Thanks again, Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Simon, for your kind remarks. I do appreciate that.\nNow, we are pleased to answer your questions."

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.\nBeginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Diaz. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.\nAfter our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2.\nIn addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.\nNow I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today.\nI want to begin by saying a few words regarding Air Products' response to the current situation in Eastern Europe. We are deeply concerned by the human tragedy in Ukraine and the impact that this conflict has on the world. We condemn this aggression and encourage all efforts for peace. Our hearts go out to those affected and we are continuing to support our employees in this region.\nAs a company, we are providing humanitarian support including assistance to the International Committee of the Red Cross from the Air Products Fund Foundation. Our employees have also responded with care and generosity, reaching out to their affected colleagues and making contributions to various organizations supporting relief efforts.\nOur presence in Ukraine is minimum with about $5 million in sales last fiscal year, and we have suspended the development of a small separation unit in the country. Our businesses in Russia is also very small with less than $25 million in sales last fiscal year. We are in the process of exiting Russia and will stop doing business in that country.\nNow before we get into the details, I want to thank each and everyone about 20,000 employees around the world for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and to serving our customers.\nLast quarter, despite the very difficult conditions caused by war, significant inflation in energy costs, supply chain disruptions and lingering effects of the COVID-19 virus, our people delivered strong results with an earnings per share of $2.38, which is 14% higher than the previous year. As always, our people's commitment and dedication is our competitive advantage as we move forward.\nNow please look at Slide #3, focusing on safety which is our highest priority. Our second quarter safety performance was similar to last quarter, but still behind last year. Although we are proud of the fact that we have made significant progress in this area over the past few years, this result is not acceptable. Our goal remains zero accidents and zero incidents, and we are committed to achieving that goal across the organization.\nSlides #4 to #7 include our goal, our management velocity and our 5 plans for moving forward. And we have also included our higher purpose slide to explain what we are trying to do every day when we come to work. We have shared these slides with investors many times before, but we always have them as part of our package to emphasize the point that these are the principles that we will follow every day, and they will continue to guide us as we move forward.\nAs we have explained to our investors in the past, our strategy for moving forward is based on 2 pillars. The first is absolute excellence in running our existing industrial gases business. That is to operate with the greatest efficiency and productivity, invest and maintain our market share and improve pricing to compensate for inflation. Our results that we have just announced confirm that we are successfully implementing this strategy, since we are delivering strong results under very difficult and challenging circumstances.\nThe second pillar of our strategy for the future is to take advantage of our unique technologies and expertise to be a meaningful player in the significant worldwide effort to transition to clean energy. Specifically in this area, we are focused on developing and executing mega projects to produce blue and green hydrogen and other sustainable fuels for the world.\nIn summary, this explains the content of the almost $20 billion of projects that we have in our backlog, and there are more of these projects to come.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year '22, we announced projects that confirm in a significant way our commitment to these 2 strategic pillars. First, in our base business, as you can see on Slide #8, we announced $1.3 billion of investment in 2 major projects for the electronic industry. These are real mega projects with long-term take-or-pay contracts with some of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world. We are proud to be executing these projects that confirm our significant position in the semiconductor industry.\nAs related to the second pillar of our strategy, as you can see on the Slide #9, we announced that we are building a $2 billion facility in Southern California to convert a conventional refinery to one that produces sustainable aviation fuel called SAF. This facility will use as its raw material renewed organic material such as base cooking oil, animal fats, et cetera, and use substantial amount of hydrogen to convert these raw materials to fuel for airplanes.\nThe total capacity of this plant will be approximately 340 million gallons per year. Although this sounds like a big number, in 2019, world jet fuel consumption was more than 100 billion gallons. The Board airlines are looking to decarbonize. Major corporations in the Board are focused on reducing the carbon emissions generated by their airline business travel. And there are already significant incentives in place to encourage the move towards sustainable aviation fuel. This is the fundamental reason aligned with our strategy to pursue this opportunity.\nWe started developing this project 3 years ago in partnership with World Energy, a private company that is currently the leading producer of sustainable airlines fuel. Our agreement is that Air Products will engineer, build and own the facility and World Energy will provide the raw material. World Energy will also sell the project -- the product and has a contractual commitment to pay Air Products a fixed fee that ensures an acceptable return on Air Products investment.\nWe are very excited about these projects since it also uses a significant amount of hydrogen that we can supply from our established and extensive hydrogen pipeline in Southern California.\nOur partner in this project, World Energy, is a private company. So I know and fully appreciate that there is little information available about them in the public domain. We have permission from the principles of the company to disclose the following information, which can be found on Slide #10. This information is self-explanatory and we are delighted to work with World Energy on this great project.\nI'd just like to point out that on the bottom of Slide #10, we have included sales and profitability numbers, $400 million sales and $54 million of profit. That is just for the products that World Energy sells out of the Paramount refinery that we are converting today.\nIn addition to that, World Energy has the capacity in their other plants in America and Canada to produce 150 million gallons a year of biodiesel. The sales number and profitability of those numbers are not disclosed.\nI also want to report to you at this time that we continue to make good progress in building and bringing on stream key mega projects that we have already announced. Slide #11 highlights the major projects that we expect to bring on stream in 2023.\nNow I would like to take a moment to reflect on our performance over the past 8 years. In July 2014, during my first conference call with investors as Chairman, President and CEO of Air Products, I promised the shareholders that our goal was to deliver over the long term a 10% per year average cumulative growth in Air Products earnings per share.\nOn Slide 12, you can see that for the past 8 years, we have delivered more than what we promised 8 years ago. And our goal for the future is to continue to deliver similar results as we move forward.\nOn Slide 13, you can see that we have shared the positive growth with our investors and increase our dividend on average 10% per year over the last 8 years.\nAnd finally, please turn to Slide #14, still my favorite slide. It shows our EBITDA margin since 2014. Despite all of the turmoil in the Board, significant energy, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions, our EBITDA margin last quarter was almost a 1,000 basis points higher than in 2014.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa to discuss our results in more details. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, we are executing our growth strategy and supporting our base business at the same time. We expect the large projects to drive our long-term growth, while our base business continues delivering near-term results. Both large projects and base businesses contribute to our fiscal second quarter results.\nThe Jazan joint venture that started up during Q1 provided a full quarter of benefit, consistent with our commitment of $0.80 to $0.85 per share on a full year basis.\nOur pricing actions also contributed with gains exceeding variable cost increases this quarter. The outperformance was particularly noteworthy in Europe, where we experienced the most significant energy cost pressure. I want to express my thanks to the team for their speed of execution and a job well done.\nNow please turn to Slide 15 for our second quarter results. Energy costs remained elevated this quarter. Our teams continue to implement significant price actions in response to the unprecedented challenges. The 6% total company price increase translating 13% increases in price for the merchant business. This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit price gain across our merchant business.\nVolume was also strong, increasing 8% overall, up in all segments, driven by the new assets, hydrogen recovery, strong merchant demand and increased sales of equipment activity.\nPricing volume combined were up 14%, accounting for most of the 18% sales increase compared to last year. EBITDA increased 9%, our third consecutive quarter exceeding the $1 billion mark as favorable volume, prices and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 270 basis points from the prior year as the negative impact of higher costs in energy pass-through more than offset higher equity affiliate income. Higher energy pass-through lowered adjusted EBITDA margin are about 200 basis points.\nSequentially, volumes were down 3%, primarily due to lower higher volumes on specific customer operational actions and the leaner (inaudible).\nOperating income was up 7%, driven by favorable rates and costs. However, EBITDA was up 2% and net income was down 5%, primarily due to the (inaudible) related to the finalization of our (inaudible) Jazan ASU joint venture, which is the benefited last quarter.\nROCE was 10.6%. We currently have significant cash on our balance sheet, which will support the major projects we have announced. Adjusting for this cash, our ROCE would have been 13.7%. We expect ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash and bring projects onstream.\nNow please turn to Slide 16. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38, which is $0.30 or 14% above last year, the fourth consecutive quarter, a double-digital year-over-year revenue growth and a testament to the stability, resilience and growth of our business model.\nThe volume was favorable at $0.18 and price net of variable costs at $0.14, as our price actions more than offset the unprecedented energy cost increases. For the quarter, our price actions alone before netting against variable costs contributed around $0.50. Our other costs are higher due to the combination of investments for future growth, planned maintenance and external factors.\nOne example that we have invested in is our helium storage cavern to help provide reliable helium supply to our customers globally. This investment increased our cost now, but we expect to generate significant value from this investment in the future. We also see higher costs as we increased resources prior to bringing projects onstream. For example, we have hired approximately (inaudible) people, who will be responsible for operating the Jazan gasifier complex once it comes onstream next year. These purposeful strategic actions begin to ensure the long-term success of our company responsible for roughly half the total increased cost this quarter.\nThe remaining half was primarily external factors attributable to inflation and supply chain challenges across the region. We remain focused on driving productivity across our business. The Jazan joint venture contributed it's first full quarter of results and continues to deliver as expected. Our share of the results from the projects are reflected entirely in equity affiliate income this quarter and will be going forward. I realized this is an updated accounting interpretation and it's slightly different than we discussed last quarter, but we believe this approach will be clear for our investors moving forward.\nThere is no difference to the bottom line EPS. The project continues to deliver as we expected. Overall, for the quarter, equity affiliate income was $0.18 higher, driven by our share of the joint ventures profit.\nOur second quarter effective tax rate of 18.6% was 160 basis points lower than last year, including the favorable impact to Jazan. We expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 20% for the remainder of this fiscal year. Non-operating income is $0.03 lower, driven by higher [Jazan] expense.\nNow please turn to Slide 17. The stability of our business continues to allow us to generate strong cash flow despite the challenging geopolitical and energy environment. Over the last 12 months, we generated around $2.8 billion of distributable cash flow or nearly $12.70 per share. From our EBITDA of over $4 million, [interest], taxes and maintenance capital expenditures. Note that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters which is nearly [continuous].\nFrom this distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.3 billion and dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.5 billion available for high-return projects. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.\nSlide 18 provides an update on our capital deployment. We continue to make great progress in developing, announcing and executing on our major growth projects. In fact, we see potential opportunities significantly greater than the investment capacity we show here. As you can see, our capital deployment potential is over $34 billion fiscal 2027. $34 billion includes about $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today. Over $16 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $10 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating.\nSo you can see we've already spent 29% in our already committed 74% of the updated capacity we show here. We've made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects. We continually evaluate our (inaudible) determine the best way to use available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value.\nTo begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #19 for our Asia results. Sales were up 8% compared to last year, primarily on 6% higher volume as a variety of new traditional industrial gas plants came onstream across this region.\nPrice was again positive. The 1% overall price improvement for the region equals to about a 3% increase for the merchant business. China's dual control policy has eased, but COVID restrictions in parts of China have modestly impacted customer demand. They also impacted our plant efficiency and increased our supply chain costs.\nCosts that are unfavorable, primarily due to inflation and resources needed to support new project start-ups, as Melissa mentioned. EBITDA up 2% as better volume and price more than offset higher costs.\nCompared to last quarter, volumes declined 2% primarily due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Price was 2% lower sequentially. As mentioned during our last earnings call, China's government has relaxed its power tariff program to allow local power costs to fluctuate. This market-oriented approach has resulted in higher power costs compared to last quarter. However, our overall costs were lower due to better operating and supply chain efficiencies.\nOur EBITDA was down 9% sequentially, and EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points as the unfavorable volume and price more than offset lower costs. For the second half of the fiscal year, we are very concerned about the potential impact of the COVID-related restrictions in China, and we do expect higher planned maintenance activities.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Simon to talk about the European results. Simon?\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 20. Energy costs in Europe began the quarter moderating but then moved up significantly and were the highest yet in March. Natural gas costs peaked in January more than 7x higher than a year ago while power costs stayed almost 4x higher. As Melissa mentioned, our on-site business has contractual pass-through of the higher costs, so we are not directly impacted by higher natural gas prices.\nHigher power costs are also passed through in our ASU on-site business.\nIn our merchant business, our team implemented significant price actions, which more than covered the higher power costs this quarter. In fact, we recovered this quarter's higher power costs and about half of the unrecovered costs from Q1. Again, a great job by the team. However, we remain vigilant and are working to drive further improvement.\nNow please turn to Slide 21 for a review of our Europe results. Compared to the prior year, sales were up 32%. Energy cost pass-through, which increases sales, but not profits accounted for more than 2/3 of the sales increase. Price increased 14% for the region, which translates to 22% for the merchant business. Prices were higher across all major product lines and subregions.\nVolume was up 2% on higher merchant volumes. EBITDA was down 3% as favorable price net of variable costs and better equity affiliate income were more than offset by negative currency, unfavorable volume mix and higher other costs. For the quarter, the supply chain disruptions caused by the significant energy cost increases persistent, negatively impacting both plants operating and distribution efficiencies. We also saw higher costs due to inflation while we continue to prepare for new projects coming onstream.\nEBITDA margin was 950 basis points lower, most of the decline about 700 basis points was due to the significant energy pass-through increase. The remainder was mostly driven by higher costs and negative volume mix, partially offset by strong merchant pricing and higher equity affiliate income. Compared to the prior quarter, price was up 5%, further improved from the already strong performance last quarter, which allowed us to more than offset the higher energy costs. This equates to an 8% increase on the merchant business.\nVolume was 7% lower due to reduced hydrogen demand on customer-specific operating actions. EBITDA jumped 17% sequentially, and EBITDA margin improved 380 basis points as strong price, higher equity affiliate income and lower nonenergy-related costs more than compensated for the lower volume.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a brief discussion of our other segments.\n\nSamir J. Serhan\n\nCOO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 22 for a review of our Americas results. Sales increased 12% versus last year. Volume and price together were up 11%. Our team in the Americas also did an excellent job raising prices to cover the higher energy costs this quarter. Prices improved in all key product lines over the last year and were also up sequentially. The 5% price gain for the region compared to last year is equivalent to a 12% increase in our merchant business.\nPrice, net of variable costs was also positive for the region. Volume grew 6%, primarily due to hydrogen recovery and better merchant demands. In general, we see hydrogen demand back [here] pre-COVID levels. Although [hydro] volumes this quarter were impacted by the planned outages. We expect the third quarter to continue at a high level of planned outages then expect volume to fully recover as we move into 2023.\nMeanwhile, our merchant volume was weaker in South America due to lower demand for medical oxygen as COVID cases declined. The decreased demand for medical gases also reduced Americas equity affiliate income. As we expected, the planned maintenance increased costs this quarter. Costs were also unfavorable primarily due to inflation and supply chain-related challenges, including driver shortages that are broadly impacting the industry.\nOperating income improved as positive price and volume more than covered unfavorable mix and higher costs. EBITDA was flat as it was impacted by lower equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin was 460 basis points lower than the previous year due to higher costs, negative volume mix and reduced equity affiliate income, which were partially offset by better price.\nSequentially, volume this quarter was lower due to planned maintenance outages. Operating income was up primarily due to strong price, but was partially offset by higher maintenance costs. EBITDA was down additionally impacted by lower equity affiliate income.\nNow please turn to Slide 23, our Middle East and India segment, which includes our businesses in the Middle East, including the Jazan joint venture and India. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly owned operations are smaller in size. However, the segment's EBITDA significantly includes the equity affiliate income related to the Jazan joint venture and our India joint venture, INOXAP.\nThe $55 million increase in equity affiliate income included our share of the Jazan joint venture net profit for the full quarter that Melissa previously discussed. I'm pleased to report that the team successfully started up a number of gasifier and steam carbon units, and the rest of the Phase 1 start-up is continuing as planned.\nSequentially, equity affiliate income was lower due to the positive nonrecurring items in quarter 1 related to the finalization of our previous Jazan ASU joint ventures.\nNow please turn to Slide 24, which addresses our corporate segment. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs.\nOver the past few years, our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses have grown considerably and are now reasonably -- responsible for most of the sales and the profit increases this quarter.\nOur LNG project activities remained robust and also contributed to these increases. As expected, inquiries for potential LNG projects have increased significantly. But since our customers' major projects take time to develop, it will be some time until this interest translates into new projects.\nAt this point, I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing comments. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dr. Serhan. Although the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine are far from clear, the evolving situation has once again brought the critical issue of energy independence and national security to the forefront, emphasizing the critical nature of the energy transition, their air products has highly valued technologies, skills and experience that will benefit our customers and countries around the world.\nGasification allows countries to utilize their own resources in an environmentally friendly way, reducing their imports of fuel and chemicals. Meanwhile, renewable energy, including green hydrogen and fuse drive from sustainable organic resources, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, will allow countries to reduce their reliance on faster fuels.\nFurthermore, the desire for diversified energy supply will also encourage additional LNG projects in the future, a positive development for Air Products as we are the leading technology and equipment provider for these large LNG projects.\nAir Products' strategy and competencies are allowing us to be a leader in the energy transition. Our industry-leading gasification technologies are suitable for various types of feedstocks, which can create net-zero hydrogen.\nThe NEOM Green Hydrogen project is the largest project of its kind in the world. Our LNG heat exchanges, which convert natural gas to liquid are an integral part to all LNG projects. The sustainable aviation fuel to be produced in our new facility in California is a direct drop in replacement for conventional jet fuel. It can significantly reduce carbon footprint of the aviation industry without any equipment modification.\nThe focus on energy security and energy transition is creating significant new project opportunities now and in the future. Therefore, we firmly believe that investing in high-return projects rather than share buyback is the right way forward to support the energy transition and continued profitable growth for Air Products and an appropriate return for our investors.\nNow please turn to Slide #25. I remain highly confident of Air Products' resilient business model, our strategy and our execution. However, I do have some concerns about the economic backdrop, driven by continued COVID challenges, the impact of supply chain constraints, inflation and energy costs.\nEven with these challenges, for quarter 3 fiscal year 2022, our earning per share guidance is $2.55 to $2.65, up 10% to 15% over last year and almost $0.20 higher than last quarter. For fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $10.20 to $10.40, which is 13% to 15% better than last year.\nWe continue to see our CapEx in '22 to be around $4.5 billion to $5 billion, including the approximately $1.5 billion previously invested for phase 1 of the Jazan project.\nAt this point, I'd like you to turn to Slide #26. The drive for energy security and transition to a more sustainable future are not mutually exclusive. The world needs cleaner, lower carbon forms of energy and more divest sources of energy. We believe our strategy directly addresses these needs. As we drive toward the clean energy world, the talent and dedication of our people are the key to making this vision a reality.\nWe need and fortunately, have talented and dedicated people to help us accelerate the progress. As I always say, our long-term competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of our people. Their hard work and contribution will ensure our success.\nSo at this point, I would like to end my comments, and we will be very delighted to answer questions. Operator, we are ready for questions."

Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Simon Moore. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' First Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability.\nI'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions.\nOur earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2.\nIn addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.\nAlso, as we shared with you on our last call, this is the first quarter we reported our results with our new Middle East and India and our new Corporate segments. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I am proud to say that despite significant challenges, including unprecedented energy cost increases, and I mean unprecedented, especially in Europe, supply chain disruptions and the continued adverse effects caused by the pandemic, the talented, committed and motivated people of Air Products continued to deliver excellent results, including earnings per share this quarter in the top half of our guidance range.\nThis quarter, we closed on Phase 1 of the Jazan project, which is the single largest project in our company's history and will create significant value for many years to come. As always, I want to thank our more than 20,000 employees around the globe for standing together, working hard, staying agile and delivering for our customers and shareholders.\nLet me start this presentation with our highest priority, which is obviously safety. Please take a look at Slide #3. Although we have made significant progress in this area since fiscal year 2014, our first quarter safety performance was slightly behind last year. That is not acceptable.\nOur goal remains 0 accidents and 0 incidents. And we are committed to drive towards that goal across the organization, knowing that the right attitude and constant attention to safety is absolutely necessary and required.\nSlides #4, 5 and 6 include our goal, our management philosophy and our Five Point Plan. We have shared these slides to you before, so I'm not going to go through the details. But these are the principles that we follow every day, and they will guide us in the future.\nNow please turn to Slide #7. We are focused on making Air Products a leader in providing solutions to today's significant energy and environmental challenges through gasification, cabin capture and clean hydrogen. I am proud to say that we have continued to create and win projects that help customers and countries meet their growing needs for cleaner energy and environmental solutions.\nLast year, we announced 2 landmark blue hydrogen projects, one in Alberta, Canada and the other in Louisiana in United States of America, adding to our a slate of world-scale mega projects supporting the energy transition. At the beginning of our fiscal year, this fiscal year, we successfully closed on Phase 1 of the $12 billion Jazan gasification and power project, fulfilling one of our major commitments.\nWe continue to expect Phase 1 of this project to contribute $0.80 to $0.85 per share on a full year basis, consistent with what we have committed to you before. We also continue to make great progress on this -- our significant project backlog.\nNow please turn to Slide #8. Creating a cleaner future requires experience, investment and innovation on a world scale. At Air Products, we have the technology, the track record, the capital and the ambition to execute our bold strategy in bringing people around the world together to collaborate in an inclusive environment and helps (inaudible) sustainability challenges. We are living our higher purpose as a company. That is our higher purpose.\nNow please turn to Slide #9. It is clear that at Air Products, sustainability is our growth strategy. Sustainability creates our broad opportunities, and our growth opportunities supports our sustainability goals and focus.\nWe are very proud to help drive the energy transition, in particular through our world-scale hydrogen (inaudible) projects. Our new project in Saudi Arabia, Alberta project in Canada and Louisiana project in the United States of America represent almost $10 billion of direct Air Products capital to create a zero- and low-carbon hydrogen needed to drive decarbonization and accelerate the energy transition. These projects will significantly reduce CO2 equivalent emissions for our customers for Air Products itself and for the world.\nAs a first mover taking real action through these real projects, we can bring a portfolio of experiences and technologies together to provide lower carbon forms of energy, improve our customers' sustainability and help solve significant energy and environmental challenges. As I said, this is our higher purpose as a company.\nIn addition, it is important that our commitments are aligned with our strategy. We introduced our Third by '30 carbon intensity reduction goal more than a year ago. And I'm very proud to say that the major projects we have announced, along with our day-to-day focus on operational efficiency, puts us in a great position to meet or exceed this goal by 2030.\nBut as a company, we are never satisfied with our current performance. Therefore, we are taking another look at our opportunities to make even more meaningful progress towards higher environmental growth. Under the purview of our Sustainability Leadership Council, we are reviewing additional areas of opportunity, which could include a Scope 3 emissions goal, the benefits of avoided emissions and/or other potential scenarios. I expect to share more with you on these exciting topics by midyear.\nNow please turn to Slide #10, which shows our EPS growth. While we focus on our strong long-term prospects, we remain vigilant and motivated to deliver excellent near-term results, consistent with our strategy and what we have already promised to investors. As you can see, we have delivered on what would we promised you in 2014 and achieved an 11% annual cumulative EPS growth on average since 2014 while building a strong foundation for our future growth.\nThe excellent results and key projects we have executed represent the initial stages of our strategy to advance the world toward a cleaner energy future. I am very optimistic about our company's prospects to capitalize on these growing opportunities by being a meaningful player in the energy transition.\nNow please turn to Slide #11. As a reminder, we do share our earnings growth directly with our customers through our dividend, while we continue to invest in growth opportunities. The whole team at Air Products is very proud that we just announced our 40th consecutive year of dividend increase. This tremendous long-term record is a testament to our people and our strength and consistency of our business model.\nThe most recent increase is 8%, which increases our dividend to $1.62 per share per quarter, which we expect to -- will translate to directly returning more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2022. And as Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will share with you in a moment, we have significant remaining cash flow to support our many project opportunities.\nAnd finally, please turn to Slide #12, still my favorite slide since it captures in one chart the progression of our business since 2014. We continue to deliver strong underlying results, but our margin declined in recent quarters primarily driven by higher energy pass-through, which increases our sales but doesn't impact profit.\n2/3 of the margin decline from our peak is due to the impact of this higher energy pass-through. But as I indicated last quarter, we are continuing to take action to improve our margins through controlling costs and increasing prices to cover cost increases.\nNow I'm happy to turn the call over to Melissa to discuss our results in more detail. Melissa?\n\nMelissa N. Schaeffer\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 13. Before we discuss the details of our first quarter results, I would like to highlight a few notable items in our reported financials this quarter.\nAs we previously announced, we reorganized our reporting segments starting this quarter. To provide more visibility to our regions, we separated the previous EMEA segment into Europe and a Middle East and India segment. The new segment is made up of our business in the Middle East, which includes the new Jazan joint venture in India.\nAdditionally, we combine Global Gases with the Corporate and Other segment. The historical resegmented financial information is available in a Form 8-K, which we published in December.\nWe are proud to have completed Phase 1 of the $12 billion Jazan joint venture in late October. This milestone has led to 2 separate but related events, which impact our results favorably this quarter.\nFirst was the start of a new joint venture known as JIGPC's ongoing financial contribution consistent with the contract between the joint venture in Saudi Aramco. On an ongoing basis, our portion of the Jazan joint venture's net profit isn't included in equity affiliate income since we don't consolidate this joint venture. We also recognized interest income on the shareholder loans associated with our $1.5 billion investment, which is included in the nonoperating income line of our income statement.\nTo be clear, these are loans from Air Products to the joint venture and are a mechanism for us to efficiently fund our contribution Together, these 2 income streams drive $0.80 to $0.85 of annual Phase 1 EPS, exactly what we expected and committed to our shareholders and consistent with what we recognized for 2 months in Q1. We remain on track for closing of Phase 2 in 2023.\nSecond, a nonreoccurring event of approximately $0.20 involved the transfer of the air separation units supporting the gasifiers at Jazan from our previous ASU joint venture to the Jazan joint venture. This transfer required the final settlement of our ASU joint venture, which previously owned and operated these air separation units and enabled us to recognize a portion of the profit that was deferred when Air Products sold the ASUs to the joint venture.\nThis profit was recognized as equity affiliate income. Partially offsetting this and also in equity affiliate income recorded a loss associated with the ASU joint venture settlement. Our joint venture partner's share of the settlement loss is reflected as a favorable noncontrolling interest item.\nNow please turn to Slide 14 for our first quarter results. Compared to last year, sales increased 26% to nearly $3 billion. Volume and price were strong and together account for 13% of the increase, while the remaining half was driven by higher energy pass-through.\nRapidly escalating energy costs continue to negatively impact our business across the region this quarter. The situation was especially challenging in Europe and Americas as natural gas and electricity costs surged even higher from the already elevated levels we saw last quarter. Simon will share more details, but in Europe, natural gas costs were almost 6x higher, and power costs are almost 4x higher than the beginning of the year.\nOur on-site business, about half of our total company sales, has contractual protection from the energy cost increases. The costs are passed on to the customer. The energy cost pass-through drove sales 14% higher but did not impact our profits.\nIn our merchant business, our teams around the world have quickly executed price actions to help offset the escalating energy costs. For this quarter, prices improved compared to last year and last quarter in all 3 largest segments: Asia, Europe and the Americas.\nWe are able to recognize a 10% price increase across the merchant business, which translated to a 5% increase in price for the total company. This is our best pricing results in many years.\nI would like to thank all our teams for the excellent work they have done in response to such a significant challenge. However, we still have more work to do. We are actively executing against price actions across the regions to recover the unprecedented cost impacts.\nVolume improved 8%, up in all segments driven by new assets, hydrogen and merchant recovery and stronger sale of equipment activities. EBITDA increased 8%, again, exceeding the $1 billion mark for a quarter as favorable volume, prices and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs.\nEBITDA margin declined 570 basis points mostly due to the higher energy pass-through, which negatively impacted our margins about 450 basis points, while higher cost net of price increases contributed to the remaining shortfall. Sequentially, volumes were down 3% primarily due to the strong sale of equipment in prior quarter. The 2% price increase was a direct result of our ongoing price action.\nEBITDA was 4% lower sequentially as better price and equity affiliate income were more than offset by higher costs and lower sale of equipment profit recognition. ROCE was 10.3%. We currently have significant cash on our balance sheet, which will support the major projects we have announced.\nAdjusting for this cash, our ROCE would have been 13.9%. We expect ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash and bring projects on stream.\nNow please turn to Slide 15. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.52, which is $0.40 or 19% above last year. Volume was favorable $0.19. And price, net of variable cost, was modestly unfavorable $0.04 as our price actions were able to offset most of the unprecedented energy cost increases. For the quarter, our price actions alone before netting against variable costs contributed about $0.40. Costs were up this quarter.\nSimilar to prior quarters, our growth strategy has us continuing to invest in additional resources. The very high and dynamic energy prices in our last -- in our largest 3 segments also impacted our supply chain as we incurred higher operating and distribution costs to keep our customers supplied.\nWe had additional discretionary compensation this quarter and a positive settlement of a supply contract last year, neither of which will continue in the future. The ongoing EPS contribution of the Jazan joint venture this quarter represents 2 months and is consistent with our commitment, adding to both equity affiliate income and nonoperating income.\nEquity affiliate income increased $0.29, including the ongoing Jazan results, the deferred profit recognition and the unfavorable ASU joint venture settlement, which I mentioned earlier. Noncontrolling interest was $0.07 favorable versus prior year, representing our partners' portion of the ASU joint venture settlement. Nonoperating income was flat as the interest income from the shareholder loans associated with the Jazan joint venture was offset by higher pension expense.\nOur first quarter effective tax rate of 17.1% was 220 basis points lower than last year, including the favorable impact of Jazan. It is seasonally lower primarily due to the additional share-based compensation, and we still expect our tax rate to be 19% to 20% this year.\nNow please turn to Slide 16. The stability of our business continues to allow us to generate strong cash flow despite the challenging energy environment. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.8 billion of distributable cash flow or about $12.50 per share.\nFrom our EBITDA of almost $4 billion, we pay interest, tax and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual driven in part by the spending on our new global headquarters, which is now essentially complete.\nFrom the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or $1.3 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.5 billion available for high-return projects. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.\nSlide #17 provides an update on our capital deployment. We continue to make great progress in developing and executing our major growth projects. In fact, we see potential opportunities significantly greater than the investment capacity we show here.\nWith the closing of Jazan Phase 1, we see a reduction in cash on hand and an increase in capital RA spent. As you can see, our deployment potential is over $33 billion through fiscal 2027. The $33 billion includes over $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, over $16 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and over $9 billion already spent.\nWe still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating.\nSo you can see we've already spent 27% and have already committed 70% of the updated capacity we show here. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects.\nNow to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #18 for our Asia results. Sales were up 9% compared to last year. Volumes grew 4% due to a strong on-site volume as a variety of the small- to medium-sized new plants came on the stream across the region.\nThe Lu'An facility continues to operate at full capacity under the interim supply agreement. We continue to recognize that reduced fee in quarter 1, consistent with this interim supply agreement. We expect this to continue through fiscal year 2022 before returning to the full fee in 2023.\nWe saw the best price performance for Asia in nearly 2 years. The 3% overall price increase improvement for the region equals to about 8% price increase for our merchant business. Our team has implemented price action in response to higher power costs and general inflation.\nChina's government has also relaxed its power tariff program to allow local power costs to fluctuate. This market-oriented approach may result in more variability in our power costs going forward. We are monitoring this situation very closely.\nIn addition, China's effort to reduce energy usage and intensity through its Dual Control policy continue to impact customer demand and caused isolated disruptions of our plants. This had a very modest negative impact on our plant efficiency and supply chain costs. This impact was more prominent earlier in the quarter and seem to ease in December.\nCosts were also unfavorable due to resources that we needed to add to support our new project start-ups in the region and higher without the COVID-related government incentives that we received last year. EBITDA was up 2% as better volumes, price and currencies more than offset higher costs. Sequentially, sales and profits were up as strong price more than offset higher costs.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Simon to talk about our European results. Simon?\n\nSimon R. Moore\n\nVP of IR, Corporate Relations & Sustainability, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 19. Before I get into our Europe results and to build on Melissa's comments earlier, I wanted to share some details related to the unprecedented energy cost increases this quarter.\nEnergy costs climbed throughout the quarter from already elevated levels. Natural gas costs were almost 6x higher, and power costs were almost 4x higher than the beginning of the calendar year. While the energy costs have been elevated all year, this quarter saw energy costs more than double from the previous quarter.\nAs Melissa mentioned, our on-site business has contractual pass-through of the higher costs. For the merchant business, our team has delivered significant price actions to partially recover the recent cost increases.\nI also would like to thank our European team for their extraordinary efforts. Although we are very proud of the work done by our team, our price actions have not fully recovered the cost increase. And as Melissa said, we have more work to do. We do believe we will be able to recover this shortfall by the end of the year.\nNow please turn to Slide 20 for a review of our Europe results. Sales increased 37% versus last year. Volume and price were strong and together grew 14%. However, our profit and margin were unfavorable this quarter due to the dramatic energy cost increases. The energy cost pass-through increased sales 27% but did not increase profit.\nFor the quarter, our price actions resulted in a 9% price gain for the region, which corresponds to a 14% improvement for the merchant business. Prices were higher across all major product lines and subregions. Volume increased 5% primarily driven by improved hydrogen and merchant demand. Currencies were unfavorable 4% primarily due to the weaker euro against the U.S. dollar. For this quarter, other costs also increased.\nThe very significant energy cost increases also disrupted our supply chain, negatively impacting both plant, operating and distribution efficiencies. We also saw inflation, higher maintenance, discretionary incentive compensation and COVID-related costs, while we continue to invest in additional resources needed to support our growth strategy.\nEBITDA was down 19% as higher costs were partially offset by price increases. Volume was positive in sales but did not contribute significantly to profit due to unfavorable mix. EBITDA margin was 1,500 basis points lower. About 700 basis points of the decline was due to the significant energy cost pass-through increase, while the remainder was mostly due to higher costs, partially offset by price in the merchant business.\nCompared to prior quarter, EBITDA was 19% lower due to unfavorable business mix, higher costs and lower equity affiliate income. Higher energy pass-through also negatively impacted margin by about 350 basis points sequentially.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a brief discussion of our other segments.\n\nSamir J. Serhan\n\nCOO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 21 for a review of our Americas results. Sales increased more than 30% versus last year. Volume and price together were up 11%, while energy cost pass-through accounted for the remaining increase. Volume grew 8% primarily due to hydrogen recovery and a strong merchant demand.\nAlthough our hydrogen business has improved, it has not yet fully returned to its pre-COVID levels. Similar to other regions, Americas also experienced significant energy cost increases versus last year. Our team has done an excellent job raising prices to cover the energy cost increase in this quarter.\nThe 3% gain for the region is equivalent to 9% on our merchant business. Costs were favorable despite inflation and supply chain-related challenges and partly due to lower maintenance costs this quarter. We expect planned maintenance activities to pick up next quarter.\nEBITDA posted another double-digit gain, 14% ahead of last year as better volume, price and equity affiliate income more than offset the higher energy costs. EBITDA margin was 560 basis points lower than last year. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 700 basis points. In other words, EBITDA margin would have been up, excluding the energy cost pass-through.\nSequentially, EBITDA was lower due to higher maintenance costs. Higher energy costs pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 300 basis points.\nNow please turn to Slide 22, our newly created Middle East and India segment. Again, as I stated before, this segment is composed of our businesses in the Middle East, including the Jazan joint venture and our business in India.\nSales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly owned operations are smaller in size. However, the segment's EBITDA is significant since it includes the equity affiliate income related to the Jazan joint venture and our India joint venture.\nThe roughly $70 million increase in equity affiliate income included our share of the Jazan joint venture net profit for 2 months. And the net impact (inaudible) the finalization of the ASU joint venture that Melissa previously discussed.\nSales and operating income are up compared to last year due to a new facility on stream in India but are down sequentially to a favorable -- due to a favorable contract settlement in the previous quarter.\nNow please turn to Slide 23, which addresses our new Corporate segment, which now includes our previous Global Gases segment. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs.\nOver the past few years, our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses have grown considerably, are now contributing most of the sales in this segment. However, the margins of these businesses are typically below our company average. Sales were higher in this quarter driven by increased project activities, but the profits were lower due to higher corporate costs and without last year's settlement of a supply contract.\nAt this point, I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing comments. Seifi?\n\nSeifollah Ghasemi\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Dr. Serhan. During my nearly 5 decades in business, I have learned that the world changes all the time, sometimes in very unpredictable ways as we have seen in the past several years. Therefore, for an organization, the ability to anticipate, plan and react to change with speed and resiliency is key to success.\nI have also learned that all challenges can be addressed by staying focused and united and calm and by working towards a common goal. That is why I'm proud that despite the continuing adverse effects of the pandemic, the rising costs, inflation, supply chain disruptions and all of the challenges facing us, our people at Air Products have done just what we expected them to do. That is, they have adapted to the change and are acting accordingly. This is why we delivered strong results despite all of these challenges.\nOur volume, price and profits all grew this quarter versus last year even as they stayed the course and added resources to support our opportunities and world-scale projects for the cleaner energy future. I truly believe that our company has become even stronger in the past 2 years and fully expect to deliver significant earnings growth as the economies around the world normalize and our new projects come on stream.\nNow please turn to Slide #24. As I said, I remain highly confident of Air Products' resilient business model, our strategy and our execution. However, I do have some concerns on the economic backdrop driven by continued COVID challenge, the impact of supply chain constraints, inflation, energy costs and geopolitical tensions.\nTherefore, for quarter 2 of fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance is $2.30 to $2.40, up $0.11 to $0.15 over last year. For fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $10.20 to $10.40, which is 13% to 15% better than last year. We continue to see our capital expenditure in 2022 to be around $4.5 billion to $5 billion, including the approximately $1.5 billion for Phase 1 of the Jazan project.\nNow please turn to Slide #25. The opportunities created by the energy transition are immense. That is why through our mega projects in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, we are acting as a first mover. We are taking real action through real world-scale investments in projects that address significant energy and environmental challenges.\nWe have the portfolio of experiences and technologies that we can bring together in an optimal configuration for a project. Working with customers and countries around the world, we will deliver low carbon forms of energy and improve their sustainability.\nIn addition to investment and technology, we know that as always, the real enablers of this transition are the people who work alongside our customers and bring our opportunities and projects to life. At Air Products, we have consciously increased our talent and resources to take on these urgent challenges, adding over 3,000 people over the past 2 years.\nAs we drive toward a clean energy world, we need talented people to help us accelerate the progress. We are continuing to build a diverse and inclusive culture that our people feel they belong and know that their contribution matters. As I always say, our long-term competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of our people. I know that through their hard work and contribution, we will continue to succeed.\nNow we are pleased to answer your questions. Operator?"

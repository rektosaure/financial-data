Welcome to NASDAQ Third Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's third quarter 2025 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation accompanying this call can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nI would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve risks. A summary of these risks is contained in our press release and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. We will discuss our financial performance on a non-GAAP basis excluding the impact of the divestiture and the impact of changes in FX, adjusted and organic year-over-year changes reflect the $32 million revenue adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 for the change to the accounting treatment of revenues associated with AxiomSL on-premise subscription contracts, which are included in the Financial Technology segment.\nDefinitions and reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP plus adjustments can be found in our earnings presentation as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. I will start with Nasdaq's third quarter results and will then review the performance across our divisions before handing the call over to Sarah for a more detailed discussion of our financials.\nI'm pleased with Nasdaq's excellent overall financial performance in the quarter. We delivered $1.3 billion in net revenue, a year-over-year increase of 11%. Solutions quarterly revenues were over $1 billion for the first time in our history, a milestone truly reflective of our transformation to a leading technology platform, representing 10% year-over-year growth.\nOur overall annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% to $3 billion. Expenses were $583 million, up 5% year-over-year. Operating income was $732 million, up 16%, and we delivered 19% diluted EPS growth. This quarter's results reflect the strength of our diversified platform and our ability to partner effectively with our clients on their evolving priorities. We're showing the value of being the trusted fabric of the financial system by empowering clients to leverage technology, data and advanced analytics to help to capture opportunities, navigate risk and strengthen resilience.\nWe're reinforcing our leadership across the capital markets, deepening our competitive advantage as we drive innovation across the financial industry.\nAs you look to the wider macroeconomic environment, the U.S. economy remains resilient, supported by solid fundamentals, but economic signals are mixed. While some consumers have faced headwinds, overall consumer spending has picked up in recent months. Additionally, the services industry remains an expansion and corporate investment in technology and AI continued contributing to persistent economic growth.\nIn Europe, although growth remains subdued, expectations for recovery in demand and renewed investments point to a gradual outlook.\nWe continue to see durable demand for technology that supports the modernization of the financial system and are increasingly supporting clients with AI-enabled solutions. As our investments in AI continue, we are deepening our competitive position and providing value to our clients through a combination of sophisticated solutions embedded with decades of expertise, our highly differentiated proprietary data and the powerful network effects of our platforms across our clientele.\nTurning to our high-level financial performance within the divisions. Capital Access platforms generated 8% revenue growth and 6% ARR growth. Financial Technology delivered 13% revenue growth and 12% ARR growth. And Market Services delivered 13% net revenue growth.\nI'll now cover our business and operational highlights, beginning with capital access platform, where I'll start with data and listings. We delivered a strong quarter in data and listings, supported by our continued market leadership. In our U.S. listings franchise, we welcomed operating companies that raised $6 billion in proceeds in the quarter with over $14 billion raised year-to-date. The European listings business also delivered a solid third quarter, and we are pleased to welcome [ Verisure ] to the Stockholm market in October, the largest European IPO since 2022.\nIncreasing IPO activity signals promising developments in the public markets. We see meaningful momentum, particularly among companies with strong fundamentals and compelling growth stories. From a macroeconomic perspective, continued global uncertainty is impacting certain sectors, resulting in some delays in IPOs. However, this dynamic is balanced by several trends, giving investors more confidence to invest in new issuances, including an expectation of lower cost of capital, the resilience of the U.S. economy and the deregulatory agenda in Washington.\nOur IPO pipeline is robust, and we continue to expect a meaningful pickup in IPO activity in the quarters ahead. While we are experiencing some short-term delays from the government shutdown, a strengthening foundation is in place and the market is showing signs of durable reengagement.\nWe are also encouraged by recent announcements from the SEC aimed at improving the public company experience. There has been meaningful progress on the policy priorities we outlined at our March white paper, particularly across scaled disclosure release, smart regulation and efforts to modernize the proxy process. We're pleased that the SEC recently approved the ability to file IPO documentation with mandatory arbitration as a condition and we're encouraged by the administration's interest in reducing the frequency of SEC-mandated disclosures.\nMoving to our data business. We delivered strong growth underpinned by robust sales and net retention as well as active retail engagement in the markets, which continues to drive usage. This quarter, we signed 5 enterprise license agreements, including a leading U.S. financial advisory firm, showcasing our continued momentum in this business.\nIn our index franchise, we continue to deliver strong growth. We had a record $91 billion in net inflows over the last 12 months and $17 billion in net inflows in the quarter. We exited the quarter with ETP AUM of $829 billion, an all-time high. We also continue to deliver on our 3 growth pillars of product innovation, international expansion and institutional adoption. We launched 30 new index products in the quarter, including 18 international products and 13 in the institutional insurance annuity space.\nWithin Workflow and Insights, our Corporate Solutions and Analytics businesses benefited from new product innovations that are expanding the ways we add value to our clients. In Corporate Solutions, while the corporate buying environment in the business remains muted, our targeted investments in our product capabilities and client engagement are building on our foundation and resulting in improving growth in net retention.\nIn Analytics, we're focusing our efforts on enhancing investment capabilities and expanding our role across the broader investment management workflows through partnerships, setting the stage for meaningful and sustained growth. In Q3, we were pleased to sign an agreement with Juniper Square, a fund operations partner to more than 2,000 private market GPs to distribute investment data through Juniper Square's fundraising platform.\nWe're expanding the scale and reach of our unique data assets to meet the evolving needs of our clients and to enhance the value that we bring to asset owners and asset managers, including in the private market space. Since the beginning of 2025, we have nearly doubled the number of private funds covered with an investment to 60,000 funds supporting growth in new sales and upsells. Earlier this month, we completed the sale of Nasdaq Solovis to Insight Partners. While Solovis has valuable portfolio management capabilities to asset owners, we determined that its offerings were not a strategic fit within our portfolio and provide limited integrated value to the eVestment analytics platform. We believe Solovis will be better positioned to grow and thrive under new ownership that is more closely aligned with this long-term direction.\nTurning next to Financial Technology. We delivered strong growth across all subdivisions. This was driven by sustained global demand for our mission-critical technologies and successful execution by our teams. Our sales execution remained robust as we signed 65 new clients, 4 cross-sells and 97 upsells during the quarter.\nTurning now to a review of the subdivisions, starting with financial crime management technology. Nasdaq Verafin had another solid quarter of execution across its client base, which now totals more than 2,700 financial institutions representing more than $11 trillion in collective assets.\nDuring the quarter, we signed Goldman Sachs as a new Nasdaq Verafin client. This cross-sell for our consortium-based payments fraud solution expands Nasdaq's relationship with the bank, demonstrating the strength of our One NASDAQ strategy.\nIn regulatory technology, we continue to see strong momentum with 6 new clients, 2 cross-sells and 31 upsells in surveillance and 22 upsells for AxiomSL. In the quarter, we are pleased to partner with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, to enhance its market surveillance and fraud detection capabilities by signing with us to deploy Nasdaq's industry-leading suite of surveillance technology.\nAdditionally, early in the fourth quarter, we signed an AxiomSL cross-sell to a global Tier 1 bank for an enterprise cloud deployment, demonstrating how we are using both the scale of our solutions and the trust we've established across multiple products to reinforce our leading market position.\nCapital Markets Technology also delivered a solid quarter with strong sales momentum. We maintained robust client engagement in the third quarter and saw persistent demand for our technology solutions. Market Technology secured 5 upsells and Calypso signed 4 new clients and 39 upsells.\nNow turning to Market Services. The division continues to deliver double-digit organic net revenue growth, reflecting broad-based strength across our U.S. and European markets. Growth resulted from elevated volumes in U.S. options and U.S. equities as well as excellent growth in index options trading. We generated record revenues and volumes in the U.S. options in the third quarter with the industry experiencing 6 of the top 10 volume days in history measured by options contracts traded, with a subsequent record established in October.\nWithin our U.S. options business, NASDAQ index options volumes also hit record levels in the third quarter with a subsequent record established in October. In U.S. equities, industry volumes remained robust during the summer months and have persisted into the fall. NASDAQ listed securities currently represent 53% of total industry volume, up from 49% a year ago, which demonstrates the strength of our platform as a trusted source to attract issuers and capital into the most liquid and transparent market in the world. In September, Nasdaq's Closing Cross set a daily notional value record.\nIn summary, our strong third quarter performance reflects solid momentum across all 3 divisions, driven by disciplined execution of our teams across our diversified businesses including continued progress on our strategic priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. Within our integrated priority, we're extremely pleased that we surpassed our expanded net expense efficiency target with over $150 million actions as of the end of the quarter. We achieved a gross leverage ratio of 3.1x at quarter end. In addition, S&P recognized our deleveraging progress with an upgrade of the company's senior unsecured debt rating from BBB to BBB+ on August 12, which results in both rating agencies having upgraded us back to our [ pre-Adenza ] acquisition levels.\nWithin our Innovate priority, we're pioneering the use of new technologies across the financial system and forming innovative partnerships to support our growth. This quarter, we submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to leverage our existing resilient trading infrastructure that, if approved, will enable equity securities and exchange traded funds to be traded on the NASDAQ stock market in traditional and tokenized form. Our proposal is for the underlying security itself to be tokenized, preserving investors' rights and benefits of share ownership.\nTurning to AI implementation in our solutions. In Corporate Solutions, over 800 clients have opted into our AI-powered Board summarization tools within Boardvantage. Our AI features with IR Insight drive efficiency and IR officer workflows, particularly related to deriving insights and connecting successfully with investors. In financial crime management technology, we're experiencing enthusiastic engagement with our clients in our rollout of Nasdaq Verafin's Agentic AI workforce that we announced in Q3. The suite of digital workers is a new solution, which we're offering to our existing client base to help address the resource-intensive pain points and daily compliance workflows.\nThe first digital worker is our digital sanctions analyst, which we launched this month into production. Our next digital worker, a digital enhanced due diligence analyst is on track for release by the end of the year.\nThis quarter, Nasdaq Verafin also announced a strategic partnership with BioCatch, a leader in behavioral and device intelligence. In Phase 1 of our partnership, where we've integrated BioCatch's alerts into the workflow of Verafin's anti-financial crime solution and launched a joint go-to-market campaign with Verafin's SMB segment, which is generating strong early engagement. Looking ahead, we plan to work with BioCatch to accelerate our expansion into enterprise banks and international markets.\nLastly, within our Accelerate priority, our One Nasdaq strategy continues to deliver driving 4 cross-sell wins across financial technology in the quarter for a total of 30 cross-sells since the [ Addenda ] acquisition closed. At the end of the quarter, cross-sells accounted for over 15% of financial technology sales pipeline, and we remain on track to surpass $100 million in run rate revenue from cross-sells by the end of 2027.\nWe're also proud to see the impact of our transformation reinforced externally. Nasdaq made its first ever parents on Interbrand's best global brands, an annual ranking of the top 100 most valuable brands, reflecting the critical role we play across the world's economies.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2025, Nasdaq remains well positioned to continue to deliver for our clients and shareholders as we head into the final months of the year with strong momentum across our platform.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Sarah to provide more details on our financial results.\n\nSarah M. Youngwood\n\nMD and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2025, Nasdaq delivered another strong quarter with 19% EPS growth. We surpassed the EPS accretion milestone provided when we acquired Adenza, achieving our goal 6 months ahead of plan.\nLet's start with quarterly results on Slide 11. We reported net revenue of $1.3 billion, up 11% with solutions revenue up 10%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Operating expense was $583 million, up 5%, leading to an operating margin of 56% and EBITDA margin of [ 58% ], both up 2 percentage points over the prior year quarter. This resulted in net income of $511 million and diluted EPS of $0.88.\nSlide 12 shows the drivers of our 11% net revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 8 percentage points of Alpha driven by new and existing clients and product innovation. Beta factors contributed 3 percentage points of growth this quarter, driven by elevated volumes in Market Services, and higher valuation in NASDAQ indices.\nAs shown on Slide 13, we achieved a third consecutive quarter of 9% ARR growth, including 12% in fintech and ARR surpassed $3 billion for the first time. Total SaaS revenues grew 12% for a second consecutive quarter, including 17% SaaS word in fintech. SaaS as a percentage of ARR increased 1 percentage points versus the prior year quarter to 38%.\nLet's review division results starting on Slide 14. In capital asset platforms, we delivered revenue of $546 million, up 8%, with ARR growth of 6%. Data & Listing revenue was up 6% with ARR up 7%. Data revenue growth was driven by new sales, upsells and usage. We also had improved Listings revenue growth due to the increase in IPO activity. Both from new listing and pricing was partially offset by delisting and lower amortization of prior period initial listing fees. This is consistent with our previous comments and our previously stated expectations of this impact in the fourth quarter remain unchanged.\nIndex revenue was up 13% in the quarter, with 9 percentage points from Alpha factors. Revenue growth was driven by a 35% increase in average [indiscernible], which reached a record $777 billion. The strong growth of AUM was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in derivative contract volumes, mix shift in asset-based products and derivatives as well as a decline in revenue from discontinued advertising on nasdaq.com.\nNet inflows over the last 12 months reached a record $91 billion, including $17 billion in the third quarter. In Wealth Fund Insights, revenue was up 5% with ARR growth of 4%. The revenue increase was driven primarily by analytics, mainly investment and data link, with continued demand from hedge funds, asset managers, asset owners and consultants who value our differentiated data and continued product enhancements.\nCorporate Solutions revenue was essentially flat, but we saw improving new sales as well as better growth and net retention trends. Quarterly operating margin for the division was 60%, up 2 percentage points versus the prior year quarter.\nBefore we wrap up on CAP, the impact of the October 16 Solovis sale will be approximately $7 million to $8 million in quarterly revenue with approximately $6 million in direct quarterly costs.\nMoving to Financial Technology on Slide 15. Revenue was $457 million, up 13% with ARR growth of 12%. Our business continues to experience strong demand across all fintech subdivisions and high levels of client engagement. The division signed 65 new clients, 97 upsells and 4 cross sales in the quarter. [ Cross ] sales continue to represent over 15% of the Financial Technology division pipeline with strength across all 3 subdivisions. Financial client management technology revenue grew 22% with ARR growth of 18%. We signed 55 new SME clients in the third quarter. Net revenue retention was 111%, reflecting strong client engagement supported by the increasing adoption of the GenAI entity Research CoPilot and targeted typology analytics.\nWe also had continued momentum with enterprise clients, including the cross-sell to Goldman Sachs which Adena mentioned earlier. With that, we are at 6 new enterprise client signings so far this year, which is more than triple the number of enterprise signings in 2024 and more than double the ACV.\nAs the business continues to make strong progress in moving upmarket, we want to reiterate that sales cycle and time to value for Tier 1 and Tier 2 deals can take time to flow into subscription revenue run rate. We continue to expect the recent enterprise signings to translate into stronger revenue growth starting in the fourth quarter, consistent with our comments last quarter.\nRegulatory Technologies revenue grew 9% with ARR up 11% for the quarter, reflecting a decline in professional services revenue versus the prior year period, which we expected and communicated on the second quarter call. The sub division signed 6 new clients, 53 upsells and 3 cross sales. Revenue growth reflects solid performance and we continue to expect professional services revenue to start to improve in the fourth quarter and early 2026.\nCapital Markets Technology revenue grew 12%, benefiting from strong performance in trade management services and a contribution from Calypso upfront revenue. ARR was up 10% for the quarter. The sub division signed 4 new clients and 44 upsells.\nFinancial Technology operating margin was 45%, up 1.5 percentage points versus the prior year quarter.\nAs we wrap up our Solutions division, we continue to expect full year 2025 revenue growth within the medium-term outlook for both capital access platforms and financial technology, with capital access platforms at slightly above the high end of the range coming from continued strength in index growth and slightly better-than-expected performance in data and listings.\nWithin fintech, we have great business momentum in financial client management technology. But based on the performance of the first 3 quarters of the year, we are expecting the business to end or just below the range.\nTurning to Market Services on Slide 16. We had net revenue of $303 million, reflecting growth of 13%. Growth was primarily driven by elevated market-wide equity volumes, record U.S. option industry volumes, increased volumes and capture in index options with index options revenue more than doubling versus the prior year period, and elevated capture in European derivatives. This was partially offset by lower share in U.S. options, lower capture in U.S. equities, which our team is managing actively and effectively in a competitive landscape, and lower USA plant revenue versus the prior year quarter, which included a previously disclosed $3 million benefit, reflecting cumulative audit and other onetime benefits. Market Services operating margin was 65%, up 5 percentage points versus the prior year quarter due to higher revenue.\nMoving to expense on Slide 17. We had operating expense of $583 million, up 5%, driven by employee compensation, strong investments in technology and people to support revenue and drive innovation and growth and other increases largely due to inflation. This resulted in an operating margin and EBITDA margin both up 2 percentage points to 56% and 58%, respectively.\nWe are updating our organic expense expectations for the year to a range of $2.305 billion to $2.335 billion from the previous range of $2.295 billion to $2.335 billion. This update reflects our strong revenue growth throughout the year, continued investments in our technology and people and the sale of Solovis just closed, which was mostly offset by FX.\nLastly on expense. We have surpassed our expanded net expense efficiency program target of $140 million with over $150 million in cost reduction actions, as of the end of the third quarter. On taxes, while we believe our previous 2025 non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 22.5% to 24.5% is an appropriate expected tax range, we are lowering our full year tax guidance to 22.5% to 23.5% due to some discrete items, that's the word of tax rate in this third quarter.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 18. NASDAQ generated free cash flow of $516 million in the third quarter and $2.1 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months, at a strong conversion ratio of 110%. The strong level of cash flow supports our dividend, deleveraging and share repurchases. We paid a dividend of $0.27 per share or $155 million in the quarter, representing a 33% annualized payout ratio. In our continued commitment towards deleveraging, we repurchased $69 million of debt and reached a gross leverage ratio of 3.1x at the end of the quarter, which was an improvement of 0.1x from the second quarter. We expect to reach 3.0 by the end of the year, excluding the effects of FX. We also repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $115 million in the third quarter.\nIn closing, NASDAQ delivered excellent results in a dynamic operating environment while demonstrating strong operating leverage. Our third quarter financial results, particularly the new record in quarterly solutions revenue and ARR reflects our transformation into a leading technology platform. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, deliver sustainable growth and generate long-term shareholder value. With that, let's open the line to Q&A."

Welcome to the Nasdaq Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call [Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation accompanying this call can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nI would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve risks. A summary of those risks is contained in our press release with a more complete description in our annual report on Form 10-K. We will discuss our financial performance on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of divestitures and the impact of FX. Organic and adjusted growth rates are equivalent this quarter as they include the same period-over-period adjustments. Definitions and reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP plus adjustments can be found in our earnings presentation as well as in the file in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nAlso, we have included a page in the appendix regarding the sale of our Nordic power futures business to Euronext. And with that, I will turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. I will start with Nasdaq's second quarter results and will then review the performance across our divisions before handing the call over to Sarah for a more detailed discussion of our financials. I'm pleased with Nasdaq's excellent overall financial performance in the quarter. We delivered $1.3 billion in net revenue, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Solutions revenues were $991 million, representing 10% year-over-year growth. And our overall annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% to $2.9 billion.\nExpenses were up just under 8% year-over-year driven primarily by the timing of our annual compensation cycle as we communicated on last quarter's call. Operating income of $721 million grew 16%, and we delivered 24% EPS growth. Our results continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified platform and our ability to capture growth through cycles, particularly given the heightened volatility that the markets and our broader client health faced early in the quarter. More broadly, although macroeconomic uncertainty persists, the U.S. economy continues to demonstrate solid fundamentals as the labor market and consumer spending remain resilient. While GDP growth across Europe has still been muted, expectations for a recovery in consumer demand and a rebound of investment into the region support an improving outlook.\nAcross the business environment, investment in technology transformation continues as companies focus on achieving benefits from AI. This is driving momentum across infrastructure modernization, accelerated cloud readiness and enhanced data management. These dynamics are evident across the banking and capital market sectors where clients are focused on technology investments to modernize our infrastructure, improve their risk management and regulatory compliance and fight financial crime.\nAlthough uncertainty remains as to the longer-term impact of trading economic policies, this resilience has translated into a robust sales pipeline across our financial technology solutions as well as active markets, index inflows and an improving IPO landscape.\nTurning to our high-level financial performance within our divisions. Capital Access Platforms generated 9% revenue growth and 6% ARR growth. Financial Technology delivered 10% revenue growth and 11% ARR growth, including 19% of Financial Crime Management Technology, 10% in Regulatory Technology and 9% in Capital Markets Technology, and Market Services delivered 21% net revenue growth.\nI'll now cover our business and operational highlights, beginning with the Capital Access Platform, where I'll start with Data and Listings. In our Listings franchise, the strong momentum in our switch program continued. Year-to-date, $271 billion in market capitalization, including Shopify and Kimberly-Clark have switched to Nasdaq. This represents the best first half performance since the official launch of our switch program 20 years ago.\nTurning to IPOs in the second quarter, we welcomed 38 new operating companies to Nasdaq, representing a 79% win rate, raising a total of $3.6 billion and extending Nasdaq's listing leadership to 46 consecutive quarters. Year-to-date, we saw the highest level of new issuances in the first half -- since the first half of 2021, attracting 83 operating companies, including 3 of the top 5 largest IPOs with an overall 81% win rate. Importantly, the strong performance of recent listings, especially of large-cap companies has raised optimism on the IPO outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2026.\nOur European listings business also delivered a great second quarter with 6 new listings. Year-to-date, Nasdaq exchanges in Europe welcomed 10 new listings, which similarly included 3 of the 5 largest IPOs in Europe. Combined, these IPOs raised EUR 2 billion, 53% of all IPO capital raised in Europe and a fivefold increase in capital raise compared to the first half of 2024.\nWe're particularly excited to see our Stockholm Exchange continue to lead as Europe's premier destination for new listings, underpinned by the relative valuation of its market and the strength of the local ecosystem. Our data business performance reflects strong and sustained demand for our comprehensive and innovative data products, with growth in new sales, upsells and usage across our client segments and geographies.\nOur industry-leading index franchise continues to drive solid growth. We managed through heightened volatility as market value declines at the beginning of the quarter were offset by higher derivative volumes followed by a fast recovery in market values. Throughout the quarter, inflows were strong at $20 billion. Over the last 12 months, we achieved a new record for net inflows of $88 billion. As volatility stabilized, we exited the quarter with a new record ETP AUM at $745 billion.\nWe remain focused on product innovation with 33 new products launched during the quarter, over half of which were international. Additionally, we continue to focus on growing our exposure to institutional clients with the launch of 7 products within the insurance annuity space. Earlier this week, we were pleased to announce that Nasdaq and CME Group signed an extension through 2039 of CME Group's exclusive contract to offer futures and options on futures based on the Nasdaq 100 and other Nasdaq indices, reflecting the company's shared commitment to delivering value through trusted benchmark products.\nI also want to provide a brief comment on the proposed reclassification of the Invesco QQQ Trust. Nasdaq was engaged with Invesco as Invesco explored these proposals. Importantly, the proposed change does not alter the terms of Nasdaq's listing -- licensing arrangements with Invesco nor the administration of the Nasdaq 100 Index. We remain committed to our strategic partnership with Invesco and to delivering the trusted benchmark on which investors rely.\nWithin Workflow and Insights, Corporate Solutions delivered modest growth, benefiting from our product and technology investments, which have enhanced our competitive position. We drove several notable wins, including a Nasdaq Boardvantage sale to a large international bank, which is also a significant fintech client. In Analytics, we continue to see strong demand for our datalink and investment solutions across the investment management community as well as improved gross retention rates.\nLastly, across Cap, we are focused on meeting the growing demand for Private Market Solutions. In June, we announced a partnership to be the exclusive distributor of Nasdaq Private Markets, Tape D API, bringing enhanced transparency and valuation visibility of private companies. Since launch, we have already signed 2 clients, and the pipeline is building. For asset managers and asset owners, our eVestment platform provides a wealth of Private Markets intelligence, which has become an increasingly powerful aspect to drive new sales and client retention.\nTurning next to Financial Technology. We delivered growth across products, client segments and geographies. This was driven by sustained demand for our mission-critical technologies and terrific execution by our teams, especially considering the complexity of the landscape for financial institutions throughout the quarter. Our sales execution remains strong as we signed 57 new clients, 7 cross-sells and 130 upsells during the quarter.\nTurning to a review of the subdivision, starting with Financial Crime Management Technology. Nasdaq Verafin had another solid quarter of execution across client segments and continue to lead the industry through product innovation. In the Enterprise Client segment serving Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, we successfully executed on our land and expand strategy with 3 new signings, including 1 cross-sell and 2 upsells. We are also pleased with the ongoing progress in our upsell conversion timeline, maintaining the 50% reduction in the sales cycle as compared to the original contract. We signed our first proof of concept with a European Tier 1 bank for our construction-based payments fraud offering during the quarter, marking a significant milestone in our early efforts to expand into Europe. And demand among our small and medium-sized client segment also remained solid with 46 new clients signed this quarter.\nTurning next to Regulatory Technology, where we signed 7 new clients and 4 cross-sells collectively. Revenue and ARR growth in AxiomSL were driven by a combination of large prior year client bookings starting to go live in addition to in year bookings. The improving clarity around the regulatory environment in the U.S., for example, with the proposed changes to the supplementary leverage ratio has further contributed to the strength and diversity of our pipeline. In surveillance, beyond the strong revenue and ARR growth, we were pleased to sign 3 cross-sells to existing market tech clients, which included 2 market operators and a large financial institution.\nCapital Markets Technology delivered a solid quarter where strong momentum was further amplified by the normalization of sales cycles. In Market Technology, we are pleased to see strong demand from traditional and emerging trade infrastructure clients for our technology infrastructure solutions as well as our operational expertise. We signed 3 clients to Eqlipse Trading, our fourth-generation marketplace technology platform, including 2 fully managed services mandates where we host and manage our clients' entire trading environment and 1 AWS hosted SaaS deployment. Calypso's performance reflected momentum in subscription revenues, including strong demand in Europe, where we delivered 2 new clients and 1 cross-sell, and we remain confident in the pipeline for the rest of the year.\nTurning now to Market Services. The division delivered record net revenues, reflecting broad-based strength across our U.S. and European markets. We are proud to support our clients with a seamless trading experience as heightened volatility and rapidly evolving market conditions drove record industry volumes for U.S. cash equities and elevated volumes in U.S. equity options and European cash equities.\nWe successfully executed the Russell rebalance with over 2.5 billion shares matched at a record notional value of $102 billion, further showcasing the strength and resiliency of our markets. In U.S. equities, we maintained our disciplined approach to pricing amid an exceptionally high volume as we manage to capture and optimize the value of our franchise. In European equities, we delivered sequential improvements in share. Further, we continue to leverage our capabilities to capture off exchange activity in Europe as well as in the U.S.\nAcross the company overall, our excellent performance was driven by strong momentum across all 3 divisions, underpinned by execution on our strategic priorities. Within our Integrate priority, we are on track to action our expanded $140 million net expense efficiency program by year-end, with approximately $130 million action as of the end of the second quarter. We achieved a gross leverage ratio of 3.2x at quarter end, over achieving our milestones set at the closing of the Adenza acquisition 16 months ahead of schedule.\nWithin our Innovate priority, we remain focused on delivering new innovations to enhance our value proposition with clients. This week, Nasdaq Verafin announced the launch of its Agentic AI workforce, a suite of digital workers that will deliver a step change in compliance effectiveness and efficiency. Early results from the first 2 agents in beta, the digital sanctions analyst and the digital enhanced due diligence analyst demonstrate Agentic AI's potential to address the most resource-intensive compliance workflows. For example, when onboarded into a bank's alert triage workflow, our digital sanctions analyst automates the acknowledgment, screening and documentation processes, reducing alert review workload by more than 80%.\nWe also continue to expand the library of anti-money laundering targeted topology analytics, our [ tariffs ] financing analytics launched in Q1 is already being leveraged by 900 clients, nearly doubling adoption versus the end of the last quarter. Our drug trafficking analytics launched this quarter in early beta has already driven strong client engagement. In addition, we're continuing to invest in new partnerships to enhance product capabilities, including our partnership with Fincom, which supports advanced sanction screening.\nBeyond AI, digital assets represents another key theme driving our innovation as we focus on the maturation of the ecosystem and supporting institutional adoption. For instance, Nasdaq Calypso announced an innovative proof of concept, which will expand upon its industry-leading collateral management capabilities. The use case demonstrates our ability to integrate on chain capabilities to allow us to help financial institutions manage collateral across asset classes and markets in a more dynamic and efficient manner. We continue to work with our partners and clients to finalize the product build and are targeting launch in early to mid-2026.\nLastly, within our Accelerate priority, our One Nasdaq strategy drove 7 cross-sell wins across Financial Technology in the quarter for a total of 26 cross-sells since the Adenza acquisition. At the end of the quarter, cross-sells accounted for over 15% of Financial Technology sales pipeline, and we remain on track to surpass $100 million in run rate revenue from cross-sells by the end of 2027.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2025, Nasdaq is well positioned to continue to deliver for our clients and shareholders. While we remain conscious of the impact of sustained uncertainty in the economic and market environment, we continue to demonstrate that our diversified business can deliver through different cycles. This is reflective of our role as a trusted strategic partner to our clients across the financial ecosystem and our ability to help them navigate across market environments, capture strategic opportunities, manage risk and solidify their operational resilience.\nWe enter the second half of the year with momentum across our platform and will remain laser-focused on supporting and innovating for our clients as the environment evolves in the period ahead.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to provide more details on our financial results.\n\nSarah M. Youngwood\n\nMD and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter of 2025, Nasdaq delivered one of our strongest quarters on record with 24% EPS growth, underscoring the durability of the model and the consistency of our execution. Starting with quarterly results on Slide 11. We reported net revenue of $1.3 billion, up 12%, with solutions revenue of $991 million up 10%.\nOperating expense was $585 million, up just under 8%, leading to an operating margin of 55% and EBITDA margin of 58%, both up 2 percentage points. This resulted in net income of $492 million and diluted EPS of $0.85, up 24%.\nSlide 12 shows the drivers of our 12% net revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 8.5 percentage points of Alpha, driven by new and existing clients and product innovation. Meanwhile, Beta factors contributed 3.5 percentage points of growth this quarter, driven by higher valuations in Nasdaq Indices and higher overall volumes in market services.\nAs shown on Slide 13, we realize a second consecutive quarter of ARR growth of 9%. This quarter's 9% included 11% ARR growth in fintech and SaaS revenue growth of 12%. SaaS as a percentage of ARR increased 1 percentage point to 37% compared to the second quarter of 2024.\nLet's review division results, starting on Slide 14. In Capital Assets Platforms, we delivered revenue of $527 million, up 9% and with ARR growth up 6%. Data and Listings revenue was up 5% with ARR up 7%. Revenue growth was primarily driven by data due to the positive impact of new sales, upsells and usage.\nWithin Listing, the benefits of new listings and pricing were partially offset by delisting and lower amortization of prior period initial listing fees. This is consistent with our previous comments, and we expect that to be the case for the remaining quarters of the year.\nIndex revenue was up 17% in the quarter, mainly driven by average ETP AUM of $663 billion, up 25%. This is due primarily to strong net inflows with more than half of the quarterly revenue growth driven by Alpha factors. ETP AUM included a record $88 billion of net inflows in the 12 months, including $20 billion in the second quarter.\nVolume-based license revenue was also up modestly as derivative contract volume, up 15%, was mostly offset by a mix shift towards micro contracts in the quarter, which have lower capture.\nIn Workflow and Insights, revenue and ARR growth were both up 5% for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by analytics, mainly investment and data link with continued demand from hedge funds, asset managers, asset owners and consultants who value our differentiated data.\nCorporate Solutions also grew modestly due to pricing and key client wins. Quarterly operating margin for the division was 58%, up 1 percentage point.\nMoving to Financial Technology on Slide 15. Revenue was $464 million, up 10% with ARR growth of 11%. We are extremely proud of this result in the context of a top Calypso account. Our business was resilient amid the modest delay we described early in the quarter, which contributed to low single-digit professional services revenue growth. The division signed 57 new clients, 130 upsells and 7 cross sales in the quarter. Even with these wins, cross sales continue to represent over 15% of the Financial Technology divisions pipeline with strength across all 3 subdivisions.\nFinancial Crime Management Technology revenue grew 20%, with ARR growth of 19%. We signed 46 new SMB clients and 3 new enterprise deals, including 1 cross-sell and 2 upsell. Net revenue retention was 113%, reflecting strong client engagement, including the continued adoption of the Gen AI entity research, Copilot, and targeted typology analytics.\nIn addition to persistent execution in the SMB segment, a consistent contributor to growth and ongoing momentum in product innovation, the business continues to make strong progress in moving up market and is showing early traction with our international expansion. As a reminder, the sales cycles and time to value for Tier 1 and Tier 2 deals can take longer to flow into the subscription revenue run rate, but the momentum in the business persists. We more than doubled enterprise signings year-to-date versus all of 2024, which will begin to translate into stronger growth from this client segment starting in the fourth quarter.\nRegulatory Technology revenue grew 11% with ARR up 10% for the quarter. The division signed 7 new clients, 67 upsells and 4 cross-sells. Revenue growth reflects solid performance despite modest client readiness delays driven by regulatory uncertainty. As we get clarity from regulators, professional services revenue should start to improve in the fourth quarter and early 2026.\nCapital Market Technology revenue grew 8% with ARR up 9% for the quarter and with 4 new clients, 61 upsells and 2 cross-sells. Financial Technology operating margin was 47%, which was flat versus the prior year quarter.\nAs we wrap up our Solutions division, we expect our 2025 revenue growth outlook for the divisions and subdivisions to be generally consistent with our comments provided in the April earnings call.\nTurning to Market Services on Slide 16. We had record net revenue of $306 million, reflecting growth of 21%. This included a second consecutive record net revenue quarter in both U.S. options and U.S. cash equities. Growth was primarily driven by the increase in market-wide volumes but also included higher share and slightly higher capture in U.S. options, both in index options, higher capture in European derivatives and higher U.S. state plan revenue. Market Services operating margin was 63%, up 5 percentage points, highlighting the strong operating leverage of this platform.\nMoving to expense on Slide 17. We had operating expense of $585 million, up just under 8%, consistent with expectations provided last quarter and driven by strong investments in technology and people to support revenue and drive innovation and growth, employee compensation and other increases largely due to inflation. This resulted in an operating margin and EBITDA margin both up 2 percentage points to 55% and 58%, respectively. We are maintaining the midpoint of our organic expense expectations for the year, which carries forward our trajectory of healthy operating leverage accompanying our strong revenue performance.\nNow that we have started to experience a more consistent FX impact as the year has progressed, we are updating our 2025 non-GAAP expense guidance to reflect the impact of movements in FX rates and to narrow the overall range with 6 months left to the year. Our guidance is now a range of $2.295 billion to $2.335 billion. The $20 million increase in the midpoint of our guidance is entirely due to FX, with no change to the organic expense growth rate implied by the midpoint of our guidance. Due to the offsetting positive FX impact on net revenue, we expect the change in FX to have no impact on our operating income.\nLastly on expense. We have actioned approximately $130 million out of our $140 million efficiency program as of the end of the second quarter, and our team is well positioned to continue to deliver on the program. We maintained our 2025 non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 22.5% to 24.5%.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 18. Nasdaq NASDAQ generated free cash flow of $467 million in the second quarter. This strong level of cash flow enabled us to support deleveraging our dividends and share repurchases. We paid a dividend of $0.27 per share or $155 million in the quarter, representing a 34% annualized payout ratio. In our continued commitment towards deleveraging, we paid down the $400 million remaining on the June 2025 bonds at maturity using cash on hand. We reached a gross leverage ratio of 3.2x at the end of the quarter, overachieving our 3.3x milestones 16 months early. The 3.2x ratio improved from 3.4x a quarter ago despite a 0.1x headwind from USD weakness relative to euro.\nWe also repurchased a total of 1.2 million shares of our common stock for roughly $100 million in the second quarter, which included the completion of our annual [ amortization ] related repurchases in April as well as opportunistic repurchases beyond that commitment. As we continue to execute against our compelling organic growth strategy, we remain focused on organic investments in the business, our dividend program and opportunistic debt and share repurchases.\nIn closing, Nasdaq delivered excellent results amid a dynamic operating environment. exemplified by a second consecutive quarter of double-digit net revenue growth and ARR growth up 9%. We continue to demonstrate strong operating leverage and make meaningful progress on our capital strategy.\nOur first half performance reflects our ability to growth cycle and underpins our confidence to achieve our 2025 objectives, as well as deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value as we drive forward in the second half of the year and beyond.\nWith that, let's open the line to Q&A."

Welcome to Nasdaq First Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2025 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation accompanying this call can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nI would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve risks. A summary of these risks is contained in our press release and a more complete description in our annual report on Form 10-K. We will discuss our financial performance on a non-GAAP basis and adjusted for the prior year impact on AxiomSL as if we recognize revenue ratably for on-prem contracts and excluding the impact of FX and the previously announced onetime revenue benefit and index in the first quarter of 2024.\nDefinitions and reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP plus adjustments can be found in our earnings presentation as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. This morning, I will start with a review of Nasdaq's financial and operational performance for the quarter. I'll then provide an update on our outlook on the current operating environment before handing the call to Sarah to walk through the financial results in more detail.\nThe year began with favorable business conditions as the global economy maintained solid performance. However, as the quarter progressed, we experienced a marked increase in uncertainty driven by changing trade policies and heightened geopolitical tensions. Nasdaq entered the year in a position of strength and we remained laser-focused on delivering for our clients despite the dynamic nature of the operating environment. The trust that we have built with our clients, the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the diversification of our platform has served us well in these times of heightened uncertainty and volatility.\nAs a result, we've been able to enhance our competitive position, execute our strategy and create value for our clients and for our shareholders. We delivered double-digit growth across all 3 divisions with net revenues of $1.2 billion, representing a 12.5% increase from the prior year period. Solutions revenues were $947 million, representing 11% growth year-over-year, and ARR rose to $2.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year.\nFirst quarter operating income rose 17% and and EPS grew 24%, benefiting from strong revenue performance and expense management, while we continue to invest in our products and capabilities to serve our clients over the long term. At a divisional level, Capital access platforms generated 5% ARR growth and 11% revenue growth, driven by continued strength in both net inflows and new product innovation in our index business.\nFinancial Technology delivered 10% revenue growth. ARR growth was 12%, which included 21% growth for financial crime management technology, 11% growth for regulatory technology and 9% growth for capital markets technology. Market Services delivered 19% net revenue growth driven by record U.S. cash equities and derivatives revenue and growth in European equity derivative volumes and capture.\nBeyond our excellent financial results, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities. After achieving our target of $80 million in net synergies from the [indiscernible] transaction, we expanded our efficiency program to target $140 million inclusive of our original synergy program. And we're on pace to achieve it by year-end with over $100 million actions as of the end of the first quarter. Our strong free cash flow of $674 million in the first quarter supported continued deleveraging and share repurchases to offset dilution from employee vesting.\nFinally, we remain on track to surpass $100 million in run rate revenue from cross-sells by the end of 2027 as we have delivered 19 cross-sells since the Adenza acquisition, including 2 in the first quarter. Turning to our operational highlights. Starting with capital access platforms. We continue to execute on the growing opportunity in front of us as we build new products to help our clients navigate market complexity.\nOur solutions take on increasing importance and periods of uncertainty and market volatility. For example, our analytics platform provides actionable portfolio and fund level insights to help institutional investment clients manage their investment strategies and dynamic markets. In addition, our IR and governance solutions provide market-driven analysis to help corporate clients connect more successfully with their Boards and investors as they manage their businesses through a fast-changing environment.\nMoving down to a review of the capital access platform subdivisions, starting with the data and listings in the first quarter Nasdaq welcomed 45 operating companies raising approximately $5 billion in total proceeds. Overall, Nasdaq had an 82% win rate for Nasdaq eligible operating companies featuring 3 of the top 5 largest IPOs in Core Weave, SailPoint and [indiscernible]. Beyond IPOs, we have sustained our listing transfers momentum with several marquee switches in the first quarter, including Shopify, Thomson Reuters and Domino's Pizza.\nAfter celebrating our 500th switch last year, during the first quarter, we officially crossed the $3 trillion threshold in combined market value for listing transfers to Nasdaq since we first launched our Switch program in 2005. This tremendous milestone further reinforces our role as the premier venue for listings in the United States. Building on our listings leadership, we launched a new research and advocacy program to engage the new U.S. administration on a set of policy recommendations that promote capital formation, enhance the public company model and ultimately reinforce the position of the U.S. capital markets.\nIn our data business, we benefited from new sales, upgrades and higher usage across the business as well as strong traction across our new products and geographies. The index business delivered another outstanding quarter as we achieved 26% revenue growth and a record in average ETP AUM for the quarter. Net inflows remained robust, and we continue to see strong increase in derivatives volumes including a record quarter.\nNasdaq's index franchise has multiple vectors for growth, and index's performance reflects the ongoing execution of our growth strategy of new product innovation, international diversification and institutional client expansion. In fact, the new products that we've launched since 2020 have accounted for 33% of net inflows over the last 5 years. We built on this success in the first quarter as we launched 30 new index products including 10 outside the United States and 7 insurance annuity vehicles.\nWithin Workflow and insights, analytics experienced solid growth among the investor community as we continue to engage our data more deeply in client -- integrate our data more deeply in client workflows and applications. In Corporate Solutions, we continue to focus on strengthening our offerings through product enhancements, including AI features, while we manage our corporate clientele for a continued period of elongated sales cycles.\nTurning to our Financial Technology division. We signed 40 new clients, 92 upsells and 2 cross-sells. In today's environment of heightened market activity and complexity, financial institutions and market operators, face an increasing range of challenges that Nasdaq is uniquely positioned to help solve. Our trade life cycle solutions are designed to support our market operator clients around the world during significant burst in trading activity while maintaining a hyper-resilient infrastructure.\nWe also provide mission-critical trading and regulatory reporting infrastructure to banks and brokers worldwide, which help them manage heightened trading and capital risks. As we partner with banks to fight financial crime, a shifting macroeconomic and global political conditions tend to motivate an increase in criminal behavior.\nWe are also focused on advancing Nasdaq's vision to be the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. This morning, we announced an enhanced partnership with AWS that is designed to benefit both our market services and financial technology divisions. Across our own markets, Nasdaq's move to the cloud has enhanced our ability to navigate the current environment successfully due to the increased and instant scalability of our market infrastructure, including our matching engines, resulting in enhanced resiliency and efficiency across our markets.\nThrough our expanded partnership with AWS, we plan to leverage the learnings and expertise gained from our transition as we continue to modernize the global financial ecosystem. Over the coming years, AWS and Nasdaq intend to progress in phases to serve the full range of our financial services clients. It will start with a focus on our market operator clientele through packaged public cloud and hybrid cloud infrastructure, software and services that build on Nasdaq's successful modernization of its own options markets.\nThe combined power of AWS and Nasdaq will enable market operators to modernize in a cost-effective manner while mitigating transformation risk, retaining data sovereignty and maintaining the highest levels of performance, security and resilience. Now turning to a review of our fintech subdivisions, beginning with financial crime management technology. Nasdaq Verafin continued to see robust demand during the first quarter, and we delivered a new cross-sell with the Tier 2 bank. We also added 35 new SMB clients in the first quarter, a 25% increase in new client signings over the prior year quarter.\nNasdaq Verafin's ongoing client growth is contributing to the growth and power of its data consortium, which now includes clients holding more than $10 trillion in total assets. The business has also made progress on its land and expand strategy, signing an expansion deal with an existing Tier 2 Nasdaq Verafin clients. The upsell is negotiated and signed in 6 months. marking approximately a 50% reduction in sales cycle when compared to the original contract.\nMore broadly, we continue to drive enhanced product functionality across the financial crime portfolio. Nasdaq Verafin's Gen AI-powered entity Research copilot has seen a 20% increase in client usage compared to the fourth quarter, showcasing the value and efficiencies that this platform delivers for our clients. Currently, more than 1,200 clients are leveraging the copilot to expedite their alert reviews. Building on this success, we plan to launch a new copilot feature in our case management module. This feature, which is currently in beta with clients will help automate and expedite case investigations and documentation.\nLooking forward to the rest of 2025. We expect to introduce new capabilities that go beyond task automation with the use of Agentic AI, which will enable banks to automate entire workloads allowing for significant efficiency gains in compliance operations like due diligence and sanction screening.\nTurning next to regulatory technology. [indiscernible] signed a large digital bank as a new client and delivered 22 upsells, including a deal with a large Tier 1 U.S. financial institution. The Tier 1 client expanded its suite of AxiomSL services by incorporating a broker-dealer solution alongside their existing U.S., European and Asian reporting modules.\n[indiscernible] signed 4 new clients during the quarter, including a regulator in Europe, a crypto marketplace, an energy trading firm and a broker-dealer, representing the diverse client set that our solutions serve. [indiscernible] continues to see strong demand as clients seek to reduce operational complexity, particularly in the midst of elevated market activity.\nMoving to the Capital Markets Technology subdivision. Our Market Technology business continued to advance its international strategy, helping to modernize capital markets infrastructure across emerging economies with 17 upsells. Nasdaq delivered an upsell with an Asian exchange and a cross-sell with Neon, the consolidation of the marketplaces across Peru, Chile and Colombia. Importantly, the [indiscernible] deal demonstrates how we have become a trusted partner to an existing client that signed on for 2 additional solutions since its initial signing in 2023.\nIn the first quarter, Calypso delivered 25 upsells, which reflect broad-based momentum across our client base, including a significant expansion with the European clients. Now turning to our Market Services division. The volatile market conditions across the first quarter showcased the depth and quality of our markets. Nasdaq is the leading platform across the U.S. and European markets, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with record net revenues and volumes. In the U.S., we generated record net revenues for U.S. options, including index options and U.S. cash equities, and we were pleased to increase our on-exchange market share in U.S. cash equities in the first quarter.\nThese results represent the exceptional performance of our systems, supported by the consistent investments that we have made over the years, the strength of our Closing Cross, our superior liquidity and the trust we've built with our clients. In Europe, we saw strong results across both cash equities and equity derivatives. Within equity derivatives, we saw a year-over-year increase in both volumes and capture. At the start of the second quarter, we experienced unprecedented levels of message traffic and volumes. The U.S. cash equities markets experienced 5 of the 6 highest trading days in industry history, and the U.S. options market had 4 of the 6 highest trading days.\nDuring this period, Nasdaq's markets performed extremely well as we managed enormous volumes in inbound and outbound message traffic, including Nasdaq's most active day ever, on April 7, which exceeded 550 billion messages. Marrying our U.S. markets, European cash equity saw unprecedented activity in the first 2 weeks of April, delivering the 7 highest -- the 7 highest better traffic days on record. I'm proud to say that our team seamlessly navigated this heightened demand and remain prepared for an environment marked by elevated volatility.\nNow I'd like to take a moment to discuss the current macro environment. Recent policy shifts and ongoing talks about potential tariffs have created significant short-term volatility, and that uncertainty is at this point, weighing on global GDP growth expectations. Entering the second quarter, this is creating modest impacts on the timing of corporate decision-making, although without a meaningful change in overall demand. Across our economic cycles -- across all economic cycles, our clients rely on Nasdaq as a trusted partner. Our global markets enable capital formation and provide investors with certainty of execution.\nWe provide corporate issuers with critical access to funding, while providing banks brokers and investors with transparent and efficient mechanisms to adjust their strategies and comprehensively manage risk. Further, the current volatility in U.S. trading has illustrated the critical nature of our markets, and the resilience of their underlying infrastructure. Nasdaq is a global business, and we have teams across the world that serve our clients at a local and regional level, which allows us to understand the specific dynamics our clients face and ensures Nasdaq's physician to help solve them -- help them solve their problems as they evolve.\nAgainst this backdrop, the power of Nasdaq's platform and diversified business positions us for resilient growth as demonstrated by our outstanding first quarter performance.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to provide more details on our financial results.\n\nSarah M. Youngwood\n\nMD and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of 2025, Nasdaq delivered one of our strongest quarters on record with 24% EPS growth and record free cash flow. Starting with quarterly results on Slide 11. We reported net revenue of $1.2 billion, up 12.5% with Solutions revenue of $947 million, up 11%. Operating expense was $555 million, up 7%, leading to an operating margin of 55% and EBITDA margin of 58%, both up 2 percentage points. This resulted in net income of $456 million and diluted EPS of $0.79, up 24%.\nSlide 12, shows the drivers of our 12.5% net revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 9.5 percentage points of alpha driven by new and existing clients, product innovation, as well as excellent market services execution in this volatile market. Meanwhile, beta factors contributed 3 percentage points of growth this quarter, driven by higher valuation in NASDAQ indices and higher overall volumes in both index derivatives and market services.\nAs shown on Slide 13, we had AR growth of 9% and above all quarters of last year, which were between 7% and 8%. This quarter's 9% included 12% ARR growth in fintech and SaaS revenue growth of 14%. SaaS as a percentage of AR increased 2 percentage points to 37% compared to the first quarter of 2024.\nLet's review division results, starting on Slide 14. In capital access platforms, we delivered revenue of $515 million, up 11% and with AR growth of 5%. Data and listings revenue was up 4%, with ARR up 6%. Revenue growth was primarily driven by data due to the positive impact of new sales, higher usage and pricing. Within listing, the benefit of new listings and pricing was offset by delistings and lower amortization of prior period initial listing fees. The revenue headwind from delistings and amortization of initial listing fees in the first quarter was consistent with our previous comments.\nIndex revenue was up 26% in the quarter, mainly driven by record average ETP AUM of $662 billion. This is due in large part to strong net inflows with more than half of the quarterly revenue growth driven by Alpha factors. ETP AUM included $86 billion of net inflows in the last 12 months, including 27 billion in the first quarter, which reflects tremendous recognition and resiliency in the context of the Nasdaq 100 market performance down 8% during the first quarter.\nVolume-based license revenue was also a strong contributor to revenue growth, given the high level of volatility with record derivative contract volumes up 28%. And we see that the revenue share threshold we have in place with our partner CME in March, earlier in the year than we have historically. In workflow and insights, revenue and ARR growth were both up 4% for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by analytics, mainly investment and data link with continued demand from hedge funds, asset managers, asset owners and consultants and a focus on differentiated data as our clients seek alpha.\nCorporate Solutions also grew modestly due to the pricing and improved gross retention. Quarterly operating margin for the division was 60%, up 2 percentage points. As we look to the full year 2025, we continue to expect capital access platforms to deliver 2025 revenue growth within its medium-term growth outlook range of 5% to 8%, with subdivision revenue growth expected to be consistent with our prior comments provided in January.\nMoving to Financial Technology on Slide 15. Revenue was $432 million, up 10% with ARR growth of 12%. The difference between quarterly revenue growth and ARR growth in fintech and capital markets technology is driven by the impact of lower Calypso on-prem subscription revenue due to the tough comp of 23% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, ARR growth remains solid across the subdivisions with the benefit of 40 new clients, 92 upsells and 2 cross-sells in the quarter.\nWhile we closed 2 cross-sell deals this quarter, cross sales continue to represent over 15% of the Financial Technology divisions pipeline, with strength across all 3 subdivisions. Financial client management technology revenue and ARR growth both increased 21% for the quarter, with 35 new SME clients and 1 [indiscernible] with a Tier 2 client as well as an upsell with an existing Tier 2 client.\nNet revenue retention was 113%, reflecting strong client engagement, including the continued adoption of the Gen AI and [indiscernible] Copilot and targeted typology analytics. Regulatory technology revenue increased 10% for the quarter with ARR growth of 11% as well as 5 new clients and 49 upsells. Capital Markets Technology delivered 7% revenue growth for the quarter, with ARR up 9%. And with 42 upsells and 1 crosssell in the quarter. Financial Technology operating margin was 46%, flat versus the prior year quarter.\nLooking ahead to our 2025 revenue growth expectations for financial technology. The uncertainty in the global macro and regulatory environment is causing some delays in large decisions and client readiness. These delays will likely have some effect on revenue and ARR growth in Q2. Additionally, as a reminder, Calypso benefited from a strategic renewal in '24, which created a difficult growth comparison for the upcoming quarter. That being said, we are seeing continued strong demand for our FinTech solutions, which is showing up in a solid 2025 pipeline. Clients continue to engage with us, underscoring the mission-critical nature of our solutions, and we continue to be the partner of choice in competitive situation.\nTherefore, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 2025 revenue growth within the medium-term outlook for both the division and the subdivision with financial client management tech and capital markets tech at the low end of their ranges and with Regtech well within its range.\nWrapping up the division with Market Services on Slide 16. We had record net revenue of $281 million, reflecting growth of 19%. This included record quarterly net revenues in U.S. options, including index options as well as in U.S. cash equities. Growth was primarily driven by the increase in market-wide volumes across all asset classes, but also included higher capture in both U.S. cash equities and European equity derivatives, higher market share in available on-exchange trading volumes in U.S. cash equities and higher U.S. state plan revenue.\nOur trading businesses have executed well during this period of significant market activity. In North America, we reached a record of more than 430 billion messages in the second day in Q1. This compares to around 200 billion messages per day, which we referenced at Investor Day in early 2024. Our clients increasingly rely on us during periods of extraordinary market conditions. And as such, give us persistent market share leadership and premium capture. This is only possible because of the major investments we've made to modernize and scale our trading infrastructure.\nTo normalize our [indiscernible] computations for market volatility in U.S. equity options and U.S. cash equities, we're including an average daily volume provision to our methodology, in which half of the net revenue generated from above [indiscernible] volume is attributed to Alpha. These thresholds are at 10% above the trailing 3-year industry average daily volume. As noted on Page 12, the addition of this new provision to [indiscernible] methodology would not have materially changed any alpha, beta splits in the projects we have reported.\nMarket Services operating margin was 62%, up 5 percentage points highlighting the strong operating leverage of this platform. Moving to expenses on Slide 17. We had operating expenses of $555 million, up 7%, driven by strong investments in technology and people to support revenue and drive innovation and growth, employee-related cost increases and other increases largely due to inflation. This resulted in an operating margin and EBITDA margin both up 2 percentage points at 55% and 58%, respectively. We are narrowing our non-GAAP expense guidance for the year to a range of $2.265 billion to $2.325 billion from $2.245 billion to $2.325 billion. FX was a very small benefit this quarter. But given current volatility in FX rates, we are once again treating it as a neutral versus 2024 rates in the narrowed guidance range. As Adena noted, we have actioned over $100 million of our efficiency programs at the end of the first quarter and we remain on track to action the $440 million by the end of the year as well as realize a 2 percentage point benefit to our full year 2025 expense growth.\nAs we look to Q2, we expect slightly higher expense growth than the first quarter due to the timing of our annual compensation cycle. We maintain our 2025 non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 22.5% to 24.5%. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 18. Nasdaq generated free cash flow of $674 million in the first quarter. This high level of cash flow enabled us to support deleveraging our dividend and share repurchases. We paid a dividend of $0.24 per share or $138 million in the quarter, representing a 32% annualized payout ratio. And this morning, we announced a 13% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.27 per share, which will be payable in June.\nIn our continued commitment towards deleveraging, we repurchased $279 million in notional value of debt for a net cash purchase price of $257 million, resulting in a gross leverage ratio of 3.4x at the end of the quarter, down from 3.6x at the end of 2024. As a result of our focused deleveraging, we recently received a one notch upgrade to our credit rating by Moody's to BAA1. Given the attractive buying opportunity in our stock, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for roughly $115 million in the first quarter, and we have since completed the employee-related repurchases in April.\nAs we continue to execute against our compelling organic growth strategy, we remain focused on reducing our leverage and now expect to reach a 3.3x gross leverage ratio in 2Q or 3Q, depending on FX. We intend to pay down the $400 million remaining on the June 2025 bonds at maturity primarily with punch on hand. Beyond that, we will remain opportunistic regarding any additional debt or share repurchases. Our capital priorities remain unchanged since the close of the Adenza transaction. We are focused on delivering what we committed to shareholders, which is investing for organic growth, delevering, expanding the dividend and repurchasing shares. We have an incredible organic growth path in front of us, and that is where we are focused.\nIn closing, Nasdaq delivered a standout first quarter marked by double-digit revenue growth across all 3 divisions and our highest year-over-year ARR increase since the first quarter of 2022. We demonstrated strong operating leverage and made meaningful progress on our capital strategy, including reinvesting in the business, reducing debt and buying back shares. As we move into Q2, I echo in our comments on the dynamic macro environment and a critical role NASDAQ played in sustaining market resilience. In times like this, financial institutions around the world rely on us for our mission-critical technology and actionable insights. Our central role in the global financial ecosystem and the trust our clients place in us reinforce our ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.\nWith that, let's open the line to Q&A."

Welcome to Nasdaq Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation accompanying this call can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nI would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve risks. A summary of these risks is contained in our press release and a more complete description in our annual report on Form 10-K. We will discuss our financial performance on a non-GAAP basis and adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, FX and the previously announced onetime revenue benefits in Market Services in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an index in the first quarter of 2024. Definitions and reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP plus statements can be found in our earnings presentation as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nThe fourth quarter marks the 1-year anniversary of the acquisition of AxiomSL and Calypso. Going forward, we will report the financial performance of these businesses within the consolidated results of the respective subdivisions and will no longer disclose these revenues in an organic revenue growth reconciliation.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning, I'll start with an overview of our 2024 financial and operational performance. I'll then discuss our strategic priorities and outlook for 2025, before handing the call to Sarah to walk through the financial results and outlook in more detail.\nReflecting on the last year, I am extremely proud of Nasdaq's progress towards becoming a scalable platform company and delivering on our vision to be the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. Throughout 2024, we substantially completed the integration of Calypso and AxiomSL, further showcased the value of our solutions, delivered on our growth objectives and achieved our initial expense synergies and delevering goals ahead of schedule.\nThe Nasdaq team's ability to execute our strategy and create value for our clients provides us with confidence in 2025, as evidenced by the strengthening of our competitive position and significant traction we are gaining with our new client wins, upsells and cross-sells.\nMoving to our financial results for the year. Nasdaq's net revenues of $4.7 billion increased 9% from 2023. Solutions delivered 10% revenue growth for the full year, with growth in each quarter within or above the range of our medium-term outlook. ARR ended the year at $2.8 billion, an increase of 7.5% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter, we delivered net revenue growth of 10% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and Solutions revenue grew 9%.\nMoving to the full year performance of our divisions. Capital Access Platforms generated 3% ARR growth and 10% revenue growth in 2024, driven by an outstanding year of index performance. Financial Technology delivered 10% revenue growth for the year. We delivered 12% ARR growth overall for the division, which included 23% growth in Financial Crime Management Technology, 11% growth for our Regulatory Technology and 9% growth for Capital Markets Technology.\nMarket Services achieved record full year revenue driven by higher volumes across the U.S. equity derivatives as well as U.S. and European cash equities.\nTurning to our operational highlights for 2024. The addition of AxiomSL and Calypso has greatly accelerated our journey as a platform company. In its first year, the Financial Technology division delivered strong financial and operational accomplishments, which resulted from deep and meaningful engagements with our clients. Today, our Financial Technology has emerged as a vital force of innovation as our more than 3,800 clients now see us as a complete partner in helping to solve their most critical challenges across risk, regulation and trade infrastructure.\nThe financial system is at a point where transformation is technologically and culturally possible with greater confidence in the banking and capital markets industry to implement cloud-based solutions. For example, according to Nasdaq and BCG's recent report, the level of comfort among global banks to deploy cloud-based solutions has increased from 57% just 5 years ago to 93% today.\nAdditionally, today, only 22% of banks prefer in-house built solutions for their regulatory appliance programs. The large majority understand that internal solutions provide superior capabilities to solve common industry problems, and they are seeking strategic technology partners who can provide solutions across multiple disciplines.\nThis sentiment is evident across the division as Nasdaq's enhanced product portfolio has strengthened our client relationships, materialized through the signing of 263 new clients, 424 upsells and 11 cross-sells this year. Importantly, these collective wins represent our continued penetration across global financial institutions and our cross-sells highlight our success in Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. Notable examples include a major financial institution expanding from trade surveillance, AxiomSL and Calypso to include Nasdaq Verafin.\nAnd another Tier 1 bank adding Calypso to its existing AxiomSL solution. As the division continues to mature, we're confident that we will deepen our strategic relations with our clients even further while delivering broad-based growth.\nNow I will turn to a review of our subdivisions within Financial Technology beginning with Nasdaq Verafin, where a growing number of financial institutions recognize our unique and differentiated capabilities in helping them root out financial crime. Nasdaq's Financial Crime Management Technology business completed one new cross-sell with a Tier 1 bank for our wire fraud solution during the quarter. And today, Nasdaq Verafin serves over 2,600 financial institutions representing nearly $10 trillion in assets, including 5 Tier 1 banks.\nBuilding on the strengths of Nasdaq Verafin's industry-leading offerings in North America, we've announced our launch in Europe where we are engaging with clients across the region.\nRegulatory Technology and Capital Markets Technology are exiting the modernization of global markets as well as our clients to manage risk and compliance. In 2024, we had several marquee deals which underscores our right to win across our serviceable addressable market.\nIn the fourth quarter, Nasdaq signed a long-term agreement to provide a future-proof regulatory management solution through AxiomSL to Arup, a collaborative joint venture of banks and financial services providers in Austria. We look forward to providing additional details on important partnerships in the coming weeks.\nAxiomSL also secured an upsell with Societe Generale to manage its domestic paltry reporting needs. France, India and the Philippines represent key Regulatory Technology international expansion opportunities that we've unlocked in 2024, and the strong progress that we've made positions us well to build on these -- build momentum in these countries in 2025.\nSurveillance signed 24 new clients during the year, including 3 new market regulators and our first Market Surveillance client in Taiwan. Fourth quarter, 100% of new trade Surveillance clients for cloud customers. And as of the fourth quarter, 68% of our clients are leveraging cloud for -- leveraging our cloud-based solution, up from 53% a year ago.\nCapital Markets Technology advanced its international strategy, expanding our key -- our client base in key markets, including Latin America, with notable wins in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Calypso signed its 20th central bank, a major milestone in an e-client cohort, with additional momentum expected across 2025. Market Technology signed 9 new commitment in 2024 with existing clients as they continue to modernize markets, and we expect this trend to continue this year. We also signed 3 new crypto clients in the fourth quarter.\nAs we look ahead, our digital asset strategy continues to focus on helping the industry mature through infrastructure that enhances market liquidity, transparency and integrity through the integration of the asset class within financial institutions. This is evident from the industry's adoption of our Market Technology Surveillance and Calypso solutions. More broadly, Nasdaq is already active in this asset class with the iShares Bitcoin Trust EPS and options for the CTF, as well as other listed crypto ETFs in our U.S. and European markets.\nWe see potential areas in Digital Assets Options product and Proprietary Index Options Benchmark to cryptocurrency indexes. We expect additional opportunities to arise as new regulatory frameworks provide clearer guidance, and Nasdaq will continue to strategically assess and pursue them in this dynamic space.\nTurning to our Capital Access Platforms division. We continued our strong success in attracting new listings to Nasdaq as the world's preeminent market operator supporting corporate and investor decision-making through valuable data and workflow tools, and driving even more liquidity into the market through our leading index franchise.\nIn 2024, Nasdaq extended our listings leadership to 6 consecutive years as the top U.S. exchange by number of IPOs and proceeds raised. For the year, Nasdaq had 180 IPOs, raising $23 billion in total proceeds. This included 130 operating company IPOs headlined by Lineage, the largest actor of the year. Overall, Nasdaq achieved an 80% win rate among eligible operating company IPOs in the U.S. for the year.\nIn the third quarter, we celebrated the 500th listing transfer to Nasdaq, cumulatively representing nearly $3 trillion of market value measured as of the date of each transfer. We continued our momentum in the fourth quarter with 14 new transfers, including Palantir, the largest exchange transfer on a U.S. exchange in 2024, bringing the total market value of switches to Nasdaq to over $180 billion for the year. And to start 2025, we welcome Domino's, which began on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on January 2.\n2024 was also an exceptional year for our Index franchise, which delivered 31% revenue growth, ending the year with record AUM. Innovation remains at the heart of this franchise as we launched 16 new products in the year with over half occurring outside the United States. Importantly, 27% -- 27, sorry, of these products were in the insurance annuity space and 30 were launched in partnership with new Index clients, delivering on our expansion pillars across innovation, globalization and the institutional space.\nWithin Workflow and Insights, Analytics saw continued demand from asset managers and asset owners for our data and workflow solutions. This demand across the client ecosystem resulted in strong year-over-year growth. In Corporate Solutions, we focused on strengthening our offerings while managing through beta challenges, as corporate buying cycles remained elongated out the year. We anticipate an improvement in this business as the IPO environment normalizes.\nFinally, in our Market Services division, we demonstrated leadership across our U.S. and European markets. We experienced strong adoption of our index options and [indiscernible] options products, as index options revenue more than doubled year-over-year. In addition, we delivered a record volume of shares and notional value traded in the Closing Cross this year, including a record quarter in terms of volume of shares traded.\nWe also made progress modernizing our markets with the migration of Nasdaq ISE to our next-generation derivatives platform, Fusion, in September. In addition, as part of our ongoing assessment of our business units portfolio and their alignment with our strategy, we announced that Nasdaq has entered into an agreement with Euronext to sell our Nordic Power Futures business. This transaction will sharpen our focus on our strategic growth areas as we lead the European market.\nMoving forward, our European business is an integral part of our strategy as the combination of our U.S. and European footprint is critical to our ability to serve clients globally. Overall, Nasdaq delivered robust growth across our business. while achieving significant strategic and operational milestones.\nAt our Investor Day in March, we introduced 3 strategic priorities: Integrate, Innovate and Excecute to deliver resilient and scalable growth. We successfully executed on these priorities and are well positioned entering 2025.\nThrough our relentless execution of our integrate priority, our Financial Technology division has a well structured and highly functioning operating model and we're deploying the One Nasdaq go-to-market approach to deliver holistically for our clients. In addition, our solid free cash flow enable Nasdaq to lower its gross leverage ratio from 4.3x at the end of last year to 3.6x at the end of 2024. Nasdaq exited 2024, having actioned over 100% of our net expense synergies target, and Sarah will discuss our incremental efforts to deliver additional cost synergies and efficiencies.\nMoving to our Innovate priority. We amplified innovation across Nasdaq, introducing and incorporating new AI-powered solutions and product offerings across each of our divisions in 2024. We've seen solid client adoption to date, and our product managers continue to work on delivering new AI features in their product road maps. Looking ahead, we have a strong innovation pipeline with various product is expected over the course of the year.\nWithin our internal business operations, our focus with AI adoption has shifted from exploration and experimentation in '23 and '24 to driving impact entering 2025. Our team is engaged in scaling our use of AI to deliver efficiencies and productivity enhancements across the organization, which is also reflected in the expanded efficiency program that Sarah will describe.\nAnd with our Accelerate priority, we drove 17 cross-sells since the [indiscernible] acquisition closed, including 11 in 2024 and 4 in the fourth quarter. Cross-sell opportunities now account for over 15% of Financial Technology Division's pipeline, with several deals at advanced stages as we execute organized sales campaigns that showcase the cross-functionality of our solution suite and deepen relationships with senior decision makers across our clientele. Nasdaq remains on track to exceed $100 million in run rate revenue from cross-sells by the end of 2027.\nLooking ahead to 2025, Nasdaq is well positioned to build on our successful '24 and deliver durable revenue growth. As we continue our journey to become a platform company, our transformation is built on 4 distinct strengths: a robust interconnected client network, purpose-built modern solutions that directly address our client-specific challenges, a scalable build once deployed a many approach across our technology and operational platforms, and standardized architectural principles and frameworks that unify our business and technology operations.\nThese factors, coupled with our deep industry expertise, have elevated our conversations with current and prospective clients. As our conversations continue to materialize into new client wins, upsells and cross-sells, we're entering 2025 with strong momentum across our business.\nIn addition, the solid economic backdrop bodes well for Nasdaq and our clients. In the U.S., consumer spending and relatively low unemployment continue to support GDP growth. Further, inflation and interest rates have settled into a more predictable state than we experienced between 2022 and 2024, giving investors more confidence in their ability to deploy capital.\nOverall, the global economy is expected to grow with help from strength in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including South Asia. These factors have contributed to creating a positive business environment to start the year. For example, after several years of muted IPO activity, we expect more companies to list on public markets with an uptake beginning in the second quarter of 2025, setting up a strong half of the year.\nWe continue to have a healthy pipeline of companies that have filed to go public on Nasdaq. As these companies become public, we look forward to helping them navigate the public markets from the initial listings process to cover governance, IR and sustainability reporting needs.\nFinally, financial institutions across the global economy face complex risks, changes in regulatory regimes and new trading opportunities which are driving strong demand for our Financial Technology division suite of solutions. Whether it's keeping up with rapid technological advancements, meeting the changing and divergent needs of regulators across the globe, or protecting the integrity of the financial institution systems against financial crime, clients will continue to turn to trusted partners to help them navigate complexity through technology first solutions, and we remain well positioned to be our partner for them throughout any environment.\nThe new administration entered the White House signaling a more business-friendly, pro-growth agenda in the U.S. We believe this will unlock capital and liquidity to the benefit of companies, financial institutions and markets. As it relates to the regulatory environment governing our clients, we're supportive of the traction that is gaining around smart well-calibrated regulation.\nTo wrap up, 2024 was a strong year in which we further advanced the evolution of Nasdaq as a leading partner to the global financial system. Across the organization, we executed our strategic priorities, delivered on our key growth objectives and achieved our synergy and deleveraging goals ahead of target. As we enter 2025, we're delivering on our strategy and remain confident in our ability to achieve our medium-term outlook.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to provide more details on our financial results and outlook for 2025.\n\nSarah M. Youngwood\n\nMD and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. Starting with annual results on Slide 11 of the earnings presentation.\nNet revenue of $4.7 million was up 9%, with Solutions revenue of $3.6 billion, up 10% and representing 77% of total revenue, an increase of 1 percentage point. Full year divisional growth rates were consistent with our expectations. Operating expense was $2.162 billion, up 6%, in line with guidance for a 54% operating margin and 56% EBITDA margin, both of which were up by over 1 percentage point. This resulted in net income of $1.6 billion and diluted EPS of $2.82.\nMoving to quarterly results on Slide 12. We reported net revenue of $1.2 billion, up 10%, with Solutions revenue of $949 million, up 9%. Operating expense was $556 million, up 6%, resulting in an operating margin of 55%, up 2 percentage points; and an EBITDA margin of 57%, up by over 1 percentage point. This resulted in net income of $438 million and diluted EPS of $0.76.\nSlide 13 shows the drivers of our 9% net revenue growth for the year and our 10% net revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 7 percentage points of alpha for the year and 6 percentage points for the quarter, driven by new and existing clients as well as product innovation, partially offset by lower market share in market services. Overall, beta factors contributed 2 percentage points of growth this year and 4 percentage points for the quarter, driven by higher valuations in Nasdaq indices and higher overall volumes in market services.\nPlease note that our alpha analysis is contributed as it includes on and off exchange trading. If we had done the analysis with market share of on-exchange volumes only, alpha would have been 7% on for the quarter and for the year. Lastly, and as shown on Slide 14, we had ARR growth of 7.5%, with SaaS revenue growth of 14%. SaaS as a percentage of ARR also increased 2 percentage points to 37% compared to year-end 2023.\nLet's review division results, starting on Slide 15. In Capital Access Platforms, we delivered full year revenue growth of 10% with quarterly revenue of $511 million, up 11%, and with ARR growth of 3%. Data and Listing revenue growth for the year was 1%, with quarterly revenue up 2% and ARR up 1%. Quarterly revenue was driven by higher data sales and usage, new listings and pricing. This was partially offset by delistings and lower amortization of prior poor initial listing fee.\nAs you recall, we expected a year-on-year revenue headwind of $3 million related to the amortization of [indiscernible] initial listing fees. This started in the third quarter of 2024 and was expected to last for 4 quarters, 2 are done and we are in line with expectations. We are on track for the next 2 quarters at $3 million. After that, we expect the impact to fall to roughly $2 million in the third quarter and $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nSeparately, we saw an improvement in delistings in 2024 versus 2023 and expect the related year-over-year revenue headwind to moderate from $10 million per quarter in 2024 to $8 million in each quarter of 2025.\nIndex revenue was up 31% for the full year and up 29% in the quarter, with more than half of the quarterly revenue growth driven by alpha factors, primarily from strong net inflows contributing to higher asset-based revenue. ETP AUM recorded $80 billion of net inflows in the last 12 months, including $28 billion in the fourth quarter. Net inflows together with market performance. resulted in record average ETP AUM of $632 billion, up almost $200 billion year-over-year.\nIn Workflow and Insights, revenue was up 4% for the year and the quarter, with ARR growth of 4% as well. The increase in the fourth quarter revenue was driven by Analytics, mainly investments, with continued growth in demand from asset managers, asset owners and consultants. New commitment sales were up 11% for the year, with full year gross retention up 2 percentage points. The broader Corporate Solutions environment remains unchanged with revenue up 1% in the quarter.\nFull year operating margin was 58% with quarterly operating margin of 57%, both of which were up 3 percentage points. Excluding a onetime benefit of Index of $16 million from a legal settlement, full year operating margin would have been 57%, up 2 percentage points. As a reminder, as we enter 2025, our contracted rate associated with trading of future contracts will be set as it does every year. It will increase once we close a specific volume threshold, which will likely occur sometime in the first half of the year.\nNow looking ahead to 2025 performance more broadly across the Capital Access Platform division. Our current expectation is portfolio revenue growth to be within its medium-term growth outlook range of 5% to 8%. Within the division, Data and Listings activity is improving, but Listing revenue is negatively impacted by delisting and amortization factors. As such, we continue to expect Data and Listings to grow within our medium-term outlook of low single digits in 2025.\nIndex continues to generate strong alpha given its very favorable positioning and additional growth opportunities. We expect to grow above our medium-term outlook of mid- to high single digits in 2025. Recall that Index revenue in the first quarter of 2024 included a $16 million onetime revenue benefit related to a legal settlement. We exclude this item from our adjusted growth rate and we'll discuss our growth and any comparison to the medium-term outlook on that adjusted basis, excluding that item.\nFinally, as a result of continued beta headwinds in Corporate Solutions, which will take time to ease even with stronger issuance environment, we expect Workflow and Insight scores to be below its medium-term outlook of high single to low double digits in 2025.\nMoving to Financial Technology on Slide 16. Total division revenue for the year grew 10% and revenue for the quarter was up 7% to [ $438 million ] with ARR growth of 12%. The difference between quarterly revenue growth and ARR growth in FinTech is driven by professional services fees and the impact of lower Calypso on-prem subscription revenue due to timing and a tough comp in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nMeanwhile, ARR growth remained solid across the division, with strong client momentum, including the benefit of 120 new clients, 127 upsells and full cross sales in the quarter. On cross-sells, our campaigns are resonating with clients as we achieved 11 cross-sells in 2024. Cross-sell opportunities now account for over 15% of the Financial Technology division's pipeline, including several deals in advanced stages.\nAs we close this deal, we will no longer account them in our pipeline, which can create order over core liability in this metric. However, over the coming years, we expect our postal pipeline mix generally to average at or above 10%, which is a level that positions us to exceed our $100 million run rate cross-sell revenue target by the end of 2027.\nFinancial Crime Management Technology revenue increased 22% for both the year and the quarter, with ARR growth of 23% and with 102 new clients and 1 cross-sell with a Tier 1 client in the quarter. Net revenue retention was 114%, reflecting strong client engagement stemming from new product enhancements, such as the GenAI Entity Research Copilot and targeted typology analytics.\nRegulatory Technology revenue increased 7% for the year and 6% for the quarter, with ARR growth of 11% as well as 9 new client wins and 64 upsells. AxiomSL revenue grew 7% for the year and 5% for the quarter with 2 new client wins and 28 upsells. And Surveillance grew revenue 6% for the year and 7% for the quarter, aided by 7 new clients and 36 upsells. The delta between ARR and revenue was due to softer Professional Services revenues, which should improve in 2025 based on signed deals in 2024.\nCapital Markets Technology delivered 8% revenue growth for the year and 4% for the quarter. ARR grew 9% with 9 new clients, 63 upsells and 3 cross-sells in the quarter, with the cross-sell activity driven by continued client demand for market modernization. Calypso Folio revenue was up 17% and up 1% in the quarter, with 4 client wins and 39% upsells, with the difference between the 2 revenue growth rates driven by deal timing.\nTogether, Trade Management Services and Market Technology had 5 new clients, 24 upsells and 3 cross-sells in the quarter. Combined revenue was up 3% for the year and 7% for the quarter. The quarterly revenue growth was primarily driven by strong growth in Trade Management Services, mainly due to meeting additional capacity demand via our recent data center expansion.\nLooking forward, we expect improved professional services revenue in 2025 due to new finance for Calypso and Market Technology implementation signed in 2024, and we are starting the year with a strong proportion of signed engagement.\nCombined AxiomSL and Calypso revenue is 13% for the year and 2% for the quarter, with ARR growth of 12%. We continue to drive the cloud journey of this businesses forward with cloud bookings as a percentage of new [indiscernible] coming in at 62% for the year and 60% for the quarter. As Ato noted in the opening remarks, we will be reporting AxiomSL and Calypso within the consolidated results of their respective subdivision going forward, and we expect combined AxiomSL and Calypso to perform within the medium-term outlook for 2025.\nFull year Financial Technology operating margin was 47%, up 1 percentage point and with quarterly operating margin flat at 49%. Looking ahead at our growth expectations for Financial Technology for 2025. We expect the division to grow within its medium-term outlook of 10% to 14%, with Financial Crime Management Technology at the low end of its range of mid-20s, Regulatory Technology at the high end of its range of high single to low double digits and with Capital Markets Technology within its range of high single to low double digits.\nWrapping up the divisions with Market Services on Slide 17. We had net revenue growth of 4% for the year and 12% for the quarter at $268 million. The strong quarterly net revenue growth benefited from an increase in U.S. derivatives revenue primarily due to record volumes and strong index options revenue growth, higher U.S. cash equities revenue from higher volume capture and market share of available on exchange trading volume, as well as higher capture in European cash equities and derivatives.\nWith these factors partially offset by a market-wide shift of U.S. cash equity volumes of exchange and a decline in new state line revenue.\nFolio Market Services operating margin was down 1 percentage point to 59%, with quarterly operating margin of 59%, up 1 percentage point. Excluding the onetime payment of roughly $7.5 million that benefited Market Services in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is excluded from the adjusted numbers, full year operating margin would have been flat and quarterly operating margin would have been up 2 percentage points.\nMoving to expenses on Slide 18. We had operating expenses of $2.162 billion for the year, up 6%, driven by strong investments in technology and people to support revenue and drive innovation and growth, employee-related cost increases, other increases largely due to inflation, as well as close to 1 percentage point of regulatory and people-related costs, which we don't expect to reoccur. This was partially offset by the benefit of Adenza-related synergies of 2 percentage points and additional efficiencies of 1 percentage point, half of which I will come back to in just a moment.\nThis resulted in an annual operating margin and EBITDA margin both up more than 1 percentage point versus the prior year. Regarding net expense synergies, we have actioned over 100% of the $80 million target we announced in relation to the acquisition of Adenza. We are now expanding this program to $140 million, including the $80 million already actioned. This run rate cost reductions will be actioned by the end of 2025. This is an increase of 75% in the same 2-year time frame as we now include the entire firm and will capture all the run rate efficiencies, including the impact of it.\nAs part of the expanded program, we expect related cost to achieve to be $140 million, with $72 million incurred to date through the end of the fourth quarter. The program has already reduced 2024 expense growth by 2.5 percentage points, 2 percentage points for Adenza and 50 basis points related to the program expansion. It is expected to reduce 2025 expense growth by 2 percentage points with a sale mostly in 2026. As always, you should expect that we will continue to reinvest a portion of these efficiencies into investments to support our growth.\nWith this in mind, we are introducing our non-GAAP expense guidance for the year of $2.245 billion to $2.325 billion. This guidance range reflects a non-GAAP organic growth rate of 6% at the midpoint. And as mentioned, it includes a roughly 2 percentage point benefit from the expanded efficiency program. Our 2025 guidance uses average 2024 FX rates as its foundation and do not reflect the benefit from the recent post-election selection strengthening of the dollar that has partly retrenched over the last few days.\nWe expect the 2025 non-GAAP tax rate between 22.5% and 24.5% in line with the prior expectation we have set.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 19. Nasdaq generated free cash flow across businesses $1.6 billion in the year, including $439 million in the fourth quarter. We repaid $815 million in debt in 2024, including about $18 million in the fourth quarter, which we repurchased. With that, we ended the year with a gross net of [indiscernible].\nIn 2024, we paid dividends of $0.94 per share or $541 million, including $0.24or $138 million in 4Q, representing a 34% annualized payout ratio. We repurchased 2.3 million shares of our common stock of the $125 million in the year, with no repurchases in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on reducing our leverage and expect to reach a 3.3 gross leverage ratio the end of [indiscernible] while purchasing shares to offset the compensation. We will remain opportunistic regarding any additional share or debt repurchase [indiscernible].\nIn 2024, we set an ambitious objective and will represent [indiscernible] action against them. I am proud of our position. We delivered on our growth ambition. We closed on a number of landmark client [indiscernible]. We made progress with our cross-sells. We identified incremental cost efficiencies and we executed against an accelerated deleveraging time line. All of this reinforces my confidence in our work force and our ability to deliver value to our clients and shareholders in 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions."

Welcome to Nasdaq's Second Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation accompanying this call can be found on our Investor Relations website.\nI would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve risks. A summary of these risks is contained in our press release and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K.\nAlso, please note that we will discuss our financial results on a pro forma basis and with year-on-year growth rates, which means that we are showing results versus the prior year period as if we owned Calypso and AxiomSL for all of 2023 and excluding the impact of FX. References to organic growth exclude the impact of FX, acquisitions and divestitures. We Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning, I'll provide some perspective on the external environment, discuss our strong quarterly performance highlights as well as our progress against our strategic priorities, and then I'll hand the call to Sarah to walk through the financial results in more detail.\nTurning to the economy in the U.S., we continue -- we're continuing to see solid but slowing GDP growth, along with cooling inflation and slightly rising unemployment. These data points support the potential for easing monetary policy in the coming months as the Fed continues to strive for an economic soft landing.\nThe general stability in the U.S. economy and the potential for a lower cost of capital going forward is resulting in modest improvements in the IPO landscape as we progress through 2024, including solid activity this week. However, investors continue to contend with external uncertainties and the timing of monetary policy shifts as well as our dynamic macro political environment. As a result, we continue to expect modestly improving IPO activity for the remainder of 2024, and our current U.S. IPO pipeline indicates that stronger momentum is likely to manifest starting in the first half of 2025.\nWe're also seeing stronger economic underpinnings in Europe, aided by the ECB's easing monetary policy, including improving economic prospects in the Nordics. The improvement is not yet translating into a material increase in new public issuances, but our European IPO pipeline is healthy and growing, particularly for 2025.\nAs investors and industry participants navigate the dynamic market environment, we continue to see sustained robust trading activity in the markets as well as strong demand for mission-critical technology solutions from financial institutions globally. As a result, our markets continue to experience strong volumes, and client demand for our fintech solutions remains consistent with trends we have seen through the cycle, which provides a healthy backdrop for continued revenue growth across our solutions suite.\nNow let me turn to our financial results, which demonstrate the power and resilience of our diversified business model and our ability to succeed through economic cycles. We delivered a strong quarter with $1.2 billion in net revenues, an increase of 10% year-over-year, with Solutions revenues at 13% growth. Our overall annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 7% to $2.7 billion.\nI'm particularly pleased with the strength of the performance across our business, which is a testament to the power of our platform. We're integrating the Addenda acquisition ahead of schedule and are realizing the investment thesis that underpin the transaction as we demonstrated value for clients, shareholders and employees.\nOur expenses for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, within our guidance. Our operating income grew approximately 14%. And importantly, our operating margin increased to 53%, representing over 1 percentage point of operating leverage while we continue to invest to support growth in our business and deliver on synergies.\nTurning now to a discussion of the business highlights, starting with capital access platforms. While ARR growth in the division remained at 1%, our index revenue grew 29%, resulting in overall revenue growth for capital access platforms of 10%.\nIn Listings, we welcomed 31 operating company IPOs maintaining our strong win rate of 72% based on Nasdaq eligible listings. While the slower IPO environment remains a headwind, we're encouraged by signs of improvement, as supported by our most recent IPO Pulse Index, which is near a 3-year high.\nOverall growth in data and listings continue to experience challenges as modest growth in market data and the slowly improving IPO environment were offset by the impact of prior year delistings. Growth in our Analytics business benefited from continued demand across the investment community for actionable intelligence and increased efficiency. However, that growth was partially offset by continued headwinds in Corporate Solutions, resulting in more muted growth for workflow and insights.\nOur Index business delivered another exceptional quarter with $17 billion of net inflows during the quarter, totaling $53 billion over the last 12 months. We also achieved another record in Index ETP AUM exiting the quarter at $569 billion.\nTurning next to Financial Technology. ARR growth across the division was 13%, including 25% in Financial Crime Management Technology, 14% in the combined AxiomSL and Calypso solutions and 9% in the combined Market Technology and Trade Management Services. The division had 69 new client signings, 96 upsells and 4 cross-sells. We also saw continued cloud adoption as 68% of AxiomSL eclipse combined bookings in the quarter were cloud-based with a strong pipeline for future quarters.\nTurning to the specific subdivisions. Financial Crime Management Technology continued its strong momentum. We signed over 50 new clients in the SMB space, and we continue to make progress in the Upmarket segment focused on Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks.\nIn July, we signed a new international Tier 1 bank, which is also an exciting cross-sell. Going forward, we continue to maintain a strong sales pipeline within the core SMB segment, and we have a growing pipeline of new clients and upsells among Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks.\nAcross Regulatory Technology, we see sustained demand across both existing and new clients as financial institutions face increasingly dynamic regulatory environment, including changes in regulation globally related to asset thresholds. Among the many regulatory trends that are driving sales demand, we're pleased with our progress in signing clients around the world as they focus on implementing Basel IV and preparing to implement Basel III end game.\nIn Capital Markets Technology, we continue to see strong demand for mission-critical technology as many of our clients focused on modernizing their infrastructure to enhance resilience and performance. For Calypso, we see robust new demand, especially in the Treasury segment in addition to cloud transformation of large-scale clients.\nIn our Market Services division, we delivered revenue growth of 3%. We experienced healthy volumes across North America and Europe, and we achieved a sequential increase in North American options market share as well as growth in Nasdaq U.S. equities on-exchange market share and capture.\nOur U.S. index options achieved record revenues, more than doubling versus last year, due to higher capture and volumes. In our U.S. Cash Equities business, we executed successful Russell, MSCI and S&P rebalances during the quarter, which showcased the strength and resiliency of our markets.\nDuring the Russell event, for instance, nearly 2.9 billion shares, representing a record notional value of over $95 billion, were executed in the Closing Cross, representing the largest liquidity event on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange or the Russell Reconstitution.\nIn our European markets, the strength of our market ecosystem, as evidenced by the depth of book, breadth of participants and product innovation continues to drive market share gains. Overall, we're pleased to report a solid quarter of market services and remain focused on retaining our leading position across all of our markets.\nI now want to spend a few minutes updating you on how we're executing against our 2024 strategic priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. Starting with integrate, we have actioned over 70% of the $80 million of net expense synergies, and our leverage ratio reached 3.9x at quarter end, both ahead of plan. Both AxiomSL and Calypso are fully integrated into the Financial Technology division and we've established strong leadership, a well-structured operating model and a One Nasdaq go-to-market approach to ensure we're delivering for our clients with the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness.\nOur CRM integration for the Calypso and Axiom solutions is now completed ahead of schedule, and this supports divisional sales coordination as well as the sales incentive program established at the beginning of the year. Importantly, across AxiomSL, Calypso and Verafin, we've been highly focused on cultural integration into the broader Nasdaq enterprise. And internal surveys continue to show that our employees are highly engaged and energized to deliver for our clients.\nWe're also making strong progress advancing our Innovate priority. We currently have approximately 50% of our employee base working with AI tools focused on enhancing productivity as well as driving our product road map. By the end of Q3, 100% of our developers will have access to AI copilot tools, and we recently had over 650 employees participate in several AI hackathons across Nasdaq.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to introduce new AI capabilities within our client-facing solutions. Consistent with other Gen AI capabilities recently launched in our Verafin and Boardvantage solutions, with an investment, we have deployed a new AI-powered feature for the Market Lens module called Pension Meeting Minute Summarization.\nThe feature provides asset managers with key insights on current and future pension fund strategies to help inform their business development and engagement priorities with top pension decision makers. We also have a strong pipeline of AI features scheduled to launch in the coming quarters, including in Market Surveillance and IR Insight. And we're seeing strong early traction in client adoption and effectiveness related to the capabilities that are already in market.\nSpecifically, Dynamic M-ELO, the first SEC-approved AI order type, which we launched in April, is driving a 20% increase in both volumes for this order type and improvement in fill rates compared to the prior static version.\nVerafin's integrated Gen AI feature, Entity Research Copilot, is now deployed at more than 250 clients, and we expect to complete our rollout in the third quarter. Client feedback has been positive, demonstrating that the integrated copilot functionality -- with the integrated copilot functionality, Verafin solutions can reduce alert research time by up to 90% compared to banks that do not use Verafin.\nBeyond AI, we continue to drive innovation towards key growth priorities. For example, in our Index business, innovation is at the heart of our growth strategy as we extend the franchise to new markets globally, drive institutional adoption and introduce new products beyond the NASDAQ 100.\nDuring the quarter, 50% of product -- index product launches were outside of the United States. And we're quickly gaining traction in investor adoption. In total, we launched 18 new products with our partners, including 12 ETPs and 3 insurance annuity vehicles geared towards our institutional clients. Additionally, we're pleased that our AI-themed ETP saw the more than $1 billion of inflows over the last 12 months.\nWrapping up with our Accelerate priority. The addition of AxiomSL and Calypso has significantly elevated the dialogue we have with our clients as a strategic partner. There's no better evidence of that than the early traction we're seeing in our cross-sell efforts. Since closing the transaction, we have executed on 11 fintech cross-sells. We had 4 this quarter, including 2 cross-sells of our AxiomSL solution to Calypso clients.\nThis is a great start, but it's only the beginning on our journey to exceed $100 million in cross-sells by the end of 2027, just 8 months since the acquisition closed, 10% of the opportunities in our pipeline are cross-sells, and we expect this to grow sequentially. The division has several strategic cross-sell campaigns underway, which are generating strong top-of-funnel interest and underpins our continued confidence in our ability to grow cross-sell bookings over the coming years.\nTo wrap up, we're pleased to deliver a quarter of strong results, driven by continued momentum in solutions and the power of our diversified platform to drive scalable, profitable and durable growth. Importantly, we're delivering on the Adenza acquisition thesis as our clients increasingly see Nasdaq as a strategic partner that can help solve their largest, most complex challenges. We look forward to leveraging this momentum to unlock our next phase of growth.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details.\n\nSarah M. Youngwood\n\nMD and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we made excellent progress in both the integration of Adenza and the accelerated paydown of debt. We actioned over 70% of net expense synergies 6 months ahead of schedule. We have also come in ahead of our accelerated deleveraging plans ending the quarter of 3.9 leverage.\nTurning to our second quarter results on Slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.2 billion, up 10%, with solutions revenue up 13%. And Operating expense was $539 million, up 7% within our guidance with an operating margin of 53% and an EBITDA margin of 56%. Overall, this resulted in net income of $397 million and diluted EPS of $0.69.\nSlide 11 shows the drivers of our 10% pro forma revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 8% outside growth on a net basis, driven by new and existing clients as well as our focus on product innovation. Overall, beta factors were 2% this quarter, driven by higher valuations in Nasdaq indexes as well as higher overall volumes in market services.\nOn Slide 12, we had 7% ARR growth. And as part of that, we had 17% SaaS revenue growth, resulting in SaaS as a percent of ARR now at 37%, up 4 percentage points.\nLet's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. In capital assets platforms, we delivered revenue of $481 million, reflecting growth of 10%. We had another exceptional quarter for our Index business with revenue up 29%, driven by $53 billion of organic inflows in the last 12 months, including $17 billion this quarter, and market performance, both resulting in average ETP AUM of $531 billion. In addition, future volumes were up 25%.\nData and Listings revenue was up 1%, while ARR was down 1%. The difference was driven by small onetime revenue benefits primarily related to listings. Revenue from higher data sales and usage, new listings and pricing offset the impact of delisting, downgrades and lower amortization of prior project initial listing fees. We expect the quarterly headwind from lower amortization of prior period listing fees to increase from an immaterial impact in 1Q '24 and approximately $1 million in 2Q '24 to about $3 million in each of the next 4 quarters.\nHowever, we have seen roughly 25% fewer delistings in the first half of the year versus the prior year period, suggesting that delistings should be less of a revenue headwind in 2025.\nLastly, Workflow & Insights revenue was up 4%, in line with ARR growth of 4%. This was driven by continued growth in innovative analytics products, mainly Datalink and e-vestment. This was partially offset by continued headwinds in Corporate Solutions.\nAnalytics had a strong quarter with both revenue and ARR in high single digits. Operating margin was 56%, up 1 percentage point. Looking forward, we expect full year revenue growth for capital access platforms to exceed our medium-term [indiscernible] with index expected to come in above its range. Workflow and insights expected to come in below its range, and with data and listings essentially flat year-on-year.\nMoving to Financial Technology on Slide 14. We had another quarter of strong growth with division revenue of $420 million, a 16% increase and with ARR growth of 13%. This performance reflects double-digit revenue and ARR growth across our 3 subdivisions.\nFinancial Client Management Technology delivered 24% revenue growth and 25% ARR growth with 53 new clients in the quarter. Capital Markets Technology had revenue growth of 14% and ARR growth of 11%, on the back of 7 new clients and 38 upsells in the quarter. The difference between revenue and ARR growth is driven by the timing of on-prem renewals and professional services fees. Together, Trade Management Services and Market Tech grew revenues 2%.\nWe experienced strong subscription revenue and ARR growth, up 9% for both businesses and up 3 percentage points sequentially. The lower growth in revenue was due to a year-over-year decline in professional services revenues. As we mentioned last quarter, in Market Tech, we had a very large implementation in 2023, which created a $27 million revenue benefit in the full year of 2023. And this year has resulted in subscription revenue or ARR of $11 million. We expect this year-over-year headwind to persist in Q3 and abate in Q4.\nCalypso had revenue growth of 34% and ARR growth of 13%. Revenue was higher than the expectation we provided in the first quarter call due to broad strength in sales activity, including a strategic early renewal, 29 upsells and 5 new clients. As we look forward, we continue to see solid momentum in the business and expect capital markets technology revenue growth for 2024 to remain in line with our medium-term outlook.\nOverall, for the second half of 2024, we expect more normalized growth across the products within the division versus the first half of the year with consistent growth across quarters.\nRegulatory Technology had revenue growth of 16% and ARR growth of 10%, with 7 new clients and 58 upsells in the quarter. The difference between revenue and ARR growth is driven by AxiomSL, which had 23% revenue growth and 14% ARR growth. The 23% revenue growth was primarily due to strong subscription revenue, including a large on-prem renewal, 29 upsells and 1 new client in the quarter, partially offset by a decline in professional services fees due to the timing of client deliveries.\nThe fintech operating margin was 47% in the second quarter, up 3 percentage points, including the benefit of synergy realization. As we finalize the business combination accounting for Adenza during the measurement period, let me update you on a change we are evaluating on AxiomSL. As part of this potential accounting change, we would recognize on-prem subscription-based revenue on a ratable basis over the contract term, whereas we currently recognize approximately 50% upfront. This is due to the frequency of critical mandatory regulatory updates that we implement and embed in the AxiomSL software throughout the contract term.\nWe believe this change would enhance our financial reporting and would not change the Adenza medium-term outlook we had provided nor our ability to achieve it this year. If an adjustment is made, it would not have a material impact on Nasdaq overall, and 2Q would remain a strong quarter with fintech revenue growth near the top of its medium-term outlook range, Solutions revenue growth at the high end of its medium-term outlook range and AxiomSL and Calypso combined revenue growth above 20%.\nImportantly, combined ARR growth of 14% and net revenue retention of 111% would be unchanged. Specifically at the AxiomSL level, we expect subscription revenue growth to be more consistent going forward and remain in line with our medium-term outlook. AxiomSL 2Q '24 subscription revenue growth would have been generally in line with ARR. However, the timing-related decline in professional services fees I mentioned earlier would have driven total AxiomSL revenue growth for the quarter to the low to mid-single digits.\nWe expect to receive additional information to finalize our analysis in 3Q. And if we make the change, we will provide updated historical information by quarter for 2023 and the first half of 2024, during 3Q and ahead of reporting our 3Q earnings.\nNow wrapping up the divisions with Market Services. Net revenue was $250 million for the quarter, up 3%. Growth was driven by higher volumes in cash equities in both North America and Europe as well as in new options, increased capture in North America equities, U.S. index options high growth, share gains in European equities from a very strong base and 1 additional trading day. This was partially offset by lower share in U.S. options and equities, though share for options was stronger sequentially and increased over the course of the quarter. We also had lower U.S. state revenue.\nMarket Services second quarter operating margin was 58%, a 1 percentage point decline from the prior year, primarily due to continued investments in market monetization and regulatory obligations.\nMoving on to non-GAAP operating expense on Slide 16. This quarter was $539 million, reflecting pro forma growth of 7% or $15 million sequentially. This is within the guidance we provided on our first quarter earnings call. And as a reminder, second quarter included the impact of annual merit adjustments and equity grants.\nAll in, we generated positive operating leverage with an increase in both operating and EBITDA margin of over 1 percentage point. This included the benefit of synergies this quarter and the funding of additional revenue-related expense. We originally targeted $80 million of net expense synergies through the end of 2025. As of Q2, we have already actioned over 70% of that amount, 6 months ahead of schedule. The P&L benefit of the actions already taken represent approximately 1 percentage point reduction in expense growth in the first half of this year.\nPlease note that the actions of 2Q and 3Q have a longer time line to expense recognition. And as such, we expect the full impact of synergies to moderate expense growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points for 2024.\nFor the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating expense of $2.145 billion to $2.185 billion, reflecting an increase to the bottom end of the range to account for strong revenue generation, which increases variable compensation and enables us to invest in growth initiatives while also accounting for the synergy benefits realized in the year. Additionally, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to our capital allocation on Slide 17. Nasdaq continued its track record of strong free cash flow generation with $328 million in the second quarter, representing a conversion ratio of approximately 100% over the trailing 12 months. This takes into consideration specific onetime costs associated with the Adenza acquisition and integration.\nThis quarter, we continued to prioritize debt reduction and are ahead of our accelerated deleveraging plan. We paid down net $174 million of commercial paper and ended the quarter at 3.9x gross leverage versus 4.1x last quarter. This was achieved while also increasing our quarterly dividend 9% to $0.24 per share or $138 million, reflecting a 37% annualized payout ratio, and repurchasing approximately $60 million of our shares to opportunistically take advantage of the attractiveness of our stock and start to offset 2024 employee dilution.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on deleveraging and expect to pay down the remaining commercial paper balance near term while remaining opportunistic and flexible. We also remain committed to offsetting employee dilution.\nIn closing, we are thrilled with the pace at which we are delivering on the results of our integration. We are executing on our plans with focus and discipline, building a financial technology powerhouse, driving durable growth and profitability for our shareholders.\nThank you for your time, and I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to Nasdaq's First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2024 financial results.\nOn the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal, Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A.\nThe press release and earnings presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Further, any references to organic growth will exclude the impact of changes in FX rates; and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which this quarter is substantially all related to AxiomSL and Calypso. The financial results of these businesses are included in Solutions revenue, within the financial technology division. Also please note that we will discuss certain financial results on a pro forma basis, which means we are showing the results as if we've included Calypso and AxiomSL results in the first quarter 2023 and excluded the impact of changes in FX rates. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financials section of our investor relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\nToday, my remarks will cover the following areas: our outlook on the external environment as well as highlights from our first quarter financial and operational performance, including innovation milestones and key progress updates on our cross-sell efforts and synergies. I will then turn the call over to Sarah for a review of our financial results. I'll start with our outlook on current economic environment.\nRecent data, including sustained consumer spending and labor force strength, suggests that the U.S. economy remains resilient despite heightened geopolitical risks and a higher cost of capital. The U.S. markets are generally performing well, reflecting that economic resilience as well as the potential future productivity benefits that derive from the adoption of generative AI and other sector-specific performance trends. This strength in the U.S. economy has U.S. growth projected to outpace other advanced economies. As such, economists continue to expect a soft lending in the U.S. Although other advanced economies are seeing slower growth, recent data shows improvement in manufacturing and services, particularly in Europe. Global inflation has trended sharply lower over the last year, although it is starting to show some signs of persistence as it moderates globally. Markets are still expecting rates to begin to decline later this year in most major markets, which will be a positive -- corporates and for the real estate sector, including new homebuyers.\nWith the strength of -- in the markets, we've begun to experience an uptick in IPO activity. In the first quarter, the U.S. markets welcomed 39 operating company IPOs, the most in 2 years, highlighted by 9 IPOs with market caps in excess of $1 billion. Additionally, as we referenced in our most recent Nasdaq IPO Pulse Index, we're seeing 5 out of 6 leading indicators of future IPO activity continue to improve, suggesting an improvement in the U.S. public equity capital raising environment over the coming months. As we look towards the remainder of the year at Nasdaq, we see a healthy pipeline of exciting companies preparing to enter the public markets, but their time lines will be dependent upon continued strong economic and market performance.\nTaking a closer look at Nasdaq's business environment, we continue to capitalize on attractive opportunities for sustainable growth through our diversified business platform that is well positioned to succeed through economic cycles, as evidenced by our solid first quarter performance with double-digit growth in our Solutions revenues. We've aligned our business against key industry-shaping megatrends, the modernization of markets, the transformation of the investment landscape, the drive towards sustainability and increasing financial services investment in resilience and risk management, where we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on strong, sustained client demand, which we'll cover throughout our call today.\nBefore we move on to our financial results, I want to mention Borse Dubai's recently completed secondary offering of Nasdaq common stock. Specifically, Borse Dubai sold a position of their stake representing approximately 5% of Nasdaq's total shares outstanding. The secondary transaction [indiscernible] on March 19 and closed on March 22, with strong investor demand resulting in an oversubscribed transaction. Following the transaction, Borse Dubai continues to hold just over 10% of Nasdaq's total shares outstanding. Additionally, Essa Kazim, the Chairman of Borse Dubai, will continue as a valued member of Nasdaq's Board of Directors.\nOur relationship with Borse Dubai is multifaceted, spanning many years, and Nasdaq continues to be a trusted technology provider and brand partner to Borse Dubai. We look forward to their continued support as a shareholder of Nasdaq, as their insights and contributions have and will continue to shape our path ahead.\nTurning now to our financial results, I'm pleased to share Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the first quarter of 2024 with strong double-digit growth in Solutions revenues.\nIn the first quarter, we achieved $1.1 billion in net revenues, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year quarter on a pro forma basis. We delivered 13% pro forma revenue growth across our Solutions businesses during the quarter. In addition to strong performance across our financial technology division, our index business had a stellar performance in the quarter. Our annualized recurring revenue or ARR increased 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis to $2.6 billion.\nAcross the company, we supported revenue growth and continued investments while delivering a 53% operating margin for the quarter. This represents a 1 percentage point of operating leverage against the prior year quarter both on a pro forma basis and when excluding Adenza. Our solid performance in the first quarter of 2024 illustrates our continued ability to execute against our strategic vision, delivering value and growth to our clients and shareholders amid a dynamic operating environment.\nNow let's review the highlights of our operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms.\nIn the Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered 15% growth highlighted by outstanding performance in our index business. With the strong close to 2023 and subsequent market rally at the beginning of 2024, our index business had an exceptional momentum in the first quarter. The Nasdaq-100 reached record highs multiple times during the quarter. And we are pleased to announce that our index business overall crossed the $500 billion threshold in ETP AUM for the first time during the quarter, finishing the period at $519 billion.\nOver the last 12 months, we saw $46 billion of net inflows, including $21 billion just this quarter alone. We also worked with clients to launch 29 new products tracking Nasdaq indices, demonstrating our steadfast focus on innovation and global distribution. This momentum contributed to our index business delivering 53% growth, which represents 38% year-over-year core revenue growth in the quarter as well as a onetime item that Sarah will describe. This quarter also marked the 25th anniversary of the Invesco QQQ ETF, representing more than 2 decades of providing investors with access to some of the world's most innovative companies within our Nasdaq-100 index. In addition to this milestone, we were honored to be named the index provider of the year by etf.com, which further validates our efforts to improve investor outcomes through product introductions, innovation, performance and support.\nOur data and listings business was up 1% year-over-year, as [ global ] growth in our data business was offset by headwinds from delistings and a muted IPO environment. In the first quarter, our U.S. listings business achieved a 69% win rate, when considering Nasdaq-eligible operating company listings. In total, we welcomed 22 operating company IPOs, raising nearly $4 billion in proceeds, including Kaspi.kz, Astera Labs and BrightSpring Health. In addition, 4 companies, representing $9 billion in market value, switched their listings to Nasdaq during the quarter, including SAIC. In our data business, we continue to make progress with the signing of new customers to enterprise agreements, with additional growth driven by our international expansion strategy, reflecting the importance of creating a frictionless data experience with multiple delivery capabilities for our global client base.\nTurning to our workflow and insights business, which grew 4% year-over-year. We saw continued weakness in corporate solutions, as lower sales in 2023 will continue to have an impact on our financial performance in 2024. While our sales cycles have been starting to improve over the last 6 months, they continue to be meaningfully longer than what we experienced in 2021 and the first half of 2022. New sales are also impacted by a persistent lower -- slower IPO environment. We are generally able to demonstrate the value of our IR and ESG solutions beyond the complementary IPO package to newly listed companies once they've had a few months to experience the rigor of the public markets. While we're encouraged by the early signs of an improving IPO environment, any IPO market improvements that we may experience in the coming quarters will take time to translate into improving sales and revenue results for our corporate solutions business.\nIn our analytics business, we achieved high single-digit growth in the quarter. And we continued to deepen our strategic alliance with Mercer, one of the largest global investment consultants. During the quarter, Mercer incorporated our new eVestment ESG analytics for asset manager diligence and insights into their assessment process. We're excited about this expansion and see additional opportunity to deepen and expand our partnerships with the asset management community going forward.\nAcross both analytics and corporate solutions, our proprietary data remains a strategic differentiator. For example, in analytics, we continue to develop innovative data products in our data link offerings that are attractive to traders and the investment community. And we have solid growth in our market lens product offered through our eVestment platform. We're also focused on enhancing our products through the use of AI. In corporate solutions, we're advancing Nasdaq Boardvantage with AI-powered workflow tools and are collaborating with Microsoft's iconic AI incubation lab on a series of planned AI-enabled features. As part of this partnership, we're launching a new capability that creates executive summaries for Board members and supports corporate secretaries in preparing and summarizing board documents. We're currently testing this feature with clients in a beta release.\nTurning next to the financial technology division. We delivered 10% growth in the quarter. Overall, we're encouraged with the very strong client response and engagement across the new division, which further reinforces our view that our clients are looking for strategic partners that can help them navigate the complexities across the financial system and operate more efficiently. As part of the transition of the Calypso and AxiomSL businesses to Nasdaq, we hosted our first-ever financial technology conference in New York City earlier this month. The event brought together more than 170 clients from over 80 accounts. Feedback from the clients was positive, highlighting their belief that Nasdaq is the right owner and a trusted partner that will invest in Calypso and Axiom offerings to fuel both the next wave of modernization; and help them mitigate, manage and capitalize on today's environment. Through the event, clients were educated on the Nasdaq organization, the product road map strategy for the AxiomSL and Calypso offerings and on Nasdaq's comprehensive suite of solutions. This has created new commercial conversations that the team is currently pursuing.\nNow let's turn to our performance highlights, starting with the Financial Crime Management Technology business, where we achieved 23% revenue growth and 24.5% ARR growth over the prior year quarter. We advanced our leadership position among small- and medium-sized financial institutions, signing 28 clients during the quarter. As a reminder: The fourth quarter is our biggest bookings quarter each year, and we have a strong pipeline of sales targets to execute on as we progress through the year. We also continue to fight -- to advance our fight against financial crime with a full production launch of our first -- of the first of our AI copilot tools that we're calling Entity Research Copilot. This tool, which is offered through the Bedrock platform at AWS, offers -- fully automates workflows with generative AI to improve investigator efficiency. By automating tasks related to research, summarization and documentation, Verafin offers significant efficiency gains that allow banks to scale their crime-fighting efforts without increasing head count and enables them to shift resources and investment to higher-value activities and more complex investigations. We're encouraged by early user results, which showed these enhanced solutions -- through these enhanced solutions, Verafin delivers up to a 90% reduction in alert review time for investigators compared to legacy approaches. We rolled out this new capability in Verafin through a beta program in the second half of last year, and we announced this week that we're moving to full production and rolling out availability to all of our bank clients.\nNext, I'll discuss the capital markets technology, which is comprised of our trade management services, market technology and Calypso businesses. Overall, capital markets technology grew 6% year-over-year, with 9% growth in ARR. Calypso had a particularly strong performance, with total revenues and ARR growth both demonstrating strength in client demand for our solutions. Calypso had 25 upsells and 1 new client sale during the quarter. While we're early in our journey of unlocking the cross-sell opportunities across the division, we executed on an opportunity with a client who was looking to adopt a data connector between Calypso and AxiomSL, which highlights the synergies between these 2 products.\nMarket technology had a more challenging quarter, largely due to a tough comparable quarter in 2023. We experienced solid growth in ARR but a decline in revenue from professional services primarily because of a significant delivery fee that we received in the first quarter of 2023. Within market technology, we accelerated our strategy to modernize markets by bringing leading technologies to our customers. We signed agreements to upgrade 3 matching engine clients to our next-generation platform during the quarter and we launched a large global clearing and custody provider to the Nasdaq risk platform.\nLet's turn now to our regulatory technology business, which is comprised of our AxiomSL and surveillance businesses where we delivered 11% growth. Our AxiomSL business experienced strong sales and renewals throughout the first quarter. The product had 20 upsells during the quarter and 1 new client sale. With the upsells, we had 3 new ESG sales to G-SIB clients. In our surveillance business, we had 26 upsells and 5 new client sales during the quarter. Across the business, we saw continued cloud adoption, with 55% of total [ MTS ] clients now in the cloud at the end of the first quarter, which represents an increase from the end of last year.\nAs we reflect on the financial technology division's first full quarter, we're very pleased with our financial and operational performance. We delivered revenue growth in line with the medium-term outlook that we announced at Investor Day with strength across many areas of business as well as continued innovation in our product offerings. Since the formation of the financial technology division, we've executed on 6 cross-sells, including 1 this quarter, highlighting the strength of our One Nasdaq go-to-market approach. In addition, we have multiple cross-sell campaigns underway, and we're pleased with the growing share of cross-sell opportunities within our pipeline. As such, we're showing early progress towards our 2027 $100 million-plus cross-sell target.\nMoving to Market Services, where we're navigating a complex market backdrop, particularly against a strong 2023 first quarter comp. We're experiencing 9% decline in revenue. The U.S. options business had a lower-revenue quarter due to lower volatility compared to the prior year quarter, which included turbulence in the banking system as well as increased competition in U.S. options from new entrants and shifts in retail activity resulting from the lower-volatility profile. Despite these headwinds, Nasdaq maintained its market share lead over the #2 operator in U.S. multi-listed equity options. And our proprietary U.S. index options products, notably NDX, continued to gain strength with record revenues, volume and share. In the Nasdaq stock market, we're also pleased to confirm the launch of Dynamic M-ELO, which commenced its rollout across symbols on April 15, with the rollout scheduled to be completed by mid-May. As we've discussed previously, Dynamic M-ELO is the first SEC-approved AI-powered order type designed to improve fill rates and create greater efficiency for our investors.\nIn Europe, where overall market liquidity continues to be challenged, we were able to maintain strong share and capture across our equities, derivatives and fixed income markets; and continue to add value to our clients through our data analytics and new trading products. We also continue to advance our efforts to bring transparency to nascent markets. Early in the second quarter, Puro.earth released a new report tracking the rapid expansion of global carbon removal markets over the last -- over the past years. With Puro.earth as well as our carbon market technology, we experienced strong growth in volumes and revenues as the market continues to mature with greater supply coming online. And we remained well positioned to capitalize on growing demand for carbon removal credits by bringing much-needed transparency, standardization and registry services to this emerging space. As we move forward, we are focused on retaining our leading market position across all of our markets and continue to build on the strong growth that we're seeing in our proprietary NDX options products and in Puro.earth.\nTo wrap up. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of solid results that were in line with the medium-term outlook we provided at Investor Day. In Nasdaq's core business, we delivered well in what we can control within a tougher market environment, including a continued muted IPO environment and lower market volatility. Across our Solutions businesses, we delivered double-digit revenue growth, including strong financial technology results and exceptional index performance. Within financial technology, our recent acquisitions of AxiomSL and Calypso as well as Verafin continue to progress well and remain in line with expectations. With our top line performance, combined with continued expense discipline, we maintain our exceptional margin profile for the company. All told, our performance underscores the durability of our business model and our ability to deliver growth across uncertain environments.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details.\n\nSarah M. Youngwood\n\nMD and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, Adena. And good morning, everyone.\nTurning to our financials. My commentary will focus on non-GAAP results. And year-on-year growth rates and operating margins will be provided on a pro forma basis -- are noted. You can find all the same metrics on an organic basis throughout the earnings presentation.\nTurning to our first quarter results on Slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $871 million up 13%. Operating expense was $524 million, up 5%, resulting in an operating margin of 53%, up 1 percentage point; and with EBITDA margin at 56%.\nOverall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.63.\nTurning to Slide 11 with pro forma revenue growth of 7% for the quarter. As you can see in the last part of the chart, results included a $16 million onetime revenue benefit related to a legal settlement within index tied to the recoupment of revenue. Excluding this, total net revenue increased 6%. And [ on a net basis ], the 6% was alpha performance.\nOverall, beta factors were neutral this quarter, with index market performance primarily offset by the impacts of delisting in Capital Access Platforms and lower volumes in Market Services. The 6% of alpha included 5% growth from our existing clients; and a strong 3% from new clients, cross-sell and other product innovations, with churn at a low 1% level; and a 1% decrease from market share and capture in Market Services.\nTurning to Slide 12. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 7%. As you recall, ARR excludes most of index. We had 12% growth in fintech with strong contributions from each of the 3 subdivisions and 1% growth in Capital Access Platforms, with strength in analytics partially offset by the impacts of delisting, the slower IPO environment and related slower sales in corporate solutions. Annualized SaaS revenue totaled $932 million, up 16%. SaaS was 36% of ARR, up 3 points on a pro forma basis.\nLet's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. In Capital Access Platforms, we delivered revenue of $479 million, reflecting growth of 15%, or 12% excluding the onetime benefit I mentioned. Index revenue increased by 53%, or 38% excluding the onetime benefit. We achieved record-high ETP AUM, averaging $492 billion during the quarter, which is roughly $150 billion higher than the prior year period average. This includes strong market performance as well as higher futures trading volume and capture. Importantly, we also had net inflows of $46 billion in the last 12 months, including $21 billion this quarter. This performance is the result of strength of our data, brand and the [indiscernible] and innovative products we have launched over many years.\nLicensing revenue for futures and options contracts linked to the Nasdaq-100 index also had high-teens growth reflecting higher futures and options trading volumes, up 5%, driven by growth in micro Nasdaq-100 futures contracts. as well as the positive impact from higher capture rates of our partners.\nMoving to data and listings, where revenue was up 1%. Within listings, the benefit of 2023 IPOs [indiscernible] was offset by the $10 million impact of last year's delistings and downgrades. The roll-off of prior year's initial listings revenue didn't have a material impact this quarter but will increase during the year. Within data, we continue to see global expansion driven by international demand, mostly offset by normal levels of [indiscernible].\nWorkflow and insights revenue increased 4%. Within this, analytics grew high single digits, reflecting our continued ability to monetize the value of our data across the [indiscernible] management and trading community. Our proprietary data is key to our alpha generation throughout Nasdaq. And within analytics, we provide valuable client insights through eVestment and data link. The strength in analytics was partially offset by corporate solutions which was flat in the period as we continued to see elongated sales cycles at levels comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as fewer sales opportunities due to the challenging listing environment.\nIn total, ARR for Capital Access Platforms was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 1%, with alpha growth from pricing, upsells and new clients mostly offset by delistings and the continued impact of slower sales cycle among our corporate clients. The division's operating margin was 58% for the quarter. Excluding the onetime benefit, the margin was 57%, up 3 percentage points. The increase was driven by higher revenue, partially offset by inflation and growth-oriented investments.\nLooking forward to the full year 2024 revenue. Due to the market backdrop negatively impacting corporate solutions, we expect growth in workflow and insights to be below its medium-term outlook, whereas the strength in our index business gives us confidence that, within 2024, we can perform above our medium-term outlook. Taken together, we continue to expect our 2024 performance to be within the [ overall ] revenue outlook for the Capital Access Platforms division.\nMoving to Financial Technology on Slide 14. As a reminder: Last week, we provided 2023 quarterly information [indiscernible] provided quarterly pro forma divisional results for 2023, both of which can be found in the appendix of the presentation. This should help you incorporate pro forma comparison in your model.\nThe division delivered revenue of $392 million for the quarter, up 10%, in line with our medium-term outlook. The growth reflects Strong performance in financial crime management, Calypso and AxiomSL at 23%, 23% and 15%, respectively, with strong client engagement. This was partially offset by a tough comp in market tech due to a significant professional service delivery in the prior year quarter, which we noted at that time, [indiscernible] year-on-year comparisons less meaningful. ARR was $1.4 billion, up 12%, with all subdivisions contributing to this strong growth.\nThe key contributors to the difference between total revenue growth and ARR growth were lower year-on-year professional service revenue growth due to the tough comp for market tech as well as less-robust project delivery across our products in the quarter, partially offset by upfront revenue from on-prem renewals, particularly for Calypso.\nBefore we move to subdivision results, a few words on the strong performance of AxiomSL and Calypso. Combined revenue of $151 million increased 20% versus last year, with good client momentum. We had a high level of upfront renewal revenue. We also had higher cloud-based revenues and slightly lower professional services revenue. As we look forward, we continue to expect combined AxiomSL and Calypso revenue to be in line with the full year expectations provided at Investor Day. As we progress through the quarters, we will provide some context to support your modeling. On the back of a strong first quarter which delivered revenue growth above [indiscernible], we expect lower revenue growth in the second quarter, due in large part to the timing of renewals.\nCombined AxiomSL and Calypso ARR of $473 million was up 15%, or up 16% excluding the impact of a significant 2023 bankruptcy noted last quarter. This is in line with our full year expectations as provided at Investor Day, and we maintain this outlook for the year.\nMoving to the subdivisions results. Financial Crime Management Technology revenue was $64 million, up 23%, with ARR of $243 million up 24.5%, reflecting continuous penetration of the core SMB client base, adding 28 new clients in the quarter, with full year 2024 SMB client wins expected to be at least that of 2023. While we had no new Tier 1 or 2 bank signings in the quarter, we continued to have active and positive engagement with a strong pipeline of client opportunities which we expect to sign in the coming quarters.\nRegulatory technology revenue was $90 million, and ARR was $328 million, both up 11%. Excluding the impact of churn related to the liquidity event of March 2023, revenue and ARR were up 12% and 13%, respectively. Surveillance grew 6% for both revenue and ARR, reflecting strong sales as well as the continuation of the cloud transformation of this business, with 55% of Nasdaq [ trade ] surveillance customers now in the cloud. AxiomSL grew revenue 15% and IRR by 16%, reflecting strong sales. In the quarter, nearly 50% of new bookings were in the cloud, highlighting the continued cloud journey for the business that is ultimately beneficial for both our clients and Nasdaq.\nIn capital markets technology, we delivered revenue of $238 million, up 6%, with ARR of $821 million up 9%. Calypso had a strong quarter, with revenue up 23% and ARR up 14%. Revenue included a strong contribution of on-prem renewal revenue. The business had 16% of new bookings come from the cloud, a lower proportion than what we expect for the year due to timing.\nThe combined market tech and trade management services business, which is what we used to call marketplace tech, was slightly down in revenue but up in ARR, again driven by the significant professional service delivery in the prior year period that provided a tough comp. This impact was somewhat offset by the partial quarter impact of pricing increases coupled with strong client activity and testing revenue within trade management services. Looking forward to the full year 2024, we expect the combined market tech and trade management services to be well positioned within the 3% to 5% range, with a muted second quarter and the growth being back ended.\nThe division's operating margin in the first quarter was 45%, up 2 percentage points. The margin expansion reflects strong top line revenue growth and the beginning of synergy realization, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and expense related to revenue and investments in growth.\nAnd wrapping up the divisions with Market Services. Net revenue was $237 million for the quarter, down 9% versus an extremely tough comp. The short story here is 1 percentage point or $3 million relating to our share of nonrecurring industry [ adjustments ] to the tape plans. The rest was about half beta, half alpha, with beta drivers across tape, 1 fewer trading days and volumes in Europe; and most of the alpha story tied to last year's exceptional capture in our U.S. options business during the bank liquidity events in the first quarter. $0.13 per contract traded in 1Q '23 was an exception in a consistent 2-year trend of capture at $0.12, which is where we were in the first quarter.\nThe division's operating margin of 56% in the first quarter represents a 6 percentage points decrease from the prior year period as a result of lower revenue as well as ongoing investments related to both capacity enhancements and modernizing our market.\nTurning to Slide 16. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $524 million, reflecting pro forma growth of $24 million or 5%. This is driven by inflation, supporting our revenue growth and investments. This compares to pro forma revenue growth of $76 million or 7%, reflecting positive operating leverage.\nNow on to guidance. We are updating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $2.125 billion to $2.185 billion to reflect FX, equity compensation and less uncertainty on revenue growth. The midpoint represents pro forma growth of just over 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza, FX and the in-year benefits of net expense synergies. Excluding Adenza, Nasdaq's expense growth would be around 4.5%. In addition, the second quarter will reflect our annual merit adjustments and equity grants. And therefore, we expect expense to increase just under $20 million from the first quarter of 2024, assuming stable performance and exchange rates.\nOn synergies, we have actioned approximately 40% of our $80 million of net expense synergies through the end of 1Q '24, with the [indiscernible] benefit weighted towards the second half of 2024 and into 2025 given some transition projects. We are confident in the 70% actioned by the end of 2024 and would note that it won't be linear. Additionally, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis.\nTurning to Slide 17. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. In the quarter, we had $504 million of free cash flow. Please note that cash flow generation in the first quarter is generally elevated versus the rest of the year. Once again, we had a cash flow conversion ratio above 100% at 106% for the last 12 months.\nIn terms of free cash flow utilization in the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share or $127 million, for a 35% payout ratio. And we did not repurchase any shares this quarter. We also repaid the remaining $340 million of our term loan, in line with our prior commitment of prioritizing deleveraging. And finally, we repaid $67 million of commercial paper. Excluding commercial paper, all of our outstanding debt is now fixed. Our all-in pretax cost of debt was 4.0% as we exit 1Q '24.\nTurning to leverage. Our gross leverage ratio declined from 4.3x at the end of last year to 4.1x at the end of 1Q '24. In addition to the stated debt repayments, our leverage ratio decreased 0.1x from impacts of FX, amortization of debt issue costs and stronger EBITDA. We are reiterating our expectation to achieve gross leverage below 4x 9 to 12 months ahead of our initial goal.\nAs I reflect on this quarter, I would highlight strong client adoption and growth in solutions overall and particularly in index, analytics, financial crime management, AxiomSL and Calypso; strong progress on synergy actions and building of cross-sell pipelines; and continued actions on deleveraging. As we look ahead, I continue to be impressed by the balance and diversity of the business model enabling us to grow the top line with strong margins and to effectively execute our capital allocation plans. We are well positioned to deliver on our One Nasdaq strategy and achieve durable organic revenue growth and profitability.\nThank you for your time. And I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to the Nasdaq Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker to Ato Garrett, SVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A.\nThe press release and earnings presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections.\nInformation concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Further, any references to organic growth will exclude the impact of changes in FX rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which this quarter substantially all related to the 2 months of Adenza performance included in the fourth quarter and...\n[Audio Gap]\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nfor an improving business environment for Nasdaq in 2024. We have a healthy pipeline of companies that have filed to go public on Nasdaq. Additionally, throughout 2023, we benefited from $31 billion in net inflows into our index products, which represents a strong starting point for 2024. In the fourth quarter, we also saw early signs of normalization and sales cycles for our IR and asset owner solutions. And lastly, market volumes are off to a solid start in the new year and client interest in our comprehensive suite of technology solutions remains very strong.\nTurning to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq crossed the $1 billion mark in net revenues for the first time in a single quarter, achieving revenues of $1.1 billion. This is a 23% increase compared to the prior year period and a 7% increase on an organic basis. We delivered 9% organic across our solutions businesses during the quarter, while Market Services was flat.\nFor the full year, net revenues of $3.9 billion increased 9% from 2022 or 5% on an organic basis. Solutions generated 7% organic -- annual organic revenue growth, which is consistent with our overall Solutions revenue outlook despite a dynamic market environment. Our Market Services revenue were flat year-over-year, primarily due to continued muted volumes in Europe on the back of strong performance in 2022.\nOur annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2.6 billion, an organic increase of 6% year-over-year. The slower IPO environment, as well as lower buying activity by corporates for our solutions, contributed to a more modest growth in ARR in 2023.\nAnnualized SaaS revenues increased to $910 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding AdenzA, this represented a 12% growth rate and 38% of total company ARR. Across the company, we accomplished revenue growth and business expansion while maintaining our operating margin at 52% for both the quarter and the full year basis, excluding Adenza.\nOur strong performance in 2023 illustrates the strength of our diversified business and ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives in an unpredictable environment. We did this while taking an important strategic step in Nasdaq's evolution.\nOn November 1, we are pleased to complete the Adenza acquisition, and we are now working as one team to further our clients' goals for risk management and regulatory reporting excellence. Reflecting on the past year, I'm extremely proud of Nasdaq's team's accomplishments. With the establishment of our divisional structure and the Adenza acquisition, 2023 was a transformational year for our business. Throughout the year, we achieved several major milestones to deepen our client relationships and advance our vision to be the trusted fabric of the world's financial system.\nNow let's review the highlights of our operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms. As you know, at Nasdaq, our exchanges are our foundation. We maintained our position as the premier U.S. exchange for IPOs with an 81% U.S. operating company win rate in 2023. In total, we welcomed 103 operating company IPOs that raised more than $11 billion in proceeds, marking Nasdaq's fifth consecutive year as the leading U.S. listing exchange in terms of both number of IPOs and proceeds raised.\nIn addition, 18 companies representing $377 billion in market value switched their listings to Nasdaq during the year. In Index, we had $31 billion of net inflows for the year, including $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Our clients want -- our clients launched 83 new products linked to Nasdaq indices during the year, bringing to market robust solutions in line with investor demand.\nBeyond our Exchange and index leadership, we are a leading source of institutional intelligence to the buy side through eVestment and have continued to expand our offering into alternatives and ESG. We continue to broaden our ESG solutions in 2023, launching multiple new offerings to help corporates and investors navigate an evolving ESG ecosystem, including Nasdaq Metrio and eVestment ESG analytics. We also introduced a suite of new solutions designed to help corporate clients drive governance excellence and accelerate their ESG strategies, including sustainable lens through IR insight.\nTurning to the fintech division. With the completion of our Adenza acquisition, we have created a financial technology powerhouse of anti-financial crime, surveillance, market technology and risk and regulatory reporting solutions that positions us as a key risk management partner to the global financial system. Our Calypso solution helps financial institutions navigate a range of market conditions, providing a live view of risk across proprietary and client trading portfolios with detailed analytics to support real-time risk management decision-making.\nSimilarly, in an increasingly complex and fragmented global regulatory environment, where risks need to be managed in shorter timelines at a granular level, our AxiomSL solution enables our clients to benefit from the Nasdaq's global scale and expertise. We now can be a comprehensive partner to banks, brokers, financial market infrastructure providers and investment managers worldwide by helping them maximize their liquidity through world-class capital markets and risk management technology as well as by enhancing integrity across the banking system through our regulatory reporting and anti-financial crime suite of solutions.\nWith the closing of Adenza, we're fully focused on engaging with our clients and new employees to ensure a smooth and successful transition and integration. Tal Cohen, NAS Co-President and leader of the Fintech division, and I have personally been speaking with our clients over the past few months, and there are a lot of excitement around the potential opportunities now that Adenza is part of Nasdaq.\nAdenza finished the year with strong sales and upsells across solutions. Specifically, in the last 2 months, we signed 6 new clients, including 2 central banks. We also expanded our relationships with 35 existing clients. For the full year, Adenza added 23 new clients and expanded our relationships with 142 existing clients, including 3 cross sells. We are thrilled to enter 2024 with Adenza as part of Nasdaq, and we're very excited to drive the business and the solutions to new heights in the years ahead.\nTurning to Market Technology. In 2023, [indiscernible] bolstered our global client footprint with addition of 7 clients, including 4 in the fourth quarter. We also expanded our relationships with 4 clients in the fourth quarter and more than 10 clients for the full year. Importantly, we had key technology client signings in APAC and in the LatAm regions. We are proud to forge new technology partnership with nuam Exchange, which is the consolidation of marketplaces across Peru, Chile and Colombia. We also expanded our relationship with Chile's central securities depository with capabilities managed digitized assets and with B3 in Brazil to develop a new clearing solution, and with BM in Mexico to modernize this entire post-trade technology platform.\nOur growing customer relationships highlight the importance of the financial technology we provide, which power resilient and liquid markets around the world. In our anti-financial crime suite of solutions, we're bringing world-leading technology, coupled with our consortium data set from 2,500 banks to fight the growing threat of financial crime in the global financial system. Our inaugural global financial crime report, which was conducted in partnership with outside experts, estimates that over $3 trillion of illicit funds flows through the global financial system and $500 billion is lost to fraud. It's an enormous challenge that requires collective action across the banking sector, the public sector and the embrace of advanced technology.\nWe are very proud of our role in fighting financial crime, and we're finding tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our capabilities across the banking sector. In 2023, we reached a significant milestone in our anti-financial crime growth strategy. During the year, Verafin, our fraud and AML solutions, signed its first 3 Tier 1 banks as well as 4 Tier 2 banks, including 1 Tier 1 client and 1 Tier 2 client in the fourth quarter. We also partnered with a growing number of small and medium-sized financial institutions for a total of 237 new clients this year and 100 for the fourth quarter alone.\nAdditionally, we developed our fourth proprietary Verafin Gen AI copilot, which is now in beta with our customers. Our Gen AI tools reduce time and resources spent on manual tasks and processes such as alert reviews, research and documentation. By increasing their operational efficiency, Verafin enables our clients to invest in resilient growth at an attractive ROI.\nIn Surveillance, we signed 27 new clients in 2023, including 6 in the fourth quarter. We made significant strides in modernizing our solutions by launching a new cloud-based architecture and capabilities within surveillance user interfaces. These innovations give our clients the ability to calibrate their surveillance setup more efficiently and effectively.\nToday, 50% of our Nasdaq trade surveillance clients leverage our cloud deployed solutions, which support access to 200 sophisticated alerts across more than 160 markets globally. As we continue to enhance our surveillance capabilities, we're encouraged by the early adoption of our next-gen cloud architecture and new user interfaces.\nMoving on Market Services. In the fourth quarter, we maintained our strong 72% market share for our cash equities markets in the Nordics against a challenging volume environment across the European markets. We've also continued to demonstrate a leading market position in the U.S. equities and options markets.\nIn the fourth quarter, we benefited from robust closing cross volumes from the S&P, MSCI and our own Nasdaq rebound events, and we continue to experience growing adoption of our NDX Index options product.\nAdditionally, we continue to advance the modernization of markets with the successful migration of our second U.S. options market to the AWS cloud infrastructure and with the SEC approval of the first AI-powered order type called Dynamic M-ELO, which we expect to launch in the first quarter of 2024.\nAltogether, we're moving with speed while delivering revenue growth and an attractive margin profile that will drive shareholder value. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2024. Our first priority is to continue the successful integration of Adenza. We've made great progress in the initial phase of the integration and remain confident in our ability to deliver on the goals that we laid out at the time of the deal.\nSecond, we're accelerating the impact of our divisional structure to activate and unlock new opportunities that will drive our business into the future. Over the past year, we've delivered significant progress across each of our business divisions and we will continue to realize the benefits of this structure in 2024.\nThird, we are institutionalizing client listening across the company to unlock revenue growth through One Nasdaq approach to our client engagements. In 2024, we have a focused program to organize our client data, advance our CRM and other related systems, and enhance our processes across the enterprise to gain a holistic understanding of our clients with the goal to drive partnerships and cross-selling opportunities going forward.\nAnd fourth, we will further amplify the impact that AI has on the business and in our products. Nasdaq is leveraging several critical components to ensure AI is implemented safely, securely and fairly. And through our focus on AI, coupled with the vast proprietary data sets that we've created over decades in our markets and in our solutions covering investment analytics, investor relations and anti-financial crime, we're confident that we can extend Nasdaq's competitive advantage in the years ahead.\nWe look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities at Investor Day and in the quarters to come. To wrap up, 2023 was another year defined by significant strategic and operational milestones and strong execution. As we look ahead to 2024, we're well positioned to better serve our clients more holistically as we become the trusted fabric on the world's financial system. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review our financial details.\n\nSarah M. Youngwood\n\nMD and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to be here for my first earnings call at Nasdaq. I could not be more excited to join the firm at such a transformational time, and I look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day.\nNow I will turn to our financial results. My commentary will be focused on non-GAAP results on a year-on-year growth rate will be provided on an organic basis. Normally, operating margins will be discussed ex-Adenza for comparability purposes. I will discuss the Adenza [indiscernible] results at the end of the fintech section.\nBefore we move to the quarter, I would like to give you the highlights for the full year 2023, starting on Slide 12 of the earnings presentation. In an uncertain environment, we delivered solid financial performance and strong cash flow generation. Revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5%, with Solutions revenue of $2.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Non-GAAP expense was $1.8 billion, up 5%, in line with guidance for a 52% operating margin, which was flat versus the prior year. This resulted in diluted EPS of $2.82, reflecting organic growth of 6%.\nWe had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, a growth rate of 11%. Moving on to the fourth quarter on Slide 13. We reported revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $860 million, an increase of 9%. Non-GAAP expense was $504 million, up 2% and with an operating margin of 52%, up 3 percentage points.\nOverall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.72, reflecting organic growth of 11%. Turning to Slide 14. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 6% organically. The annualized SaaS revenue totaled $910 million, representing organic growth of 12%. Excluding Adenza, SaaS was 38% of ARR, an improvement of 2 percentage points. Including Adenza, that number is 35%, which will improve as the cloud portion of their revenue increases.\nAs a reminder, we only consider the cloud portion of their revenue to be soft. Let's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 15. For capital access platforms, revenue of $461 million increased 10%, driven by excellent performance in Index. In Data and Listing Services, we saw 3% growth. In Data, we have seen a continued increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand.\nIn Listings, the positive impact of pricing was partially offset by the combined impact of delistings, a muted IPO environment and the roll-off of prior year's initial listings revenue. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 3%. Analytics delivered high single-digit growth, reflecting our ability to monetize the value of our data to the buy side with new business and increased pricing across traditional and alternative asset managers.\nThe strength in analytics was partially offset by a weaker capital raising market and the impact of elongated sales cycle in Corporate Solutions. Index revenue increased 26%, and overall AUM grew by 34%. Over the last 12 months, our net inflows were $31 million, $10 million of which occurred during the fourth quarter.\nLicensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 index increased as well, driven by higher capture, partially offset by a decline in trading volumes. As a reminder, our capture increases once we cross a volume threshold and then resets at the beginning of each year.\nWhile smaller in size, Index revenue also benefited from Index data revenue growth. ARR for Capital Access Platforms was $1.2 billion, up 3%. ARR growth was largely driven by Analytics and to a lesser extent, Data and Listings. The muted IPO environment impacted ARR growth. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we could see a recovery in IPOs, combined with more normalized sales cycles as we progress through 2024.\nAs a reminder, substantially all of Index revenue is excluded from ARR. The division's operating margin was 54% for the quarter, an increase of 4 percentage points due to higher revenues. For the full year, it was 55%, up roughly 50 basis points. The increase was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by inflation, revenue-related expense and investments, in particular, across Data and Index.\nMoving to Financial Technology on Slide 16. The division delivered revenue of $399 million for the quarter, up 8%. Regulatory technologies grew 17% with Verafin at 25%. Verafin added 100 new clients this quarter, including our third Tier 1 bank. While we are excited about these additions, as we have previously discussed, the contracting and implementation with this [indiscernible] complex institutions is longer. We will start recognizing subscription revenue in 2024, but we believe that Reg Tech will only accelerate as we expand relationships with these clients.\nThe strong performance of Verafin, along with 6% growth in surveillance, led to the 17% growth of Regulatory Technology. For Surveillance, the fourth quarter growth was impacted by the timing of bookings in 2023 versus 2022. But fundamentals remain strong for the year, with 6 new clients in the fourth quarter and 27 for the full year. We also made inroads with the Tier 3 broker client cohort, which reflects progress beyond our leadership position with large banks.\nCloud as well as Surveillance is now above 50% deployed, which is an important driver of client stickiness through the speed and efficiency it enables us to provide.\nMoving on to Capital Markets Technology. We saw 3% growth, driven by data center connectivity demand. We had new market tech contract signings in Latin America and with one of our U.S. Tier 1 clients. We expect these contracts to start to accrue in 2024.\nAs Adena mentioned, we continue to increase our market technology presence in Latin America and to have a leading role in the modernization of markets in the region. ARR for FinTech totaled $1.35 billion, an increase of 10% due to continued customer wins at Verafin as well as growth in trade management services and Market Technology. The division's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 40%, up 4 percentage points. The organic margin expansion reflects solid top line growth and expense control with an overall increase in revenue-related costs, offset by efficiencies and lower professional fees.\nWe are progressing on our journey to improve the efficiencies in Market Technology are continuing to support the growth of Verafin and surveillance. For the full year, the operating margin was 40%, up 5 percentage points with a story which mirrors that of the quarter, including strong operating leverage and investments.\nBefore closing on FinTech, a few additional words on Adenza. For November and December, Adenza contributed $149 million in revenue; $458 million of ARR, of which $98 million was in SaaS; and $35 million in non-GAAP operating expense. A strong finish to the year drove a 77% operating margin for our 2 month [indiscernible]. On a full year basis, Adenza had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59%, ahead of our initial 58% outlook for the year. Let me now talk about Adenza's full year revenue and ARR.\nRevenue was $583 million in 2023, up 14%. ARR of $458 million grew 16%, excluding a significant bankruptcy that occurred during the year or 14% net of it. Both metrics are on a constant currency basis. We had nearly 50% of new ACV coming from cloud this year. The strong cloud take-up by our clients supports our growth and efficiencies.\nRevenue growth benefited from a large portion of ARR up for renewal in the quarter and in the year. Going forward, we expect Adenza's revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens consistent with the medium- to long-term outlook we provided when we announced the acquisition.\nThe timing of contracts being up for renewal and the mix of revenue between cloud and on-premise delivery will have an impact on revenue growth in any given quarter on year. This is why we are focused on ARR growth, which is not as impacted by in our renewable and delivery method. We'll provide more details on the revenue dynamics of our FinTech division at Investor Day.\nAnd wrapping up our divisional overview with Market Services. Net revenue was $247 million for the quarter, roughly flat with growth in U.S. cash equities offset by decreases in U.S. options. U.S. cash equity's growth was driven by higher capture, partially offset by lower share. In a very competitive U.S. options environment, we are defending our strong market share lead and our attractive capture.\nMeanwhile, in Europe, CapEx exchange volumes were positively offset by a $7 million nonrecurring payment and by the benefits of diversification between fixed income and equity. The investments we have made in leveraging our technology and data to provide our European market clients with transparency helps them to generate AF. This has enabled us to help our clients improve their execution quality and has been key to our ability to reclaim our 72% market share, a 2 percentage point increase.\nThe division's operating margin was 57% in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to 60% in the prior year quarter as a result of higher compensation costs as we continue to invest in our people and higher technology costs due to ongoing investments related to both capacity and migrating U.S. market to the cloud. The full year operating margin for the division totaled 59% with the same drivers as the quarter history.\nTurning to Slide 19. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $504 million, an organic increase of $8 million or 2% versus our organic revenue growth of 7%. I want point a story in the businesses, and it reflects good expense discipline as well as the timing of marketing and professional fees. Overall, this reflects a 52% operating margin, up 3 percentage points.\nFor the full year, our non-GAAP operating expense was $1.83 billion, in line with guidance. We were up 5%, consistent with revenue growth for a flat operating margin at 52%. The increase is due to investments in key growth areas, inflation and higher revenue-related expense. We also achieved efficiencies during the year as we continue to optimize our location footprint and bring divisions together as part of our divisional realignment.\nIf you include Adenza for the full year, operating expense totaled $2.05 billion. Now on to guidance. We are initiating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance of $2.105 billion to $2.185 billion, the midpoint of which reflects pro forma growth of 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza and in year expense method of net synergies.\nOn an organic basis, excluding Adenza, tax expense growth will be just under 4.5%. We will spend more time on synergies at Investor today, but we reiterate the net $80 million synergy target by the end of 2025 and $80 million cost to achieve are set forth in the restructuring program we just initiated. Additionally, we are guiding the full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis, slightly higher than 2023, due to lower expected tax benefit on equity awards.\nTurning to Slide 20. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. For the year, we had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, and Adenza had $306 million in unlevered pretax free cash flow. Our gross leverage ratio was expected to be at 4.7 at the time of deal close. But we are pleased to share that at year-end, we are at 4.3 despite 0.1 headwind from euro strength.\nLet's go through the details on the chart. At the end of the third quarter, our adjusted leverage ratio was 2.4. We added the leverage to acquire Adenza. At the beginning of December, we posted share repurchases and repaid $260 million of term loans. The ratio benefited from the incremental EBITDA from Adenza's full year and net tax growth. We expect to continue deleveraging in the first quarter of 2024.\nAnd to wrap up on free cash flow utilization, we have repurchased $269 million of our common stock this year, including $110 million in the fourth quarter. And we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for a 35% annualized payout ratio.\nIn closing today, this quarter and this year's performance shows Nasdaq's ability to deliver consistent growth, margin and free cash flow in a range of environments. We are committed to disciplined execution and continued innovation. The invest we have made in our resilience, our technology and our data over the years, helped with our reach and park record, position us for sustainable growth as we power our client's success. Thank you for your time, and I will turn back to the operator for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's third quarter 2020 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will open up the line to Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation are available on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with the disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation [ FD ]. I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Nasdaq's third quarter earnings call. Before I begin, I would like to offer brief comments on the situation in the Middle East. We were horrified by the acts of terrorist violence that occurred in Israel last week, and we were deeply saddened by the subsequent loss of innocent lives at Israel, Gaza and the region. Our focus has been on supporting our people and our clients with the connection in the region. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and stay engaged with them throughout this emerging crisis.\nTurning now to my remarks about the quarter. I will start by covering Nasdaq's performance and how our strategy is unfolding in the context of the current operating environment as well as provide key business highlights. I will then turn the call over to Ann for a detailed review of our financial results.\nI'm pleased to share that Nasdaq continues to make solid progress on our strategic objectives to capitalize on the key megatrends shaping the financial system. Nasdaq continues to execute against its strategic vision, become the trusted fabric of the global financial system, delivering broad-based growth across our businesses including 6% overall net revenue growth and 8% year-over-year organic revenue growth in our Solutions businesses.\nI'm proud of the team's efforts to continue to serve our clients, and I'm pleased to see our revenue growth improving in the third quarter, aided by strong performance in our Capital Access Platforms division particularly in our Index business. In addition, our Anti-Financial Crime division continued to deliver strong results with solid growth in our Surveillance business and Verafin continuing to demonstrate strong new customer growth as well as an expansion contract with the Tier 2 clients.\nWith respect to the market backdrop, during the quarter, we saw a variety of cross currents including increasing market volatility, fluctuating equity markets and rising long-term interest rates. Nevertheless, we experienced modestly improving momentum in our Listings business amid a gradual reemergence of U.S. IPO activity with 35 operating companies choosing to list at Nasdaq during the quarter. Based on our client conversations and our growing IPO pipeline, we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the upcoming year.\nAcross the company, as we've discussed before, Nasdaq is well positioned to thrive by capitalizing on 3 key megatrends that are shaping the financial system: the modernization of markets, the development of the corporate and investor ecosystem for environmental sustainability and the increasing need for integrity solutions across the financial system, including risk management, surveillance, regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime technology. By aligning our business with these key megatrends, we're unlocking attractive opportunities for sustainable growth, and we're building a diversified business that's well positioned to succeed through economic cycles.\nIn this regard, I'd like to provide a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate the progress we're making to capitalize on these growth opportunities. First, our focus on market modernization continues to deliver innovation that enhances the liquidity and underlying market infrastructure that powers the world's economies. A major driver of that innovation has been our ability to adopt and leverage technologies including cloud and artificial intelligence across our markets and in our products. In the third quarter, we are pleased to announce the approval by the SEC of the first exchange AI-powered order type, which we call Dynamic Midpoint Extended Life Order, or Dynamic M-ELO.\nFor the last several years, we've offered an order type called the Midpoint Extended Life Order for clients seeking larger trade sizes at the midpoint. The order introduces a fixed holding period to gather order interest before execution. Through extensive testing and consultation, we determined that our clients' trade execution could be improved under certain market conditions by applying adaptable holding periods. This led to the creation of Dynamic M-ELO, which leverages AI to adjust the length of holding periods throughout the trading day on a stock-by-stock basis to improve fill rates and reduce market friction. We're very excited to roll out this enhanced order type to our clients in the coming months, and we see significant opportunity ahead to drive the application of AI and other emerging technologies across our markets.\nNext, regarding the development of the environmental sustainable ecosystem. During the quarter, we were proud to launch 2 new offerings designed to help corporates and investors streamline their sustainability journeys. Following the acquisition of Metrio last year, we have integrated Nasdaq's OneReport and Metrio's sustainability reporting and workflow offerings into a single solution called Nasdaq Metrio, which was officially launched during the quarter. Nasdaq Metrio is a SaaS-based end-to-end solution that helps corporates better collect, measure and report sustainability data on a single platform.\nIn addition, in our Investment Intelligence business, we announced the launch of Nasdaq eVestment ESG Analytics, which is designed to help asset managers better quantify and showcase the environmental, social and/or governance impact of our portfolio's position in the market. It enables asset managers to demonstrate their portfolio sustainability strategies to asset owners, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and endowments. These 2 solutions underscore our role as a bridge between corporates and investors by creating market-based, demand-driven solutions that help bring clarity to a rapidly evolving environment for sustainability reporting.\nLastly, looking at the increasing need for integrity solutions, including risk management and anti-financial crime technology, we're developing innovations that make our clients' anti-money laundering, or AML, programs more efficient. Specifically, in October we have launched the beta version of an AML workflow co-pilot tool that will leverage generative AI to automate portions of our clients' AML processes. We look forward to updating you on our progress of these opportunities in the quarters to come as we continue our journey to leverage technology to advance our clients' evolving needs.\nTurning next to our results. I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's continued solid financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. We achieved $940 million in net revenues, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year period and an increase of 5% on an organic basis. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $694 million, up 9% from the prior year period and 8% on an organic basis. Our total ARR increased 6% to $2.1 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million in the third quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues now comprise 37% of total company ARR.\nIn our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $456 million in total revenue in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period. Our Index revenues grew 15% from the prior year period. The performance in our Index business reflects strong year-over-year market performance, $24 billion in net inflows over the past 12 months, including $5 million in the third quarter and strong futures capture, partially offset by lower derivative volumes.\nOur Workflow and Insights revenues grew 5% over the prior year period, reflecting sustained demand for project work in our ESG solutions and steady Analytics solutions sales to asset managers. While we continue to see elongated sales cycles for certain products in this business, we've not seen a material improvement or worsening of sales cycles from the second quarter of 2023. Our Data and Listing Services revenues grew 5%. Our Listings revenues was largely unchanged due to continued muted IPO activity and heightened delistings, while our data business delivered continued strong revenue growth driven by demand from international data clients.\nWe maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings, ending the quarter with strong momentum from some of the year's biggest IPOs by proceeds raised. Year-to-date, Nasdaq welcomed 83 new operating company IPOs for an 84% win rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we have welcomed 4 of the 5 top IPOs by capital raised. And in the third quarter, we achieved an overall win rate of 95% and welcomed several marquee IPOs, including [ ARM Holdings ] and Instacart. This momentum was also bolstered by several notable listing switches to Nasdaq in the quarter, including DoorDash and Roper Technologies. Overall, 11 companies have transferred to Nasdaq year-to-date, representing a total market value of $184 billion.\nThe September listing success coincides with the launch of our new IPO and Broadcast Center at the Nasdaq market site in Times Square, further establishing Nasdaq as the world's premier venue for listings. The reimagined space reflects our commitment to showcasing our clients and elevating their IPO experience and enables us to create more visibility for first trade celebrations through increased access to global media outlets. Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to capture new listings activity. We have a strong pipeline of companies that have committed to NASDAQ and are in close contact with these companies as they evaluate their IPO time lines.\nTurning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $381 million in total revenues during the third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. In our Trading business, revenues declined 1% and compared to the prior year with lower European revenue, partially offset by modest growth in U.S. equities revenue due to higher revenue capture and a small FX benefit. In our market technology business -- our Marketplace Technology business, revenue grew 4% with growth in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology Solutions. During the period, we completed delivery of a major CSD project for our Latin American central securities depository and signed a contract extension, including an upgrade to our next-gen trading system, with one1 of the largest stock exchanges in Southeast Asia.\nTurning next to a brief update on Adenza. We're progressing well towards the closing of the Adenza transaction. We've completed the antitrust review, and Thoma Bravo is on track to obtain the remaining approvals from the Nordic and Baltic financial regulators to become a major shareholder in Nasdaq. Therefore, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. As previously disclosed, this business will be reported as part of the newly created Financial Technology division, alongside our Marketplace Technology and Anti-Financial Crime businesses.\nIn the third quarter, Adenza continued its strong performance, delivering constant currency ARR growth in the high teens. Year-to-date through the third quarter, they added 17 new clients and 3 total cross-sells, which compares to 7 new clients and 3 cross-sells over the same period last year. Additionally, Adenza maintained solid growth in net revenue retention at 97.4% and 113%, respectively. We're also pleased with the momentum of a Adenza's journey towards a cloud-based delivery of solutions across both existing and new clients. Through the first 3 quarters of 2023, 55% of bookings have been for cloud delivery solutions versus 27% over the same period last year.\nSince the transaction was announced in June, we have held extensive integration and planning discussions with the leadership team at Adenza, and we're very excited about the opportunities ahead. As a result of our early interactions together, we have developed a very clear path and process for integration that we intend to execute successfully starting on day 1 post close.\nFinally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $93 million in total revenue during the third quarter, a 21% increase in the prior year period. Nasdaq Verafin grew 29%, primarily driven by growth in the adoption of our fraud and anti-money laundering, or FRAML, solutions by small- and medium-sized banks as well as an expansion of wallet share among existing clients. We continue to expand client relationships with 47 new small and medium-sized financial institutions adopting our FRAML solutions.\nAdditionally, we continue to have momentum in our move-up market. This quarter, we signed an expansion agreement with an existing Tier 2 bank client. Specifically, this is a bank client that signed on to our fraud detection and workflow solution in the first quarter of 2023 and has now expanded their relationship with us to include our complex investigation solution. We view this expansion as a strong proof point in our ability to land and expand our relationships with large bank clients. We continue to be actively engaged in contract negotiations and proof of concepts with several Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and remain on track with our plans to sign additional large banks in the coming quarters.\nOur Surveillance business delivered 9% organic revenue growth with continued new customer growth, including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers, as we expanded our leadership position with large customers. And lastly, I'm pleased to announce that we've officially named Brendan Brothers as Executive as President of our Anti-Financial Crime division. As you may recall, Brendan was named to the role on an interim basis earlier this year, and we're thrilled to welcome him formally as a member of our leadership team, continuing to report directly to me.\nTo wrap up, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified business and reflect our strong position going into year-end with the closing of the Adenza transaction view. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nSenior VP, Controller & CAO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. Turning to this quarter's results. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will start by reviewing third quarter 2023 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $940 million is the net result of organic growth of 5%, including an 8% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and slightly lower Trading Services revenue and $3 million in net positive impact from changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 4%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was down approximately 90 basis points from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $349 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $335 million or $0.68 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year period; while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million, an increase of 11%. ARR and SaaS revenue growth in the quarter reflects broad-based growth led by continued booking strength in our Anti-Financial Crime division. We are delivering solid performance despite ongoing elongated sales cycles in certain areas of our Workflow and Insights business, similar to recent quarters. We are working closely with our customers in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and are executing well on our strategic pillars of bringing liquidity, transparency and integrity to financial markets.\nI will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15, starting with the Market Platforms division. Revenues increased $2 million or 1%, driven by positive impact from changes in FX rates. Trading Services organic revenue was down 2% driven by lower European trading revenues due to lower volumes, despite better cash equity revenue capture that offset largely flat U.S. revenues. While we have seen an increase in off-exchange trading, which is common in a lower volatility environment, Nasdaq's share of available volume has remained steady.\nIn Marketplace Technology, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, reflecting solid revenue growth in our Market Technology business. As a reminder, Marketplace Technology revenue growth in the first half of the year benefited from testing revenue and a large project delivery that we don't expect to recur in the second half of the year. We continue to expect full year revenue growth for Marketplace Technology to be at the upper end of our medium-term outlook.\nARR totaled $511 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period. This growth rate is lower compared to prior periods due to slower trade management services growth, resulting from near-term market conditions. Market Platforms operating margin was 52% in the third quarter of 2023, representing a 370 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to lower revenue resulting from lower European trading activity as well as higher compensation costs, ongoing investments related to migrating U.S. markets to the cloud and investment in new growth opportunities in Marketplace Technology.\nTurning to Capital Access Platforms. Revenues increased $34 million or 8%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $32 million and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. We delivered broad-based organic growth in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in Index. Index revenue increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 22% increase in average AUM over the prior year quarter.\nLicensing revenues for future contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased 14%, reflecting higher pricing per contract, partially offset by a decline in trading volumes. Additionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $24 billion, including $5 billion in the quarter. While AUM has benefited from a strong year-to-date market performance, we saw AUM impacted by overall markets trending lower in the last 2 months of the quarter.\nMoving to Data and Listing Services. Our revenue grew 5%. Excluding the positive impact from changes in FX rates, our organic growth was 4%. Revenue growth reflects continued strength in our data business and the combined impact of delisting and a more muted IPO environment on listings revenue growth. However, as Adena mentioned, we have seen several high-profile initial listings and 11 switches year-to-date.\nWorkflow and Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the third quarter of '22, reflecting growth across our ESG and Analytics businesses despite ongoing elongated sales cycles with corporates, particularly for our IR tools and for our asset owner portfolio management solutions, affecting revenue growth in the third quarter.\nARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period. While ARR growth related to our data products remain solid, the Capital Access Platforms' ARR growth rate has been impacted by slower listings growth and the impact of continuing elongated sales cycles on parts of our Corporate Solutions and Analytics businesses. The division operating margin was 56% in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of roughly 50 basis points from the prior year period.\nAnti-Financial Crime revenue increased [ $16 ] million or 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Growth reflects robust demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as our staff-based Surveillance solutions. Our fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 29% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Surveillance revenues grew 9% compared to the third quarter of '22 with continued customer growth, including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers. These new customer wins reflect our ability to drive growth beyond our leadership position with large banks and expand into new customer segments.\nARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $348 million, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced, totaled $381 million, an increase of 19% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 33% in the third quarter of 2023 versus 27% in the prior year period with approximately 1/2 of the margin growth resulting from the timing of recognition of incentive compensation.\nTurning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $32 million to $449 million. The increase primarily reflects a $32 million organic increase or 8%. The organic year-over-year increase reflects increased compensation and benefits expense due primarily to increased headcount and the impact of merit increases, higher technology spend attributable to continued investment in our business and higher G&A expense.\nWe are narrowing our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.785 billion to $1.805 billion, which is a $10 million reduction to the top end of the guidance range. As a result, the midpoint of the updated expense guidance range is $5 million lower than our prior guidance, which reflects an annual expense increase of approximately 4.5% for 2023. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the updated guidance range.\nAdditionally, we narrowed our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance range from 24% to 26% to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. We expect to come in at or around the midpoint of this updated range for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 17. Excluding Adenza-related debt, our adjusted total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.4x, down from 2.6x at the end of the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $108 million. And in September, our Board approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to a total of $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains solid,and our cash flow generation is strong, including $1.6 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We remain well positioned to support organic growth, execute on the deleveraging plan we announced with the Adenza acquisition, increase our dividend payout ratio over time and repurchase shares to minimize dilution.\nIn closing today, Nasdaq's third quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to perform consistently well across the wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ann. And before we turn to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Ann Dennison. After 8 years at Nasdaq, Ann will be stepping down from her role as CFO at the end of this year. Ann has been a guiding voice to the market on our financial performance, a leader in enhancing our Investor Relations and ESG reporting efforts and a steward to our company's transformation, most recently through our announced acquisition of Adenza.\nIn conjunction with Ann's upcoming departure from Nasdaq, we're pleased to welcome [ Sarah Youngwood ] as our next EVP and CFO. Sarah will join us from UBS Group where she served as CFO and a Group Executive Board member. Sarah will officially join us on December 1, and we'll work closely with Ann and the team to ensure a seamless transition. I want to thank Ann personally for her many contributions to Nasdaq. She's been a phenomenal partner to me and the company, and we wish her the very best.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to Nasdaq's Second Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to hand the conference over to Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2023 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; Tal Cohen, President; and other members of the management team.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will open up the line to Q&A. The press release, earnings presentation and supplemental information are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.\nI would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and on periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter business and financial performance, the solid progress we're making to deliver on our strategic objectives and how our recently announced acquisition of Adenza advances our vision to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. I'll then turn the call over to Ann to review -- for a review of our financial results.\nI'd like to begin with an update on the strategic transformation underway at Nasdaq. Since 2017, when we sharpened our focus towards becoming a leading technology provider to the global financial system, we've made significant progress on our strategic journey by allocating capital to our biggest growth opportunities and reorienting our businesses to align better with the key megatrends shaping the global economy.\nOver that period, we have focused on our innovation strategy on maximizing the potential of cloud computing and AI across our products and markets, while strategically divesting more than $700 million in noncore assets. We've also delivered consistent execution in our operating business through dynamic operating environment, demonstrating the power of the diversified platform we have built at Nasdaq. That execution strength is reflected in our second quarter performance, which I'll discuss shortly in greater detail.\nBut first, let's spend a few moments on Adenza. When we announced the acquisition of Adenza on June 12, we took a seminal step in our journey to becoming a leading technology provider to the global financial system. That consistent growth throughout Nasdaq's and Adenza's journeys has been our dedication to our clients. As the financial industry faces a steady stream of new regulations and reforms that present reputational and financial risk, we are positioned to be a key partner in helping participants manage those risks.\nMost notably, we will enable our clients to meet regulatory mandates to reduce financial crime, manage liquidity risk and provide resilient capital markets infrastructure, all while reporting on their compliance to over 100 regulators and agencies around the world. The addition of Adenza's capabilities to the Nasdaq platform will increase our serviceable addressable market by approximately 40%.\nWe saw further evidence of the power of the Adenza business and its performance during the first half of 2023. The company has maintained strong annualized recurring revenue, or ARR growth, in the high teens as compared to the prior year period, which was underpinned by continued strength in gross and net revenue retention at 98% and 115%, respectively. As we discussed at our initial investor call post announcement, the fundamental drivers of growth in Adenza's business comes from new client sales, cross-sells and upsells to existing clients.\nConsistent with our strong performance in signing new clients over the last 2 years, which is provided in more detail in the supplemental information that we provided this morning, both Calypso and AxiomSL continued to demonstrate strong growth across new logo wins and client upsells in the first half of 2023, validating our acquisition thesis. Specifically, Calypso signed 7 new clients and completed upsells to 40 existing clients in the first half of the year; while AxiomSL added 7 new logos, 2 of which were cross-sells of Calypso clients, and completed upsells to 25 existing clients during the period.\nThe recent performance of Adenza furthers our conviction that we are working towards acquiring a business that delivers world-leading solutions that meets the growing dynamic regulatory needs of our clients. Upon closing of the Adenza acquisition, our focus will be to maximize the client and shareholder benefits. With our strong combined free cash flows, our capital allocation priorities over the next 3 years are as follows.\nFirst, we will begin to delever to meet the debt-to-EBITDA targets that we disclosed upon deal announcement. Second, we plan to continue to increase our dividends to achieve a 35% to 38% payout ratio over the coming 3 to 4 years. And third, we plan to buy back stock to offset employee and deal-related equity dilution. We do not anticipate making any significant acquisitions that would deter us from executing sizable stock buybacks over the next 3 years.\nWe expect the transaction to close within approximately 5 to 8 months, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions, and we look forward to updating you as we move through the closing and integration process.\nNow turning to the second quarter results. I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's continued solid financial performance in the second quarter of 2023. We achieved $925 million in net revenues, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period and an increase of 4% also on an organic basis, excluding the impact of changes in FX and an acquisition and divestiture. Revenues across our solutions businesses were $674 million, up 6% from the prior year period on a reported and organic basis.\nOur total ARR increased 6.5% to $2.1 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $755 million in the second quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues comprised 36% of total company ARR. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $438 million in total revenue in the second quarter, a 4% increase from the prior year period. Our Index revenues grew 4% organically from the prior year period.\nThe rebound in our Index business reflects strong year-over-year market performance and inflows of $25 million over the past 12 months, including $10 billion in the second quarter, partially offset by lower volumes in the index-related futures products. Revenues within Workflow and Insights grew 5% organically over the prior year period, reflecting sustained demand for IR and ESG solutions and Study Analytics solutions sales to asset managers.\nSimilar to the start of the year, we continue to experience elongated sales cycles in certain products within this business as clients escalate buying decisions through more levels of approval, which has had a modest impact on the year-over-year growth. Overall, across the business, we continue to see opportunities to drive wallet share expansion through cross-sell campaigns to existing clients, especially as uncertainty in the capital markets often leads to increased demand for analytics solutions from asset owners and asset managers, as well as corporate services across Investor Relations and Governance.\nOur Data and Listing Services revenues grew 2% organically. We experienced 5% growth in our data revenues, primarily driven by growth in our recurring data revenues across our international footprint. With a weaker IPO environment, we saw stable listings revenues year-over-year. We maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings. And year-to-date, Nasdaq has welcomed 48 new operating company IPOs for a 77% win rate, including 2 of the top 3 operating company IPOs by proceeds raised.\nIn addition, we have a strong pipeline of companies that are committed to Nasdaq. We remain well positioned to capture future new listing activity, and are in close contact with these companies as they evaluate their IPO time lines. Turning abroad, we welcomed 6 new listings across our European markets, bringing our year-to-date total to 13 new listings. Nasdaq Stockholm continues to be one of the leading European exchanges for small to medium enterprise listings, welcoming 9 new listings in 2023 year-to-date.\nNext, in our Market Platforms division, we delivered $397 million in total revenues during the second quarter, a 2% organic increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by an increase in the Marketplace Technology revenues, which grew 5% compared to the prior year period. In our Trading Services business, revenues were flat organically compared to the prior year, with higher U.S. cash equities revenue offset by lower European equities revenue.\nI would like to highlight the performance of Nasdaq's Closing Cross during the annual Russell U.S. Index's reconstitution, which occurred in late June. For Nasdaq-listed securities, the Closing Cross successfully executed approximately 2.6 billion shares, representing $62 billion in market value in just over 0.8 of 1 second. This represented the second highest volume of shares crossed since we implemented the Closing Cross in 2004. I'm incredibly proud of our continued leadership in operating the industry's most robust and resilient market infrastructure.\nTurning now to 2 strategic portfolio and capital allocation decisions within our Market Platforms business. First, as we previously announced, during the period we entered into an agreement to sell our European Power Trading and Clearing business to the European Energy Exchange.\nThis decision aligns with our renewed focus towards investing in opportunities that will deliver the most value to our clients and shareholders and build on our strong position as a leading market operator of European equities, equity derivatives and fixed income, while also expanding our leadership and providing sustainability solutions with Puro.earth, our voluntary carbon removal marketplace. We expect the closing to take place in the first -- within the first half of 2024, upon completing all outstanding closing conditions. The transfer of membership interest will occur shortly thereafter.\nTurning next to our Digital Assets business. This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the U.S., we've made the decision to halt our launch of the U.S. Digital Assets custodian business and our related efforts to pursue a relevant license. However, we continue to build and deliver technology capabilities that position Nasdaq as the leading digital asset software solutions provider to the broader global industry. This includes advancing our custody solution as a technology platform to serve the broader global digital assets marketplace.\nMore broadly, we remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital asset ecosystem in a variety of ways, among them, through our ongoing engagement with regulators, the delivery of comprehensive technology solutions across the trade life cycle and through our partnerships with potential ETF issuers to support tradable exchange list of products. And we'll discuss the modest financial impact of our decision for the remainder of 2023.\nTurning to the Marketplace Technology business. Revenue grew 5%, reflecting growth in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology. During the quarter, Chile's central securities depository, DCV, announced a significant expansion in its partnership with Nasdaq with plans to leverage our technology to issue and settle digitized securities. The expansion of our existing partnership with DCV highlights the increasing global desire for market infrastructure that can leverage existing security systems to service emerging asset classes.\nAdditionally, we signed a partnership with Brazil's B3 Exchange to deliver a new clearing platform. The multiyear agreement will focus on leveraging our technology to evolve our existing clearing settlement and risk management capabilities to support the rapid growth of the Brazilian market. We also completed deliveries for 7 major market infrastructure projects during the period, including powering the launch of the stock exchange of Thailand's new trading system, which included additional market data distribution and market surveillance systems.\nThis implementation of our next-gen trading technology solution marked a significant milestone in the ongoing development of one of Asia's fastest-growing exchanges and illustrates our ability to bring our modern market infrastructure technology to new partners in the region.\nFinally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $89 million in total revenue for the second quarter, a 19% increase in the prior year period, all of which was organic. We continue to expand client relationships, signing 51 new financial institutions to our fraud and anti-money laundering, or what we call FRAML solutions, including 47 small to medium-sized banks. As we previously announced, we signed 4 large financial institutions in the second quarter, including 2 Tier 1 and 2 Tier 2 clients.\nThe growing adoption of our FRAML solutions across the banking sector is a strong indication that banks of all sizes are prioritizing risk management spend and looking to Nasdaq to provide mission-critical anti-financial crime solutions. Our Surveillance Solutions also continued to perform well with 13% revenue growth this quarter, which was all organic, led by increased subscriptions from both new and existing clients.\nWe added 10 new clients in the second quarter, reflecting strong demand for our trade surveillance and our crypto market surveillance solutions. We had several large clients signed long-term renewals in the first half of the year that included pricing adjustments to reflect the increasing value that our Surveillance Solutions provides to our clients.\nTo wrap up, our second quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq's client-centric culture and diversified business model provides the stability to perform well in different market environments. I would also like to reiterate our excitement around the acquisition of Adenza and the impact we believe it will have for our clients and shareholders. It will accelerate our strategic journey, enabling us to deliver even more mission-critical platforms that enhance the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global financial system. Adenza, combined with our powerful existing solutions, sets us up for faster growth and even greater success in the years to come.\nAnd with that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nSenior VP, Controller & CAO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. Before getting to our second quarter results, I would like to comment on strategic activities across the company. Starting with the divestiture of our Power Trading business in Europe. We do not expect the recently announced sale of the business to have a material impact on our financials, and we plan to include historical results for this business in the corporate and other portion of our financials starting next quarter. Once all open interest is transferred, we expect the sale to reduce annual revenues and expenses by approximately $35 million and $20 million, respectively.\nTurning now to Adenza. We see Adenza continue its strong execution across both new customer wins and cross-selling activity. These new customer wins and expansions concreted to Adenza, achieving year-over-year ARR growth in the high teens with both Calypso and Axiom each delivering solid double-digit ARR growth over the past year. We have provided a supplemental information deck that includes information about Adenza's business and recent performance to help further illustrate Adenza's continued strong momentum.\nAs we embark on our integration planning with the Adenza team, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the $80 million in net cost synergies by the end of year 2 post closing. In order to provide our shareholders transparency into our progress in achieving our Adenza-related expense synergies, we will disclose the onetime costs related to achieving our synergies separately from our existing restructuring program that we announced at the start of 2023 related to our divisional realignment.\nTo finance the Adenza acquisition, we have secured financing for the transaction through a successful bond issuance in June, issuing $4.25 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated debt across 2-, 5-, 10-, 30- and 40-year terms, as well as a EUR 750 million denominated 8-year bond. To enable us to manage our deleveraging plan, we expect to fund the remainder of the cash component of the transaction with a $600 million term loan that we plan to issue just prior to closing, as well as commercial paper. The estimated weighted average cost of this debt is just under 5.5%.\nTo minimize the carrying cost of the debt prior to closing, we are investing the proceeds of the bond issuances in highly liquid and low-risk investments, and we expect the net carry to be less than 50 basis points at current market rates, which will be excluded from our non-GAAP results.\nWith regards to our capital allocation priorities moving forward, as we work to integrate Adenza and optimize our business to achieve the full benefits of the acquisition after the closing, we will be focused on using our free cash flow to generate return for our shareholders. Specifically, looking back to 2022, Nasdaq generated approximately $1.45 billion in operating free cash flow. In 2022, Nasdaq returned approximately $380 million in dividends which was 26% of free cash flow, and we expended approximately $230 million to offset employee-related dilution. That left us with over $800 million in free cash flow to use for other strategic and investor return activities.\nWith the addition of the shares that will be issued to acquire Adenza, if all else stays the same, our dividend payment at the current payout of $0.22 per share will increase to approximately $510 million annually. We have also stated our plans to increase the dividend to achieve a 35% to 38% payout ratio over the next 3 or 4 years, which implies an approximately 10% CAGR in the dividend payout ratio over the period.\nWe expect Adenza to generate approximately $300 million in unlevered pretax cash flow in 2023. We expect the debt financing for our planned acquisition of Adenza to result in annual interest payments of approximately $325 million, which is more than Adenza's current free cash flow. However, as Adenza grows and as we pay down debt, we expect incremental free cash flow from the addition of Adenza to fund incremental debt repayment and share buyback.\nBased on the 2022 results, combined with the full year 2023 estimates for Adenza, we would have approximately $700 million in excess annual free cash flow beyond our dividend and employee-related buybacks. And we expect that amount to grow commensurately with our earnings growth over the next 3 years. With the remainder of the free cash flows over the next 3 years, our priority is to delever and bring our leverage ratio to 4.0x within 18 months and 3.3x within 3 years.\nAchieving our ratios reflect the combination of business growth that drives increases in EBITDA as well as debt paydown. Therefore, we will not provide a specific paydown schedule. However, based on our debt maturity profile and the nature of our debt, we will have the flexibility to pay down approximately $2 million between now and year-end 2026 without any prepayment penalties or other restrictions.\nWhile we don't anticipate needing that full amount to support our path to 3.3x, we want to have the flexibility to accelerate and/or exceed our paydown expectations if we believe it is the best use of capital to drive shareholder returns. We will also execute share buybacks to help offset the acquisition-related share issuance and support EPS accretion. After our debt paydown, we will focus on using the vast majority of our remaining free cash flow to execute share buybacks.\nOur focus over the coming years will be to maximize the client and shareholder benefit we received from the Adenza acquisition. Therefore, as Adena mentioned earlier, we do not anticipate making any significant acquisition-related capital allocation decisions that would deter us from sizable stock buybacks over the coming years.\nTurning to the quarter's results. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will start by reviewing second quarter 2023 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 4% increase in reported net revenue of $925 million is the net result of organic growth of 4%, including a 6% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and stable Trading Services revenue and $4 million of net negative impact from changes in FX rates and an acquisition and divestiture.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was down approximately 140 basis points from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $350 million or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to $342 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of 6.5% from the prior year period; while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $755 million, an increase of 11%. We are delivering solid performance despite low IPO volumes and elongated sales cycles in certain areas of the Capital Access Platforms division, which had a modest impact on the rate of ARR and SaaS growth this quarter. We are well positioned to deliver improving revenue growth as sales cycles normalize and capital market activity increases.\nI will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15. Starting with the Market Platforms division, revenues increased $5 million or 1%, with an organic increase of 2%. Trading Services organic revenue was flat, with higher U.S. revenues driven by strong U.S. equity capture and continued options volumes, offset by lower trading revenues -- European trading revenue due to lower volumes despite better share.\nIn Marketplace Technology, we delivered 5% revenue growth driven by strong results in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology. As a reminder, Trade Management Services revenue growth in the first half of the year benefited from testing revenue that we do not expect to recur in the second half of the year. Additionally, we will face tougher comps in the back half of the year as we cycle through strong revenue growth we had in 3Q and 4Q last year. And therefore, we continue to expect full year revenue growth for Marketplace Technology to be at the upper end of our medium-term outlook.\nARR totaled $516 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 53% in the second quarter of 2023 reflects a 200 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to lower revenue resulting from lower European trading activity, with ongoing investments related to migrating U.S. markets to the cloud and investments in new growth opportunities in marketplace technology.\nCapital Access Platforms revenues increased $16 million or 4%, with organic revenue growth of $15 million, excluding $1 million related to an acquisition. Growth in the division was broad-based for the quarter. Specifically, Index revenue returned to growth, delivering a 4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 9% increase in average AUM over the last year. Licensing revenues for future contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index declined 9%, reflecting a 28% decline in trading volumes, which was partially offset by higher pricing per contract.\nSecond quarter revenues also benefited from improving futures revenue share related to meeting certain contractual milestones in the quarter. Additionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $25 billion, including $10 million in the quarter. In Data, revenue grew by 5% due to continued strong demand from enterprise and international customer strategies, with growth in recurring data sales driving solid revenue growth.\nListings revenue was flat year-over-year due to continued weak IPO environment, coupled with slightly elevated delistings, including SPAC. Workflow & Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting growth across our ESG IR and Analytics businesses despite ongoing elongated sales cycles among corporates and asset owners affecting revenue growth in the second quarter.\nARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period. which reflected a significant slowdown in new listings and the impact of continuing elongated sales cycles. The division operating margin was 55% in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 200 basis points from the prior year period.\nAnti-Financial Crime revenue increased $14 million or 19% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Organic growth was 19% in the period. The growth reflects robust demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as our SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Specifically, our Fraud Detection and AML solutions revenues grew 23% compared to the second quarter of '22. Surveillance revenues grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2022, with solid growth in subscription revenues from new and existing customers, partially offset by softer professional fees.\nARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $339 million, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced, totaled $365 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 36% in the second quarter of 2023 versus 27% in the prior year period, with approximately 1/2 of the margin growth resulting from a benefit in our expenses due to a onetime adjustment to the incentive compensation program.\nTurning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $28 million to $441 million. The increase primarily reflected a $34 million organic increase or 8%, partially offset by a $6 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense reflecting higher headcount and technology spend as we continue making growth investments across the platform.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2023, expenses increased due to the timing of our annual merit adjustments and equity grants. However, this sequential increase was less than we expected due to the previously mentioned onetime adjustment to the ASC incentive compensation program as well as lower-than-expected hiring and client incentive marketing spend.\nWe are narrowing our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance by $30 million to a range of $1.785 billion to $1.815 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range now represents an annual expense increase of just below 5% for 2023. The decrease in our expense growth expectations primarily reflects the impact of our decision related to the redesign of our digital audits offering as well as the adjustment to the ASC incentive compensation program.\nAssuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the updated guidance range. Additionally, due to the timing of expected expenses, we expect a greater sequential increase in expenses in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 26%.\nTurning to Slide 17. Excluding Adenza-related debt, our adjusted total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6x, consistent with the first quarter of 2023, and there are no long-term debt maturities until 2026. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, including $1.5 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, we continue to be well positioned to support growth in a variety of macroeconomic backdrop.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $109 million. As of June 30, 2023, there was an aggregate $491 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program.\nIn closing, today, Nasdaq's second quarter results reflect the continuation of the company's ability to perform consistently well across a wide range of operating environments.\nThank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to the Nasdaq First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to hand the conference over to Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAto Garrett\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2023 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up the line to Q&A.\nThe press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.\nI would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nActual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and in periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I start, I would like to welcome Ato Garrett to the Nasdaq team as our new Investor Relations Officer. I know he's looking forward to meeting each of you very soon.\nI will now turn to my remarks today, which will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter performance and the solid progress we're making to deliver on our strategic objectives. I will then turn the call over to Ann for a review of our financial results.\nLet's begin with the current market landscape. Nasdaq continued to perform well, what was clearly a very dynamic operating environment with a shock to the banking sector happening amid an already uncertain macro backdrop. During this challenging period, we delivered solid financial performance while demonstrating operating and strategic momentum across each of our divisions.\nWe achieved a new milestone for our Anti-Financial Crime division with the signing in April of our first Tier 1 client with over $1 trillion in assets for our fraud solutions, including the comprehensive fraud detection capabilities across wires, ACH and checks as well as case management and reporting functionality.\nWe maintained our leading position in U.S. cash equities and equity derivatives trading while seeing strong demand for both our ESG services and our SaaS-based market technology solutions. Overall, the current uncertain financial backdrop highlights the value of our diverse platform of mission-critical solutions.\nIn the first quarter, we also saw a generational technology breakthrough with the emergence of new artificial intelligence tools called generative AI. While the debate surrounding use cases for generative AI needs time to evolve, it is clear to us that companies that have invested in modern technologies, including cloud architecture and deployments, modern APIs, and machine learning are poised to take advantage of this new era of technological advancement.\nAt Nasdaq, we've been focused on investments to modernize our technology across our businesses, and therefore, we're well positioned to incorporate more advanced AI capabilities in the future. Against this evolving economic and technological backdrop, our team remained hyper-focused on delivering for our clients. Our results underscore our ability to navigate successfully amid a dynamic market environment and to deliver on our long-term commitment to provide world-leading platforms that improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy.\nNow let's turn to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. We achieved $914 million in net revenues, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and an increase of 4% on an organic basis, excluding the impacts of changes in FX and an acquisition divestiture.\nRevenues across our Solutions businesses were $646 million, up 4% from the prior year period, driven by organic growth of 5%, partially offset by the impact of changes in FX. Excluding the Index business, which declined by 10% due to a continued weak beta backdrop, revenues in our Solutions businesses increased 8% organically compared to the prior year period.\nOur total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 7% to $2 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $729 million for the first quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues now comprise 36% of total company ARR.\nAcross each of our divisions, we delivered well for our clients during the quarter. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $416 million in total revenue in the first quarter. Despite growth in data as well as in workflow and insights, headwinds across our Listings and Index businesses resulted in flat organic revenue for Capital Access Platforms year-over-year.\nIndex experienced a 10% revenue decline and Listings was stable year-over-year. While our Index business continues to show year-over-year decline due to higher market levels at the start of last year, during the first quarter, we did experience a 5% improvement in average AUM from the fourth quarter of 2022. If the markets continue to demonstrate some level of recovery from last year, we should experience an improving year-over-year index performance as we continue through 2023.\nData and listing Services revenues grew 4% organically, driven largely by higher international demand for our proprietary data during the period. Our Workflow and Insights business revenue grew 5% organically, which reflects continued demand for our IR, ESG and Analytics solutions as clients navigate a dynamic and challenging market environment.\nTurning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $413 million in total revenues during the first quarter, a 6% organic increase from prior year period. Amid a volatile capital markets environment our core trading services business experienced strong performance in North American markets where we saw double-digit revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in our European markets revenues, primarily reflecting lower value traded and cash equities due to market declines in a softer volume environment.\nIn the U.S., we continue to provide our clients with the premier trading experience, while optimizing the revenue and capture mix for both U.S. cash equities and multiply listed equity options.\nIn Marketplace Technology, we delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by strong results in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology. During the quarter, we signed a Marketplace Services platform agreement with an innovative carbon trading platform in -- sorry, carbon trading marketplace in Latin America as well as a new European risk modeling customer. We also signed a multiyear extension and expansion with a Tier 1 bank for our trading platform.\nFinally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $84 million in total revenue in the first quarter, an 18% organic increase from the prior year period and a 16% increase, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down in the first quarter of 2022.\nRevenues in our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions or what we call our FRAML solutions, grew 30% compared to the first quarter of 2022 or 27% excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. The overall anti-financial crime business saw continued growth with 42 new AFC clients during the period.\nOur first quarter financial performance also illustrates the progress we've made to capitalize on certain growth opportunities that are aligned with 3 key trends that we believe are shaping the financial system. First, the modernization of markets where we can deliver innovation that powers the world's economies and enhances the underlying market infrastructure.\nSecond, the development of the ESG ecosystem, where we help companies and investors successfully navigate increasingly complex reporting frameworks, access more seamless routes to capital and achieve their net zero or sustainability objectives.\nAnd third, the increasing need for advanced Anti Financial Crime Technology, where we can enhance the integrity of the financial system through emerging technologies, including cloud and AI, coupled with end-to-end workflow solutions for our clients. In this regard, I'd like to provide 2 highlights for the quarter.\nFirst, our focus on markets modernization continues to deliver innovation that enhances the liquidity and the underlying market infrastructure that powers the world's economies. From the successful migration of Nasdaq MRX, which is 1 of our 6 options markets to the cloud infrastructure in the fourth quarter of last year in partnership with AWS, we announced during the first quarter our plans to migrate our second options market to the AWS Edge Cloud by the end of 2023.\nSecond, as financial institutions make investments in technologies to detect and fight financial crime, in early April, we are very pleased to sign our first global Tier 1 client with over $1 trillion in assets to our fraud solution, including comprehensive fraud detection capabilities across wires, ACH and checks as well as case management and regulatory reporting functionality.\nAdditionally, we signed another Tier 2 client to our enterprise anti-money laundering solution during the period. These signings further demonstrate our ability to displace legacy providers and manual processes through our cloud-based and market-proven solutions.\nAs we look ahead, I want to take a moment here to discuss in more detail the breakthrough developments in the field of artificial intelligence, which have captivated businesses across all industries concerning its applicability and impact. As a result of our years of investment in our cloud architected market solutions and SaaS applications, coupled with our recent acquisitions of advanced cloud-based investment Analytics and Anti Financial Crime solutions, I believe Nasdaq is uniquely positioned within our sector to play a leading role with this technology in the future through the responsible deployment of AI to drive meaningful impact to our business, products and clients.\nTo date, we've been very intentional in migrating critical workloads and capabilities into a cloud environment with modern APIs to support client connectivity and functionality. We've also built unique data sets across various areas of our business. Both are foundational to our ability to leverage this generational shift in the technology. While we're just beginning the process of evaluating specific ideas for the use of generative AI in our products and across our business operations, we see compelling opportunities to lever broader AI models, including deep reinforcement learning, predictive control and computer vision across our business divisions to support our strategic efforts to enhance the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the financial ecosystem.\nThis is already happening in various elements of our business today. For example, in our Anti Financial Crime business, Verafin has integrated AI and machine learning into their solutions and capabilities since their founding 20 years ago. The combination of the advanced data sets combined with the self-learning capabilities of the AI and machine learning model is a key differentiator for the product. This improves the efficiency in the banking industry's daily compliance processes and achieved a step change in their ability to detect and stop money laundering, fraud and market abuse across their networks as well as to reduce false positives.\nIn our Market Platforms division, we're in advanced stages of new product developments that incorporate AI, including new dynamic order types that improve our clients' fill rates while minimizing market impact. In fact, we've submitted for regulatory approval, our first AI-based market order or market order type, which is context-aware, meaning that it is designed to incorporate awareness of market conditions on a real-time basis.\nAs we seek out more ways to leverage AI across other parts of our business, we intend to take a principled approach to leveraging generative AI for the right purpose. Our data scientists and agile development teams will continue their research and development responsibly, so that our regulated and unregulated businesses can deploy this technology to create and maintain fairness across markets and develop more advanced solutions to fight crime.\nWe look forward to updating you on our progress with these opportunities in the quarters to come as we continue our journey to become the trusted fabric of the global financial system.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ann, I'd like to offer some final comments on the operating environment as we move further into 2023. When we gathered in January for our fourth quarter results call, we discussed some of the impacts and market-driven headwinds that we are beginning to see related to the market environment and the uncertainty in the global economy. As we progressed through the first quarter, as we expected, we saw a decrease in the total number of operating company IPOs versus the prior year period, as companies put their IPO plans on pause while investors closely monitored interest rates and correlated inflation figures.\nDespite the slower start to the year, we maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings across our U.S. and European markets in the first quarter. In the U.S., we welcomed 30 new operating company IPOs during the period for a 91% win rate, bringing 7 of the top 10 IPOs by proceeds raised.\nIn addition, there's a significant backlog of operating companies in the pipeline with 147 active operating companies on file with the SEC to go public and committed to Nasdaq, which is a 10% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and a 25% increase versus the prior year period. Our team continues to be in close contact with these companies, and we believe that we are well positioned to capture future listing activity once the IPO window reopens.\nBeyond listings, we're still seeing elongated sales cycles in our Workflow and Insights businesses. As we previously observed, while overall interest in client demand for our Workflow and Insight solutions remains healthy, the process for some clients is taking longer as they escalate buying decisions through more levels of approval.\nDemand for our strategic focus areas, including our Anti Financial Crime Solutions, our ESG, solutions for corporates, and our modern market solutions for established exchanges continues to be strong and largely unaffected by the market environment at this stage.\nOverall, we're very fortunate to have deep and trusted relationships with our clients, who rely on us even more during complex operating environments. For example, during periods of heightened volatility, pensions and endowments often need to make swift asset allocation decisions to manage their portfolios which can increase their reliance on our Analytics solutions.\nSimilarly, for our public company clients, these cycles can drive demand for our Investor Relations solutions as company leaders seek shareholder activity insights in real-time. As the global markets demonstrate sustained volatility, our market technology clients are focused on modernizing their market infrastructure to improve their agility and addressing client needs while improving -- also improving the resiliency and scalability of their markets.\nAnd within our Anti-Financial Crime business, the disruption caused by the banking crisis has caused -- has resulted in clients moving deposits at unprecedented rates. Because of our cloud-based consortium data models, our fraud and AML solutions are instrumental in helping banks monitor payments and behavioral changes. These patterns underscore how our diverse pattern -- our diverse platform of mission-critical solutions allows us to maintain our competitive strength through dynamic periods of uncertainty like we've experienced during the quarter.\nWith our continued client engagement, coupled with the long-term investments we're making in our future, we remain confident in our medium-term revenue growth outlook for our Solutions businesses.\nAnd with that, I will now turn it over -- turn the call over to Ann to review the financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nSenior VP, Controller & CAO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. I also want to extend a warm welcome to Ato Garrett as Nasdaq's Investor Relations Officer.\nMy commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will start by reviewing first quarter 2023 performance beginning on Slide 10 of the presentation. The 2% increase in reported net revenue of $914 million is the net result of organic growth of 4%, including a 5% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and a 3% organic increase in Trading Services, partially offset by a 2% net negative impact from changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 3%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was unchanged from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $339 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $329 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 11. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $729 million, an increase of 11%.\nI will now review quarterly division results on Slides 12 through 14. Starting with Market Platforms -- the Market Platforms division. Revenues increased $[ 17 ] million or 4%, with an organic increase of 6%. Trading Services organics growth totaled 3%, with the increase primarily due to higher U.S. cash equity capture rate and higher U.S. equity derivatives volumes and capture rates, partially offset by lower European cash equities revenues due to lower industry volumes and market share and lower U.S. tape plan revenues due to lower collections from underreported usage.\nIn Marketplace Technology, we delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by strong results in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology, which benefited from testing revenue and a large project delivery during the quarter. ARR totaled $510 million, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 55% in the first quarter 2023 reflects a 1 percentage point increase from the prior year period.\nCapital Access Platforms revenues decreased $3 million or 1%, primarily due to the negative impact from changes in FX rates with organic revenue growth of $1 million. Growth in the division was mixed for the quarter with a decline in index revenue significantly impacting the overall growth of the division.\nSpecifically, index revenue declined by 10% compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by an 11% decline in average AUM from near record levels last year. Transactional licensing revenues were flat as a 20% decline in trading volumes in futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index was offset by higher pricing per contract and favorable mix.\nAdditionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $23 billion.\nIn Listings, we maintained our leadership position with a 91% IPO win rate for U.S. operating companies. The Nasdaq stock market welcomed 7 of the 10 largest U.S. operating company IPOs by capital raise in the first quarter of 2023, including NEXTracker, which raised over $600 million in proceeds as well as the spin-switch of GE Healthcare.\nIn data, we have seen an increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the first quarter of 2022, reflecting growth in our ESG, IR and Analytics businesses.\nARR for Capital Access platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin was 54% in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1 percentage point from the prior year period.\nAnti-Financial Crime revenue increased $12 million or 17% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Organic growth was 18% in the period or 16% when excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down of $1 million in the prior year period. The growth reflects healthy demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as our SaaS-based surveillance solutions.\nSpecifically, our fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 27% compared to the first quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. Surveillance revenues grew modestly compared to the first quarter of 2022 as growth in subscription revenues was partially offset by lower professional fees. ARR for Anti Financial Crime totaled $321 million, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year period.\nSigned ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced, totaled $354 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year period. The Anti Financial Crime division operating margin was 27% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 21% in the prior year period.\nTurning to Page 15 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $8 million to $436 million. The increase primarily reflects a $20 million organic increase, partially offset by a $13 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense and computer operations and data expense as we invest in our businesses.\nThe higher compensation largely reflects our 2022 investment in new employees to drive long-term growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, which featured higher sales activity to finish the year, expenses declined primarily due to lower marketing, travel and professional services expense.\nDuring the quarter, we completed the first phase of a review of our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We reduced our footprint and recorded an impairment charge of $17 million related to our lease assets and related leasehold improvements.\nWe are updating our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.78 billion to $1.84 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range is unchanged and still represents an increase of just over 5%, including 1% related to our digital asset strategy. The increase primarily reflects our continued investments to drive growth across ESG, Anti Financial Crime and market modernization.\nThe second quarter will reflect our annual merit adjustments and equity grants and therefore, we expect expenses to increase about $20 million from the first quarter of 2023. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the guidance range.\nTurning to Slide 16. Debt decreased by $290 million versus 4Q '22 primarily due to a net paydown of $317 million of commercial paper, partially offset by a $26 million increase in Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6x down from 2.7x in the fourth quarter of 2022, and there are no long-term debt maturities until 2026.\nWith our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, including $1.5 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, we continue to be well positioned to support growth in a variety of macroeconomic backdrops.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million and repurchased shares for $159 million. The repurchases complete our objective to offset employee share dilution for the year. As of March 31, 2023, there was an aggregate $491 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program.\nAdditionally, we are announcing today a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share. In closing today, Nasdaq's first quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to the Nasdaq Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Neil Stratton, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNeil Stratton\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team.\nAfter prepared remarks, we will open the line up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.\nI would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nCEO & Chairman, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial and business performance, the progress we have made to advance Nasdaq along our strategic journey and our enterprise-wide ambitions and priorities for 2023 and beyond. I will also provide comments on the current market and regulatory environment before turning the call over to Ann for a deeper look at our financial results.\nWe continued to deliver solid growth in 2022, even in an -- with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and following a very strong 2021. 2022 was also a year of milestones, strategic firsts and market-leading innovation for Nasdaq. I'm proud of the Nasdaq team and the resiliency of our business as well as the trusted relationships we have with our clients.\nBefore I turn to our financial performance, I want to remind everyone about our new corporate structure that we implemented during the fourth quarter. When we gathered at our Investor Day in November, we noted how the alignment of our business across 3 new divisions: Market Platforms, Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime, allows us to capitalize on mega trends shaping the financial system to unlock new growth opportunities for our company.\nThese trends include: The modernization of markets, where we continue to deliver innovation that powers the world's economies and enhances the underlying infrastructure; the development of the ESG ecosystem, where we help companies and investors successfully navigate increasingly complex reporting frameworks, access more seamless routes to capital and achieve their net zero or sustainability objectives; and the increasing need for anti -- advanced anti-financial crime technology, where we can enhance the integrity of the financial system through emerging technologies, including cloud and AI.\nOur financial results today reflect the new divisional alignment, and we look forward to continuing our journey as we deliver world-leading platforms that improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy, with our long-term goal of becoming the trusted fabric of the global financial system.\nNow let's turn to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022.\nFirst, regarding the fourth quarter. Nasdaq achieved $906 million in net revenues, a 2% increase compared to the prior year period and a 5% increase on an organic basis, excluding the impacts of changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. In the quarter, we delivered 5% organic growth across our Solutions businesses, even with an 11% drop in our Index revenues. We also delivered 4% organic growth in our Trading Services business in the fourth quarter on top of a very strong trading performance in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFor the full year of 2022, net revenues of $3.58 billion increased 5% from 2021 and 7% on an organic basis. Our Solutions businesses generated 10% annual organic revenue growth despite a fast-changing market environment, and our Trading Services revenues increased 1% on the back of very strong performance in 2021.\nOur annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Annualized SaaS revenues increased 13% to $725 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing 36% of total company ARR.\nFor the full year, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.66 increased 6% from 2021. Our strong performance in 2022 against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop illustrates the strength of our diversified business and our ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives.\nNext, I'm going to turn to specific divisional highlights, which reflect the new corporate structure, focusing mainly on the fourth quarter results. In our Capital Access Platforms business -- division, we delivered $420 million in total revenue in the fourth quarter, a 2% increase in organic growth. Revenue in our Data and Listing Services business increased by 3% from the prior year period and 6% organic growth, primarily due to an increase in annual listing fees and growth in proprietary data revenues driven by higher international demand, partially offset by a decrease in initial listing fee revenues.\nIn 2022, Nasdaq maintained its position as the leading U.S. exchange for IPOs for the tenth consecutive year with 87 operating company listings for a 92% annual win rate. In Europe, our Baltic, Nordic and First North exchanges, combined, welcomed 63 new listings in 2022, including 38 IPOs. For the second consecutive year, Nasdaq Stockholm remains the most successful listing venue in Europe.\nIn our Index business, we saw revenue decrease by 11% versus the prior year period, primarily due to lower average AUM and exchange-traded products linked to Nasdaq indices, partially offset by higher revenues related to futures trading linked to the NASDAQ 100 Index.\nYear-over-year average AUM for the fourth quarter declined by 19%. The fourth quarter presented a particularly challenging market backdrop on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Ann will provide more details on the AUM and trading dynamics that drove the fourth quarter revenue decline.\nFocusing on the full year performance. Our Index revenues for the full year of 2022 increased 6% versus 2021 due to higher net inflows and futures volumes. Net inflows into exchange-traded products totaled $34 billion in 2022, and we saw demand grow for our new offerings, with 44 ETPs tracking Nasdaq indexes, accumulating $3.5 billion in AUM during the year. In our Workflow and Insights business, which include our Corporate Solutions as well as our Investment Analytics business, our fourth quarter revenues increased 8% from the prior year period or 10% organically, reflecting deepened client engagement and strong client retention.\nTurning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $403 million in total revenues in the fourth quarter, a 3% increase from the prior year period or 5% organic growth.\nOur Trading Services business, which includes our transactional and U.S. tape plan data businesses, delivered combined total revenue of $253 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% organically from the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher U.S. equity derivatives trading revenues, reflecting higher revenue capture versus the prior year period and higher industry volumes.\nCash equities trading revenues were lower year-over-year, primarily driven by lower European cash equities revenue, partially offset by modest growth in the U.S. cash equities business.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we were incredibly pleased to announce the migration of Nasdaq MRX, 1 of our 6 U.S. options exchanges, to the cloud in partnership with Amazon Web Services. The new cloud-enabled system delivers -- continues to deliver ultra resiliency to our market participants while improving latency performance by 10%. As the first exchange to put a major market in the cloud, this marks a significant milestone in our journey to build the next-generation technology infrastructure for the world's capital markets.\nThis success has also reinforced our credibility with our technology clients. As illustrated by Bolsa Electronica de Chile's agreement earlier this month to migrate their current on-premise Nasdaq trading technology to our cloud-based marketplace services platform. We are thrilled that BEC has chosen us to help manage this next phase of their cloud journey.\nAnd lastly, in our Marketplace Technology business, we delivered $150 million in revenues during the fourth quarter, a 5% increase versus the prior year period. Growth in revenue was primarily due to increased demand for connectivity driving a record year for our trade management services business as well as higher SaaS-based Market Technology revenues.\nOrder intake in our Market Technology business totaled $106 million for the quarter and $264 million for the full year, which compares to a record of $304 million in 2021. We had strong order intake across both existing and new clients, with over 90% of our new clients signing up for SaaS solutions, an encouraging indicator of growth returning to the technology business post-pandemic. We signed 12 new technology clients and completed 5 implementations in our Market Technology business in 2022. We continue to make good progress with our post-trade implementations, taking 2 of our largest clients into live operation during the year.\nOver the past 18 months, we've seen increased demand for our technology solutions, with many current and new client conversations focused on market modernization initiatives encompassing both cloud delivery and SaaS.\nBefore I conclude my remarks regarding our Market Platforms division, I want to offer brief comments here on the SEC's equity market structure proposals which the commission published in December of 2022. We're encouraged that the proposals addressed many of our recommendations from a paper that we published last year on optimizing markets.\nWhile we believe that the equity markets work well now, we acknowledge that there are always opportunities for improvements. Accordingly, we support the SEC's efforts to modernize and enhance equity market structure to improve trading efficiency, bolster competition, increase market transparency, strengthen best -- obligations and ultimately achieve better outcomes for investors.\nIn proposing to introduce significant changes to markets that are already highly complex and interconnected, we think it is critical for the commission to strive to avoid unintended consequences by proceeding incrementally, methodically and collaboratively. There are also a few areas where we differ with the SEC's approach, and we plan to recommend improvements, modifications and/or alternatives during the comment period.\nFinally turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $82 million in total revenue during the fourth quarter, a 21% organic increase from the prior year period and 14% when adjusting for the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. The revenue increase was driven by strong demand for our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions, or what we call our FRAML solutions, in addition to modest growth in our surveillance solutions.\nRegarding our FRAML solutions specifically. Revenue grew 23% when adjusting for the impact of deferred revenue in the prior year period. The business saw continued growth in new clients across small to medium banks with 98 new SMB clients signed during the quarter.\nIn addition, the business signed its first 2 clients to its crypto anti-financial crime platform in 2022. This is an exciting offering that allows crypto companies to identify crime, ensure regulatory compliance and prevent losses.\nWe also continue to see momentum following several proofs of concepts with a number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, including signing a Tier 2 bank for our enterprise fraud solution during the fourth quarter. Feedback on the proof-of-concept results has been very positive, and we anticipate signing additional clients in 2023.\nI want to take a moment here to acknowledge a leadership appointment that took place this month in our Anti-Financial Crime division. Brendan Brothers, a co-founder of Verafin and the division's Head of Strategy, has been appointed interim Head of our AFC division. He succeeds Jamie King, who's retiring from Nasdaq. We're grateful for Jamie's tremendous contributions to Verafin, and we wish him very well in his next chapter. And we're excited to have Brendan step in to his role as we continue to execute against our AFC road map.\nAs I mentioned at the start of my remarks today, Nasdaq has made notable progress against our broader strategic journey. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2023 and beyond.\nFirst, we will strive to realize the benefits of our new divisional alignments. We aim to unlock the growth opportunities that our new structure provides us. We intend to deliver an enhanced client experience by delivering more unified solutions through a One Nasdaq approach to our clients. We will have a focused capital allocation strategy across our 3 divisions, and we will increase our go-to-market agility by integrating related software development and marketing talent into each division, which would facilitate streamlined decision-making.\nSecond, we want to remain positioned for success amid a dynamic market environment. With macroeconomic uncertainty likely to persist as we continue into 2023, we want to demonstrate the value of our mission-critical solutions in an environment where businesses know that they need to keep investing but are increasingly focused on quick time to value and strong return on invested capital.\nAnd third, we want to continue advancing our long-term cloud and AI strategy across the Nasdaq franchise by optimizing our agile development and leveraging machine intelligence across our solutions to unlock more opportunities to deliver innovation to our clients.\nWithin Market Platforms, as we deploy our new data-centric system architecture, combined with the scalability and the analytics engines that are offered through the cloud infrastructure, we believe we'll be able to develop new AI-based order types and we'll offer more advanced capabilities to our market participants connected into our ecosystem. These capabilities will also become available to our exchange technology clients as we work collaboratively with them to deploy cloud-based market infrastructures in their home markets.\nBeyond Market Platforms, we're already well positioned with our cloud-based SaaS solutions across many of our solutions businesses, and we're on our journey to bring more of our solutions into the cloud. In 2023, we're currently migrating our clients onto our next-gen cloud-based governance platform and trade surveillance platform.\nAs our Anti-Financial Crime solutions demonstrate, having a cloud-based data lake unlocks enormous potential in applying advanced AI algorithms and self-reinforcement learning engines to our solutions. And with new step-function improvements in AI that are coming to market, we're extremely excited to apply those technologies to more of our solutions in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities in the quarters to come.\nBefore I wrap up, I would like to address the current market environment. Uncertainty still lingers across the global economy and market-driven headwinds. And if they persist throughout the year, that could impact our near-term growth outlook across listings and index in 2023.\nWe are also seeing a modest elongation of sales cycles for certain of our solutions, notably our IR solutions and our asset owner solutions, which is part of our Analytics business. We are viewed by our IR and asset owner clients as a trusted partner to help them manage through the challenges that the markets have presented, but we are finding, particularly in more hard hit sectors, that clients are going through more internal gates to approve investments in IR and portfolio management solutions.\nMore generally, across our broader Nasdaq platform, client demand remains strong. Despite the macro uncertainty, we believe 2023 will be marked by how well businesses continue to adapt to the digital transformation of the economy through investments in technology. Nasdaq benefits from that digital transformation given our range of technology and analytics solutions.\nBuilding on our foundation of solid client retention, competitive success and deepened engagement with clients, we have confidence that our clients' investments in technology and cloud-based SaaS solutions will continue to be a priority. Therefore, we maintain our conviction in the investments we're making to deliver modern world-class solutions to our clients.\nWe have a very resilient and diversified value proposition and are well prepared to guide our clients and our company through this dynamic environment. We are entering the year with a continued focus on achieving our revenue growth outlook over the medium term as we navigate a complex 2023, and we remain confident that our longer-term investments across market modernization, ESG solutions and anti-financial crime technology will create value for our clients and shareholders alike.\nAs I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a very successful 2022 for our company. Looking ahead in 2023, we enter the year focused on realizing the benefits of our new corporate structure to amplify growth across our key pillars of liquidity, transparency and integrity as we look to advance towards our goal of becoming the trusted fabric of the global financial system.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review the financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in the file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nAs a reminder, on Slide 4, our financial reporting reflects the new corporate structure that we announced last quarter. Additionally, in order to better align our financial reporting with our internal management structure, we also recast the U.S. cash equity and options tape plan revenues into the Trading Services business within Market Platforms division from the Data and Listing Services business within the Capital Access Platforms division. Investors can review an updated supplement on the IR website with historical time periods reflecting this change.\nI will start by reviewing fourth quarter 2022 performance, beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 2% increase in reported net revenue of $906 million is the net result of organic growth of 5%, including a 5% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and a 4% organic increase in Trading Services, partially offset by a 3% negative impact from changes in FX rates and the net impact of an acquisition and divestitures.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income decreased 1% while the non-GAAP operating margin of 49% was down from 51% in the prior year period. For the full year 2022, the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 52%, a decrease of 1 percentage point from 2021. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $317 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to $328 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $725 million, an increase of 13%.\nI will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15, starting with the Market Platforms division. Revenues increased $10 million or 3%. The organic increase was 5%, and there was a 2% negative impact from changes in FX rates.\nTrading Services organic growth totaled 4%, with the increase primarily due to higher U.S. equity derivatives and U.S. cash equity revenues due to higher capture and higher industry volumes, partially offset by lower European cash equity revenues due to lower industry volumes.\nWithin Marketplace Technology, we had strong performance in our Trade Management Services business and delivered another quarter of organic growth in the Market Technology business, driven by higher SaaS revenues and strong order intake during the period. This builds on the positive organic revenue growth in the third quarter of 2022, which is a further encouraging proof point that the programs and initiatives implemented by the leadership team are moving the business forward.\nARR totaled $503 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 52% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 54% in the full year of 2022 both decreased 2 percentage points from the prior year period. The change primarily reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses, including our digital asset strategy.\nCapital Access Platform revenues were unchanged, reflecting organic revenue growth of $7 million or 2% as well as a 2% negative impact of changes in FX rates. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects positive contributions from the Workflow and Insights and Data and Listing Services businesses, partially offset by an organic decline in Index revenues.\nSpending a moment on Index. Overall Index revenue declined by 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. When examining the key drivers of the financial performance, our asset-based licensing revenues declined 21% compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a 25% increase in futures-related revenues linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index. Average AUM during the period, which is used to calculate our asset-based revenues each quarter, decreased 19% from the prior year period, and trading volumes in futures linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased 21% from the prior year quarter. To assist analysts and investors going forward, we are updating our public disclosures to provide average AUM each quarter in addition to the end of the period, which will be -- which will better align our key disclosures with our key revenue drivers for the business.\nOne additional note looking forward to the first quarter of 2023. Trading activity of instruments linked to our indexes achieved certain annual thresholds during the second quarter of '22 that resulted in an increase in licensing economics during the remainder of the year. As we begin 2023, the economics of certain agreements reset for the new year. We estimate that this will lead to approximately $9 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, assuming similar trading activity and product mix in the 2 periods.\nARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.19 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 50% in the fourth quarter decreased -- the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased 3 percentage points from the prior year period. The operating margin for the full year 2022 was 54.4%, up 60 basis points from 53.8% in 2021.\nAnti-Financial Crime revenue increased $14 million or 21%, with $4 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in 4Q '21. Organic growth was 21% in the period or 14% when excluding the impact of deferred revenue, reflecting healthy demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 23% compared to 4Q '21, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down.\nARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $312 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced, totaled $338 million, an increase of 17% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 32% in the fourth quarter of '22 and 26% in the full year of '22.\nTurning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $26 million to $460 million. The increase reflects a $45 million organic increase, partially offset by a $20 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $1 million decrease from the net impact of an acquisition and divestitures. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense and general and administrative expense.\nThe higher compensation reflects our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 10% increase in the team over the past 12 months; and annual merit increases, which were higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation. The higher general and administrative expense primarily reflects higher travel versus the prior year period as we returned to a more normalized level of travel in 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of our new corporate structure. As a reminder, we did this to focus our business more sharply on 3 megatrends: Modernizing markets, ESG and anti-financial crime. The structure change not only increases our focus, but will also bring commercial teams closer together; put technology and marketing resources closer to our products; and redefine how we engage, attract and retain clients across products. As a result, we expect to incur $115 million to $145 million in pretax charges, approximately 40% of which will be noncash charges.\nThe program will be open for 2 years and has 3 main components: One, asset impairments and contract terminations; two, employee-related costs to support the divisional realignment; and three, onetime consulting and other spend designed to help us unlock revenue synergies. We are targeting benefits in the form of combined annual run rate operating efficiencies and revenue synergies of at least $30 million by 2025. Costs related to the divisional alignment program will be recorded as restructuring expense.\nWe are initiating our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.77 billion to $1.85 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range reflects an increase of just over 5%, including an increase of 1% related to our digital asset strategy and primarily reflects our continued investments to drive growth across ESG, anti-financial crime and market modernization. We expect the 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%.\nTurning to Slide 17. Debt increased by $27 million versus 3Q '22, primarily due to net issuances of $465 million of commercial paper and $164 million increase in Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro, partially offset by repayment of $600 million of 0.445% senior unsecured notes at maturity. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio remains at 2.7x as compared to the third quarter of 2022.\nWith record free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees of $1.5 billion in 2022, a weighted average cash cost of debt of 2.2% and no long-term debt maturities until 2026, we have positioned the company to minimize the impact of rising rates and to provide flexibility to support our growth strategy.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million. As of December 31, 2022, there was an aggregate $650 million remaining under the Board-authorized share repurchase program, reflecting an increase in authorization approved by the Board in December.\nTurning to Page 18 of the presentation. I would like to highlight some of the significant progress we have made executing on our sustainable strategy. For the seventh consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, one of the most prestigious environmental, social and governance ranking benchmarks. Nasdaq was 1 of 8 diversified financial services companies selected for inclusion in the 2022 index. In addition, we were only -- 1 of only 283 companies out of 15,000 evaluated and named to CDP's 2022 Climate Change A List.\nIn closing today, Nasdaq's fourth quarter of 2022 results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments.\nThank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to Nasdaq's Third Quarter 2022 Quarterly Update Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, to Mr. Ed Ditmire, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nEdward Ditmire\n\nVP of IR, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal, Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the line to Q&A.\nThe press release and presentation are on our website, and we intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.\nI'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nLastly, a quick programming mention. We're excited to be hosting our Investor Day on November 8. Our leadership team will give presentations about our strategy, operations and opportunities and will be available for your questions. I know many of you on the line today are planning to participate. If you have not registered, please do so at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI'll now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a summary of the new corporate structure for NASDAQ that we announced during the quarter. The new structure organizes our business units into the following 3 divisions that align us more closely to the foundational shifts that are driving our strategic evolution.\nMarket Platforms, led by Tal Cohen, will include our North American and European Market Services as well as our Market Infrastructure Technology business. The division will also include our Digital Assets and Carbon Markets businesses.\nCapital Access Platforms, led by Nelson Griggs, will combine our Corporate Platforms and Investment Intelligence businesses.\nAnd Anti-FINANCIAL Crime, led by Jamie King, will include Verafin, our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solution, as well as our Market and Trade Surveillance business.\nOur new structure will take effect by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. As Ann will note later, we will -- we have provided supplemental information to help investors and analysts prepare for the financial and reporting implications of our new structure. This information is available on our IR website and was furnished in our Form 8-K filed this morning. Additionally, we will discuss our businesses through the lens of this new structure at our upcoming Investor Day on November 8.\nWe believe the new structure will elevate our strategy and amplify our growth opportunities by allowing us to provide even more holistic solutions to our clients' most complex challenges. We view this as the next chapter in the strategic pivot that we launched 5 years ago, which solidified our focus on liquidity, transparency and integrity as the foundation of our strategic growth pillars.\nWhile these strategic themes are carried across our divisions, each division has a central theme that will help define its strategic focus.\nMarket Platforms will focus on maximizing the liquidity of the capital markets through our role as a market operator and as a provider of market ecosystems to our technology clients. This division will center around the modernization of markets, including the migration of markets and core infrastructure to the cloud and the emergence of blockchain and the resulting digital assets as elements of future market infrastructure.\nNasdaq today serves as a powerful capital markets platform. We are a leading force in the modernization of marketplaces through our world-class technology, including the progress we're making as we migrate our own markets to our next-gen exchange platform in an edge cloud environment. We are also actively deploying our next-gen market platform to our Market Technology clients. And through our new structure, we see an opportunity for us to drive a broader strategy as one integrated unit.\nFor instance, as we move forward with our Digital Assets platform, we see our role as being broader than a market operator or a market technology provider. It is a true platform opportunity, creating a custody foundation with strong anti-financial crime capabilities that allows multiple market venues, including those to whom we sell our market technology, to connect; and where we can facilitate institutional liquidity across venues more seamlessly than exists today.\nIt's just one example of how the divisional structure will have more power, working together both as an operator and as a technology partner. We are excited to demonstrate how we can combine our expertise in managing market infrastructure, coupled with our focus on leading technologies, to support exchanges and market participants in new ways to drive the global flow of capital.\nIn our Capital Access Platforms division, we will leverage the insights and capabilities across our Corporate Platforms and Investment Intelligence teams. And we will be focused on the transparency pillar, reflecting the profound shift in behavior among corporates and investors, with a focus on long-term value creation. We are seeing a sustained prioritization across the buy side on long-term value creation, and the subsequent response across corporates, to engage their investor base in this evolving construct.\nFor instance, there is a notable opportunity for Nasdaq to be a leading ESG solutions provider. We are centered first on a foundation of serving the specific needs of corporate issuers by providing advisory services, along with SaaS-based data aggregation and reporting capabilities, to facilitate their ability to communicate their ESG and climate strategies and progress to the investment community. As we mature our strategy, we have an opportunity to bridge these capabilities into the investment community through analytics, indexes and data solutions.\nMore generally, capital access platforms will be positioned to connect the investor and the issuer communities through actionable insights, industry-leading indexes and modernized workflows. This will allow us to provide more seamless, more holistic and more impactful solutions that help both stakeholder groups navigate the increasing complexity of the evolving financial system.\nAnd finally, our Anti-Financial Crime division will continue to focus on strengthening and safeguarding the integrity of the financial system. Anti-financial crime technology represents an already large and fast-growing sector with structural and regulatory tailwinds. And as the financial system transforms and becomes more technologically driven and sophisticated, the threats to its integrity are growing in scale and sophistication as well.\nFinancial institutions face increasing -- I'm sorry, faces significant challenges in detecting and preventing financial crime, and therefore, are investing significant capital and resources in combating those threats. Nasdaq's Anti-Financial Crime division focuses on delivering a world-class platform with holistic solutions and capabilities to support financial institutions and fighting financial crime more effectively across their networks and the wider financial system.\nWe are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us to further lean into the areas that are primed for growth as we become the trusted fabric of the financial system. As I noted earlier, we will have an opportunity to provide more details and answer your questions about this new structure for Nasdaq at our upcoming Investor Day on November 8.\nNow let's turn to our results. Nasdaq delivered strong third quarter results with $890 million in net revenues, a 6% increase compared to the prior year period and a 9% on an organic basis, excluding the impacts of the changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 8% to $1.97 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $699 million in the third quarter of 2022, growing at an even faster rate of 13%. We are pleased with the continued consistent growth across our recurring revenue segments, complemented by positive organic contributions from other areas, including index licensing and trading.\nTurning next to the specific business highlights starting with our Solutions segment. Our Solutions segment delivered total revenue of $584 million during the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period or 10% organically, excluding the effect of FX and an acquisition. The growth was driven from activity across the full breadth of our businesses, including our index and investment analytics offerings, the expansion of our listed issuer base, our anti-financial crime offerings and Market Infrastructure Technology business, as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services.\nIn our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $284 million in total revenue in the third quarter, a 4% increase overall from the prior year period. Our organic growth was 6%, excluding the effect of FX, with contributions to organic growth from each of the 3 businesses during the quarter.\nRevenue in our Market Data business increased by 2% from the prior year period and 5% organically, excluding the impact of FX, primarily due to an increase in proprietary data revenues from international clients.\nOur index business saw revenue growth of 5% versus the prior year period, driven by positive net flows of $56 billion over the last 12 months. We also saw continued strong results from licensed futures activities, which together with the impact of positive inflows, more than offset the negative impact of market beta.\nIn our Analytics business, revenues grew 8% from the prior year period and 10% organically, excluding the effect of FX. Our combined eVestment and Solovis offerings saw strong revenue growth driven by the sequential impact of new sales and client retention. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for that team, which underscores the power of these offerings across both asset owners and asset managers.\nTurning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $132 million in total revenues in the third quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year period. This was driven by growth in both the anti-financial crime and the Market Infrastructure Technology businesses. Our anti-financial crime technology business had a very encouraging third quarter with a 24% increase in revenues versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by new sales across both our fraud and anti-money laundering and surveillance solutions as well as the $7 million impact of the Verafin acquisition deferred revenue adjustment recorded in the prior year period.\nRegarding Verafin specifically, we grew revenues 25%, excluding the $7 million impact of the deferred revenue write-down on the prior year period. We are particularly proud of the team's continued ability to sign new clients across small to medium banks, which is the core of the current franchise, with 54 new small to medium bank clients signed during the quarter.\nWe are also pleased by the results of recent proof-of-concepts with several Tier 1 banks. As an example, in one PoC that we ran, we were able to reduce false positives by 25% by simultaneously identifying 3.5x more dollars in fraudulent payments.\nMoving next to our Market Infrastructure Technology business. We generated $55 million in revenues, representing 8% organic growth. We are pleased to see the business return to positive organic growth versus the prior year period for the first time in over a year. We continue to be on track with large complex deliveries, and we have a strong pipeline of engaged clients and prospects.\nMoving to our foundational Marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $305 million during the third quarter, a 4% increase versus the prior year period or 8% higher organically, excluding the impact of FX. The increased revenue year-over-year was broad-based, with especially strong growth in trade management services, which had a record quarter; and increases across each of our trading businesses, equity derivatives, cash equities and fixed.\nLastly, we were excited to announce during the quarter the launch of our new Digital Assets business to power the digital asset ecosystem. This new business underscores our ambition to facilitate broader institutional participation in digital assets by providing trusted and institutional-grade solutions focused on custody, liquidity and integrity.\nAs part of our Market Services segment, Nasdaq Digital Assets will initially develop an advanced custody solution, coupled with liquidity and execution capabilities geared to serving institutional clients by enabling safe transaction and storage of digital assets. This solution is developed through an innovation -- an innovative technology approach that brings together the best attributes of hot and cold crypto wallets, providing a high degree of accessibility without compromising security. Additionally, we will incorporate our anti-financial crime technology with new coverage for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including a comprehensive suite of crypto-specific detection and investigation capabilities.\nFinally, our Corporate Platforms segment delivered revenue of $168 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period or 11% organically, excluding the impact of FX and an acquisition. The growth was driven primarily by the increased demand for our IR and ESG services, and secondarily, due to the expansion of the issuer bases across both our U.S. and Nordic listing franchises.\nRevenues in our IR and ESG services businesses increased 13% organically, underscoring the strong demand for our technology-based and consultative solutions during the period. The number of corporate clients using Nasdaq's IR and ESG solutions increased 5% from the prior year period.\nExamining our IR, ESG solutions more specifically. We have increased the number of companies using our ESG advisory services by 35% versus the prior year. We've also tripled the number of clients using our ESG workflow solutions to 170 companies, coming from both strong growth in OneReport and the acquisition of Metrio.\nTurning to our Listing Services business. Revenue increased 6% to $105 million as the number of Nasdaq-listed corporate issuers, excluding SPACs, increased 5% compared to the prior year period. Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting the majority of new U.S. listings during the quarter with 28 operating company IPOs and a 90% win rate.\nNext, I want to touch briefly on the current market environment. As we enter the final months of 2022, we continue to find ourselves amid an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. While we will remain vigilant and maintain flexibility to respond effectively to changing conditions, we believe we continue to be well positioned to deliver for our clients and our shareholders throughout this cycle.\nOur results continue to demonstrate the quality of our businesses and the value inherent in diversified model. We also continue to see compelling opportunities to further deepen relationships with our clients in this environment and expand the ways we support them as they navigate these dynamics. The new corporate structure we unveiled last month will serve as a great foundation, providing us even more opportunities to lean into areas most primed for growth and deliver even more holistic solutions to our clients across the ecosystem.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will start by reviewing third quarter 2022 performance, beginning on Slide 9 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $890 million is the net result of: Organic growth of 9%, including a 10% organic increase in the Solutions segment; and an 8% organic increase in Market Services; partially offset by a 3% negative impact from changes in FX rates and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 53% was unchanged compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $335 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared to $303 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 10. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.97 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenue totaled $699 million, an increase of 13%.\nI will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 11 through 14. Starting with Market Technology. Revenue increased $18 million or 16% with $7 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in the prior year period. Organic growth for the Market Technology segment was 18% in the period, and driven by both the anti-financial crime and Market Infrastructure Technology businesses.\nOur Market Infrastructure Technology business grew 6% as compared to the prior year period and 8% organically, excluding the impact of FX. This inflection reflects the progress we have made in advancing some of the largest client implementations through critical milestones earlier this year, new and expanded customer relationships and the lapping of a difficult comparable due to the planned rollout of a client support contract in the second half of 2021. This progress is an encouraging early proof point that the programs and initiatives of our Market Infrastructure Technology team have been implementing will move this business forward.\nARR for Market Technology totaled $456 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period and increased 6 percentage points compared to the prior year period.\nInvestment Intelligence revenue increased $12 million or 4%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $16 million or 6%. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects positive contributions from the index, Analytics and Market Data businesses.\nAsset-based licensing revenues declined 6% compared to the prior year period and represented 61% of index revenues. AUM and exchange-traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes totaled $311 billion, a decline of 14% from the prior year period. ARR totaled $583 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 64% decreased 1 percentage point from the prior year period.\nCorporate Platforms revenues increased $13 million or 8%, including 11% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listing services revenues as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and ESG and advisory and reporting offerings. Our listed corporate issuer base increased 7%, or 5% excluding SPACs.\nCorporate Platforms ARR was $589 million and increased 11% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 44% increased 2 percentage points compared to the prior year period, driven by a combination of recent growth in the listed issuer base and lower marketing expenses due to the subdued IPO environment.\nMarket Services net revenues increased $13 million or 4%. The organic revenue increase was $24 million or 8%, and there was an $11 million negative impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects growth across trade management services, U.S. cash equity, equity derivatives and fixed.\nTurning to Page 15 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $20 million to $417 million. The increase reflects a $40 million organic increase partially offset by a $19 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $1 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nThe organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting 2 factors. First is our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 9% increase in the team over the past 12 months. Second is annual merit increases which are reflected in the quarterly expense run rate starting in the second quarter. The increase is higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation which we reflected in our guidance at the beginning of the year.\nWe are lowering our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.70 billion to $1.72 billion, lowering both the top and the bottom of the prior range to reflect a combination of the continued strong organic growth dynamics as we progress through 2022, along with the impacts of a stronger dollar on our non-U.S. expenses. Lastly, we are lowering our 2022 tax guidance to a range of 24% to 25% versus 24% to 26% previously.\nTurning to Slide 16. Debt decreased by $344 million versus 2Q '22, primarily due to net repayment of $222 million of commercial paper and a $123 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by the strengthening dollar. Our total debt to trailing 12-month non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.7x, down from 2.9x in the second quarter of 2022.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $99 million. As of September 30, 2022, there was $293 million remaining under the Board-authorized share repurchase program.\nTurning to Page 17 of the presentation, I would like to touch on some of the very material progress we have made executing our sustainability strategy. I would like to note that Nasdaq's GHG reduction targets were approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative. Our targets including, reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 100% by 2030 and absolute Scope 3 ESG emissions 95% by 2050.\nAdditionally, EcoVadis upgraded our sustainability rating from silver to gold status, which is reserved for the top 5% of all companies rated. We also earned a place on Seramount's 100 Best Companies list, and were recognized as a Best Company for Dads for the second consecutive year. We continue to see opportunities to advance our sustainability program across multiple aspects and look forward to updating you regularly on our progress.\nI would like to take a moment to discuss the new organizational alignment that we recently announced. On the Investor Relations website, we published a supplement to help with the financial reporting under the new corporate structure which will take effect by the end of the fourth quarter 2022. The supplement covers the revenues, operating income and operating margin of each of the 3 new segments: Market Platforms, Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime, as well as revenues of their underlying businesses.\nIn addition, I would also like to call your attention to a change in how we are grouping our recurring revenue segments collectively. In particular, we are now adding trade management services to the prior Solutions segment grouping and calling it Solutions Businesses. The Solutions Businesses cover 75% of our last 12 months revenues and encompasses all of our non-trading revenues.\nAt our Investor Day on November 8, we'll discuss our businesses, opportunities and strategy through the lens of this new corporate structure. And at that time, we will provide associated updates to our growth outlook and other objectives. As such, we will answer any questions regarding the revenue growth outlooks on Investor Day.\nIn closing today, Nasdaq's third quarter results reflect the continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment, 9% organic revenue growth across the entire company and achieved a 53% non-GAAP operating margin.\nThank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to the Nasdaq Second Quarter 2022 Results Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Ditmire, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nEdward Ditmire\n\nVP of IR, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2022 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the line to Q&A.\nThe press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.\nI'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter 2022 financial and business performance as well as the progress we've made to drive forward our strategic priorities for the year. I'd like to begin by acknowledging that we continue to find ourselves amid an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Yet while markets, investors and corporate clients all experienced increased levels of volatility during the second quarter, Nasdaq's strategic vision and our ability to execute on it remains clear. The strength and quality of our businesses puts us in an excellent position to navigate these dynamics.\nOur record net revenue and non-GAAP EPS results demonstrate our ability to capture new opportunities in different operating environments, even as we continue to strengthen our positioning for longer-term growth through focused investments. I'm proud of our team's focus on delivering consistent results to our clients against this dynamic backdrop.\nLet's turn to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the second quarter of 2022. We achieved a record $893 million in net revenues, a 6% increase compared to the prior year period and 9% on an organic basis, excluding the impacts in changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures.\nOur total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 9% to $1.97 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $679 million in the second quarter of 2022, growing at an even faster rate of 12%, which reflects strong demand for our anti-financial crime solutions and investment intelligent -- and investment analytics offerings. SaaS revenue now comprises 35% of total company ARR, a new high. The consistent growth we're seeing in our recurring revenue segments provides a powerful starting point for our overall performance, but we also delivered strong results across with our index licensing and trading revenues.\nTurning next to specific highlights from our business segments. Our Solutions segment delivered a combined total revenue of $582 million during the second quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year period, or 12% excluding the impact of FX. The growth was driven from activity across several of our businesses, including our index and analytics offerings, the expansion of our listed issuer base, our anti-financial crime offerings, as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services.\nIn our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $283 million in total revenue in the second quarter, an 8% overall increase from the prior year period and 10% excluding the impact of FX, with growth contributions from across the businesses during the quarter. Revenue in our Market Data business increased by 1% from the prior year period and 3% excluding the impact of FX, primarily due to an increase in proprietary data revenues from international clients.\nIn our index business, we saw revenue growth of $17 million or 16% versus the prior year period, driven by positive net flows of $71 billion over the last 12 months, including $25 billion of inflows during the especially challenging beta environment experienced in the first half of 2022. We also saw especially strong results from licensed futures activities, which together with inflows, more than offset the negative impact of market beta.\nAnd in our Analytics business, revenues grew 8% from the prior year period and 10% excluding the impact of FX. Our flagship eVestment analytics offerings saw continued strong user adoption, both across our asset owners and asset managers, and drove annualized SaaS revenues for the Investment Intelligence segment to increase 12% versus the prior year period to $215 million.\nTurning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $131 million in total revenues in the second quarter, a 12% increase from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by continued growth in our broader anti-financial crime technology solutions business. Our anti-financial crime technology business had a strong second quarter with a 29% increase in revenues versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by sales in our fraud and anti-money laundering, or what we call FRAML solutions, as well as the impact of the Verafin acquisition deferred revenue adjustment recorded in the second -- in the prior year period. We welcomed 37 new clients during the quarter.\nWe continue to gain momentum with our efforts to expand Verafin's presence with larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks through our proof-of-concept trials. These are active evaluations within a prospective client's compliance infrastructures. While this diligence process results in a relatively long technology purchasing cycle, it is an important step to drive our success in extending our solutions to this area of the market.\nMoving next to our Market Infrastructure Technology business. We generated $56 million in net revenues during the second quarter. Importantly, we made continued progress on the deliverables within a group of particularly large client projects that we have discussed in recent quarters, reflecting our increased ability to work with clients on site. Specifically, we completed Phase 1 deliveries for all 4 of our largest implementations by the end of the quarter. While some of the projects have follow-on phases, we are pleased to have met these important milestones so far this year.\nMarket Infrastructure Technology also had some exciting new relationships that were announced during the period. In May, XP, a provider of financial products and services in Brazil, announced the development of their new trading platform for digital assets which is leveraging Nasdaq's next-gen technology deployed as a SaaS solution in the cloud.\nIn June, Climate Impact X, a Singapore-based marketplace for carbon credits, announced their decision to leverage Nasdaq's SaaS-based Marketplace Services Platform to power their new spot exchange for carbon credits which is slated for launch in early 2023.\nAs I noted earlier, we are actively engaging in person with our clients again, and the team recently welcomed over 100 officials from 50 global marketplaces to our annual Technology of the Future industry conference. The overall sentiment from clients there was incredibly encouraging, particularly as the market infrastructure operators see the advantages that our technology, including our cloud-deployed solutions, can bring to their respective customers as they contemplate shifts in their operating models and look for new ways to differentiate their offerings. We remain confident in our ability to improve our organic growth through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023.\nMoving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $310 million during the second quarter. We maximized opportunities presented by robust levels of activity through strong market share and consistent pricing strategies. The share volume traded on Nasdaq Exchanges grew by 22% compared to the prior year quarter. And trade management services revenues hit a new quarterly high of $87 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting an increase in demand for connectivity and infrastructure services.\nAt the end of June, Nasdaq's closing crossed set a record for the number of shares traded during the 2022 Russell U.S. Indexes reconstitution. 3.3 billion shares, representing nearly $64 billion, were executed in 2 seconds across Nasdaq-listed securities, a 40% increase in shares crossed from last year's event.\nI'm incredibly proud of our Market Services team on achieving yet -- this important milestone. The new closing cross record is a testament to the investments we've made in our technology and the result of the trust the team has worked diligently to build with all investors, including through some of the most volatile market periods on record.\nNasdaq's Nordic equities markets also saw strong volumes as well. The value of our shares traded on Nasdaq's Nordic and Baltic markets for the first half of 2022 was the second highest since 2008.\nFinally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenue of $168 million in the second quarter, a 13% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by our expanded listed issuer bases across both our U.S. and Nordic listing franchises as well as growth in demand for our IR and ESG services.\nRevenues in our IR and ESG services business increased 9%, underscoring the strong demand for our consultative and technology-based solutions during the period. The number of corporate clients using Nasdaq's IR and ESG services solutions increased 6% from the prior year period while we've also been expanding relationships of existing clients.\nIn addition, during the second quarter, we acquired Metrio, a provider of corporate sustainability data, analytics and reporting services to corporates. Metrio's SaaS-based platform is complementary to our existing suite of -- I'm sorry, of ESG reporting solutions and will accelerate our ability to support corporate clients in their expanding sustainability management and reporting needs. Our growing expertise in all components of E, S and G enable us to help our corporate clients confidently navigate the complexity of the modern capital markets, including managing their investor relationships more successfully.\nTurning to our Listing Services business. Revenue increased 15% to $107 million as the number of Nasdaq-listed corporate issuers, excluding SPACs, increased 9% compared to the prior year period. Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting the majority of new U.S. listings for the 34th consecutive quarter, with 38 IPOs raising a combined $2.8 billion for an 88% win rate. In Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges also welcomed 25 new listings.\nAs I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our second quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq's client-centric culture and diversified business model provides us the stability to perform well in different market environments. As we enter the second half of 2022, we continue to focus on broadening opportunities within 3 major areas that align with our strategic evolution.\nFirst, under the pillar of liquidity, we are a leader in the modernization of marketplaces through our world-class technology. This includes the progress we're making as we migrate our own markets to a cloud-enabled state, including the planned migration of our MRX Options market in the fourth quarter of this year, as well as our efforts to enable more of our Market Infrastructure Technology clients to maximize cloud and other powerful technologies within their offerings.\nSecond, under the pillar of transparency, we believe that we are incredibly well positioned to execute on our unique and substantial opportunity to be a leading ESG solutions provider. We are centered first on a foundation of serving the specific needs of corporate clients by providing advisory services, along with SaaS-based data aggregation and reporting capabilities, to facilitate their ability to communicate their ESG and climate strategies and progress to the investment community.\nAnd third, under the pillar of integrity, we play an important role in seeking to make the entire financial system more safe and fair for savers and investors through our powerful and diverse anti-financial crime offerings combined with our network of bank and brokerage clients.\nWe remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategy, and we believe that Nasdaq is well positioned to navigate the geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward into the latter half of this year.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will start by reviewing second quarter 2022 performance, beginning on Slide 10 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $893 million is the net result of: Organic growth of 9%, including a 12% organic increase in the Solutions segment; and a 4% organic increase in Market Services; partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a 2% negative impact from changes in FX rates.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 6%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 54% was unchanged compared to the prior period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $342 million or $2.07 per diluted share compared to $316 million or $1.90 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 11. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.97 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $679 million, an increase of 12%.\nI will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 12 through 15. Starting with Market Technology. Revenue increased $14 million or 12% with $10 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in the prior year period. Organic growth for the Market Technology segment was 14% in the period and was driven by the anti-financial crime business, though Market Infrastructure Technology saw a sequential improvement. ARR for Market Technology totaled $451 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 12% in the period.\nInvestment Intelligence revenue increased $22 million or 8%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $25 million or 10%. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects primarily strong growth in our index and analytics businesses as well as positive contribution from Market Data. ARR totaled $586 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period.\nOur index revenues were up 16% compared to the prior year, due principally to higher revenues derived from Nasdaq licensed derivative product, where we saw the benefit of both higher trading volumes in the products as well as hitting the revenue threshold that triggers a step-up in licensing economics, which happened about a month earlier in the year than we did in 2021. Based on the strength in the futures side of index licensing during the period, the percentage of index revenues from AUM-based licensing was 5 percentage points lower than the approximate 2/3 level we typically speak about.\nThe Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 66% increased 1 percentage point from the prior year period.\nCorporate Platforms revenues increased $19 million or 13%, including 16% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and ESG advisory and reporting offerings. Our listed corporate issuer base increased 11% or 9% excluding SPACs.\nCorporate Platforms ARR was $586 million and increased 15% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platforms segment operating margin of 46% increased 4 percentage points compared to the prior year period, driven by a combination of recent growth in the listed issuer base and lower marketing expense due to the subdued IPO environment.\nMarket Services net revenues increased $2 million or 1%. The organic revenue increase was $11 million or 4%, and there was $9 million negative impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects growth in trade management services, equity derivatives and cash equity revenues. The segment operating margin of 65% was unchanged from the prior year period.\nTurning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $21 million to $413 million. The increase reflects a $42 million organic increase partially offset by a $17 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $4 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\nThe organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting 2 factors. First is our continued investments in new employees to drive growth, including a 9% increase in the team over the past 12 months. Second is annual merit increases which is reflected in the quarterly expense run rate starting in the second quarter. The merit increase was higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation, and we've built the higher increase into our guidance at the beginning of the year. We continue to make significant investments in this tightened labor market to attract and retain the top talent in our industry.\nWe are narrowing our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion, tightening both the top and bottom of the prior range to account for expectations of continued investments, current FX rates and the continued strong performance thus far in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 17. Debt decreased by $182 million versus 1Q '22, primarily due to a repayment of the $499 million -- repayment of $499 million of the 4.25% senior unsecured notes due June 2024, partially offset by a net issuance of $421 million of commercial paper and a $105 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.9x, down from 3.1x in the first quarter of 2022.\nLet me take a moment now to update you on the dividend, stock repurchases and our Board approval to split our stock. During the second quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $166 million in shares and paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million. We have successfully completed the share repurchase program to offset dilution related to the divestiture of our U.S. fixed income business in June of 2021. As of June 30, 2022, there was $293 million remaining under the Board-authorized share repurchase program.\nI am also pleased to announce that our Board approved and declared a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. As we had previously disclosed, the approval of an amendment to our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to permit us to effect the stock dividend required the approval of both the SEC and our shareholders. We received both approvals last month and filed the charter amendment yesterday. The record date for the stock dividend will be August 12 with a distribution date of August 26. And we expect trading to begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 29.\nTurning to Page 18 of the presentation. I'd like to touch on some of the very material progress we've made executing on our sustainability strategy. First, in terms of external impact. As Adena mentioned, we announced and closed on the Metrio acquisition in June, expanding our corporate-serving ESG solution set, which will complement the more framework-based approach of our existing OneReport solution.\nSecond, in terms of corporate sustainability, we published our annual sustainability and TCFD reports in June. On advancing our climate strategy, we have had our 2021 GHG emissions verified by a third party, and submitted our science-based targets to the Science Based Targets Initiative for official validation.\nLastly, in July, we received a 2-level upgrade of our MSCI ESG rating to AA, recognizing the overall strength of our sustainability profile, including our leading governance standards in particular. We continue to see opportunities to advance our sustainability program across multiple aspects and look forward to updating you on our progress regularly.\nIn closing, Nasdaq's second quarter results reflect the continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered record quarterly revenues, 12% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment and a 54% non-GAAP operating margin, resulting in what we see as strong momentum thus far in 2022 that we can build upon moving forward.\nThank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Actual results may differ materially from these projections, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nI'll now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin my remarks today by addressing the current market landscape.\nAs I've noted in past calls, the Nasdaq team has become familiar with how unpredictable today's operating environment can be. The first quarter of 2022 was certainly no different, given the dynamic geopolitical and economic factors we experienced during the period. As I've noted in prior public comments, the war in Ukraine is a terrible tragedy, and we stand with the greater business community urgently calling for peace. Nasdaq has a proud and long-standing position in Europe, which includes 7 markets we operate across the Nordic and Baltic countries, specifically Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden. We've been extremely diligent in monitoring the threat environment in Europe and across our global operations to protect our employees and to ensure the resiliency of our markets and client solutions.\nOur revenue exposure to Russian clients was de minimis, and we remain committed to ensuring full compliance with all relevant sanctions. In addition, our global workforce is highly engaged in humanitarian and philanthropic efforts to support the needs of those impacted by the senseless war. It fills me with immense pride to see the outpouring of support across our employee base.\nRegarding the backdrop we are operating against, our corporate clients and our investor clients are navigating through a very dynamic environment, where strong economic growth has been accompanied with significant inflation, continued supply chain and labor shortage challenges and increasing geopolitical impacts. This environment creates volatility in markets, which tends to be a volume driver, and we have continued to experience strong volumes across our U.S. and European markets. It also creates an uncertain landscape for investors to navigate, resulting in a slowdown in capital raising activities, including IPOs.\nAnd depending on the way the markets are moving, it creates interesting dynamics for our index business. This quarter, the drop in market cap was offset partially by inflows into our index products and strong index futures volumes.\nLooking beyond the direct market impacts, because we offer solutions that help our clients navigate through these uncertain times, it's actually increased our client engagement in 3 key areas where we have secular growth. Our bank clients are managing increasingly complex geopolitical risks, which results in strong demand for advanced anti-financial crime solutions, which we offer with Verafin.\nasset owners, including pensions, sovereign wealth funds and endowments, are making quick asset allocation changes and must manage their portfolios very carefully, which increases their reliance on our eVestment and Solovis offerings. On the corporate side, our clients are navigating through a dynamic ESG environment, which drives demand for our ESG advisory and reporting solutions.\nOverall, our diversified business model gives us the means to be able to manage successfully in this environment recognizing, of course, that there are a lot of different forces at play. And in that context, let me briefly address the inflation-related pressures, which are certainly factors we are navigating as is the broader corporate community.\nOn the revenue side, we are fortunate to benefit from a highly diversified revenue mix based on providing mission-critical solutions that support our clients and the broader financial system around the world. We take a long-term approach to value creation for our shareholders in the context of serving our clients, and we will continue to manage that balance thoughtfully.\nIn addition, we are actively managing the evolution of inflationary pressures across our expense base. Our current expense guidance reflects the near-term actions we have taken to address the challenges of recruiting and retaining a highly skilled team in today's economy, and we'll continue to monitor the situation over time.\nOur team's focus on secular opportunities to drive organic growth as well as our business model's reliance on recurring revenue components has enabled Nasdaq to continue our track record of growth as we execute against our longer-term objectives. The record net revenue we achieved in the quarter against this very dynamic backdrop illustrates the strength of Nasdaq's business model.\nNext, I'd like to take a brief moment to thank 2 of our senior leaders for their years of impactful contributions to Nasdaq following the announcements that they will be moving on to new chapters in their lives. First, I want to congratulate Lars Ottersgard for his 16 years of leading our Market Technology business. During his tenure, he led a dramatic expansion in the capabilities and client network for the business and helped advance our ongoing transition to a more scalable SaaS-focused orientation.\nI also want to thank Lauren Dillard, who in her 3 years at Nasdaq delivered tremendous impact in strategically repositioning the Investment Intelligence business that now features a majority of revenue contribution from higher growth index and analytics products. We're incredibly excited about the strong successors we announced during the quarter for the market technology and Investment and Intelligence segments.\nSpecifically, Jamie King, who joined us from Verafin, will lead the anti-financial crime technology business. Roland Chai, who joined in Nasdaq in 2020, will lead the market infrastructure technology business. Those 2 businesses will continue to roll out to form the Market Technology segment. Oliver Albers, a long-standing Nasdaq executive will lead our Investment Intelligence segment. All 3 are respected leaders in their fields with deep industry expertise and a proven track record of success. Let's now turn to our results.\nI'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the first quarter of 2022. We achieved a record $892 million in net revenues, a 5% increase compared to what was itself a very strong prior year period when the company previously set a quarterly record on trading revenues. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 9% to $1.91 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $655 million in the first quarter of 2022, representing 34% of our total company ARR, reflecting particularly strong growth in our anti-financial crime and investment analytics businesses.\nOur recurring revenues and their consistent growth provide a powerful starting point for our overall performance, but we also delivered strong results across both index licensing and trading revenues. This solid start to the year positions us well to address the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward in 2022.\nTurning next to specific highlights from our business segments. Our Solutions segment businesses delivered combined total revenue of $576 million in the first quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year period, driven from several of our businesses, including our anti-financial crime offerings, our index and investment analytics offerings; the expansion of our listed issuer base as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services. Excluding FX and the partial quarter impact of the Verafin acquisition, we achieved organic growth of 13% across our solutions segments.\nIn our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $284 million in total net revenue in the first quarter, an 11% increase from the prior year period, with contributions across the business during the quarter. Revenue in our market data business grew by 2% versus the prior year period. Our strategy for geographic expansion, particularly in the APAC region, remains strong.\nIn our Index business, we saw revenue growth of $20 million or 20% versus the prior year period, driven principally by growth in ETP assets, which saw positive net flows of $75 billion over the last 12 months, including meaningful inflows during the especially volatile first quarter itself. We launched 55 ETFs tracking Nasdaq indexes over the last 12 months, which in turn accumulated $2.5 billion in assets through the end of the quarter.\nNotable launches outside the U.S. include the Mara Philex Semiconductor Index ETP and the Samsung Nasdaq 100 ETP. In addition, we created and launched the first index representing the pricing of carbon removal credits during the first quarter based on our activity on our Puro Earth carbon removal marketplace.\nMoving from the asset-based index revenues to transactional, the volumes of Nasdaq licensed index futures were particularly strong with a record of over 147 million future contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 traded in the quarter. And in our Investment Analytics business, revenues grew 13% from the prior year period driven by the sequential impact of strong sales across asset owners, asset managers and private markets throughout 2021.\nWe are excited about the appointment of Oliver Albers to the Executive Vice President of Investment Intelligence. As a 20-plus year veteran of Nasdaq, Oliver is an experienced, results-oriented leader, who is instrumental in supporting Lauren in strategically repositioning Nasdaq's Investment Intelligence segment into the higher growth, more technology-enabled business you see today.\nTurning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $124 million in total net revenues in the first quarter, a 24% increase from the prior year period. This is primarily driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin in our results year-over-year and more broadly, continued organic growth in the broader anti-financial crime technology business.\nOur anti-financial crime technology business had a very strong first quarter, achieving 71% increase in revenues versus the prior year period, partially driven by the partial quarter inclusion of Verafin in the prior year period, the phasing out of revenue write-down associated with the acquisition as well as by strong organic growth with the majority of that coming from the fraud and anti-money laundering, which we call FRAML Solutions.\nThe growth was driven by both new sales and expanded relationships within our existing client base. We have made meaningful progress in the last 12 months on our objective of helping Verafin expand its client franchise into larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks as well as to innovative fintech companies, all of which account for half of the industry spend.\nSince we closed on the acquisition, we have signed 10 new fintech clients and 2 new Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks with several ports of concepts currently underway at major Tier 1 banks. We also launched our first digital assets module for traditional banks and virtual asset service providers, or otherwise known as VAS, including crypto exchanges to detect and investigate fraud and money laundering within digital wallets and in transactions between traditional fiat and digital currencies.\nWe are committed to supporting the financial ecosystem through its digital transformation by innovating quickly to deliver digital-ready versions of our advanced crime fighting solutions. And as a recent example, we responded quickly to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by expanding our sanctions product to include new sanctions agents for our bank clients.\nVerafin is meeting the high expectations we set at the time of the acquisition, while at the same time, the broader Nasdaq team is learning from Verafin in important ways. Their operational expertise as an all SaaS provider is invaluable to us as we build upon and improve our effectiveness in offering our expanded suite of other SaaS offerings.\nBy bringing together all of Nasdaq's anti-financial crime solutions, including Verafin and our market and trade surveillance solutions under Jamie King, the CEO and Co-Founder of Verafin, we have an incredible opportunity to maximize those cross-product synergies. We're excited to have Jamie as the new Executive Vice President of Nasdaq's ASC business as he leads the future of Nasdaq's high-impact, high-growth solutions that focus on fighting crime and ensuring the integrity of the financial industry.\nWithin our market infrastructure technology business, the first quarter results continue to reflect the revenue headwinds that we have communicated to investors over the past 2 years since COVID began. As we discussed on prior calls, these headwinds have stemmed from factors that include logistical challenges the pandemic presented to sales, installation and change request work that often occurred on site, as well as some specific client delivery challenges in the post-trade space.\nWe are pleased that 2 of our post-trade clients successfully went live in the beginning of the second quarter with the first phase of their implementations, and we continue to make good progress in all of our major implementation projects. As I said last quarter, as we reengage in person with our clients, we're starting to see these revenue headwinds recede. With the healthy order intake trends in both 2021 and early 2022, we entered 2022 with an opportunity to improve the organic growth of our market infrastructure solutions as we progress through the year and into 2023.\nWe have appointed Roland Chi as the new Executive Vice President and leader of our Market Infrastructure Technology business. Roland has been serving as our Chief Risk Officer. And just as importantly, he spent more than a decade leading key technology product areas at several of the world's leading exchange businesses and was, in fact, the customer himself of Nasdaq's marketplace technology. Roland has very specific mandates to strengthen, deepen and progress our client relationships and to continue to innovate across our product suite. I'm excited about this transition as it comes at a time when Nasdaq has never had more to offer to our technology clients, including our next-generation, cloud-native trade life cycle solutions, a newly built cloud-based trading risk management solution and as well as solutions to meet the needs of digital asset marketplaces.\nMoving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $315 million during the first quarter, its second highest quarter ever, second only to Q1 2021. Our market share in U.S. equity saw year-over-year and sequential quarterly improvement, which resulted from an industry uptick in on-exchange trading as well as early success increasing the demand for some of our unique functionalities.\nEquity derivatives set a new quarterly net revenue high, up 6%, maintaining our market share in U.S. options in a very busy period while realizing improved capture. Our U.S. options business saw average daily number of contracts traded of $12.8 million during the first quarter and led exchanges with a 32% market share.\nAnd in our Nordic and Baltic markets, equities markets saw robust volumes during the period, with the value of shares traded setting a decade high of EUR 289 billion.\nFinally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered record net revenue of $168 million in the first quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by our continued leadership in new listings across our U.S. and European markets as well as growth in demand for our IR and ESG services. We saw particularly strong growth in Nasdaq IR Insight and IR advisory offerings as well as across our Government Solutions suite, including our Board meeting management and advisory offerings and Nasdaq One Report, our ESG reporting workflow solution.\nDespite the slower start to the year for IPOs, Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting 70 total listings in the U.S. during the quarter, raising $9 billion for an 86% win rate. we listed 100% of all operating company IPOs during the quarter and 80% of stack listings.\nIn Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges welcomed 19 new listings. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our first quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq's performance-driven culture and diversified business model enables the company to perform well in different data-driven environments. As a result, we will continue to make focused investments in our businesses to support sustainable growth and expansion of our impact to the financial industry, while also positioning us well as we work towards our medium-term goals.\nWe remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategy, and we believe that Nasdaq is well positioned to address the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward in 2022.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review the financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted.\nReconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter 2022 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation.\nThe 5% increase in reported net revenue of $892 million is the net result of organic growth of 6%, including a 13% organic increase in the Solutions segment, partially offset by a 4% organic decrease in Market Services compared to a record net revenue high in the first quarter of 2021, and the contribution from Verafin as well as impact from divestitures, partially offset by the negative impact from changes in FX rates.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% decreased 2 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $329 million or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $327 million or $1.96 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.19 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $655 million, an increase of 12%. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 13 through 16.\nStarting with Market Technology, revenue increased $24 million or 24%. The increase primarily reflects a positive $18 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin, which occurred near the middle of the first quarter of 2021, and $9 million in organic revenue growth, led by our anti-financial crime technology business.\nARR for Market Technology totaled $435 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 3% in the period, well below our objectives. Focusing on the Market Infrastructure Technology business, results continue to reflect the headwinds from logistical challenges the pandemic presented as well as some specific client delivery challenges in the post-trade space.\nInvestment Intelligence revenue increased $28 million or 11%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $30 million. Organic revenue growth during the period primarily reflects strong growth in our index and analytics businesses as well as a positive contribution from Market Data.\nARR was $570 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. AUM ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices increased 4% compared to the prior year period to $401 million. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% is unchanged from the prior year period.\nCorporate Platforms revenues increased $22 million or 15%, including 17% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the 17% expansion in our listed U.S. corporate issuer base as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations, and newer ESG advisory and reporting offerings.\nCorporate Platforms ARR was $576 million and increased 18% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 45% increased 5 percentage points compared to the prior year period and was primarily driven by growth in the listed issuer base. Market Services net revenues decreased $19 million or 6%. The organic revenue decrease was $13 million or 4%, and there was a $6 million negative impact from changes in FX rates.\nThe organic decrease primarily reflects lower U.S. equities industry trading volumes compared to the record first quarter 2021 period as well as lower capture in U.S. equities. The segment operating margin of 63% decreased 5 percentage points compared to the very strong prior year period given the lower trading net revenues and the impact of higher professional fees.\nTurning to Page 17 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $35 million to $428 million. The increase reflects a $36 million or 9% organic increase and a $9 million increase from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by a $10 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.\nThe organic expense increase is driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting our continued investment in new employees to drive growth. Inflationary pressures on compensation and performance-linked compensation, which continues to reflect the very strong growth across our solutions segment.\nWe intend to continue investing thoughtfully to maximize the benefits of our expanded customer base and the increasing breadth of capabilities we have developed to expand each relationship. We are revising our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.76 billion, essentially lifting the bottom end of the existing range a bit to account for the very strong organic growth in the Solutions segment businesses to start the year.\nTurning to Slide 19. Debt increased by $68 million versus 4Q '21, primarily due to issuance -- the issuance of $550 million of new 3.95% senior unsecured notes due March 2052, partially offset by a net payment of $420 million of commercial paper and a $55 million decrease in eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro.\nOur total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.1x, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2021. In April, we used proceeds from the notes offering completed in the first quarter to retire $500 million of bonds maturing in June of 2024. Now let me take a moment to update you on the dividend stock repurchases and our intention to split our stock.\nDuring the first quarter of '22, the company repurchased $467 million in shares, including $325 million related to the previously disclosed accelerated share repurchase program discussed on the 4Q call. Additionally, we are announcing today an 11% increase in the dividend to $0.60 per share.\nThe company has also began the process of obtaining certain shareholder and SEC approvals to facilitate a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. If such approvals are received, we expect the split to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.\nIn closing, Nasdaq's first quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered record quarterly revenues, 13% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment and a 52% non-GAAP operating margin, what we see as an incredibly strong start to 2022 that we can build upon moving forward.\nSo thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

Welcome to the Nasdaq Fourth Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Ed Ditmire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nEdward Ditmire\n\nVP of IR, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the line to Q&A.\nThis press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nActual results may differ materially from these projections and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Adena.\n\nAdena T. Friedman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Let me first note how proud I am of the resilience of Nasdaq's business, the nimbleness and dedication of our global team and the trusted relationships we have with our clients. We are certainly familiar with how unpredictable today's operating environment can be as we continue to navigate a dynamic pandemic and economic landscape.\nBefore I turn to our performance, I would briefly like to address the current market environment. While the markets have experienced increased levels of volatility since the start of the year, we maintain a positive overall economic outlook going into 2022 as the underlying economy continues to have the ingredients for continued growth. Notably, consumer demand for products and services remains high, the ongoing digital transformation of industry continues to drive long-term demand for advanced software and other technology and market innovations and the resulting employment environment is very strong.\nThat said, there are several factors driving the current market volatility. Notably, due to the cyclical and structural issues, we are entering 2022 with a tight labor market and supply chain challenges, both of which are contributing to inflationary pressures. Those pressures are then creating uncertainty around the pace and rate of monetary policy adjustments. Additionally, there are broader geopolitical challenges and continued pandemic impacts that are adding to the macro uncertainty.\nSo our overall -- while our overall outlook remains positive, we expect the confluence of market-driven factors and macroeconomic and political factors to continue to drive volatility over the near term. Within that context, we also remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. For example, we've seen significantly higher trading volumes. And within the last week, the industry processed and Nasdaq process, a new record number of messages in a single trading day.\nWe continue to have a healthy pipeline of companies expecting to tap the public markets during 2022. In fact, we have more than doubled the number of S1 on file with the SEC compared to the prior year period, although market volatility could cause some delays to IPO timing. Something we're monitoring closely.\nAnd in our index business, we expect index asset values to experience some impact associated with various market levels and investor appetite for products tracking our indexes. But also to benefit from higher futures trading volumes due to the use of our core indexes and market hedging strategies. The diversification of our business over the past number of years has created a flywheel effect between our foundational U.S. and European marketplaces and the technology solutions we deliver to thousands of clients across public companies, investment managers and banks as well as the 100-plus market infrastructure operators, all of whom rely on our mission-critical software to navigate the financial system successfully.\nThis is especially the case during these periods of heightened market turbulence. We help asset owners rebalance their portfolios and manage asset allocation decisions. We enable banks and brokers to prevent financial crime while handling increased investor activity. We provide critical investor relations insights to corporate clients to understand changes in their investor base. And we empower exchanges around the world to handle the market volumes and volatility.\nNasdaq is there as a critical partner across the financial markets and our business has demonstrated time and again that we can achieve success in the face of these types of backdrops. I'm confident this time will be no different.\nLet's now turn to our results. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's full year 2021 and fourth quarter 2021 financial and business performance, the progress we've made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction and an update on Nasdaq's cloud journey as well as our ambitions for 2022 and beyond. I'll then turn the call over to Ann, who will provide further details about our results as well as give updates on our guidance, capital deployment and sustainability efforts before we move to Q&A.\nLet's begin with our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. First, on the fourth quarter, we achieved $885 million in net revenues, a 12% increase compared to the prior year period, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93 rose 21% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFor the full year of 2021, net revenues of $3.4 billion increased 18% from the prior year. We achieved 14% organic growth with double-digit contributions from both the Solutions segments and Market Services. Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $1.87 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This underscores our continued progress across key secular growth opportunities, including building out our anti-financial crime technology as well as our analytics and workflow solutions for asset owners.\nWithin our recurring revenue businesses, we see some of our best performances from our SaaS-based solutions. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $640 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing a 34% -- I'm sorry, representing 34% of total company IRR -- ARR, sorry, up from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The 43% year-over-year increase in annualized SaaS revenues primarily reflects the inclusion of Verafin as well as strong organic growth in our market surveillance and investment analytics businesses.\nBecause of our 2021 performance, we entered 2022 with solid momentum, and we intend to lean into our success as we operate our advanced client-led technology solutions and our foundational marketplace businesses diligently in the months ahead. Now I'm going to turn to specific highlights from our businesses, focusing mainly on fourth quarter results.\nOur Solutions segment businesses delivered combined total revenues of $581 million during the fourth quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year period, driven most notably by standout performances from index and listing services, exciting momentum in our investment analytics offerings and strong performance in our anti-financial crime offerings, including the impact of the acquisition of Verafin.\nIn our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $288 million in total net revenues in the fourth quarter, an 18% increase from the prior year period, with contributions from across the business. We continue to invest in product innovation to meet the evolving needs of our clients. During the quarter, we brought to market several new products that are seeing encouraging initial demand.\nLet me highlight a few. Data Fabric, which is our new enhanced cloud-based offering is a powerful new feature inside of Nasdaq Datalink that allows clients to bring their own data to the platform and have it securely managed as a service. The early traction we observed with Data Fabric is encouraging, and this offering is quickly becoming a critical part of our clients' investment workflows. And in our index franchise, we saw demand growth for the new offerings in our expanded Nasdaq 100 related and ESG-focused indexes, including 2 new sustainability-focused ETFs tracking the Nasdaq 100 ESG and the Nasdaq -- next-gen 100 ESG indexes. In total, 61 ETFs tracking Nasdaq indexes launched in 2021, accumulating $2.9 billion in assets through the end of the fourth quarter. Notably, 67% of ETF launches in the year were outside the U.S., demonstrating the strong international demand for Nasdaq's index franchise.\nTurning to investment analytics, building upon our successful partnerships with leading investment consultants that were announced during 2021, Nasdaq's Asset Owner Solutions now distributes investment research and insights from Mercer and Aon among others, to our growing community of asset owners and asset managers on the eVestment platform. This is just one of several ways for increasing the value of eVestment and the broader asset owner solutions offering to our clients. And I'm incredibly pleased to see the tremendous sales growth from new clients reported by eVestment and Solovis for the full year of 2021.\nCombined new sales in 2021 totaled $26 million, an increase of 41% over the prior year, driven in large part by 79% new sales growth in asset owner -- in the asset owner business, and Solovis' new sales grew 145% across all applying groups.\nTurning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $131 million in total net revenues in the fourth quarter, a 24% increase from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin in our results. More broadly, we saw continued growth in demand for our SaaS-based offerings, both fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions, which we call FRAML; and from the market and trade surveillance areas, our anti-financial crime technology as well as a growing number of market operators utilizing our cloud native marketplace solutions.\nOver the course of 2021, I'm pleased to report that in addition to 197 new banks, credit unions and fintech companies that adopted Verafin, our other market technology businesses welcomed 31 new customers, of which 26 chose our SaaS solutions. Though market technology overall had a transformational year in 2021, in particular, as we grow Nasdaq into an anti-financial crime leader with related shifts in revenue composition, we have an equal focus on catalyzing a recovery in the growth of our Solutions business for our market infrastructure operators.\nRevenues recognized in that business decreased in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis due to factors including lower nonrecurring professional services revenue caused in part by pandemic-related logistical challenges that we've previously disclosed. However, we're seeing some encouraging trends that bring us incrementally closer to a positive inflection in revenue.\nFirst, we're making progress on some of the larger, more complex implementations that have been more exposed to the pandemic-related challenges of travel and restrictions to on-site collaboration. In particular, 2 key projects are approaching their first go-live and acceptance phases in the first quarter of 2022. And then the third, the collaboration with the client resulted in its scope and time line adjusted to reflect both expanding customer needs balanced against evolving delivery time line realities.\nSecond, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we achieved strong new order intake of $142 million, capping a record full year of $378 million, excluding Verafin, which constitutes a very substantial 58% increase in new order intake from 2020 that was highly impacted by the onset of the pandemic. Further, we have seen a substantial uptick in early-stage discussions with clients who want to learn more about our progress bringing the benefits of the cloud and managed services to their own markets.\nWe are excited to see how they can -- how that can play out not only in driving further growth in new contracts down the line, but also because SaaS and managed service projects entail simpler delivery processes versus our legacy on-premises installations. Obviously, the duration of the pandemic has exceeded everyone's expectations. However, we are encouraged by the growing interest in our next-gen capabilities and the future opportunities to increase the way we serve market infrastructure operators to complement the strong growth that we see today in our larger antifinancial crime offering.\nMoving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $303 million during the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 5% from the prior year period. We maintained our strong competitive performance amidst a dynamic trading backdrop as the retail and institutional investment communities found new opportunities across equities and options to drive their strategies. Our U.S. options business set a new annual record for trading volumes in 2021, and we are starting 2022 with new records being set in volumes and message traffic.\nIn early December, we announced our decision to begin the migration of our options markets to the cloud beginning in 2022, starting with our Nasdaq MRx options market. This innovation in the infrastructure that underpins our markets will create more elasticity in our capacity while maintaining or improving the performance of our clients that our clients have come to expect from us.\nThis will be made possible with the build-out of the broader cloud infrastructure within the Carteret data center supported by AWS and our local partner, Equinix. I will cover this topic in more details in a few minutes.\nTurning to U.S. Cash Equities. The increase of our volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 mirrored the industry volume increase at approximately 3%. And in the Nordic markets, we continue to experience strong trading performance, including a matched equity market share among lit venues of over 75%. The European equities value traded per day also increased 23% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.\nFinally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered net revenues of $162 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% increase driven primarily by our continued leadership in new listings across our U.S. and European markets as well as growth in demand for our complementary IR and ESG services.\nFor the ninth consecutive year, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs in 2021 was 752, capitalizing on one of the strongest years for new issuances over the last 2 decades and with a 73% overall IPO win rate. Nasdaq also ranked #1 in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised for the third quarter with -- I'm sorry, for the third year. So let me read that again.\nNasdaq also ranked #1 in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised for the third year with $181 billion and listed 9 of the top 10 U.S.-based IPOs in terms of proceeds raised. We also had 33 new companies switch their corporate listings to Nasdaq in 2021, including Honeywell, Palo Alto Networks and Baker Hughes, representing an aggregate $361 billion in global equity market capitalization. The total market value of all companies transferring to Nasdaq in the last decade has exceeded $1.7 trillion.\nIn Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges also experienced a record year for new listings with 207 companies raising over $15 billion. And for the first time ever, Nasdaq Stockholm facilitated more capital raise than any other country in the EU, while our combined Nordic exchanges had more IPOs than any other market operator in Europe.\nDemand for our IR Intelligence and governance solutions drove 4% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter within the IR and ESG business. We continue to see deepened client engagement across Nasdaq IR Insight and Advisory and have also invested in the expansion of our ESG advisory and reporting services to corporate clients. We now provide these services in our portfolio solutions offered to companies who list on our U.S. market.\nNext, I'd like to provide an update on the important progress we made in 2021 to advance our cloud journey and how these milestones support our broader strategic vision to unlock potential growth -- growth potential, sorry, and accelerate our transition to a SaaS business model in our technology, data and investment analytics businesses.\nOur move to the cloud began over a decade ago, and we have used its innovation capabilities to deliver client-driven solutions while evolving our own infrastructure for a digital future. In fact, a wide range of Nasdaq solutions are already in the cloud today. We have also advanced our markets ecosystem by migrating several of our market surrounding systems that have greatly benefited from the hyperscaling that the cloud affords us manage elevated volumes in the world's markets.\nWe were, therefore, very excited to announce in December a multiyear partnership with Amazon Web Services to build the next generation of cloud-enabled infrastructure for the world's capital markets, committing to move one of our markets to the cloud this year. The partnership with AWS will accelerate the migration of our North American market to the cloud through a phased approach.\nSpecifically, this year, we plan to move our MR options market to our next-generation trading technology. And as part of that migration, we also plan to move MRx into AWS's cloud environment within the Carteret data center. The new edge computing solution that we codesigned with AWS may also be used by other market infrastructure operators and market participants to move their trading systems to the cloud, and we look forward to engaging with our market technology clients on this future-oriented approach to managing market infrastructure. In addition, the partnership will include opportunities to explore new ways to leverage AWS' cloud capabilities across Nasdaq's anti-financial crime, data and investment analytics as well as our market infrastructure software businesses.\nNow as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, Nasdaq made notable progress against our broader strategic journey in 2021. As we continue that path, we would like to share our core ambitions and execution priorities for 2022 and beyond, which we detail on Page 10 of the presentation.\nFirst, we want to reinforce a culture of inclusive frozen prosperity within our own organization. We want to continue increasing collaboration across our entire enterprise to deliver more through our deep client relationships to further increase our value proposition as an employer and to continue to advance our sustainability practices.\nSecond, we want to advance our client-first approach to serving the financial ecosystem. We will continue to deliver our core marketplace solutions with superior client service, utmost integrity and technological excellence. We will also continue to listen to our clients' needs as we expand our offerings in index, investment analytics anti-financial crime and ESG solutions.\nThird, we are accelerating our technology modernization, our AWS partnership and how we're marching forward on the cloud is an incredible example of this. But we have additional opportunities to increasingly leverage machine and learning within our offerings as well as our agile development within more of our innovation areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these ambitions in the quarters to come.\nAs I wrap up, I will summarize by saying our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a very successful 2021 for our company. We remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategic position as a technology company that is advancing the financial system as we move forward into 2022, capitalizing on the strong momentum generated last year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\n\nAnn M. Dennison\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com.\nI will start by reviewing fourth quarter performance beginning on Slide 12 of the presentation. The 12% increase in reported net revenue of $885 million is a net result of: organic growth of 10%, including 12% organic increase in the Solutions segment and a 6% organic increase in Market Services; and the contribution from Verafin as well as the impact from divestitures, partially offset by the negative impact from changes in FX rates.\nMoving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 18%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 51% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $328 million or $1.93 per diluted share compared to $268 million or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior year period.\nTurning to Slide 13. As Adena mentioned earlier, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, totaled $1.87 billion, an increase of 19% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $640 million, an increase of 43%. Excluding the impact of Verafin, ARR increased 9% year-over-year.\nI will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 14 through 17. Starting with Market Technology, revenue increased $25 million or 24%. The increase reflects the positive $35 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin and a $3 million increase in our existing anti-financial crime technology business, partially offset by an organic revenue decline of $10 million in our market infrastructure technology business. Excluding a $4 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $39 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 30% year-over-year; and anti-financial crime technology would have been $76 million with both our existing Surveillance and Verafin's FRAML solutions continuing to exhibit strong momentum.\nOn a sequential basis and excluding the impact of the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue, Verafin revenues of $39 million in the fourth quarter compares to $36 million in the third quarter.\nAs we discussed last quarter, the revenue decline within the Market Infrastructure Technology business was impacted primarily by the successful completion of midyear of a significant long-term maintenance and support licensing contract with a customer who will continue to use our technology as well as decrease more broadly in change requests and installation revenues mostly due to capacity constraints we are working through as a result of logistical implications of the pandemic.\nThat said, as Adena discussed a few minutes ago, we see some encouraging signs, including the $142 million of order intake during the quarter. ARR for Market Technology was $428 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 51% compared to the prior year.\nThe Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period, an increase compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to a $25 million reserve related to an unexpected loss on an implementation project taken in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned $4 million purchase price adjustment related to Verafin, the operating margin would have been 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nInvestment Intelligence revenue increased $43 million or 18%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $44 million. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business as well as a meaningful contribution from analytics. ARR was $567 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 18% compared to the prior year period to $424 billion, including $74 billion from net inflows and an $83 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by $92 billion in net negative impact related to the ETP sponsor switches that we have discussed earlier in 2021.\nThe Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 64% is down 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period as we continue to make strategic investments in Index and Analytics to support sustained growth. One note looking forward to the first quarter of 2022. Trading activity of instruments licensed to our Indexes achieved certain annual thresholds midyear that resulted in an increase in licensing economics in the second half of the year.\nSimilar to what we described in the call 1 year ago, as we begin 2022, the economics of certain agreements reset for the new year. We estimate that this will lead to approximately $7 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, assuming similar trading activity and product mix in the 2 periods.\nCorporate Platforms revenues increased $23 million or 17%, reflecting organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the 23% expansion in our listed corporate issuer base, primarily due to a higher number of IPOs as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and newer ESG and reporting offerings.\nCorporate Platforms ARR was $546 million and increased 16% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 37% increased 7 percentage points compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the continued increase in the listed issuer base.\nMarket Services net revenues increased $15 million or 5%. The organic revenue increase was $17 million or 6%, and there was a $2 million negative impact from changes in tax rates. The organic increase primarily reflects higher equity derivatives and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 61% was unchanged from the prior year period.\nTurning to Page 18 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $28 million to $430 million, the increase reflects a $6 million or 1% organic increase and a $24 million increase from the net impact of the acquisition and divestitures, partially offset by a $2 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the $25 million reserve in the Market Technology segment taken in the fourth quarter of 2020, the organic expense increase totaled 8%.\nThe organic expense increase has 2 main drivers: first, higher compensation expense, reflecting our continued investment to drive growth as well as an increase in variable performance-linked compensation due to our outstanding results; and second, marketing and advertising expense driven by higher level of new listing activity. We are initiating our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.68 billion to $1.76 billion.\nThe expense guidance range at the midpoint has 3 components. First, a core increase compared to 2021 at approximately the midpoint of our medium-term expense growth objective of 3% to 6%. The majority of which is being allocated to our highest growth product areas: anti-fin crime, index, analytics and ESG. Second is a roughly 2% additional increase, reflecting certain shorter-term factors, including costs related to the heightened competition for talent in today's market, and inflationary pressures as well as some budgeted rebounding costs associated with return to office and travel and entertainment.\nThird, there is also the full year impact of the 2021 M&A activity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, which together net to a decrease of under 1%. Our expense philosophy and budget is driven by our strong growth opportunities and our willingness to invest to properly support execution against them. And as Adena went over earlier in her remarks, our positioning versus these large and growing opportunities has never been better. We expect the 2022 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%.\nTurning to Slide 19. Debt decreased by $97 million versus 3Q '21, primarily due to a net payment of $60 million of commercial paper and a $39 million decrease in eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.1x, down from 3.2x in the third quarter of 2021.\nLet me take a moment now to update you on stock repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2021, in addition to retiring 0.4 million shares of stock representing the final 20% of the $475 million accelerated share share repurchase program or ASR agreement, we entered into in July of 2021, the company also repurchased an additional $58 million in shares in 4Q '21.\nMoving to the first quarter of 2022. Thus far in January, we have repurchased $142 million in stock. And later this week, we plan to execute a second ASR for $325 million, which we expect to fully complete in the first quarter of 2022. These repurchase plans are consistent with our desire as part of our capital plan to maintain a stable share count and with our intention to materially offset the dilutive impacts of the NFI divestiture and beyond the first 12 months of that transaction closing.\nTurning to Slide 20. I want to touch on Nasdaq's unique set of opportunities in terms of our sustainability and external impact and the strong momentum we have in executing against them. In terms of what makes our ESG opportunities unique, we're committed to the highest level of sustainability in terms of how we run our businesses and serve all of our stakeholders. But we have also positioned ourselves to deliver high impact outside the organization through our anti-fin crime solutions and ESG products and services, our position as a marketplace operator to advance standards and practices and our efforts to further financial inclusion through focused charitable activities and volunteerism.\nAs we look back at 2021, we have made significant progress across all pillars of ESG. We meaningfully expanded our disclosures and commitments, including our first-ever task force on climate-related financial disclosures report; we enhanced our suppliers' sustainability program, received SEC approval on our Board diversity rule and added Puro Earth, a provider of carbon removal solutions to our growing suite of ESG product offerings.\nWe are pleased to see several third-party ESG research and ratings firms recognize our meaningful progress over the year, including Sustainalytics, ISS, CDP, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the Human Rights Equality Index and the just capital ranking of 100 companies to provide critical business -- who prioritize critical business behaviors.\nWe're also moving further in 2022. Earlier this month, Nasdaq announced its partnership with Tribe Freedom Foundation, a charity focused on fighting human trafficking and modern slavery. Nasdaq will support Tribe in the creation of a survivor financial empowerment program, a centralized portal, including content, practical tools and educational financial literacy material tailored to support survivors of human trafficking. We look forward to updating you on a regular basis as we progress our ESG initiatives going forward. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."
